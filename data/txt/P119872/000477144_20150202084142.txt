1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Major African economy with poor population. In 2009, Nigeria was the most populous
African country with an estimated population of 151 million people and the second largest economy
in Africa, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$207 million. Although GDP per capita was
estimated at US$1,340, about 54.4 percent of the population lived below the poverty line of less than
1 dollar a day.

2.       Complicated structure of national statistical system (NSS) adds layer of complexity to
its functioning. Nigeria is a three-tiered federated system comprising of the federal government at the
center, a federal capital territory administration, 36 state governments, and 774 local government areas
(LGAs). At the federal level, the NSS includes: (i) the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the apex
body mainly in charge of economic and social statistics; (ii) the National Population Commission
(NPoPC) responsible for demographic and vital statistics, including population censuses; and (iii)
federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) which have statistical units with limited
capacity for respective administrative data production and dissemination. The federal structure is
replicated at the state level. In addition, each state has a State Statistical Agency (SSA) or State Bureau
of Statistics (SBS), which generates statewide and state-specific statistics. Other NSS stakeholders are
the Central Bank of Nigeria, the National Consultative Committee on Statistics (NCCS), the Statistics
Board, and research and academic institutions. The legal mandate for official statistics is complicated,
with several different laws in effect. Moreover, the Constitution gives significant powers,
responsibilities, and autonomy to the sub-national levels of government, particularly the state
governments. By its provisions government at each level has the authority to produce its own statistics.
All of the above highlights a strong need for effective coordination in a weak statistical system that
competes for limited resources.

3.       At project appraisal, the country’s vision for development was outlined in the National
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS II), Vision 20:2020 and the Seven
Point Agenda (7-PA). These strategic policy documents provided the framework for reforms,
principally targeted at improving governance and building a competitive economy, especially in the
non-petroleum sector. One key objective of the 7-PA was the promotion of accountability and
transparency in public service, implying the need for the production and availability of reliable and
timely data. Moreover, it was clear that the implementation and tracking of these government policy
initiatives would require comprehensive, quality, and trustworthy statistics.

4.        The National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS), prepared through an
interactive and consultative process, was approved by the Federal Executive Council in March 2010.
It embraced strengthening statistics production at both national and sub-national levels, with four
strategic objectives: (i) statistical communication with a focus on state levels to generate demand for
statistics; (ii) organizational and institutional development of the NSS through reforming the legal
framework (especially at the state level), and institutional restructuring of the MDAs; (iii) developing
a statistical framework and information technology (IT); and (iv) data development and management
through using sound and internationally accepted statistical techniques for data production and
management across the entire NSS. The NSDS also estimated the costs of implementing the Strategy,
and explained how these costs would be financed. The Government’s commitment to fund statistics
was reflected in its pledge to fund 65 percent of the total cost of the NSDS (US$471 million) – a
reversal of the budgetary cutbacks made in previous years. However, no money has ever been released
to support the NSDS. Also no monitoring and evaluation system was set up to regularly assess NSDS
implementation.

                                                    [1] 
 
5.      The rationale for Bank support was to consolidate and build upon the progress made in
the area of statistical capacity, for which the Bank has a comparative advantage. The Bank’s
mandate to lead the statistical capacity initiative, particularly in International Development
Association (IDA) countries, was reinforced in the IDA15 Results Measurement System. It
specifically stated that Country Assistance or Partnership Strategies (CAS or CPS) were expected to
include a review of the national statistical system and indicate what is needed to strengthen the
capacity to both generate and use statistical data. The Bank has been a key player on statistical
development in Nigeria prior to project approval through a variety of technical assistance initiatives
to enhance the capacity of the NBS, as well as to support the preparation of the NSDS.

6.       There has also been increasing IDA support at state level, including the Economic Reform
and Governance Project and its support to the NBS at the time of appraisal2. To strengthen these
efforts, the Bank agreed to support the NSDS implementation, both financially and technically,
starting with a pilot operation to be financed by the Statistics for Results (SRF)3 grant, followed by a
larger IDA credit. The rationale for supporting states in addition to the federal government is found in
the federated structure of the Nigeria statistical system and in the increasing WB support to states
(improved statistics will put the WB support on more informed footing). The rationale for the
implementation arrangement is explained by the political economy which did not suggest that the
government wants to embark on restructuring its statistical system.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
7.        As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and Grant Agreement, the PDO of the
SRF grant was to initiate the implementation of the NSDS by producing reliable statistics in
participating states: Anambra, Bauchi, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo. Based on consultation with the
project team, the ICR team assumes that “reliability” of statistics is not used as a term strictly related
to data quality, as defined by the IMF DQAF, but rather as a broader and more general term for better
statistics.

8.      The progress towards the PDO was to be measured through the Results Framework
outlined in the PAD. It encompassed the key indicators outlined below:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    Reasons/Justification

9.      The PDO and key indicators were not revised. However, during project implementation,
several indicators were slightly re-worded to reflect more accurately the project activities and
measurement methods.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The primary beneficiaries as identified in the PAD were: the NBS, the NPoPC, the SSAs/SBSs
and core MDAs in the six participating states. The Government of Nigeria, the general public and the
Development Partners were also expected to benefit from the project.

1.5 Original Components

11.       The PDO was to be achieved through the implementation of three project components
with total allocation of SRF financing of US$10 million. The project was seen as critical to launch
the implementation of the NSDS program in six pilot states and to focus on building capacity of the
statistics related institutions for implementation of the wider NSDS program. The components’
description is provided according to the PAD. However, the components’ description in the Grant
Agreement is more concise.

12.      Component 1. Organizational, Institutional and Human Resource Development
(US$2.40 million) aimed to support technical assistance for the design and pilot test of a
comprehensive program of organizational restructuring in 6 states, including the modernization of
their statistical activities to create a more efficient decentralized structure with well-trained staff.
The three sub-components were as follows:
    a) Organizational and institutional development at NBS to finance technical assistance to
         conduct studies and assessments, to pilot the framework for organizational and institutional
         development of the NSS, and to prepare guidelines for overall coordination to harmonize
         and eliminate duplication of responsibilities. Other activities included hands-on training
         for statisticians at the MDAs and states, and other training and human capacity building,
         based on a comprehensive Training Needs Assessment;
    b) Human resource development and management at NBS to (i) finance technical
         assistance for the development of a human resource management strategy at NBS and to
         initiate i t s implementation in six states; (ii) establish job profiles by function and
         corresponding salary scales and standard career paths for each profile; and (iii) define and
         set up a system of internal promotion and merit based remuneration; and

                                                         [3] 
 
    c) Human resource development and management at NPoPC to further strengthen human
       capacity at NPoPC through training for staff from all states in the following areas: (i) data
       entry packages: CSPRO, and SPSS; (ii) demographic techniques and analysis; (iii) research
       methodology, population dynamics, gender issues, reproductive health and population
       coordination; and (iv) capacity building in writing codes for scanner technology, Oracle
       spatial database management systems. It was also to finance training on complex survey
       data analysis, and the purchase of two vehicles and motorcycles for field supervision.

13.       Component 2. Statistical Framework and Information Technology (US$6.60 million)
was designed to finance technical assistance and acquisition of equipment for the development
of statistical and data infrastructure and information technology for the NSS. This included computer
facilities for survey processing; statistical application software; and Management Information
Systems for the state statistical agencies. The five sub-components were as follows:
    a) Technical assistance for the roll-out of statistical template at SSAs f o r t h e 6 pilot states,
          including investment in Statistical Framework and equipment;
    b) Information technology at NBS to finance investment in IT equipment (hardware and
          software), staff training to improve communications and internet connections between the
          NBS and the 6 pilot states, and enhancement of the Geographical Information System (GIS;
    c) Pilot phase of electronic Birth and Deaths Registration Centers at NPoPC to develop the
          Statistical Framework for direct electronic data capture in all existing birth and death
          registration centers of participating states. The investment included equipping the centers
          with necessary furniture and IT equipment. Information sharing with UNICEF on their
          experience in managing the issues of low public awareness and low capacity for data
          collection, analysis and dissemination was envisaged;
    d) Data development, m anagement and dissemination at NBS to ensure that the state agencies
          would be able to generate, manage and disseminate diversified products and services and
          respond to the needs of the planning, monitoring and evaluation of national development
          programs and its other stakeholders. This included an agreed release schedule on
          administrative data between the States and NBS through Memorandum of Understandings
          (MOUs); a dissemination strategy covering the federal, state and local government levels;
          technical assistance for the adoption of the direct electronic data capture at NBS; and the
          development of a unified and consistent definition of concepts and methods used for the
          collection and compilation of data; and
    e) Data development, m anagement and dissemination at NPoPC to finance technical
          assistance for the adoption of the direct electronic data capture at NPoPC and to enhance the
          effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at the birth and death
          registration centers.

14.     Component 3. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Statistical
Communication (M&E) (US$1.00 million) focused on coordination, monitoring and evaluation
of the project. The sub-components were as follows:
    a) Project, management, monitoring and evaluation at NBS and NPoPC to finance operating
        costs, technical support, logistical support and equipment needed to coordinate the overall
        project and implement the NBS components. Reporting on implementation progress to
        national institutions responsible for statistics was also envisaged; and
    b) Statistical communication at NBS to finance technical assistance and investment in
        statistical communication with the key stakeholders (Parliament, Government, Non-
        Governmental organizations (NGOs) the Nigeria Statistical Association, Civil Society
        Organizations and international organizations), as well as training the media to create
        statistical awareness and promote the use of statistics in policy making and in the media.
        This sub-component would also ensure technical coordination with statistical

        communication programs in the pilot states and coordination between government and
        donor community.

1.6 Revised Components
15.     There were no revisions of components during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.      No significant changes took place in terms of scope, implementation arrangements, schedule,
and initial funding allocations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

17.      The project emerged from longer-term engagement between the Bank and the Nigeria
Government, which focused on enhancing the operations of the NSS. Prior to the Statistics for Results
Facility Catalytic Fund (SRF-CF) project, the Bank had channeled Technical Assistance to the NBS
through supporting the preparation of the NSDS financed from the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity
Building (TFSCB). This engagement provided a well-developed basis for initial reforms, but existing
gains needed strengthening. The rationale for supporting states in addition to the federal government
is found in the federated structure of the Nigeria statistical system and in the increasing World Bank
support to states (improved statistics will put the World Bank support on more informed footing). The
rationale for the implementation arrangement is explained by the political economy which did not
suggest that the government wants to embark on restructuring its statistical system.

18.    The PDO that emerged from this process was, overall, clear, relevant to country
circumstances and NSS needs, and consistent with SRF objectives. Being moderately ambitious,
the PDO appeared to be reachable within a relatively short period of three years.

19.     The project was designed in the context of a pilot phase of the SRF-CF, which financed
the grant. The main objectives of the SRF-CF are to support a sector-wide approach to statistics as
defined in a country’s NSDS and to promote and improve donor collaboration around the
implementation plans of the NSDS. In this regard, the project was generally well designed and aligned
with the key pillars of Nigeria NSDS. Given the complexity of Nigeria’s statistical system, the project
aimed at initiating the strengthening the national statistical system through a pilot approach, whose
experience and lessons would feed into a larger follow-up operation. With regard to donor
collaboration, a National Partnership Group (NPG), chaired by the World Bank (WB) and composed
of the key development partners, was revived during project preparation. The SRF-CF also financed
an in-country donor statistician, who was recruited just at the very beginning of project
implementation. Development Partners were invited and a few attended all supervision missions and
made comments on the Aide memoires before they were finalized. During the last supervision mission,
the NPG was preparing a plan to synchronize their activities and improve donor coordination, which
was a big achievement to foster donor collaboration.

20.     The project preparation team learned lessons from similar operations and experience
gained in Nigeria and other countries, specifically that:
    a) Statistical capacity building requires integrated and coordinated support: the project based
        its interventions on the NSDS rather than on fragmented and uncoordinated programs;
    b) Improved implementation of statistical projects need to ensure ownership of key stakeholders:
        the project supported the implementation of the NSDS, which was prepared through an
                                                  [5] 
 
           interactive and consultative process with government, NGOs, the private sector and
           development partners and donor coordination was promoted through the National Partnership
           Group;
        c) Improved quality and wide dissemination of data has a positive impact on the use of data: the
           project supported improvements in data quality, such as improving inter-institutional
           coordination to produce data, promoting the adoption of standardized concepts, definitions
           and classifications, and developing skills for data analysis. It also included the development
           of a dissemination strategy at all levels and a release calendar for administrative data between
           the state statistical agencies and the NBS;
        d) Focus on institutional reform, not only data collection activities, has greater impact on the
           statistical system: the project supported a review of the legal framework at the state level and
           capacity building of statistical staff in technical and management skills to ensure greater
           sustainability.

21.      In order to achieve the objectives, the following implementation and governance
arrangements were proposed. Institutional arrangements were designed to integrate project
implementation in the regular operations of the two key project beneficiaries, the NBS and the NPoPC,
each with a Project Implementation Task Team (PITT), comprised of staff from the respective
agencies. A Technical Committee, headed by the Director of International Economic Relations
Department in the Federal Ministry of Finance, was given the oversight for project implementation
and its outcome. Each PITT was to include a financial management (FM) specialist and procurement
officer – the NBS from its own staff and the NPoPC to appoint an external one. Dedicated staff from
the Federal Project Financial Management Division (FPFMD) was to be responsible for ensuring
compliance with the financial management requirements of the Bank and the Government.

22.      The main risks were appropriately identified. The overall risk rating at project design was
Moderate-Low – high likelihood, low impact. The main risks identified related to the capacity and
governance of the two implementing agencies, including low capacity to manage World Bank
procurement and contracts, and that of the SSAs in participating states. The main risks identified and
their mitigating measures are presented in the Table 2.

                               Table 2: Main Risks and Mitigations Measures

    1    Weak capacity for        This is mitigated by the following: (i) strong oversight by a high-level and
         program management       experienced staff, supported by the Statistics Board and improved management
         in NBS and NPoPC         of NBS; (ii) addition of key personnel to enhance the technical and program
                                  management capacity specific to the program within NBS and NPoPC; (iii)
                                  improved management reporting and monitoring system; and (iv) the improved
                                  center-state dialogue through National Consultative Committee on Statistics
                                  (NCCS) and other institutional setup.
    2    Poor performance in      Requirements of high-level commitment to the program objectives and
         States with weak         specific steps for each participating state; and flexibility in design to adjust the

                                  minimum standards and criteria.
    3    Weak coordination        This risk of coordination failure is mitigated by the strong work program of the
         and learning             NBS, regular exchange of experience and expertise through NCCS meetings at
         outcomes                 the national level, and the State Consultative Committee on Statistics at the state
                                  level, promotion of dialogue with all participants of statistical activities as part of
                                  the user-producer forum.

    4   Failure of State-level     This is mitigated by formalizing the State commitment through the signing of a
        SSAs to implement the      detailed MOU, preparation of State specific organizational priorities and giving
        program due to             adequate weight to SSAs in the State strategic statistical plans; setting up high-
        limited capacity           level Steering groups chaired by the Statistician General; and supervision by
                                   NBS.

23.     The Results Framework was generally adequate for monitoring progress. Several
indicators reflected progress in data quality directly: (i) the establishment of the release calendar and
the proportion of publications publically available according to release calendar to monitor data
timeliness; (ii) number of incidence of statistics quoted in the media, and State information available
on the NBS website to reflect data accessibility (also derived from the results of the user satisfaction
surveys); and (iii) the inclusion of five basic economic statistics in annual state statistical yearbook to
address data relevance. Longer-term results in other dimensions of data quality could be expected
through the vast training program provided under the project. Specific subject training and
introduction of international standards will eventually lead to increase in data accuracy and coherence.
The training courses provided to NBS and state statistical agencies in agricultural, social and
environmental statistics included the metadata production module that would ultimately lead to
improved interpretability of data generated. NBS also organized training for media with a focus on
the interpretation of data, and a statistics user-producer seminar. Project addressed different
dimensions of data quality through initiating the statistical capacity building both at federal and state
levels.

24.      Prioritization of indicators to reflect the project achievements. There is always a challenge
in defining the right number of indicators to monitor the project progress and choosing those that
reflect the achievement of the PDO. For example, the large training programs for staff at state level
together with the high-impact activities in institutional strengthening of NBS, NPoPC and SSAs/
added a significant value to initiation of the NSDS implementation in states.

25.     The project team did not perform the Quality Enhancement Review (QER). Though
strongly recommended, QERs are not mandatory. However, a QER would have possibly aided the
team in identifying the challenges and fertilize the project design from the start.

26.        Potentially significant time lag beyond the project’s control from concept review to
                                                         [7] 
 
approval. It took a year and a half from concept review to approval. Though it is considered to be
overall within the average for the region and for a country like Nigeria, the ICR team was informed
of particular circumstances (death of the President, the need for electing a new administration,
including changes in the Ministry of Finance, and as a result, all approval being put on hold at the
time) that slowed down the project preparation. All the above circumstances were out of the control
of the Bank team.

2.2 Implementation

27.      The project did not undergo any restructuring or major change. The mid-term review
was not formally conducted, but combined with the third supervision mission in May 2013. No
specific mid-term review report was prepared.

28.      The institutional arrangements of having two implementing agencies with different
capabilities and experience and a little dialogue were not ideal and led to implementation delays and
difficulties in reporting. The rationale for the implementation arrangement is explained by the political
economy which did not suggest that the government wanted to embark on restructuring its statistical
system. Nevertheless, these internal challenges were mostly addressed by the project during its
implementation.

29.     An additional challenge was originated by the SSAs/SBSs not being state branches of the
NBS, but possessing an independent status. The rationale for supporting states in addition to the
federal government is found in the federated structure of the Nigeria statistical system and in the
increasing WB support to states (improved statistics will put the WB support on more informed
footing). In order to produce better statistics, the states were requested to identify their needs in terms
of institutional strengthening; training needs; dissemination; and improvement in working
environment. Based on these needs, the PITTs put together a uniform set of activities for the federal
and state levels. The NBS offices at state level were not engaged to play any role in the project.

30.     The in-country donor statistician facilitated stronger coordination by traveling to the
participating states between supervision missions to improve the SSAs/SBSs performance. Some
noticeable progress was recorded in the case of Niger, Ondo and Anambra throughout the project. The
in-country statistician provided the necessary support, and failure to mention the placing of an in-
country statistician as a part of intensive supervision in a risk mitigation section of the PAD did not
have any material impact on the project. His interventions and day-to-day assistance to the SSAs and
NBSs contributed to reduce the second, third and fourth risks.

31.      Technical Committee provided overall project oversight. It was responsible for oversight
of implementation of the project and its outcome, and responsibility for its monitoring and evaluation,
as described in the Grant Agreement – Schedule 2, Section I.A, was established on March 29, 2012.
This was almost one year after the project became effective. The Technical Committee did not prove
to be either efficient in providing oversight of project implementation or proactive in resolving the
issues that emerged. The government also did not make provision for any resources to the committee
for either operating costs or field visits, making it difficult to carry out any supervisory function.

32.      The first year of project implementation faced a number of delays due to external
factors, such as labor strikes and civil unrest, caused by a fuel crisis and subsidy removal. The security
situation in the country contributed to slower progress too. Slow disbursement continued in the second
year of project implementation, pointing to issues of delegation of signature at the FPFMD. At the
same time, due to active interventions of the Bank team and continuous efforts of the NBS and NPoPC,
the project completed most of its activities by its closing date. There is evidence that project processes
                                                    [8] 
 
(procurement, financial management, project management and M&E) have improved to a large extent
at both NBS and NPoPC.

33.       Being a problem project at some points. In June 2012, a new top management was
appointed at NPoPC. It took time for them to become familiar with the project. This resulted in
approval and implementation delays for some activities planned for this period and, eventually, in the
lower than satisfactory IP rating. The Bank team discussed with top NPoPC authorities on the ways
to speed up implementation of the project. Disbursement showed some signs of picking up. The project
faced another delay in April 2013, when a new project coordinator was appointed at NPoPC.
Unexpectedly the coordinator transferred the already fully trained PITT project manager to another
state without consultation with the Bank. Given that the project only had less than a year to close, the
Bank team advised against the move as this meant additional time and resources to bring the
newcomer’s knowledge and skills to an acceptable level. A negative response from NPoPC prompted
the Bank team to suspend disbursement to NPoPC, from May to September 2013. During this period
little progress was seen at NPoPC, but by the end of the project (February 2014) with strong support
from the Bank’s procurement team, the NPoPC made up for the delays and implemented almost all
project activities with insignificant cancellation of funds.

Project Disbursement

34.     The project disbursement rate at closure was 98 percent. The NBS disbursed 100 percent
of its allocated funds. The undisbursed amount under the NPoPC execution amounted to
US$226,997.47 and was cancelled in due course. The PITTs indicated that the funds flow arrangement
between the NBS and NPoPC where NBS received funds from the WB and disbursed to NPoPC and
also NBS being responsible for managing the withdrawal application on behalf of the NPoPC was not
optimal, as it deprived the NPoPC from building its capacity to manage the WB funds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design (based on PAD)

35.      The Project Results Framework and Monitoring includes a number of key indicators
critical to monitor the progress towards the PDO and project performance. The set of indicators
for the most part are broadly relevant and adequate to identify the monitor progress in achieving the
PDO. There was also a sense to consider carefully the number of indicators, given the weak capacity
of the implementation agencies. Recognizing that result frameworks can always benefit from further
improvements, a few potential areas for improvement can be highlighted:
     a) Questionable coherence within indicators, e.g., PDO Indicator One refers to number of
         publications available according to the release calendar and yet release calendar (Intermediate
         Result Indicator Two for Component 2) is not scheduled to be deployed until second year of
         project;
     b) It was not possible to establish the baseline for eight indicators prior to the start of the project
         due to innovative nature of its activities. Prior to project launch the baseline was available for
         four indicators out of 16 indicators; it is recommended to ensure that there are baselines in the
         upcoming project;
     c) Target values or text description are not defined for four intermediate result indicators;
     d) Number of targets were not specific enough to interpret and measure progress (such as
         Intermediate Indicator One for Component 1 - “Number of staff with competencies in core
         areas: official statistics, demography, data analysis, sampling design and methodology
         increased”); and
     e) A breakdown by states where possible.

M&E implementation and utilization

36.     Tracking progress towards the desired outputs and outcomes was planned to be based
on monitoring and evaluation activities including the preparation of Interim Financial Reports
(IFRs); audit reports; regular project progress reports, including annual reports to Technical
Committee; Aide Memoires from supervision missions and working visits to states; and their
submission to the respective committees and governing authorities, and the Bank.

37.       Performance of the M&E system. Due to insufficient capacity and lack of M&E skills to
monitor the outcomes defined in PAD or ensure regular reporting of project progress both on federal
and state level, M&E implementation remained a challenge. Developing of any M&E system
proposals for the NBS, NPoPC, SSAs/SBSs or other statistical institutions to monitor and evaluate
their annual plans or other work programs would have helped to start introducing the M&E culture in
statistical performance. However, some progress has been made due to the in-country donor
statistician facilitated monitoring through his visits to the participating states to improve performance
of the SSA/SBSs.

38.      The targets set out in the Results Framework were largely met and two - overachieved.
The majority of the results indicators was met. PDO Indicator One (Achieved almost in full) –
proportion of publications 9including press releases) publically available according to release calendar
by NBS/NPoPC; PDO Indicator Two (partially achieved) – number of thematic areas with
internationally accepted standards in use – 5 out of 7 planned; (ii) PDO Indicator Three – user
satisfaction surveys – which is almost fully achieved as two surveys were conducted at federal level
and in six states, the initial results were discussed, and a comparative analysis is being finalized by
NBS. However, Intermediate Indicator Two for Component 3 - annual progress reports presented to
Technical Committee and uploaded to NBS website – is considered not to be achieved as the reports
were neither placed on the web nor shared with the Bank team. Intermediate Indicator Seven –
Mapping of State Demographic, economic and Social Statistics- is overachieved, and Intermediate
indicator 8 – 6 states information available on NBS and NPoPC website – is overachieved.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.     There were no safeguard policy issues with this project - it was rated as a category C. The
project focused on institutional reforms and capacity building, and did not include civil works and
thus had no environmental impact.

40.      Fiduciary compliance. Weak capacity in procurement and financial management was
identified during project preparation. This was particularly true for the NPoPC, which had never
implemented a Bank project. To mitigate these risks, a training program was developed to address the
existing capacity gaps identified in the procurement and financial assessments. Procurement
performance varied, but overall improved during project implementation. No mis-procurement was
noted on the part of both agencies. Financial management was also largely satisfactory. Despite some
initial delays, financial reporting is viewed as largely timely and adequate. Agreed internal and
external audits were conducted and reports were shared with the Bank. Both NBS and NPoPC did
relatively well in training staff and maintaining their financial management systems, despite initial
difficulties in attracting a qualified procurement specialist for the PITT at the NPoPC. At project onset,
the NPoPC payment vouchers prepared and sent to the FPFMD were not approved in a timely manner.
The impasse, however, was eventually resolved.

41.     All legal covenants were respected as agreed in Grant Agreement.

                                                  [10] 
 
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.      Certain transitional steps have been taken to maintain the project benefits. The
governments in several states have ensured that recurrent costs, maintenance costs for the equipment
and motor vehicles acquired under the project are sufficiently provided for in state budgets. The NBS
website continues to improve. As to the NPoPC, the demographic laboratory, birth/death registration
centers in states, and mini-GIS centers continue to be operational.

43.     As for next steps, the NBS identified some areas for consolidating and building on
project achievements and has begun a dialogue with the Bank regarding a follow-up operation.
The World Bank is preparing a new lending operation for building an effective and modern statistical
system in the country. The NBS provided the Bank team with a list of its needs and areas for
preferential development during a Bank identification mission in Abuja in September 2014.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives Sub-Rating: Substantial

44.     Overall, in broader terms the PDO remains relevant and consistent with Nigeria’s
current development priorities, the NSDS implementation action plan, and the Bank’s country
and sector assistance – Country Partnership Strategy4. The mid-term goal will be to strengthen
Nigeria's participation in the General Data Dissemination System, while moving towards more
exacting standards, such as the Special Data Dissemination Standard within ten years.

Relevance of Project Design and Implementation: Substantial

45.     The project design was largely consistent with the PDO and targeted several critical
areas for achieving the objectives. The selection of sub-activities was notably relevant insofar as it
drew from the NSDS diagnostic and the 2012-2014 Corporate Strategic Implementation Plan, and
followed up on a long-term engagement of technical support provided by the Bank, as outlined in
Section 2. “Key factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes”.

46.     The actual implementation of the project was largely relevant to the achievement of the
PDO. Project implementation was largely consistent with the PDO, despite initial challenges
encountered in the first 18 months of the project, which were subsequently resolved, to a large extent
thanks to the presence of an in-country statistician.

Overall Relevance Rating: Substantial

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Attribution and Results Measurement

47.            To assess the extent to which the Nigeria SRF-CF project achieved the PDO level results,
the causal relationship between project inputs, outputs and outcomes were reviewed, as outlined
in Table 3. While it is difficult to attribute results with full certainty, especially in institution
strengthening and capacity building projects, it was found that there were no other major initiatives or

donor funded activities that could have generated the results assessed here. At the same time, UNICEF
collaborated with the Bank to provide NPoPC with fully equipped and functioning Data Capture
Centers (see Donor participation Annex 10A). Thus, the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
team considers only those results that can be reasonably attributed to project activities.

48.     The project has largely achieved its development objective of initiating the
implementation of the NSDS in six participating states. Annex 3 and Annex 4 present key project
outputs by sub-components. Project achievements can be summarized as follows:
    a) The methodological skills of the NBS, NPoPC, MDAs, SSAs/SBS staff were upgraded
        through basic and on-the-job training, particularly in survey data management, demographic
        techniques, compilation of sector statistics (price indices, agriculture and environment), and
        information technology. Over 1,100 staff members in the NBS, NPoPC, line ministries and
        states completed their training;
    b) Internationally-accepted standards and methodologies are now being used in data production
        in the following thematic areas: GDP, Poverty Statistics, CPI and Water and Sanitation
        Statistics; in addition NPoPC stated that all concepts and methodology in census, migration
        and vital statistics data collection are based on international standards;
    c) A new regulatory HR policy institutional framework (Code of conduct) for the entire national
        statistical system, including the state level, is currently in place and operational with NBS and
        NPoPC;
    d) Significant strengthening of NPoPC branches in all six states had high demonstration effect
        for neighboring states; significant improvement in sampling frames in participating states by
        use of satellite imaging and GIS maps to demarcate enumeration areas;
    e) Five basic economic statistics are included into state statistical yearbooks;
    f) Statistical infrastructure and information technology were further developed based on piloting
        the electronic birth and death registration centers with eight mobile centers operational in all
        six participating states, and updating/revising the Compendium of statistical terms; and
    g) Data development and dissemination were improved through availability of the NBS release
        calendar, publications of backlog of state statistical products (yearbooks and sector statistics
        reports), modernizing the websites, and introducing the user satisfaction survey).

49.       Achievements in institutional development paved the road for further successful NSDS
implementation. The project demonstrated important progress in strengthening the legal framework
(adoption of Statistical Edicts) at state level, and supporting the strategic approach to development of
statistics by preparation of the state Statistical Master Plans in Bauchi, Edo and Kaduna states.

50.       The SRF project has raised awareness and interest in statistics through a number of
important measures including the following: (i) the publication of a release calendar on the NBS
website; (ii) the dissemination of backlog publications; and (iii) the revamping of the NBS website,
including a powerful data portal with data mapping features. As a result of these measures, official
statistics are now being mentioned in the media at an increasing rate; notably a number of editorials
in the largest national newspapers covered poverty data, GDP, unemployment and inflation.

51.      The user satisfaction survey was conducted for the first time at the federal level and in the
6 pilot states during the period of July to October 2011. The results of the survey, collected through a
workshop format, thus ensuring wider outreach and a greater response rate, have been analyzed and
are available. NBS is finalizing a comparative analysis of the results of the initial User Satisfaction
Survey with the second survey, conducted in early 2014, however, the final analysis was is yet to be
shared. In the absence of these comparative analysis, there is no direct confirmation of the increased
user satisfaction and broader access to statistical data achieved over the life of the project. Though it
                                                  [13] 
 
is highly probably that is the case. Users of statistics collaborated to state their needs, which were
revised in December 2012, to convey to the federal level agencies for information and increased
support.

52.      It was important to upgrade the basic working environment in the SBSs and SSAs of the
participating states. In the six pilot states, the project significantly improved working conditions for
staff through the availability of PCs connected to the federal network, generators to prevent frequent
blackouts, better-furnished and air-conditioned spaces, and in Anambra, water supply, and increased
fleet of motorcycles and double cabin pick-up trucks to collect data.

53.      Donor interest in statistical development revived. The National Partnership Group met on
a regular basis and contributed to raising awareness on the importance of support to statistics among
different development partners. This has encouraged other partners to support statistical development
and to align their development assistance programs with the NSDS. The NPG is interested in working
in a more collaborative way on the proposed IDA project, under the leadership of the Bank. The
presence of the in-country donor statistician, at the WB office, was a key positive factor during project
implementation, in strengthening partner coordination, and acting as a liaison between the government
and the Bank.

54.      The project faced a highly unfavorable and challenging environment, including: (i) a
complex national statistical system with high autonomy of SSAs/SBSs; (ii) weak coordination at
federal and subnational levels; (iii) low capacity of statistical offices due to severe shortages of
qualified human and financial resources; (iv) weak demand for data in the government and society;
(v) mandate for key statistics functions divided between two federal agencies and limited coordination
between the federal and state statistics offices”; and (vi) low capacity at the implementing agencies to
implement World Bank projects. Despite these conditions the project not only largely met its targets,
but also completed several innovations in the area of statistics, such as the introduction of a user
satisfaction survey; development of Code of conduct, a policy to support development of human
resources in the NSS; preparation of annual training plan; and promotion of sub-national statistics.
There are also achievements not captured by the Results Framework: (i) the project significantly
strengthened the dialogue among data producers, namely the NBS, and other data producing agencies,
including NPoPC and SBSs/SSAs, and improved the dialogue with data users; (ii) the revived NPG
contributed to raising awareness of statistical development among development partners; (iii) five
participating states (Anambra, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo) passed the Statistical Edict: (iv) the
legal status and organizational structure of the state statistical agencies in these states were upgraded
to the SBSs; (v) the NBS and NPoPC now have a more efficient management team trained in financial
and administrative management and leadership, which will become useful in the implementation of a
larger project.

Achievements of Objectives Rating: Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency Rating: Substantial

55.      As stated in the PAD, the project is not amenable to a cost-benefit or economic rate of
return analysis as national statistical offices have hardly any significant cost-recovery, apart from a
small amount of revenue generated from data publications. The financial returns from this project will
not be representative of the economic returns. Therefore, it is challenging, if not impossible, to carry
out such an analysis and clearly identify the economic impact of a well-functioning statistical system
in the country.
                                                  [14] 
 
56.     Precise quantitative rates of return cannot be determined for this type of project. The
ICR team judges overall efficiency to be substantial. Both the NBS and NPoPC largely achieved
the project targets through efficient use of resources and investments. Almost all planned activities
were completed within the initial three years of project life. Though there was a delay in project
implementation on the NPoPC side (paragraph 31), due to joint efforts the project catch up and spent
its almost all allocated resources with insignificant amount (roughly USD 227,000) cancelled. There
was no extension of initial project closing date.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

57.      The project has helped to initiate the implementation of the NSDS in participating states.
The project was a relevant and timely intervention. Despite moderate shortcomings during initial
implementation stages, it triggered the long-term institutional reform process, increased data
production, and sped up several data collection processes on the ground. It largely overcame the issues
related to financial management and procurement. Training of statisticians and adoption of new
standards and methods can potentially lead to improvement in data coherence, coverage and accuracy
at state level. In terms of PDO relevance (Substantial), achievements of the PDO (Substantial),
efficiency (Substantial) the project performed at a level consistent with a satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.      The project did not specifically target these social objectives (it rather focused on
economic statistics), but had an overall positive impact on them by improving the capacity of the
national and state level statisticians to produce relevant, timely data, based on sound methodologies
in line with international standards, particularly demographic statistics, poverty and health statistics.
The vital registration centers at state level have improved the possibility of collecting and processing
more accurate sex-disaggregated data. The grant did not have any direct impact on poverty reduction
either. However, by improving statistics and building institutional capacity in NBS, NPoPC and six
pilot state statistical offices, it initiated reforms that will improve monitoring of poverty and social
data. The standardization of state statistics supported by the project aimed at the coordination and
harmonization of key statistical activities that are used to monitor and evaluate the implementation of
the Government’s poverty programs. These key poverty-related statistical activities produced by the
project beneficiaries include social statistics, morbidity and fertility statistics, as well as price statistics.
All of them are critical elements of policymaking and could contribute to more efficient and targeted
social assistance thus alleviating poverty in the country.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.      The project focused rather heavily on institutional change and strengthening of the
statistical service in the participating states – all relevant points have been considered above. The
project was critical in introducing a comprehensive and strategic approach to statistical development
by funding the preparation of state level Statistical Master Plans, passing State Statistical Edicts,
upgrading the SSAs into SBSs and strengthening professional expertise.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)


                                                      [15] 
 
60.     No negative unintended outcomes were observed.

61.      A positive unintended outcome is that a larger number of statisticians received the
training provided under the project. Statisticians from all states participated in two training courses
conducted by NPoPC upgrading their knowledge and practical skills. It is reasonable to assume that
some of the training benefited the whole NSS. Mini-GIS centers established under the project in six
pilot states are now providing service to neighboring states that are lacking appropriate equipment and
skilled personnel. The six states have shown a dramatic improvement in the sampling frames as a
result of the mini-GIS centers. Satellite maps of enumeration areas have been used to update sampling
frames. If this is replicated in the other states, there will be great improvement in the overall sampling
frame and thus improvement in the sampling and data collection.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

62.      There was no formal stakeholders’ workshop conducted at project closure. During its visit to
Abuja and three states (Anambra, Edo and Ondo) the ICR mission met the direct beneficiaries of the
project at NBS, NPoPC, its offices in the states, and each state statistical office. The ICR consultant
visited the northern participating states Niger, Bauchi and Kaduna meeting the same range of project
beneficiaries there. There was no meeting with academia, NGO or general public representatives. The
overall project implementation and results assessment provided was positive. Findings are reflected
in two Government’s ICRs in Annex 9 and Lessons Learned Table 4.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

63.      There are various reasons to be relatively optimistic about the prospects of maintaining
the project’s development outcomes, especially in the short term. Some of the project’s
achievements have already been institutionalized both at federal and state levels. The NBS and NPoPC
have shown strong commitment. The objectives remain relevant. There are some post–operational
steps that have already been taken (see Section “2.5 Post-completion Operation / Next Phase”). The
follow-up Bank operation is under preparation. The donor community in the country is better
coordinated with the revival of the National Partnership Group -- the Nigeria Development Partners’
Statistics, Monitoring and Evaluation.

64.      However, based on available information, the following risks were identified that could
potentially limit the prospects for the gains to be expanded over the medium term. Although the
government has expressed a strong interest in developing its national statistical system, it needs to
recognize that donor support to statistics cannot be seen as a substitution for federal government
financing. Allocation of funds for statistics by state governments is also considered to be crucial. (For
additional information on Government funds allocated for statistics see Annex 11, Table III.2: “Budget
allocations for Statistics 2011-13, in billions of Naira”). Leadership and coordination capacity of the
apex statistical organization – the NBS – should be constantly strengthened because of the complex
institutional set-up of Nigeria’s NSS. There is also a risk that SBSs will not be able to retain the already
trained staff.

65.    Taken as whole, the risk is judged to be moderate with a potential to expand in the
absence of longer-term corrective actions.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
                                                   [16] 
 
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.      Though a QER was not conducted by the Bank, overall the project team had an appropriate
skill mix and substantive country experience. Technical aspects of the project were well covered, and
a solid rapport was established with the counterparts / government / NSB / NPoPC. Attention was
given to involve partners and stakeholders in the preparation of the project. The project activities were
fully in line with overall country needs and development objectives. A vital decision to arrange for an
in-county statistician was made and executed. Risks were identified and mitigation measures
incorporated. For example, the procurement capacity assessment of the client’s readiness for
implementation suggested a “High” risk rating. Consequently, the NPoPC was required to recruit an
experienced procurement specialist as a condition for project effectiveness. In addition, the Bank team
ensured that just before implementation, all necessary tools and knowledge for efficient procurement
management were put in place by providing thorough training for the NBS and specifically for the
NPoPC staff.

67.      However, there were moderate initial shortcomings that were subsequently resolved,
associated with the M&E framework and mechanisms for project coordination. In particular,
measurable baselines and targets together with measurement technics could had been defined in a
clearer and more consistent way from the outset. Moreover, it could be argued that the oversight
Technical Committee with a clear description of its functions should have been in place before project
effectiveness, and that state statistical offices should have been more actively engaged during project
design. As mentioned, these issues were mostly resolved after the initial implementation period, and
to a large extent thanks to the active contributions of the in-country donor statistician (see below). In
this context, quality at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

68.      The responsible FM specialist, the Procurement Specialist resided in the Bank country office.
The in-country donor statistician, fully qualified with sufficient knowledge and experience in Bank
project implementation procedures and national statistical system operations, stayed in Abuja for the
entire implementation period. They all were, therefore, able to have regular follow-up and take any
proactive actions necessary, ensuring continuous monitoring and guidance. The Bank’s fiduciary and
procurement team provided constant and regular advice to the government team on grey areas. This
enabled the project team to identify potential errors in a timely manner, and/or address errors
immediately. The in-country donor statistician ensured timely technical and implementation support
across several important activities. His regular visits to states in-between the supervision mission from
Washington, helped maintain constant dialogue and address issues in a timely manner. The
composition of the Bank team remained stable and adequate throughout the project implementation
period. The Bank’s performance seems not to have suffered any shortcomings throughout the duration
of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

69.     In light of project outcomes and quality of intensive supervision carried out, the overall

                                                  [17] 
 
performance is assessed as satisfactory. This rating reflects a balance of (i) less-than-satisfactory
quality at entry of the project; and (ii) better-than-satisfactory supervision efforts for stable
implementation and remedying of bottlenecks. Field visits were carried out as scheduled and advised
by the Bank. External experts were hired when necessary to strengthen implementation and to ensure
higher quality of assistance provided. The team maintained very close collaboration with key
stakeholders in the government, NGOs, civil society, and business community and played a catalytic
role in encouraging other development partners to support statistical capacity development throughout
the project life. The Bank team’s quick and positive response to issues raised by project counterparts
in the government and related proactive actions helped to achieve the project objectives and key
results. The team recognized the shortcomings at project design and complications at early stage of
implementation. Its intensive and continued supervision efforts and proactive actions allowed for
achieving significant results, completion of almost all envisaged project activities, disbursement of
almost full project’s funds with no extension.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.      From the very beginning, government ownership and commitment were consistent. In line
with the governing arrangements, the Technical Committee provided an oversight of project
implementation, though the ICR team was not able to find any written evidence of the sessions
conducted or issues discussed. The work of the Technical Committee seems not to have been well
documented. Sharing of documents and other information on the SRF project among the members of
the Committee could have been better handled, although it is not clear whether this should have been
the role of the Ministry of Finance or facilitation by the Bank team.

71.      Bureaucratic issues between the FPFMD and PIU: At project commencement, it was noted
that payment vouchers prepared and sent by the Project Accountant (NPoPC component), to the Head
FPFMD were not approved in a timely manner. While the Head FPFMD stated that queries raised by
him were not responded to by the Project Accountant within 48 working hours (as required by the
financial procedures manual) hence the delay, the Project Accountant represented that the queries were
all promptly attended to. This friction resulted in delays in the release of the requisite funds to carry
out project related transactions. The bank team subsequently invited both parties for series of meetings
to resolve the lingering issues after which the impasse was eventually resolved. 

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

National Bureau of Statistics (Moderately Satisfactory)

72.      The FM arrangements for the project consistently improved over time. At the beginning,
several issues, such as the lack of a functional internal audit system, untimely submission of IFRs and
poor quality of reports, several instances of insufficient supporting documentation and poor method
of retiring funds, and ineffective budget system, were noted. However, at project closure, most of
these issues had been sufficiently addressed. At project closure, the disbursement rate was 99.95
percent.

73.     The first Post Procurement Review (PPR) revealed some weaknesses linked to delays in

                                                  [18] 
 
contract publications, poor procurement filing and payment delays. All of these issues were
subsequently resolved during project implementation. The NBS had a well-organized and robust
project management structure and effectively procured goods and services.

74.     The monitoring of project indicators could have been significantly improved through the
strengthening of regular reporting and evaluation of project interim implementation results.

National Population Commission (Moderately Unsatisfactory)

75.     Review of FM arrangements at project closure revealed that several of the internal control
weaknesses highlighted during the course of the project life (lack of an approved FM procedures
manual, no chart of accounts, and poor expense retirements procedures) were properly addressed.
Several other issues, however, were not sufficiently addressed up until project closure (the overall
quality of the internal audit report was still low and an effective budget system was still lacking).
Furthermore, IFRs were not submitted on a regular basis.

76.     The first PPR also revealed several weaknesses in procurement (delays in contract
publications, poor procurement filing, and payment delays). The key factor that affected effective
performance of the procurement at NPoPC included, but was not limited to, weak contract
management. This led to delays in the delivery of the majority of procurement and project activities.
However, at project closure, most of these issues had been substantially addressed.

77.     Improvements could have been introduced into the monitoring and evaluation activities,
including the preparation of regular progress reports and an assessment of outstanding issues in order
to undertake the proactive measures and actions. By the end of project implementation, however,
targets were largely achieved due to strong efforts of the NPoPC project team and continued support
from the Bank team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     Despite the late establishment of the project oversight body and its performance, the dismissal
of key staff at NPoPC in the midst of project implementation, and a relatively weak reporting and
monitoring performance, both the NBS and NPoPC demonstrated a strong interest in reforming
process and a commitment to successful project implementation.

79.       State statistical agencies were the primary beneficiaries of project activities. They participated
in the identification of their needs at the project design stage and made every effort to ensure that
acquired equipment was operational. In order to strengthen the sustainability of project results in
states, it would have been helpful to set up an institutional framework supporting stronger involvement
of subnational entities in the overall reform process, policy dialogue and project implementation.
Moving forward it might be useful to consider the introduction of matching grant principles (whereby
state governments would be invited to co-finance federally/centrally supported activities in their states
in order to increase both impact and sustainability).

                 ICR Team, ICR Mission findings, including Country Management Unit (CMU)
                 recommendations
Project design   1. Complexity of NSS. The complexity of the Nigerian Statistical System must be taken into
                 account in the design of any new statistics operation.

                 2. Exceptionally strong overall design and implementation coordination mechanism is
                 needed for multiagency project. In case of multi-agency project, a strong governance
                 arrangement needs to be established and funded during project preparation.

                 3. Diversity of local needs in various states in Nigeria calls for the introduction of flexible
                 project design for various states. It is not feasible to roll out the identical project design for all
                 36 states, as “one size fits all” would be inefficient and undermine ownership; project supervision
                 would be “mission impossible”.

                 4. Linkages between the PDO, planned project activities, their sequencing, and alignment
                 with the results indicators need to be strong at project design phase. This is necessary to
                 ensure a clear project “causal chain” from the very beginning.

                 5. The governance structure of a project needs to be clearly defined, established and
                 functional prior to project effectiveness. The Technical Committee acted as the oversight
                 structure for the project, but was not established and functional until a year after project
                 effectiveness. No resources were budgeted for its operating costs, including field visits.
Project          1. Continuity of project management/coordinators on the client side for the entire period of
arrangements     implementation. Effective implementation requires consistency in project arrangements, and in
                 addition, there should be a “succession plan” envisaged. For example, the unplanned change in
                 key project management personnel at NPoPC resulted in long delays that stalled project
                 implementation significantly.

                 2. Importance of project governance, monitoring and reporting arrangements. Technical
                 Committee did not play a cohesive role under multiagency project supervision either because of
                 weak incentives or lack of experience. Monitoring reports to be provided by the PITTs of NBS
                 and NPoPC lacked analysis of implementation issues and did not constitute either a solid basis for
                 evaluating ongoing project implementation or assessing its outcomes.

                 3. FM arrangements. In case of several “independent” project participants (PITTs) and different
                 level of their FM capacity, the project should consider operating separate designated accounts
                 for each participant.
Central/local    1. WB presence on the ground. The presence of an in-country donor statistician was a strong
coordination     asset in building trust among the different participants, in solving implementation problems and
during the       acting as a liaison between the government and the Bank. This arrangement should be preserved

implementation
                 2. In order to influence state level reforms more efficiently, it is advisable to consider and engage,
                 besides the SSAs/SBSs, additional channels and champions in the state government, not limiting
                 to a Commissioner, but including Governor level as well.

                 3. The role of the National Partnership Group. Partner support can be helpful in providing
                 critical technical assistance and fill in some gaps in financing. Partners can also reinforce the
                 message of the overall coordination and support to statistical development. However, it is essential
                 that Nigeria Government players are in the lead of the NSS development and own the process.

                 4. One important lesson learned from this pilot project is indeed the usefulness of following up at
                 state level between supervision missions to ensure progress in implementation (e.g. Edo and
                 Kaduna for statistics edit and SSYB), and the difficulty to do so in a context of security threat (e.g.

                                                        [20]

Project             1. Coordination with CMU as an asset. CMU should be onboard. Its interventions could be used

course              Governor is very strong - in case of problems, the matter could have been brought to his attention
                    (i.e. elevated from the Commissioner level to the Governor’) earlier. It seems that statistical
                    project issues were not presented as clearly as they could have been - all WB projects are
                    performing in Edo state well, except for statistical one.

and
sustainability of   2. Stability of Government financing of statistics development. It should be realized that the
outcomes            WB and other funds are just supplementary investment and not a substitution for government
                    recurrent and investment funding for statistical system. In this regard, it is necessary to be engaged
                    with Nigeria’s Ministry of Finance on the sustainability of the overall funding envelope for
                    statistics, ensuring the government first and then to add the WB resources.
Other               1. The Role of NBS. NBS has to work/operate/perform as a joining/connecting center/force in the
                    country; and become the true coordinating force.

                    2. Accessibility of state level data. It is noted that occasionally states did not have access to data
                    collected in the states.

                    3. Capacity building can be strengthened if accompanied by broader policy dialogue and
                    reform. The project illustrates what can be achieved within the existing reform/dialogue space.
                    Taking the longer term perspective, the enabling environment should be made sustainable through
                    broader reforms, enactment of relevant legislation, building of reform-minded coalition of data
                    producers and users, broader range of stakeholders, and strengthening the evidence-based policy
                    dialogue.

                    4. Connection between PDO and monitoring indicators should be ensured at the time of project
                    design.

                    5. Location of the Project Implementation Units (PIUs). Establishing the PITTs within the NBS
                    and NPoPC (instead of independent PIUs under some other projects) helps to improve the
                    management capacity, strengthens ownership, and ensures smoother implementation of donor
                    projects in the future. In case of more than one implementing agency it is advisable to consider the
                    option of establishing the coordination unit outside both implementing agencies.

                    6. Regular training and retraining in statistics related matters should be an important
                    component of any statistical development project.

                          FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
                          Nigeria: Statistical Development Project
              Annex 1: Statistics for Results Facility (SRF) – Main Features

1.      The Statistics for Results Facility is a multi-donor initiative, managed by the World
Bank, to increase the capacity of developing countries in formulating policies and decision-
making for development through the production, availability and use of quality statistics in
participating countries.

2.     The Catalytic Fund supporting the SRF (the SRF Catalytic Fund) is intended to
support this goal. In each participating country, the SRF Catalytic Fund aims to:
    Promote a system-wide approach in statistics at country level;
    Increase resources for implementing country-owned National Statistical Plans;
    Promote an improved national dialogue and partnership between statistics users and
       statistical producers; and
    Deliver more efficient and effective aid and technical assistance for strengthening
       statistical systems and results measurement, through better coordination and
       alignment to agreed National Statistical Plans and through better alignment to the Paris
       Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

3.      A country requesting support from the SRF-CF must have a National Statistical Plan
and be willing to establish a National Partnership in Statistics, if one does not exist. More
specifically, eligible countries must decide to:
    Exercise leadership over their statistical development by developing a good quality –
        comprehensive, realistic, prioritized, and costed – National Statistical Plan;
    Allocate resources and carry out necessary administrative reforms for proper
        implementation of the National Statistical Plan;
    Take lead in coordinating donor and government support to statistics – through the
        creation of national partnerships;
    Put into effect the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, in particular to
        ensure that users have confidence in the quality and integrity of national statistics; and
    Monitor progress in statistics and statistical capacity, based on output and outcome
        indicators.

4.     The exact composition of the partnership group will differ among countries, but
should include representatives from government, development partners involved in statistics.
The leadership of the group is shared by a lead government agency and a designated lead
donor. The SRF-CF strongly recommends that a statistician be identified from the donor
community to serve as a liaison between the national statistical system and development
partners by stimulating support to the implementation of the National Statistical Plan and
promoting stronger coordination and partnership between the users and producers of statistics.

                        Nigeria: Statistical Development Project
                           Annex 7: Beneficiary Survey Results

1.       NBS and NPoPC together with six states SSAs/SBSs were the primary
beneficiaries and main stakeholders of this project. NBS and NPoPC benefitted through
institutional and organizational support, training, data development, methodology
improvement, physical infrastructure and ICT equipment, and purchase of vehicles. District
statistics offices received training and equipment to improve their capacity. These offices
were mainly supported with statistical training and physical infrastructure, which resulted in
some states producing statistics for the first time. In total, more than one thousand people
were trained in statistics, data collection and computer programs across the NSS. The project
increased their ability to track progress toward meeting the government’s development goals
and the MDGs. Overall statistical coordination benefitted through the establishment of sector
working groups to strengthen the national statistics system and the promulgation of the new
Statistics Edicts that redefined and strengthened the role of the NSS.

2.      Policy makers and planners. The next set of beneficiary was policy- and decision
makers in the public and private sectors by having access to higher quality data to inform
their policy decisions and monitor progress. NBS provides a large share of the statistics in
the Government’s Annual Progress Report, which is intended to inform policy-making,
planning and budgeting.

3.      Non state actors and the general public. The project also aimed to ensure that data
from across government is readily accessible and available in a timely manner for use by
different stakeholders, including academic institutions, Parliament, NGOs, and the general
public. The media received a special training under the project to play more efficiently its
important role by helping to sensitize the public about the activities of NSS, and also as a
mean to disseminate statistics to the general public. The academicians, researchers and
general public also benefitted from the significant number of datasets released from NBS
and line ministries through the NBS website.

    IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT ON THE NIGERIA STATISTICS
        FOR RESULTS FACILITY-CATALYTIC FUND (SRF-CF) PROJECT

1.0          Introduction

1.1     The Statistics for Results Facility-Catalytic fund (SRF-CF) Project in Nigeria
Commenced with the World Bank providing a Grant of $10m through the Statistics for
Results Development Project (SRF) Trust Fund (TF99783) to support the implementation of
the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS). The Grant was to be used
for the implementation of the Pilot Phase of the NSDS covering the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS), the National Population Commission and the six (6) States of Anambra,
Bauchi, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo. Of this amount, $5m was allocated to NBS and the
six Pilot States of Anambra, Bauchi, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo. The implementation of
the Pilot Phase of the NSDS under the SRF Catalytic fund spanned over the period of three
years effective from 16th June, 2011 with the signing of the Grant Agreement by the
honorable Minister of Finance and the Coordinating Minister of the Economy and closed on
the 28th of February 2014.

1.2     The main objective of the project was to initiate the implementation of the National
Strategy for the Development of Statistics by producing reliable statistics in participating
States. This was to contribute to the long-term vision of the Nigerian Statistical System
which was to modernize and streamline the statistical system to ensure that it is sufficiently
equipped in terms of human resources, essential tools and infrastructure to produce and
disseminate reliable and timely statistics in a cost effective manner in accordance with
international standards and in response to users’ needs.

2.0          Project Intermediate Outcome Indicators

2.1          Ultimately, the specific intermediate outcome indicators of the project were:

      i)      Number of staff with competencies in core areas: official statistics, demography,
              data analysis, sampling design and methodology increased;
      ii)     Institutional Reform Roadmap being implemented on Track;
      iii)    Revised Human Resource Policies adopted;
                                                 [38] 
 
      iv)     Human Resource Information System developed and Populated;
      v)      Code of Conduct based on NBS Core values developed and disseminated;
      vi)     Staff training plan agreed and adopted;
      vii)    State Statistical agencies and MDAs have furnished office spaces with: desks,
              chairs, computers and operational internet links by 20103;
      viii)   ICT standards and policies adopted;
      ix)     ICT staffing and Training Plan adopted;
      x)      Baseline for equipped Birth and death registration centers developed;
      xi)     The use of concepts, definitions and methodology across the 6 states is standardized
              in at least 10 subject areas;
      xii)    Statistical template Adopted and used;
      xiii)   Increase in the number registering at pilot birth and death registration centers;
      xiv)    Increase in electronic birth and death capture; Increase in the incidence of statistics
              such as: enrollment, immunization, infant mortality rates; Malaria prevention, bed
              nets and price indices from NBS and NPoPC quoted in the media;
      xv)     Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) functional in all the 6 States; and
      xvi)    Annual progress Reports presented to SSAs and NBS Boards on time and uploaded
              on NBS website.

3.0          Project Components

        In order to meet up its Intermediate Outcome Indicators, the implementation of the
Project was broken into three broad Components as follows:

3.1          Component 1: Organizational, Institutional and Human Resource Development

       This component financed capacity building activities aimed at developing the
organizational and institutional framework of the National Statistical System. Under this
component also was the design and implementation of a human resource development and
management framework aimed at attracting and retaining qualified personnel in NBS.

3.2          Component 2: Developing statistical framework and information technology

        This component provided the necessary framework including computers (Hardware)
and software for strengthening data collection, processing and analysis. This has improved
the collection and processing of administrative data which will ultimately lead to
improvement in administrative statistics at the state level. It has also improved the
dissemination of quality statistical data at both NBS and statistical agencies of the
participating States through the publication of statistical reports in hard copies and electronic
media.

3.3          Component 3: Project management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and
             statistical communication

        This component made provision for co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation of the
project. It also focused on putting together baseline information which served as starting
point for monitoring implementation of the wider NSDS program.

                                                  [39] 
 
4.0      Status of Project Implementation

4.1     The Implementation of the SRF-CF project in Nigeria was driven by two
Implementing Agencies, viz; the National Bureau of Statistics and the National Population
Commission each allocated a sum of $5m. Whereas the National Population Commission
focused on Demographic Statistics, the National Bureau of Statistics on the other hand
focused on Economic and Social Statistics as well as the development of capacity in the six
States covered under the Project. Upon the signing of the Grant Agreement by the Honorable
Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, NBS prepared her Work
Plan, Procurement Plan and Budgets to cover the activities of the three components of the
project. The Procurement Plan covered five major areas, namely: Office furniture and
equipment, Consultancies, Workshops, Training and Operating Cost. Overall, the SRF
Project implemented by NBS achieved about 99.95% disbursement rate of the allocated
fund. In real terms the sum of $4,996,232.52 was disbursed leaving a balance of $3,767.48
only as at the close of the Project on the 28th February, 2014.

4.2     The activities in the Procurement Plan were broken into seven sub-topics in a
compressed Work Plan as follows:
    i)   Organizational and Institutional Development at NBS
    ii) Human Resource Development and Management at NBS
    iii) Roll Out of Statistical Template at SSAs (NBS)
    iv) Information Technology at NBS
    v) Data Development, Management & Dissemination at NBS
    vi) Project Management and M&E at NBS
    vii) Statistical Communication at NBS

5.0        Outcome of Project Implementation

a)         Capacity building of the State Statistical Agencies (SSAs)

5.1     The series of Training Programs undertaken during the implementation of the SRF
Project helped to tremendously improve the capacity of the statistical personnel in the States
covered under the Project. In addition, the Office furniture and equipment procured and
delivered to both NBS and the six benefitting States to a larger extent improved the
conditions of the working environment.

b)         Increased Statistical Output
5.2     As a matter of fact, the quantum and quality of statistics produced in the six States
that benefitted from the SRF has improved tremendously in the past three (3) years. In all the
six States covered by the Project, a lot of Publications ranging from Statistical Year Book,
Annual Abstract of Statistics, Review of the Performance of the Economy, Digest of
Statistics, Facts and Figures, Manpower Statistics, Market Calendar, Sector Statistics
(Education, Health, etc.) to mention but a few were produced.

c)         Design of State Statistical Master Pan (SSMP).
5.3        Through the SRF Project, three (3) of the participating States (Bauchi, Edo and

                                                   [41] 
 
Kaduna) were able to have their State Statistical Master Plans designed. This was used as an
Instrument to drive the process of reforming statistics at the respective States.

d)     Statistics Edicts
5.4    As part of the impact of the SRF Project, 20 States had passed their Statistics Edict.
These include Abia, Anambra, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Enugu, Ekiti, Gombe, Imo, Kaduna,
Kwara, Kano, Nassarawa, Niger, Ondo, Oyo, Rivers, Sokoto, Zamfara and Ogun State.

e)     Establishment of State Bureau of Statistics
5.6    During the implementation of the SRF Project, 18 States were able to establish their
State Bureaus of Statistics with Statistician Generals appointed. These are Abia, Anambra,
Cross Rivers, Edo, Enugu, Ekiti, Gombe, Imo, Kaduna, Kano, Kwara, Lagos, Niger, Ondo,
Oyo, Plateau, Sokoto and Zamfara State.

6.0     Lessons Learned
6.1      The World Bank provision for in-country donor statistician, working full-time to
support statistical reforms efforts in Nigeria was a welcome development because the
statistician provided technical assistance to NBS and the 6 Participating States statistical
agencies.

6.2     The funds flow arrangement between the NBS and NPoPC where NBS receives funds
from the World Bank and disburses to NPoPC and also NBS being responsible for managing
the withdrawal application on behalf of the NPoPC wasn’t optimal as it deprived the NPoPC
from building its capacity to manage World Bank Funds.

6.3     The role of the Federal Projects Financial Management Department (FPFMD) should
be better organized to enhance the smooth operation of projects and not in stalling and
delaying disbursements as was witnessed in the Project were withdrawal applications are let
unsigned for weeks without any reasons given for such. The Client Connection gives room
for rejection of applications and providing reasons for any such rejection. This should be
made use of in the event of withdrawal application been unsatisfactory.

6.4     At the preparation stage of the Project’s Work Plan, failure to make provision for the
Project Technical Committee made it difficult for the Committee to perform her Oversight
functions during the Project implementation.

7.0    Challenges
7.1     Slow pace of statistical development in some of the pilot states due to lack of State
Statistical Master Plan and passage of Statistics Bills.

7.2    Failure of the Federal Project Financial Management Department of the office of the
Accountant-General of the federation to develop an interim financial report format and
Financial Management (FM) Procedures Manual for the project affected timely Financial
Reporting.

                                             [42] 
 
7.3   Lack of Operating Cost for the Pilot States hindered them from putting into use the
equipment and furniture received from under the Project early enough.

7.4     The use of two agencies as Implementing Partners made it difficult for any of the
agencies and especially NBS as the Coordinator of the National Statistical System to provide
a single Report on the Project for the Country.

8.0    Way Forward

8.1     There is need for more support to intensify advocacy to Government Functionaries
at the State level on the importance of statistics to enable them facilitate the design of State
Statistical Master Plan (SSMP) and passage of Statistics Bills.

8.2    The Office of the Federal Project Financial Management Department of the office of
the Accountant-General of the federation should be strengthened and its role clearly defined
to guarantee the smooth implementation of Donor Projects.

8.3    Subsequent Projects should make provision for Operating Costs for all participating
agencies including the States to enable them take care of some miscellaneous activities.

8.4      In order not to cause any unnecessary confusion in the coordination of the statistical
system in Nigeria, as much as possible there should always be a single Implementing Agency
for statistical Projects under the support of Donors.

9.0    Conclusion
        In conclusion, the Nigerian Statistical System through the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) is appreciative of the support towards the development of statistics in
Nigeria by the Development Partners, especially The World Bank for providing Resources
through the Statistics for Results Facility Catalytic Fund for the Pilot Phase of the
implementation of the NSDS in Nigeria. With the kind of support enjoyed through the SRF
Project, NBS can proudly claim that Nigeria will no doubt implement the NSDS successfully
to enable the Country produce timely, accurate and easily accessible statistical information
for policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation of Government Projects and Programs.

                                [45] 
 
1.1    BACKGROUND
1.      The Commission in a memo no. SDM/1/S-2/XVI/312, of 22nd May 2009, approved
a 5-Year Strategy Document seeking financial support from the World Bank. The support
was intended to strengthen the Commission’s capacity to meet the challenges of timeliness
in data production and also prepare for the 2016 census exercise. The approved document
was forwarded to the World Bank for consideration. The support requested initially
amounted to about N10 billion naira (about $70 m).

2.      Following series of meetings with the World Bank in furtherance for the
consideration of submission, the Bank approved a $5,000,000 (five million dollars) grant
over a 3-year period (2011-2014) under the Statistics for Results Facility – Catalytic Fund
(SRF-CF). This necessitated the prioritization of the activities based on the amount
approved.

3.     The Grant became operational following the signing of the Grant Agreement between
the Federal Ministry of Finance that signed on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and
the World Bank on 16th June, 2011. This Grant agreement terminates on 28th. February, 2014.

4.     This 3-year Grant of $5 million is part of a $10 million package approved for Nigeria
to support the Nigerian Statistical System (NSS) and is shared equally between the
Commission and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

5.     As the SRF-CF project is primarily intended to enhance the quality and timeliness of
the National statistics through the implementation of the Nigerian Statistics Development
Plan (NSDP), only technical departments of vital registration, Census, Cartography,
Information technology and Planning & Research have been slated to benefit from the
support programme.

1.2    OBJECTIVES

          To enhance the capacity of the statistical system and promote demand for and use
           of statistics.
          To build capacity to produce better statistics for tracking progress of the key
           indicators in the national development programs.
          To build capacity for the conduct of the next census.
          To enhance the quality, relevance and timeliness of national statistics produced
           through the implementation of the Nigerian Statistics Development Plan (NSDP).

1.3    The Project Development Objective (PDO)

6.    The SRF-CF is to initiate the implementation of the National Strategy for the
Development of Statistics (NSDS) by producing reliable statistics in participating states:
Anambra, Bauchi, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo states.

7.     The project components are:

                                            [46] 
 
(i)      Organizational, Institutional and Human Resource Development - This component
         will finance set up costs for a national framework for data management and
         development in the country, which requires reforming the legal framework at the state
         level streamlining the coordination arrangements and exploring the possibility of
         reinstating the common statistical cadre. It will also prepare the 6 states: Anambra,
         Bauchi, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo states for implementation of the wider
         statistical program;
(ii)     Developing Statistical Framework and Information Technology - This component
         will provide the necessary framework including computer processing equipment
         (hardware) and software for strengthening data collection, processing and analysis;
         this will improve the collection and processing of administrative data which will
         ultimately lead to improvement in social, economic and demographic statistics; and
(iii)    Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and Statistical
         Communication -This component will develop and maintain mechanism for project
         coordination and statistical communication, as well as set up of monitoring and
         evaluation of the project.

1.4      PROJECT ADMINISTRATION

            There is the PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TASK TEAM (PITT) headed by a
             project Coordinator- that implements project activities in line with Bank
             guidelines.
            The FEDERAL PROJECT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DIVISION
             (FPFMD) that ensures compliance with the financial management requirements
             of the Bank and Government
            A technical Committee headed by the Director of the International Economic
             Relations department in the Federal Ministry of Finance, with membership drawn
             from Central Bank or Rep, Nigeria Statistical Association, office of the Auditor-
             General that have oversight for the implementation of the project and outcome.

1.5      OUTCOME

1.5.1    INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING

       (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF 144 DIRECT DATA CAPTURE CENTRES
8.      The promulgation of the Births, Deaths etc. {Compulsory Registration) Decree No.39
of 1979 marked the commencement of a centralized universal birth registration system in
Nigeria. Subsequent amendments such as the “Births , Deaths ETC (Compulsory
Registration) Act No. 69 of 1992” assigned the responsibility to register the events to the
National Population Commission and also empowered it to establish a machinery for a
uniform nationwide system of vital registration. These legislations were further strengthened
by section 24 of the 3rd schedule of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999.

                                             [47] 
 
9.       The programme over the years has expanded to cover the whole country with the
establishment of an average of three registration centres in each of the 774 Local Government
Areas of the Federation. Each registration centre is manned by a registrar and equipped with
facilities such as table, chair and steel cabinet as well as necessary registration forms and
registers. The occurrence of births, deaths or stillbirths is reported to the registrar, who enters
the information in the appropriate form/register and issues a certificate.

10.      All completed forms in each registration centre are coded, parcelled and transmitted
to the Local Government Area office and then to the state office of the National Population
Commission at the end of every month. Some manual tabulation is done at the State level
before the forms are sent to the National Headquarters for processing. This process is not
only time consuming but also labour intensive which has bearing on the dwindling annual
budgetary allocations. Thus, the adoption of the direct electronic data capture will greatly
conserve resources, avoid loss of information/data and ensure timely and regular publication
of vital statistics for the benefit of Government planners and other data users.

11.     Objectives
           To fast-track data capture on birth registration
           To make data available, timely, user friendly and easy to manage
           To facilitate timely publication and dissemination of data on child birth and
            death, including infant, child and maternal mortality.
         To create and sustain a national data base of registered events.
12.      Thus, the adoption of the direct electronic data capture will greatly conserve
resources, avoid loss of information/data and ensures timely and regular publication of vital
statistics for the benefit of Government and other data users. For the pilot phase 144 centres
were selected in six states. Eight LGAs were selected with 3 centres established.

Direct Data Capture System
13.    Personal Digital Assistant [PDA]: A digital handheld device [Alternatives are Mobile
Devices, Pocket or Portable PC’s] used to log and record/capture survey or census
information

                            SAMPLE PDA SYSTEM




Advantages
    1.    Instant data capturing at the point of collection, reducing manual input errors.
    2.    Immediate data validation, reducing re-verifications at later stage.
    3.    Time effective with real time logical validation rules, reducing logical errors.
    4.    Faster processing of survey/census information leading to timely availability of
    results.
    5.    Integration of Enumeration Maps during field exercise to ensure full coverage


A REGISTRAR ONLY CAPTURES ABOUT 30 EVENTS USING MANUAL
REGISTRATION BUT NOW COULD REGISTER ABOUT 150 EVENTS IN A DAY



     (b) ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOGRAPHIC LABORATORY

14.     The World Bank supplied some equipment such as lap tops, desk tops, computer
bags, stabilizers, optical mouse, mouse pad, printers and photocopier toners to the department
in order to help set up its demographic laboratory. These materials have since been deployed
to use.

Benefits of the demographic laboratory

1.       The demographic laboratory provides effective platform for continuous demographic
         analysis by staff of the census department.
2.       The resources in the laboratory and the skills acquired by the department’s staff are
         facilitating the in depth analysis of the census data beginning with 20006 data.

                                             [49] 
 
3.      The laboratory provides a good environment for engaging in other researches of
        interest by staff such as Nigerian population dynamics.
4.      The laboratory is open for all staff of the commission to use.


     FASTER DATA ANALYSIS AND INDEPTH ANALYSIS OF CENSUS DATA NOW

     (c) ESTABLISHMENT OF MINI-GIS CENTRES
15.     Geo-spatial information such as cadastral maps, administrative boundary maps,
attribute information from population characteristics, from registers such as title and
valuation, has traditionally been gathered from isolated systems of surveying, title
registrations and valuation assessments. As a result, getting complete and up to date
information is often time consuming and difficult. However, the development of Internet
technology has allowed Geographic Information (GI) providers an unprecedented
opportunity to disseminate data, and has allowed users an unprecedented access to volumes
of Geographic Information.

16.    Therefore the increased demand for up-to-date geo- information from a large number
of users informed the need to established GIS centres. This will bring about an efficient
mechanism for making geo- information accessible through the Internet network to the
majority of the users. Generally speaking, the electronic access to geo- information is
important because the information serves the land market, credit facilities, urban and rural
planning and development, land taxation and management of natural resources, thereby
enabling citizens and organizations to make the right decisions.

17.    Digitally capturing all the 660,000 Enumeration areas, all important landmarks &
physical features are tasks which cannot be accomplished hitherto by the few digital
cartographers at the headquarters within a short time but with the broadened the capacity
base both institutional and human the task could now be accomplished with ease.

1.7       ASSESSMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE

PLANNING
18.     Even prior to the fruition of the SRF-CF project, the Commission had put up a
comprehensive document in readiness for the 2016 Census and for the revitalization of the
civil registration and vital statistics system in the country. However, the Bank excited by the
document facilitated the conveyance of an interface with all UN agencies. This opportunity
enabled the Commission perfected its document in terms of strategies and budgeting. Later,
however it was the same document that was presented for support to the Bank under the SRF-
CF project.

19.    Indeed, the input from the statisticians and procurement specialists at the planning
period were of immerse value.




                                                  [52] 
 
IMPLEMENTATION

20.     The first six months from the commencement was not easy as there were challenges
that really slowed the pace of implementation. It was more of a learning process as the
Commission was undertaking such a programme for the first time. Indeed, the professional
advises from the Bank officials, especially the engagement of a procurement specialist for a
one year period and the sharing of experiences with colleagues in the NBS greatly helped.

21.     A second major challenge that greatly affected the implementation of the project that
came almost six months towards the closure of the project was the sudden deployment of the
Project Manager. This action was not in consonance with the terms of Grant Agreement. The
effect of this was to ground project implementation to a halt until pressures from the Bank
and Technical Committee prevailed on the Commission to reverse the decision.

ASSESSMENT OF THE BANK’S PERFORMANCE

PLANNING

22.    The Bank was much helpful during the planning stage. In addition to the professional
advices given, it organized a meeting with all UN agencies where the support document was
presented for inputs and likely support from those organizations. The result was the
successful buying-in into the SRF-CF project when it came on board.

IMPLEMENTATION

23.     The Bank was handy throughout the implementation period giving guidance, advise,
project monitoring and evaluation. The period of the Support Mission Visit is most crucial
period of interface with the Bank. The visitation subjects the project to a thorough
assessment, analysis of challenges and measures proffered instantly to overcome challenges
for smooth implementation. In addition, the Bank had not barricaded itself at any time as
advices and guidance are sought at any point in time.

PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT FOR FUTURE OPERATION

ROLE OF TECHNICAL COMMITTEE

24.     Indeed, the Technical Committee is crucial to the successful implementation of the
project. The role as stipulated include facilitating the overall coordination of the project
activities, providing strategic and policy directions on the implementation of the project,
reviewing and recommending for approval by the Bank the proposed Annual work plans and
budgets and reviewing progress made towards achieving the project’s objectives as well as
making recommendations for removal of any obstacle to the implementation of the project.

25.      To ensure that it functions more effectively in the future, there should a clear cut
budget line provided for it in the project. This will enable the servicing of the meetings and
visitation to project sites for effective monitoring and supervision.


                                             [53] 
 
FEDERAL PROJECT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT
26.     The FPFMD at the office of the Accountant-General is also a key pillar for it ensures
financial management of the project in accordance with the provisions of the requirements;
it prepares interim unaudited report financial reports and annual financial statement and
performs internal audit functions.

27.     The serious challenge experienced was the enormous responsibilities of the head of
the FPFMD in meeting the demands of the project especially as a key signatory in the
disbursement arrangement. Project Implementation within time frame suffers when
unnecessary delays result from lack of prompt payments when activities are completed or
payments were not forthcoming as and when due because of the preoccupation of the head
of the FPFMD.


IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT MISSION
28.     This organ is perhaps the most critical component in successful project
implementation. The implementation Support Mission avails the opportunity for an interface
with all stakeholders in the project implementation where issues, challenges and progresses
were discussed and way forward earmarked. This organ is necessary and the six month
interval is quite apt.

PROCUREMENT CLINIC
29.    This is a forum where organizations handling one project or another under the World
Bank are brought together from time to time to discuss procurement issues, challenges and
experiences. Thus, participants learn from experiences and expert advises that fast track
program implementation. This forum should be maintained.


CONCLUSION
31.     The Commission benefitted tremendously form both the individual and
institutional capacity buildings that have overall impact on the quality and timeliness
of data collection and use.

                           Annex 10B. Strengthening Statistics in Nigeria under ERGP
Background

1.      Nigeria’s statistical system was particularly badly affected during the years of
military rule. Over more than 15 years, the capacity of statistical agencies declined with the
result that many important indicators are either incomplete or not available at all and data
quality was poor. In the eyes of many users official statistics are thought to be unreliable and
of only limited use.

2.      The statistical system in Nigeria was complex. At the Federal level the apex
organization was the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), but there are also several other
important players, including the Central Bank of Nigeria and the National Population
Commission, which has formal responsibility for population and demographic statistics,
including carrying out population censuses. In addition, the Departments of Planning,
Research and Statistics of the Federal Ministries are responsible for the compilation and
dissemination of statistics in their areas of competence. There was also a separate statistical
structure at the state level. The legal mandate for official statistics was also complicated, with
several different laws in effect. FOS was governed by the Statistics Act, which pre-dates
Independence. However, a new Statistics Act 2007 has transformed the statistics architecture
in Nigeria with the establishment of the National Bureau of Statistics.

3.      With financial and technical assistance from the World Bank6, Nigeria prepared a
Statistical Master Plan (SMP) for the development of statistics generally in the country,
covering the period 2004/5 to 2008/9. Based on a detailed assessment of current capacity and
performance, the SMP proposed a comprehensive five-year program, with total development
cost of the order of $45 million. There was general support among most stakeholders for the
analysis in the SMP and for the overall strategy proposed. However, it was not clear that an
investment program of this magnitude could support the development of statistics at the sub-
national level. While the Federal Government recognized the need for investment in statistics
and a number of donors, including the World Bank were prepared to provide support, there
was concern with both the size and complexity of the program proposed. As a start, the
Federal Office of Statistics had to develop the appropriate management capacity to lead the
implementation program, while simultaneously improving data quality and coverage.

4.     A limited change management program could be put into effect in the short to
medium term, which would meet some of the most immediate data priorities and which
would also prepare the ground for more comprehensive change later on.

5.      The SMP identified that the problems faced by the statistical system in Nigeria
reflected both supply and demand issues. The long decline in capacity was largely a
reflection of a lack of interest in and demand for data at the highest levels. With the
restoration of democratic government the demand for data was undoubtedly increasing led
by the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). However, it
was also clear that demand for good quality statistics was weak and there was, yet, only
                                                            
6
  The SMP coordinated and supervised by the Country Office was prepared with the support of a grant from
the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building 
                                                               [56] 
 
limited recognition of the need for an independent and effective statistical system as a core
component of good governance. Any strategy to strengthen statistics in Nigeria, therefore,
had to address both demand and supply constraints. Ultimately any investment program
would only generate sustained returns if sufficient demand for statistics could be generated
in the long-term.

Funding        : DFID: US$ 7.00 million (equivalent)
                 IDA: US$ 13.00 million

6.      Short to Medium-Term Development Strategy to Strengthen Statistics in Nigeria
What was being suggested, therefore, was to put in place a three-to-five year program to
cover the calendar years 2005 to 2009 inclusive, which would address some of the key
problem areas identified in the SMP, but which would have a more limited focus. It was
proposed that this program should focus on rebuilding trust in official statistics and should
be limited to the federal level, with specific emphasis on developing the capacity of FOS.
Such a program should be formally adopted by the Federal Government, if possible at
Cabinet level. It should then provide the basis to coordinating all assistance to statistics,
including exiting or planned support from DFID (US$7 million equivalent), IDA resources
in the sum of US$13 million would become available while awaiting the resources from the
European Union. If this could be done, then any assistance provided through ERGP would
be seen as part of a coordinated program of donor support to implement an agreed
government strategy. Towards the end of this period, the program for strengthening statistics,
especially the statistical master plan could be revised and updated to provide the basis for
further investment in capacity.

7.     By the end of the five-year period, it was suggested that the strategy should have
achieved the following:
    Have re-established FOS as the lead agency in the national statistical system with its
       headquarters in Abuja;
    Build a statistical management structure and capacity to lead to further development
       of statistics;
    Have re-established trust in official statistics among data users, in particular in the
       key economic and social indicators;
    Have re-established effective communication with data providers and have in place
       an effective system for the regular collection of the main economic data series;
    Have a system in place for the regular dissemination of key data series in line with
       the recommendations of the GDDS; and
    Have established an effective statistical coordination system in the country.

8.      Since Nigeria was already participating in the GDDS, it made sense to build on what
was already in place and, in effect, to use the GDDS as the framework to guide development
over the period. The emphasis in data quality and on dissemination, should help to build trust
among data users and the system covered all the main data series that would generate the
indicators required by NEEDS as well as users more generally. Since plans were already well
advanced for the 2005 population census, the activities outlined below, did not directly
include the data collection program of the National Population Commission, although
provision was made for better sharing and use of the data. The key activities and outputs
                                             [57] 
 
were identified, therefore, as follows.

Organizational and Institutional Development

9.      Although the legal mandate for FOS was clearly out of date, it was suggested that it
may be premature to think about new legislation until there was clear agreement on how the
national statistical system was to be organized and, in particular how the activities of
agencies such as the National Population Commission were to be included. For the next three
years, therefore, it was suggested that the priorities should be:
     To establish FOS with its headquarters in Abuja;
     To develop a medium-to-long-term (probably for ten years) plan to restructure FOS
        and, in particular, to increase the proportion of professionally qualified staff from
        about five per cent at present to more than 40 percent;
     To establish effective mechanisms for the coordination of statistical activities at the
        federal level, with both technical and political oversight, based, as far as possible, on
        what is already in place;
     Have effective mechanisms in place to provide for regular consultation between data
        providers, compilers and users; and
     Have in place a set of indicators to monitor the performance of the federal statistical
        system and a mechanism for reporting these to parliament on an annual basis.

Human Resources Development

10.     The SMP identified the need for a fundamental restructuring of federal statistical
agencies with focus on the Federal Office of Statistics. The Federal Office of Statistics was
then over-staffed, but also suffered from severe shortages of professional and managerial
staff. This was likely to be a long-term process and in the next three-to-five years, it was
suggested that the priority should be to establish capacity and processes that would then allow
the necessary restructuring to take place. The centerpiece of this component was the
development of strategic skills and staff motivation. This would require a systematic and
fundamental transition from low skills base and low motivation to a level where staff were
skilled and highly motivated. Based on the long-term restructuring plan outlined above,
therefore, it was suggested that the priorities for human resources development be as follows.
     To strengthen management capacity at both senior and middle-levels in FOS through
        an effective management training program;
     To carry out staffing reforms to begin to professionalize the FOS;
     To put in place effective staff appraisal and human resources development processes
        in FOS;
     Do a training needs assessment of the FOS;
     To establish an appropriate scheme of service for statistical workers and a career
        structure that can be applied s widely as possible; and
     To upgrade technical skills, especially in data analysis and dissemination.

Data Development

11.     Data quality is a cornerstone of statistical work in any country. In Nigeria, lack of
quality has been identified as one of the factors limiting data use. While there is a clearly a
                                              [58] 
 
need in the medium to longer-term to develop new data collection activities, as set out in the
SMP, the short-term focus should be to improve existing data processes, with particular
emphasis on coverage, data quality and dissemination. A second objective should be to put
in place the statistical infrastructure in the form of: a comprehensive business register;
targeted sampling frameworks for surveys; cost effective and efficient methods used for
statistical operation; and database structures that promote easy access to and use of statistical
data. It is suggested, therefore that the priorities for activities in this area should be as follows:
     To review and promote the adoption, by the main statistical agencies, of
         internationally accepted standards and methodologies in data production;
     To ensure that sound and well-accepted statistical techniques are used for data
         collection, compilation and validation;
     To conduct target surveys and disseminate results in areas such as: national accounts;
         poverty and living standards monitoring statistics; business and industrial statistics;
         demographic and vital statistics; health statistics; education statistics; employment
         statistics; agricultural and agriculture-related statistics; transportation statistics;
         governance; and gender statistics;
     To improve data processing and analysis to reduce the delays in dissemination and
         also to make more effective use of data that are already collected;
     To use modern database management techniques to make it possible to use data from
         different sources and to produce statistical products that are easier to access and use;
     To strengthen data dissemination especially using new formats such as CD-ROMs
         and the Internet;
     To develop and promulgate a formal data dissemination policy, with provision for
         the release of suitably anonymized micro-level data sets for further research and
         analysis;
     In line with the recommendations of the GDDS, review and disseminate detailed
         information on methods and procedures used for the main data series; and
     To carry out a user-satisfaction survey, to measure user response to data
         improvements.

Infrastructure, Equipment, Information Technology and Transport

12.     It is clear that the activities outlined above would require an upgrading of the physical
infrastructure, equipment, information technology and transport facilities available to FOS
and other federal agencies. It would be important to promote cooperation between agencies
to build statistical infrastructure. It would also require commitment by Government to
provide flexibility on the choice and use of technology and equipment for statistical purposes.
Key requirements are likely to be as follows:
     The provision of a headquarters office building for FOS in Abuja and ensuring that
        this is adequately provided with a local area network, back-up generators, computing
        facilities, Internet and e-mail access and facilities to allow data users to access data
        and statistical products;
     The development of an appropriate database structure to allow for the effective
        sharing of data between agencies and to promote easy access by users; and
     Support the provision of critical transport infrastructure, including vehicles, motor
        cycles.

                                                [59] 
 
Achievements

13.    The Federal Government recognized that it needed a strong statistical system to
underpin the development and constant refinement of development policy and strategy; to
monitor the impact of policies and progress towards the achievement of MDGs; and to ensure
that Nigerians have adequate information on various aspects of national life and are able to
engage in more informed dialogue on various development policy challenges. A medium
term Statistical Master plan has been developed with the full participation of key
stakeholders—both users and producers of data and different levels of government. The
Master plan would take several years to implement fully. However, so far under the ERGP,
funding was provided for:

(i) Organizational and Institutional Development. The mandate for statistical activities was
derived from outdated legislation. A new Statistics Act had to be put in place which reflected
modern statistical principles re-established the integrity and independence of official
statistics, which was severely undermined during the years of military rule. The new
legislation defined the responsibility of the national statistical system, provided the necessary
authorities to carry them out and defined limitations on its authority and safeguards for
individuals and corporations. The legislation and associated regulations provided a sound
institutional and regulatory framework to ensure and safeguard the confidentiality of data
sources, while promoting access to and use of official statistics and ensuring that the
statistical system as a whole is accountable and transparent. This support also provided
increased guidance for statistical operations, strengthened and streamlined the national
coordinating bodies on statistics; reducing duplication while ensuring that all stakeholders
are given an adequate voice in setting priorities. Another important achievement was that
appropriate mechanisms for effective coordination have been established at national and sub-
national levels, while at the same time establishing mechanisms for effective dialogue with
data users and respondents. The SMP fused the Federal Office of Statistics and the National
Data Bank into a National Bureau of Statistics.

(ii) Human Resource Development: Current staff skills and capacity in key statistical
agencies was weak and the SMP identified the need for a complete restructuring of the
Federal Office of Statistics, the apex organization in the national statistical system. This
would necessarily be a long-term process and the project would focus on those components
that could be implemented with limited resources in the first three years. The project would
also establish a framework to support staff development and the restructuring of the FOS in
the medium to longer term. A particular focus was to expand and develop professional and
managerial skills and competencies and staff would be trained on new standards and
methodology, as well as in managerial skills. The output of this component extends not only
to the acquisition of new technical competencies, but also to wider skills associated with
effective relations with users and suppliers of statistics. Such training would be provided
through local and external institutions. As part of its restructuring, 1450 staff mostly low
level and of the non-professional cadre were disengaged from the NBS (FOS was now NBS)
and even though the agency was yet to begin recruitment of professional statisticians, the
percentage of professional staff has increased from 1:4 to 1:3. In addition, the capacity of
other producers and users of statistics was being enhanced through formal training, seminars,
retreats and workshops. The methodologies of the producers so as to promote the use of

                                              [60] 
 
statistics in decision-making and improve users’ analytical capabilities is also being
improved. This activity also supported the adaptation of these standards to Nigeria and be
implemented within the Statistical System (FOS, CBN and delegated institutions). This
includes implementing an integrated accounting and classification system for the National
Accounts, Government Finance Statistics and Balance of Payments, as well as classifications
for industries and products which link to each other. The aim would be to strengthen Nigeria's
participation in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), while moving towards
more exacting standards such as the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) within
five to ten years. The project would also help to develop appropriate frameworks and
mechanisms for supporting human resources development once the project is completed.
These would include the establishment of a scheme of service for statisticians and other
related professional staff, the development of a framework for management training; and
putting in place mechanisms for human resource and training management.

(iii) Data Development: While there was a need in the medium to longer-term to develop
new data collection activities, as set out in the SMP, the immediate focus for the project was
to improve existing data processes, with particular emphasis on coverage, data quality and
dissemination. A second objective was to put in place the statistical infrastructure in the form
of a comprehensive business register; targeted sampling frameworks for surveys; cost
effective and efficient methods used for statistical operation; and database structures that
promote easy access to and use of statistical data. Accordingly, this activity would finance
the adaptation by the main statistical agencies of internationally accepted standards and
methodologies in data production; ensure that sound and well-accepted statistical techniques
are used for data collection, compilation and validation; conduct target surveys and topical
statistics and disseminate results; and ensure increase in the rate of provision of sectoral
statistics such as: national accounts; poverty and living standards monitoring statistics;
business and industrial statistics; demographic and vital statistics; health statistics; education
statistics; employment statistics; agricultural and agriculture-related statistics; transportation
statistics; governance; and gender statistics. A special emphasis would be on improving data
processing and analysis to reduce the delays in dissemination and also to make more effective
use of data that are already collected. Modern database management technique has been
introduced to make it possible to use data from different sources and to produce statistical
products that are easier to access and use. In addition, a national statistical compendium of
terms, concepts, definitions and methods has been introduced into the national statistical
system. Modern methodology for statistical surveys, censuses and administrative record has
been introduced to support statistical development at the subnational level. During the project
much more statistical data would be disseminated in electronic form both on CD-ROM and
through the Internet. A formal data dissemination policy would be developed and
implemented, with provision for the release of suitably anonymized micro-level data sets for
further research and analysis.

(iv) Equipment, information technology and transport: This activity would support the
provision of necessary infrastructure including computer processing equipment (hardware)
and software for strengthening data collection, processing and analysis. Every effective
national statistical system needs a basic range of facilities and competencies, both tangible
and intangible. A lack of infrastructure would compromise the system’s capability of
achieving its objectives. The statistical agencies in Nigeria are handicapped in their

                                              [61] 
 
observance of accepted international standards for statistical infrastructure. This would
require all statistical and regulatory agencies to agree to cooperate and make joint efforts to
build statistical infrastructure. It would also involve the commitment by Government to
provide flexibility on the choice and use of technology and equipment for statistical purposes.
This would aim at providing computer facilities for survey processing; statistical application
software; and MIS systems for the statistical agencies.

Statistics at Sub-National Level:

14.    Support has also been provided to the Nigerian Statistical System with Trust Fund
support for a holistic assessment of the statistical system at the state level and the
development of State Level Statistical Master Plan (SSMP). The SSMP has been adopted
by all the states for implementation. However, the constraint is the funding for the
implementation which requires US$10.2 million equivalent per state over the next 3-5 years.

15.    For an effective coordination of the entire statistical system, the NBS has commenced
the preparation of the National Statistical Development Strategy (NSDS) with funds
provided by the African Development Bank.

     ANNEX 3: Detailed reviews of Nigeria and Rwanda experiences with the SRF-CF
Introduction

1.      As described in the Methodology section, owing to the short period covered by this
evaluation and the fact that only three country projects were under implementation when it
started, the assessment of the SRF’s objectives has relied on a number of different approaches
including in-depth discussion with the teams in charge of the preparation and implementation
of pilot projects as well as field visits to two of the three countries with relatively longer
implementation experience. The visits provided useful information on how the key
principles of the SRF approach work in a concrete country context, which was very helpful
to the Evaluation Team in getting better insights into the responses and comments drawn
from a larger population of respondents from the eight pilot countries. The field visits also
provided the opportunity for the Evaluation Team to refine the questionnaire and the
identification of responding groups for the survey.

NIGERIA
                a) Background

2.       The Nigeria Statistical System. Nigeria is a three-tiered federal state composed of
36 States and the Federal Capital Territory. Each state is made up of administrative units
called Local Governments. By the provisions of the Nigeria Constitution, government at each
level has the authority to produce its own statistics. In practice, most of the statistics are
produced by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which operates as the apex organization
and coordinator of the National Statistics System (NSS), the State Statistical Agencies
(SSAs) and line Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) both at the federal and state
levels. The NBS and Federal MDAs produce national statistics, while the SSAs and state-
level MDAs are in charge of statewide statistics. Other important producers of official
statistics include the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), responsible for financial statistics, and
the National Population Commission (NPoPC) which has formal responsibility for
population and demographic statistics, including carrying out population and housing
censuses, and operates at all three administrative tiers of the government. Given the federal
structure of governments in Nigeria, accurate population figures are important and politically
sensitive since they are used to determine budget allocations for and transfers to the States.

3.      The NBS was established by the Statistics Act of 2007 from the merger of the Federal
Office of Statistics and the National Data Bank. The National Strategy for the Development
of Statistics (NSDS) -which will be discussed in greater detail below- also promoted the
conversion of SSAs into State Bureau of Statistics (SBSs) to play the role of counterparts of
the NBS at the state level. In order to change the status of the agency, the State must have

                                                [63] 
 
passed their Statistics Edicts7. Overall coordination of the NSS is provided by the National
Consultative Committee on Statistics (NCCS), a forum where overall coordination,
development of statistical programs, and uniform standards and methodologies among the
various agencies are discussed and adopted by all producers of official statistics in Nigeria,
with a view to improving the quality, comparability and timeliness of statistical production.
All policy issues regarding statistics are managed by the National Statistics Board which was
established as the oversight body of the NSS and as the Steering Committee for statistical
development in Nigeria with the NBS as its secretariat.
4.       The National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS). In the course of
rebuilding the NSS, the Government prepared a five-year statistical strategic plan for 2010/11-
2014/15 which was developed in part with a grant from the World Bank’s Trust Fund for
Statistical Capacity Building and which aims at achieving the following strategic objectives:
       (i) creating the demand for the use of statistics at the state level through a focus on
           statistical communications;
       (ii) strengthening the national framework for data management and development
            through an emphasis on reforming the legal framework (especially at the state level);
            institutional restructuring of the MDAs; and streamlining the coordination
            arrangements;
       (iii) developing the necessary statistical framework and information technology (both
             hardware and software) with a focus on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness
             in data collection, processing and analysis, and their dissemination; and
       (iv) promoting the development and use of sound and well-accepted statistical techniques
            for data production and management across the entire NSS.
5.       The NSDS incorporates a generic State Statistical Master Plan (SSMP) for
strengthening the Nigeria NSS at sub-national levels. The strategy also envisages a Sectoral
Statistics Plan (SSP) targeting implementation of the NSDS at sectoral level. The latter is to
be done in phases; the first phase includes 16 Federal MDAs chosen on the basis of the volume
of their respective statistical activities and the relative significance of the content of the
mandate of each of the MDAs in national survival and development. The NSDS is expected
to be evaluated in the middle of next year.
6.     The SRF Project. The US$ 10 million three-year project became effective in June
2011 and implementation is expected to be completed by February 2014. The project’s main
components provide support to help to achieve the four strategic objectives of the NSDS as
described above with a focus on NBS and NPoPC at the federal level and six pilot states
(Anambra, Bauchi, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo states), one per geopolitical zone of the
Federation.

 The creation of the SBS is a key step in the reform of the state statistical systems. The former Director of the
State Statistical Agency will become the Statistician General of the state and serves as a counterpart of the
Federal Statistician General. To switch from an SSA to an SBS, all the states have to pass Statistical Edicts.
As of the time of the Evaluation Team’s visit to Nigeria (end-June 2013), 21 of the 36 states have passed the
Edicts and are on their way to creating SBSs.
                                                               [64] 
 
7.      Development partners. Eighteen development agencies8 are actively and directly
involved in statistical development activities in Nigeria with the World Bank playing the role
of lead donor.

                 b) Nigeria’s Experiences with the SRF Approach/Project

8.      Promotion of a system-wide approach to statistics at the country level. The
experiences of the two countries visited by the SRF evaluation mission reflect two startlingly
different systems which have a significant impact on coordination. Leaving aside differences
due to largely different geographical sizes and populations of the two countries, the top-down
structure of government in Rwanda has proven to facilitate coordination and the design and
implementation of a system-wide approach. In contrast, the three-tiered government
structure in Nigeria has made it much more challenging to achieve similar results.

9.      In spite of the above challenges, the design of the Nigeria SRF project which allocates
funding equally between NBS and NPoPC9 has been instrumental in incentivizing these two
major Statistics agencies to work together. In addition to this significant achievement given
that these two major statistics agencies were not effectively collaborating in the past, the SRF
evaluation mission observed signs of greater ownership of the statistics development
program at both the Federal and the Niger State levels. The difficulty of coordination is partly
due to the Federal structure of governments in Nigeria. For instance it was reported that
although the NBS is legally supposed to act as the overall coordinator on statistics matters
for Nigeria as a whole, control of the NBS on state-level administrations and ministries
remains confused in practice.

10.     The evaluation mission also met with the SRF Technical Committee which is chaired
by the Director of International Relations of the Federal Ministry of Finance and includes
representatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria, the National Planning Commission, the
Auditor General Office, the Accountant General Office, the Nigeria Statistical Association
and the two executing agencies of the SRF project, NBS and NPoPC. The interactions
between the various members of the Technical Committee reveal a number of useful insights
such as the complexities of coordination among various agencies in Nigeria where the
authority of the lead agency, in this case the Federal Ministry of Finance, cannot be taken for
granted. Based on the discussions during the meeting, the sharing of documents and other
information on the SRF project among the members of the Committee may need to be
improved although it is not clear whether this should be the role of the Ministry of Finance
or of the World Bank.

  In June 2012, changes were made at the top management level of NPoPC which have caused delays in the
implementation of the SRF project on the components managed by this agency. The new management of
NPoPC has also developed very ambitious plans for the Commission which has rendered more difficult recent
discussions between NPoPC and other partners involved in statistics, including with the World Bank staff
involved in the implementation of the SRF project. The recent resignation of the NPoPC chairperson will
likely lead to continued uncertainty in the near future.

11.     The situation in Niger State reflects a strong ownership of statistics at the state level
by all concerned including the Chairperson of the Board of the Niger State SBS (who was a
former Director-General of NBS), the Planning Commissioner, senior staff at the state-level
ministries of health and education as well as major statistics users including university
researchers and local media representatives. More specifically, all the state-level MDAs have
joined the State Consultative Committee on Statistics – SCCS, the state-level NCCS.

12.     Increasing resources for implementing NSDS. As can be seen in Table III.2,
allocations for investments have gone up sharply both for the NBS (from N290 million in
2011 to N 1 billion in 2013) and for the NPoPC (from N290 million in 2011 to N 1.5 billion
in 2013).

13.      The NBS is taking steps towards the creation of the Trust Fund for Statistics using a
similar trust fund arrangement in education as a model10. Development partners are also in
the early process of considering the creation of a basket fund for statistics. The World Bank
is currently preparing a new technical assistance project – with a notional amount of at least
$100 million for a 2-3 year project focusing on aligning existing methodologies to
international standards and on helping to build Nigeria’s capacity to produce and disseminate
statistics using the updated methodologies. This project is tentatively scheduled to become
effective in June 2014, shortly after the end of the current SRF project.
14.     In Niger State, the major developments in terms of resources have been the
establishment of a separate budget for the SBS; funding for statistics used to be allocated
through the Planning Commission. The dramatically increased budget for statistics has
jumped from N1 million to N52 million in the most recent year.
15.     Linking improvements in the statistical system to the needs of national and
sectoral monitoring frameworks. In spite of important progress, the impression of the SRF
evaluation mission is that more work needs to be done on advocacy and on helping to raise
awareness of the benefits of good data on the quality of economic policies. The challenges
of how to promote usage of data for economic planning and how to allay the general
skepticism of the public at large on economic and social data in Nigeria were a common
theme. Improving the regularity of the publication of key data together with the organization
of press conferences on the release of new information on the CPI and GDP have led to an
improved coverage of economic data in the local media. The evaluation mission was also

  The latest information is that the idea of a Statistics Trust Fund will require more time for reflection and
has been temporarily put on hold.
                                                                          [66] 
 
informed that earlier in the year, the MDG Office has commissioned a special study by the
NBS to cover more MDG specific data.

16.     In the Niger State Vision 3:2020 -- which aims to make of Niger State one of the top
three states in Nigeria by the year 2020 --, statistics play a very critical role. Using the model
of the Africa Peer Review Mechanism, senior political leaders of the State are considering
setting up a state peer review mechanism to learn from best practices amongst Nigerian states
in public finance, procurement practices, and statistics generation and dissemination. Senior
officials met by the SRF evaluation mission also shared their plans for funding social and
economic research in the State. The participation of the evaluation mission in a discussion
between senior officials at the state-level ministries of health and education and the State
Statistician General revealed the strong desire for the SBS to help with improving the quality
of statistics in health and education required for policy making. The regular publication of
key documents including the Niger State Statistical Yearbook, statistics on public finance,
education, manpower and agriculture to name a few have led to the sharply rising demand
for data.

17.     Promoting an improved national dialogue and partnership between users and
producers of statistics. The SRF has raised awareness and interest in statistics through a
number of important measures including: (i) the publication of a release calendar for the NBS
website; (ii) the dissemination of several publications; and (iii) the revamping of the NBS
website which includes a powerful data portal with data mapping features. As a result of
these measures, official statistics are now being mentioned in the media at an increasing rate;
notably a number of editorials in the largest national newspapers covered poverty data, GDP,
unemployment and inflation. A user satisfaction survey was conducted at the federal level
and in the 6 pilot states during the period of July to October 2011. The results of the survey,
collected during workshops, have been analyzed and are available. NBS has organized
journalist training with a focus on the interpretation of data, and a statistics user-producer
seminar. Users of statistics have worked together to compile their needs which have been
revised in December 2012 to be used as information to convey to the Federal level agencies
for information and increased support.

18.      The SRF project has also facilitated the conduct of 2 NCCS meetings. The NCCS is
the largest forum on statistics in Nigeria. It meets twice a year; every producer of official
statistics is invited to this meeting, and the way forward for the NSS is usually discussed at
this forum. During the last meeting in December 2012, two main achievements were noted:
(i) the adoption of the updated template for the State Statistical Yearbooks and (ii) a dialogue
with all stakeholders on the way forward with re-basing the GDP (current base year is 1990)
and GDP calculations for state and federal governments. The NSS is currently organizing
itself to be in a position to compute state-level GDP, following the conclusion of the dialogue
at the NCCS.
19.     In Minna, Niger State, the mission was able to get a first-hand exposure to the
workings of statistical development at the State level, including a very useful joint meeting
with the State Consultative Committee on Statistics (SCCS) chaired by the chairman of the
board, various board members, university researchers and the local media to go over the
internal dynamics on the development of statistics in Niger State, where rising demand for
data has led not only to the regular publication of key economic and social indicators but also

                                               [67] 
 
to a constant effort to improve the quality and coverage of data published by the SBS and
state-level MDAs. Meetings with the permanent secretaries of the Planning Commission, the
new officials of the ministries of health and education and the State Statistician General
provided the evaluation mission with first-hand exposure to the close and constructive
relationships on their respective roles in promoting both the reliance on and concerns for
timely and relevant data for economic planning and its implementation.
20.      Delivering more effective and efficient aid and technical assistance for
strengthening statistical systems. The development partners have established the Nigeria
Development Partners’ Statistics, Monitoring and Evaluation Group to maximize the impact
of their support in improving production and use of M&E and statistics in Nigeria. The newly
created forum provides for a unified dialogue with the Government and other Nigerian
partners, for sharing information, implementation progress reports and lessons on support for
statistics in Nigeria. The World Bank is the Chair and provides secretarial support with DfID
as the backup agency. The Group’s priority work plan for the 2012-14 period focuses on the
enhancement of the quality of data and their availability at the state level in four areas
considered as key to national development namely the national accounts, health, education
and agriculture. To this end, the Group will promote and support a better coordination among
the main producers of official statistics at federal level and state levels, the survey program
identified by NBS and NPoPC, as well as the M&E component of the Transformation
Agenda.
21.      The development partners have devised in early 2013 a joint support strategy to the
NBS Corporate Strategy Implementation Plan (CSIP) for 2013-201411, which covers three
main areas: (i) how to better use administrative data and survey programs to generate better
quality statistics, (ii) how to better align training programs with data production needs, and
(iii) how to improve the ICT strategy for better data production and dissemination. In spite
of these various efforts for more coordinated assistance in statistics, there remain concerns
that support by development partners on statistics, and particularly to the MDAs, is not
always in collaboration with the NBS, thereby rendering coordination of the NSS less than
effective.
22.      Impact of the in-country donor statistician (IDS) in helping to achieve the SRF
objectives. The multiplicity of national stakeholders involved in the implementation of the
SRF project both at the federal and state levels together with difficulties in travelling inside
the country -- in particular security concerns in addition to long distances between Abuja and
the six pilot states included in the SRF project -- have made the tasks of the IDS most
challenging. Discussions with other development partners in Nigeria brought up the critical
issue as to what should be the main role(s) of the IDS. The SRF-Catalytic Fund guidelines
on terms of reference for the IDS are very broad and cover: (a) coordination of national
agencies in charge of statistics; (b) coordination of development partners; (c) support for a
national partnership to promote and strategize statistics development in the country including
institutional reforms; and (d) provision of capacity development and technical assistance for
the implementation of the NSDS.


                                                            
11
  This is the first time that the NBS has developed such a strategy and shared it with its development partners
for information and eventual support. Given the limited resources coming from both the Government and
development partners, further prioritization of the strategy document’s Action Plan is needed.
                                                               [68] 
 
23.     In addition to the difficulties in allocating the IDS’s time to the various objectives
listed above, the need for hands-on support for a recipient country-executed project and in
the particular case of Nigeria where the IDS also plays the very important role of a ‘clearing
house’ for all data used in World Bank projects -- the World Bank portfolio in Nigeria of
approximately $5 billion is by far the largest in sub-Saharan Africa -- further complicated
the role of the IDS. Given the very broad tasks performed by the current IDS in Nigeria,
discussions by the evaluation mission with national stakeholders at both the Federal and State
levels revealed a high appreciation of the IDS’s roles.
24.      Discussions with all the current IDSs (Afghanistan, DRC, Ghana and Nigeria) reveal
a broad range of priority settings in their current day-to-day activities covering the three main
tasks which are project implementation, coordination and strategizing. In terms of office
arrangements, most IDSs are located in the local office of the lead agency which also finances
the IDSs – the World Bank for DRC and Nigeria and DfID for Afghanistan. In Ghana, the
IDS is financed by DfID but based at the local World Bank office. This arrangement has
helped to lighten the demand on the IDS’s time for regular office tasks such as project-related
activities and to allow the Ghana IDS to focus her work much more on coordination and
strategizing. Based on the assessment by the evaluation mission, the SRF guidelines may
need to be reviewed. For large countries, and more particularly federal systems such as
Nigeria and Ethiopia where states play an equally important role in the generation of data, it
may be worth considering having more than one IDS.
25.     Broad issues related to the SRF Charter. SRF-CF governance arrangements and
operational practices and procedures. The mission also met with the World Bank's
Country Director who shows a very strong support for statistics and has empowered the in-
country donor statistician to play an active role in decision meetings on various WB projects
in Nigeria with a focus on data. The Country Director for Nigeria highlighted the importance
of statistics as a key sector in the country assistance strategy than that the SRF has helped
raise the profile of statistics. She also mentioned that the development partners group in
Statistics is performing best among the various sectors in Nigeria.
