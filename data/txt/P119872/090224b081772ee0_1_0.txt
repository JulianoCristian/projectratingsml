                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the SRF-CF, is to initiate the implementation of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) by producing
                         reliable statistics in participating states: Anambra, Bauchi, Edo, Kaduna, Niger and Ondo states.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall project management is rated as moderately satisfactory. There are two teams, one in the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the other at the National Population
                         Commission (NPoPC), with clear responsibility for project coordination. Although the Bank team was regularly updated on progress of the project implementation, none of the
                         implementing agencies provided timely monthly and quarterly progress reports.

                         There has, overall, been slow progress on the 2011 work plan. While a number of key activities have been started, and there is evidence of progress under each component, there is

                         a lot less progress than would have been expected at this stage of the project. Discussion with the Project implementation teams indicated that slow disbursement has been a key
                         bottleneck, pointing to issues of delegation for signature at the Federal Project Financial Management Department (FPFMD). The Bank team discussed the issue with the FPFMD,
                         and concluded that the project teams have not been forthcoming with proper support documentation for requests for finances.

                         The mission and the Project Implementation teams concluded that FPFMD should provide implementing agencies and the Bank with (i) checklist of support documentation to be
                         provided and (ii) hierarchy of delegation
