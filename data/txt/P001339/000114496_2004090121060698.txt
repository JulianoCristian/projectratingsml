Minister of Finance 
Ministry of Finance

Nairobi, Kenya
Dear Sir:
Credit No. 2310-KE:  Health Rehabilitation Project Amendment to Development 
Credit Agreement
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement) for the Health 
Rehabilitation Project, dated December 11, 1991, between the Republic of Kenya (the 
Borrower) and the International Development Association (the Association), and to the 
Ministry’s letter dated April 14, 1998, requesting the Association toan amendment to 
the Agreement to adjust the disbursement percentage applicable to incremental 
operating costs, and correct a couple of other anomalies which have been noted in the 
previous amendment letter, dated November 26, 1997, in relation to Categories (2) and 
(3) of the disbursement table.
We are pleased to inform you that the Association accedes to your request and 
agrees, accordingly, to amend the Agreement by deleting the table in paragraph 1 of 
Schedule 1 thereto, and substituting therefor the table attached in the attachment to 
this letter.
This is to inform you of our agreement to your requests and to propose 
the following amendments to the Agreement:  The table in the first paragraph of 
Schedule 1 is amended to read as in the Attachment to this letter.
This incorporates the following changes: 
a)
Adjustment of the percentage of expenditures eligible for financing under 
Category 6 (Incremental Operational Costs) from 100% to 95%. 
b)
Correction of error in November 26, 1997, amendment which unintentionally 
redefined Category 3(b) to include only Part B of the project, instead of Parts B and 
C, and Category 3(c) to include Part C of the project, instead of Part D, thus 
rendering expenditures from Part D (Welfare Monitoring Component) ineligible for 
financing. 
c)
Correction of error in November 26, 1997, amendment which unintentionally 
reversed the previous amendment of November 19, 1996, which defined the percentage of 
expenditures eligible for financing under Category 2 (equipment, vehicles, materials 
and supplies for Parts A to D of the project) as “100% of foreign expenditures and 90% 
of local expenditures” instead of “100 of foreign expenditures and 100% of local 
expenditures (ex-factory cost).
Please confirm your agreement with the proposed amendment by signing, dating, 
and returning the enclosed copy of this letter.  The amendment shall be effective as 
of the date of your countersignaturethis letter.
Sincerely,
Harold E. Wackman
Country Director for Kenya
