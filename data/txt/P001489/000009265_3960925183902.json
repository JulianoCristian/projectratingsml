The Bank played a\n            positive role in the preparation of the project. On the\n            water supply side, the project was successful in addressing\n            deficiencies in water availability, tariff policy and\n            financial management. On the drainage and sanitation side\n            the bad performance of the local consulting firms recruited,\n            associated with the complexity of the Malagasy procurement\n            procedures, jeopardized the entire component which was\n            cancelled except for some urgent works. Nevertheless, the\n            drainage and sanitation works will be reactivated, combined\n            with flood control, under the Antananarivo Plain Development\n            Project. The review of the existing studies, carried out for\n            its preparation, led to major revisions and better\n            coordination between the various components of the project.\n            Concerning the Fivondronana, its deficiencies on the\n            financial and technical sides are being addressed under the\n            First Urban Project. The main lessons to be learned are the\n            necessity to have the final design available at appraisal,\n            as it is done now, and not to accept the recruitment of\n            local consultants if their experience and competence are not\n            clearly established."}, "docdt": "1989-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
