          project are: to increase access to treated water for the\n            Antananarivo urban population and to improve sanitation\n            conditions in the city area, thereby reducing health hazards\n            to assist the beneficiary institutions to renew and\n            modernize their facilities, improve the reliability and\n            efficiency of their services and operations and strengthen\n            their financial management. The project components are: (a)\n            construction of water production works and transmission\n            mains; extension and reinforcement of the water distribution\n            system (reservoirs, pipes, booster station) and supply of\n            heavy maintenance equipment; (b) construction of drainage\n            collectors, a pumping station, river dikes, 10 storage\n            basins and canals and dredging of an existing canal; (c)\n            construction of a sewerage collecting system, a pumping\n            station, pumping discharge mains and pilot stabilization\n            ponds; (d) construction of collective dumping containers;\n            purchase of collection trucks and maintenance equipment and\n            upgrading of an experimental composting facility to produce\n            10,000 tons of compost annually; (e) training for JIRAMA\n            staff and sanitation staff."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
