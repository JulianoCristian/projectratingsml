I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
Country Background
2
1.01      Madagascar is an island of 590,000 km  located in the Indian Ocean
off the southeast coast of Africa. It enjoys a greatly varied climate because
of differences in altitude.
1.02      The population was about 8.0 million in 1977.  From 1971 to 1976,
the average population growth rate was 2.5% p.a. It is estimated that the
population will increase at about 2.9% p.a. between now and the year 2000,
when it will reach 15.5 million.
1.03      The countrq  is sparsely populated with an average density of approx-
imately 14 inhab./km . The population is mainly concentrated in the highlands
between Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa, where the density is over 50 inhab./km
The urban population, located in towns of around 2,000 inhabitants and over,
amounts to 18% of the total population. Its rate of growth is around 6%
p.a., or about twice the national average, partly due to rural centers growing
beyond the 2,000 limit and being classified as urban.  Antananarivo, the
capital, is by far the largest center in the country with more than 600,000
people.
1.04      Madagascar's gross national product (GNP) per capita was $240 in
1977. To a very large extent the Malagasy economy is based on agriculture
which accounts for 40% of its GNP and 80% of its exports.
1.05      The latest statistics 1/ show that in 1974 over 30% of the child
mortality up to the age of 4 was due to intestinal diseases. Overall
infantile mortality was 102 per thousand, which is high compared to Europe
(20 per thousand) or North America (15 per thousand). The number of cases
of enteric diseases recorded each year is of the order of 8% of the total
population.
Water Resources
1.06      The amount and frequency of rainfall vary from region to region.
The eastern plains and low hills receive more than 1,500 mm of rainfall
annually, fairly well spread throughout the year. In the highlands, where
there is one dry and one humid season, rainfall is 1,000 mm.  In the plains
and tablelands of the west and northwest the dry season is long, but rainfall
is still over 800 mm. The southwestern part of the country has an arid
climate with an annual rainfall of only 300 to 700 mm.

1.07      The longest rivers run west and have periods of very low flow.
In peak flows they carry a great deal of suspended material (laterite usually).
The eastern rivers are short, with a more regular flow. Because of the steep
slopes and deforestation, floods can be severe. Rivers in the south and
southwest have intermittent flows.
1.08      Underground water is substantial in the porous sedimentary forma-
tions of the west. There are numerous small sources in the laterite regions,
in alluvial valleys and in dunes on the coast. The southern tip lacks under-
ground water.
Sector Organization
1.09      Many governnental agencies are involved in the sector.  The Direc-
torate of Industry and Mines (Ministry of Economy and Commerce) is responsible
through its Energy Department for developing policy for water supply, assess-
ing water resources and providing generai guidance to water supply under-
takings. The Directorate of Urbanism and Habitat (DUH) of the Ministry of
Public Works is responsible for elaborating master plans for sanitation
(sewerage, drainage and solid wastes) and implementing the construction of new
facilities. The Directorate of Rural Engineering, and the Waters and Forestry
Department of the Ministry of Rural Development are involved in rural water
supply, irrigation and river protection. The Department of Health and Popula-
tion (Ministry of Interior) is responsible for overseeing health aspects of
the sector.
1.10      Practically all water abstraction has to be authorized by the
Goverment. Legal arrangements for control of water pollution need to be
completed. Minor legal arrangements need to be made concerning water quality
standards, protection of water sources for domestic consumption, and standards
relating to discharges of effluents.
1.11      In 1976, JIRAMA 1/ was established as a totally governnent-owned
enterprise to construct and operate power and water facilities throughout
the country. It took over the water operations of (a) a private company
(Electricité et Eau de Madagascar, EEM) operating in four cities including
Tananarive, (b) some municipally operated entities (régies communales) and
(c) all urban water schemes owned by "Gérance Nationale de l'Eau" and operated
by a company (Société d'Energie de Madagascar, SEI) which was half owned by
the Government. Presently JIRAMA owns and operates all urban water supply
systems except a few municipally operated entities which it will take over
within a few years.
1.12      Although according to the legislation JIRAMA is responsible for
all water supply systems in the country, in practice it has not up to now
been involved in rural water supply. The Ministry of Rural Development,
through its rural engineering departments in each province, and some religious
institutions (Church World Service, Catholic Relief Service) are active in
rural water supply. Although not urgent, a study is required to determine the
1/   JIRAMA - Jiro Sy Rano Malagasy, which means Power and Water of Madagascar.



most appropriate organization and the long-term development program for the
rural water supply sector. The Bank has offered to assist with such a study
through the IBRD/WHO Cooperative Program. The Government has requested that
the study be deferred until after the end of 1980 when implementation of its
decentralization policy is more advanced.
1.13      Operation and maintenance of sewerage, drainage and solid waste
facilities are the responsibility of the local authorities which have recently
been decentralized. New works are handed over to the local authorities
which do not have sufficient funds to operate and maintain them, but in the
future will get appropriate budgetary allocations (para 6.13).
Present Service Levels and Tariffs
1.14      The urban population of about 1.46 million is slightly better served
than the average urban population in Africa: 71% (1,037,000) are supplied with
treated water (one third through private connections, two thirds, which is
high, through public standpipes and laundries), 10% are supplied through low
standard water supply systems (with neither treatment nor disinfection,
providing low per capita supply - 20 to 30 lcd) and 19% have no public supply.
In 1975, 25% of the urban population, or 365,000 people, were in the urban
poverty group. They either were supplied from public standpipes and low
standard systems or had no public supply. Standards of service are generally
higher in larger towns than in smaller towns.
1.15      The rural population of about 6.5 million is also slightly better
served than the average rural population in Africa: 16% are supplied with
piped water.
1.16      Only 3% of the urban population is served through public sewers
and the rest is served through individual sanitary facilities or not at all.
Although in the highlands and in most of the western part of the country
individual facilities are in common use, their incidence diminishes with
the size of the community and disappears almost entirely in other regions
(except in the larger towns). Lack of adequate waste disposal arrangements
often combined with inadequate protection of the water source in small com-
munities means that waterborne parasitic diseases spread freely.
1.17      All water connections in the systems operated by JIRAMA are metered
and charges are based on metered use. JIRAMA submits the bills and makes
the collections. In the case of private connections, the customer pays.
The water consumed through public standposts and laundries is billed to
and paid for by the municipalities (water wastage is limited in these facil-
ities by shutting off the water after business hou5s). The 1979 water
tariffs of JIRAMA are low (about 34 FMG = 16 USe/m i.e. 61 USc/1,000 gallons
on average)l/ and are about 88% of the tariffs which would just cover oper-
1/ Water tariffs for some other East African countries, in U.S. cents per
m are: Gaborone-Botswana 39; Mombasa-Kenya 48; Nairobi-Kenya 42;
Lesotho 38; Blantyre-Malawi 29; Mogadishu-Somalia 32; Sudan 40; Swaziland
32; Zaire 45. Corresponding figures in U.S. cents per thousand gallons
are: Gaborone-Botswana 148; Mombasa-Kenya 182; Nairobi Kenya 160;
Lesotho 144; Blantyre-Malawi 110; Mogodishu-Somalia 122; Sudan 151,
Swaziland 122; Zaire 170.

ating expenses and depreciîtion (para. 6.05). They are slightly lower in the
former EEM areas (32 FMG/m ) than in the rest of the country.
1.18      Sewerage, drainage and other sanitatioa services are paid for
through local taxes (usually property taxes). The costs of certain special
services such as cesspool emptying and use of public lavatories are partially
recovered through the payment of small fees by the users. In Antananarivo,
it is planned to increase the total sanitation revenues by increasing the
rate of a surtax on all water consumed presently collected by JIRAMA on behalf
of the local authority. (para. 6.14).
Sector Obiectives
1.19      The Government has set very general national objectives for water
supply, with no time horizon. 1/ They are: (a) study of the means of pro-
viding a satisfactory water supply to the entire population; (b) gradual
construction of schemes aimed at serving the whole population; (c) standard-
ization of the terms (especially tariffs) on which people are supplied;
(d) financial viability of water supply entities and (e) recovery of costs
for all water supplied. Water delivered through public standposts is to
be paid for by the communities. (It is compulsory for local authorities
and administrative services to earmark funds for their water bills.) In
another document 2/ the Government states that it expects by 2000 all house-
holds will have easy access to a vater supply.
1.20      Other objectives were proposed in a UNDP/WHO report 3/ completed in
1975 and accepted by the Government. This report provides a master plan and
feasibility and design studies for the Antananarivo area and recommends an
immediate works program, a series of five-year programs for water supply and a
series of seven-year programs for sewerage and drainage. The immediate works
program for water supply and minor portions of the first phase program are now
in progress.
1.21      The same report recommends for the remaining urban areas of the
country that for water supply the first priority should be to provide dis-
ïnfection facilities for the existing systems. For excreta disposal, prior-
ity should be given to protecting the water sources of urban areas without
a public water supply system and to educating the public regarding the hazards
of unsatisfactory methods of disposal of human wastes.
Sector Development
1,22      US$9 million equivalent was invested in water supply in the first five-
year plan period (1964-1969) by the Government and one of JIRAMA's predecessors

with the help of grants and loans from France and the USA; little investment
was made during the 1969-77 period. JIRAMA intends to spend $49 million in
its 1977-1984 water supply investment program, to be distributed as follows:
44% in the Antananarivo region, 46% in existing systems in the rest of the
country and 10% to serve localities not yet supplied (two new localities per
year). This program appears reasonable considering the special needs of the
Antananarivo area where one third of the urban population of the country
lives. As JIRAMA is a new institution, a more precise and more justifiable
long-term program has not yet been worked out. Agreement was reached that
JIRAMA will set up a long-term development program for water supply in the
urban areas by June 30, 1981. For water supply in rural areas, a sector study
is planned to be carried out by the Malagasy Government after the end of 1980
when the Bank offer of assistance will be repeated (para 1.12).
Sector Constraints
1.23      On the water supply side, the major constraint is financial. Water
tariffs are currently inadequate to meet operating expenses including depre-
ciation and will have to be increased (paras 1.17 and 6.05).
1.24      On the sanitation side, the major constraints are staff and finan-
cial arrangements. The existing capabilities within the local authorities
for operating the sanitation systems are now inadequate and need to be sub-
stantially strengthened by hiring higher caliber staff (para 5.09) and setting
up training programs for the existing staff (para 3.10). Financial arrange-
ments are inadequate (para 6.12). To permit sound financial management, the
resources allocated to sanitation should be related to recurrent and investment
needs (para 6.14).
Il. POPULATION, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT AREA
Location - Special Features
2.01      The project area comprises the Fivondronana of Antananarivo (the
capital city) and its suburbs. The Fivondronana consists of two former
municipalities (Tananarive and Ambohimanarina) covering 8,000 ha: 3,000 ha of
plains in the west and 5,000 ha of hilly areas in the east. The suburbs
outside the Fivondronana comprise 12 former rural communities. 1/
2.02      The Antananarivo region consists of a range of hills where most of
the urban development has taken place and an alluvial, mainly agricultural
plain. The plain covers 20,000 ha, is almost flat, consists mainly of rice-
fields and is drained by the Ikopa river, its tributaries and a network of
man-made canals. However, drainage to the north is limited by the rocky areas
of Bevomanga and Farahantsana falls. The rivers have been dyked to limit
flooding and to protect the city during the wet cyclone season (December
through February) when the water level in the rivers is higher than the level
of the plain. These features create special problems:

divoribe, Fenoarivo, Itaosy, Ambohitrimanjaka, Ambohidratrimo, Ante-
hiroka-Ivato, Ampitatafika.

(a) difficulty in draining the low area of the city during
the rainy and high flow season, which results in yearly
flooding when heavy rains fall inside the city limits;
(b) difficulty in disposing of sewage by gravity alone; and
(c) less frequent but more dangerous flooding of the low
areas of the city and the surrounding agricultural plain
caused by water spilling over the river dykes (the Ikopa
river mainly) or through breaches in the dykes.
Existing Water Supply and Sanitation Systems
2.03      The Antananarivo water supply system is described in Annex 2.1.
Water is drawn from the small lake of Mandroseza in the south, which is fed
by a pumping station on the Ikopa river upstream from the city and thus is
protected from urban pollution. A production plant on the lake consists of a
raw water pumping station, a rapid sand filtration plant and a treated water
pumping station, from which rising mains feed the main reservoirs located in
the city hills. Storage capacities total 53% of average daily production.
All the city and several communities in the suburbs are already served.
However, parts of the water supply system need strengthening to meet the
present water demand. High pressure zones supply high or remote areas; they
require the use of booster stations. Existing facilities are generally in
good condition. However, the low mineralization of the water source makes it
difficult to adjust water acidity. This creates moderate problems and some
old portions of cast-iron pipes which are heavily incrusted need to be re-
placed.
2.04      In Antananarivo the public sewerage system (Annex 2.2) is fairly
old and does not cover all the populated areas.  It is not properly main-
tained and the sewage pumping stations are often out of order.
2.05      Sewage and storm water are collected mainly by a combined system.
Only a few new urban developments in the plain are served through separate
systems; they total only 10% of the area served by the existing facil-
ities. The combined system which serves the hills differs from that serving
the plain. The hills are served through an urban-type system of pipes while
the plain is served mainly through a rural-type system of canals. Practically
all the hill area system flows into the plain system, but the system serving
the hills is capable of discharging much greater quantities than the plain
system can carry. Consequently, the town's low areas are flooded during the
rainy season. The system in the plain includes canals with very low slopes,
and sometimes no outlets. Canals are badly maintained and in some populated
areas garbage is illegally dumped into them. The most important, the Andrian-
tany canal, serves the dual purpose of irrigation and drainage. This poses a
problem at the beginning of the rainy season (November-December) when ricefield
irrigation is still needed. When the water is at a high level in the canals,
it flows back into the rainstorm collectors where sludge settles and over
an extended period of time deposits build up inside the collectors.
2.06      The present collection of solid wastes in the city (Annex 2.2)
meets about 90% of the needs. The total capacity of private and collective
containers throughout the city is inadequate. Wastes are dumped on a land-

fill 9 km from the city but the dumping is not carried out properly. Man-
agement capabilities need to be upgraded and heavy maintenance equipment
needs to be reinforced.
Population Served and Standards of Service
2.07      In 1975, the Antananarivo area had a population of 635,000 of
which 452,000 were living in the Fivondronana and 183,000 in the suburbs. The
proportion of the population which may be classified as urban poor (per
capita income of $110 (1975) or less a year) is 27%, or 172,000 people, for
the urban area as a whole (19%, or 86,000 people, in the Fivondronana and 47%,
or 86,000 people, in the suburbs) 1/.
2.08      In 1975, 75% of the population of the Antananarivo area were served
by public water supplies, 17% through private connections and 58% through
public standposts. The remaining 25% were not supplied with public water.
The whole population living in the Fivondronana, including the urban poor,
were served, but about 87%, or 159,000 people (including the 86,000 poor) in
the suburbs lacked satisfactory access to a safe water supply. For those
served, water was supplied through 20,500 private connections and 500 public
standposts.  Average domestic consumption of the population served was low:
38 lcd (25 lcd for people served through public standposts and 80 lcd for
people served through private connections). Overall consumption (including
industry, government, and unaccoun5ed for water) of the population served was
only 102 lcd. Out of the 43,500 m /day consumed on average in 1975, 20% was
consumed by domestic consumers with private connections, 22% by domestic
consumers served from public standposts, 30% by industry and commerce, 20% by
government, and 8% by municipalities. The estimated percentage of water
losses (leaks, metering defaults, and fraud) is low (11% of water produced).
Water used for washing streets and reservoirs, flushing sewers and water mains
and water used by the Fire Department is not included in this percentage; it
is estimated by JIRAMA and billed to the Fivondronana.
2.09      As far as sewerage is concerned, although 62% of the population
of the Fivondronana lives in areas with a waterborne sewerage system, only
about 15% of the water consumed is collected by this system. This is because
although household sullage from nearly all the houses in these areas is
discharged into the public system, many houses still use individual systems
for exereta disposal. In areas not covered by waterborne sewers, individual
systems of varying degrees of sophistication are used.
Population Projections
2.10      The population of the Fivondronana is expected to reach 525,000 by
1980, and 700,000 by 1990, with population growth decreasing from 3% in 1975
to 2.5% in 1990. The population of the suburbs is expected to reach 220,000
by 1980, and 325,000 by 1990, with the population growth increasing from 3.75%
in 1975 to 3.9% in 1990. In total, the population of the Antananarivo area
1/   Information deduced from WHO/OTH study - Livre III - Etude Socioeconomi-
que, Chapter I.



is expected to reach 745,000 by 1980, and 1,025,000 by 1990, with an average
growth rate of 3.25%. 1/
Demand for Water Supply
2.11      In the project area, reasonable targets have been set.  In the
Fivondronanà the entire population would continue to be served either by
private connections or by public standposts. In the suburbs, by 1985, all
centers of more than 1,000 people would be served, i.e. 30% of the total
suburban population would be supplied compared to 13% in 1975 (para. 2.08);
and by 2000 all centers of more than 500 people would be served, i.e. 80% of
the total suburban population.
2.12      Key indicators relative to domestic demand are expected to develop
as follows:
1978  1986  1990  2000
Percentage of people served thru private connections            18    24    27    46
Percentage of people served thru public standposts              58    57    56    47
Per capita consumption for private connections (lcd)            83    97   104   122
Per capita consumption for public standposts (lcd)              28    33    35    40
2.13      Government facilities now consume 20% of total consumption.  As they
are presently well served, it is expected that this percentage will progres-
sively decrease to less than 10% in 2000. The consumption of the municipalities
(public standposts excluded) has been 8% of the total consumption for a number
of years. It is expected that this percentage will remain the same in the
future.
2.14      Total water demand is expected to increase as follows:
3
Demand in m /day                           1978     1986      1990      2000
Domestic (including standposts)          22,500   39,600   49,000   104,000
Industry and commerce                    17,300   28,400   34,000    59,000
Government                               14,200   20,000   23,000    37,000
Total demand at distribution level       54,000   88,000  106,000   200,000
Total demand at production level         60,000   97,000  117,000   220,000
Peak day water demand                    68,000  110,000  133,000   250,000
2.15      The investment program needed to satisfy this demand is realistic
and attainable but would imply increases in water tariffs (paras. 6.05 and
6.07). The program would be implemented in several stages. The capaci5y of
the treatment facilities is now being hncreased from 60,000 to 85,000 m /day
and construction of a further 25,000 m /day extension to be started in 1983
would allow the peak day demand to be met up to 1986. Works to be constructed
under the proposed project would increase the capacity of production facilities

ses of development were considered. The intermediate development has been
retained for the water supply and sanitation master plans.



other than treatment (mainly pumping facilities) in order to meet the 1986
demand. They would also increase the capacity of transmission lines and of
the distribution system in order to deliver the additional water to the
consumers. During the 1979-1986 period, about 200,000 additional people would
be served; the level of service to domestie consumers would be improved with
average domestic consumption per capita increasing from about 42 lcd to the
still modest figure of 53 lcd. The project would also meet the needs of
industry, commerce and governiment whose daily water demand would increase
by about 17,000 m by 1986.
Demand for Sewerage and Drainage Facilities
2.16      To assess the sewerage needs, the daily flows of waste water produced
in the project area over the years up to the horizon 2000 have been estimated.
However, collection of waste water through a public sewer system could reason-
ably be envisaged only in certain parts of the project area. In those parts
of the hilly areas where population density is lower than 150 inhabitants per
hectare, individual systems of waste water disposal`would still be used. A
master plan for the public sewerage system has been designed for the horizon
2000 to determine how the existing system should be developed. For technical
as well as financial reasons the program of development has to be implemented
in several stages, the first of which would be implemented under the proposed
project. The proposed project would mainly extend the existing public sewer
system in the center of the city where the population density is high and
where improvement of the sanitary conditions of the area is urgent. It would
also reduce the pollution of the main canal which crosses the western part of
the city center.  rhe amount of sewage collected and disposed of would increase
from about 8,000 m /day presently to about 18,000 m /day in 1984 after con-
struction of the project. At this date the ratio of sewage collected to water
consumed would reach the still very modest figure of about 23%.
2.17      To assess the needs for drainage facilities, several factors have
been considered: intensity and duration of rainfall, slopes and impervious-
ness of the ground, population density and economic activity in the different
quarters of the project area. Drainage facilities, mainly collectors, have
been sized according to different standards of service, depending on the
gravity of the risks involved for the urban areas when exceptional rainfall
overflows the facilities. On this basis a master plan for the drainage system
has been designed for the horizon 2000 to determine how to develop the exist-
ing system described in Annex 2.2. The development program would be imple-
mented in several stages. The first stage, which would meet the most urgent
needs, would be implemented under the proposed project. The proposed project
would reduce the frequency of floods in the low areas of the town and thus
lessen damage to roads and dwellings, increase the amount of building land,
and reduce illness, death hazards and the loss of crops (200 ha of ricefields
are generally flooded each year), farm produce and working hours due to traffic
congestion.
Demand for Solid Wastes Services
2.18      Demand for solid wastes services has been assessed for the next six
year period only, as the type of investment needed for this subsector is not



- 10 -
"lumpy". In 1984, 180 tons of solid wastes per day would need t3 be collected.
This would imply a total capacity of garbage containers of 400 m . Taking
into account the existing facilities (see Annex 2.2), provision of additional
collective dumping containers, trucks and heavy maintenance equipment and
improvement of the sanitary conditions of the present dumping site are needed.
This would be provided under the proposed project (see Annex 3.1).
III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      During the years 1971 to 1975, master plan and feasibility studies
for the water supply and sewerage sector in Antananarivo were financed by
UNDP, with WHO as executing agency and the French consulting firm OTH 1/
as subcontractor (para. 1.20). The studies also included an urban water
supply and sanitation sector study for the whole country. The Bank formally
expressed "special interest" in the studies in 1971 and kept close contact
with the work. A number of Bank missions to Antananarivo at the time helped
influence the direction of the studies. In December 1976, the Government
formally requested that the Bank include the Antananarivo water supply and
sanitation project in its lending program. Because of the reorganization of
the local authorities and the need to complete the project preparation, field
appraisal of the project was delayed until July 1978.
Objectives
3.02      The project would:  (a) improve and develop the existing water
supply, sewerage, drainage and solid waste facilities in the Antananarivo
area; (b) strengthen the institutions, especially in the sanitation sub-
sector, in order to attain proper standards of operation and maintenance;
(c) assist the Government in developing appropriate cost recovery policies
and (d) require the Government to prepare a more precise long-term development
program for urban water supply from which a sector lending strategy could be
devised. A similar program for rural water supply is to be prepared in due
course.
3.03      The project has four physical components.  The water supply component
would meet the water demand of the Antananarivo Fivondronana and of all suburban
communities with a population over 1,000 up to 1986. Service standards would
be modest as 60% of the population would be served through public facilities
(standposts, laundries and lavatories). The remaining three components relate
only to the Fivondronana. The drainage component would notably reduce the
frequency of floods in the low areas of the town caused by rainstorms and
would substantially reduce the risk of city floods caused by intruding water
(para. 2.02). The sewerage component, although modest in size, would complete
the sewerage facilities in the densely populated quarters of the city center
where the situation is most critical. It would reduce the pollution of
a canal which crosses the heavily populated and poor areas of the town. The
1/   Omnium technique OTH.



- il -
solid wastes component would improve the conditions of refuse collection and
remedy deficiencies in current disposal arrangements. It would meet the
needs of the community up to 1984.
Description
3.04      The project which has six components:  water supply, drainage,
sewerage, solid wastes, training of water supply staff and training of sani-
tation staff, is described in detail in Annex 3.1.
3.05      The water supply component includes construction of minor additions
to water production works, about 17 km of transmission lines, about 1.8 km of
pipelines to supply suburban communities, extension and reinforcement of the
water distribution system (reservoirs, pipes, booster station), (map IBRD
13935R1) and supply of heavy equipment for maintenance. It does not include
construction of the additional standposts which are needed to supply new
consumer. Standposts were in the past, and would continue in the future, to
be built by the Fivondronana.   Agreement was reached that additional stand-
posts in adequate numbers would be built by the Fivondronana during the
1980-1984 period.
3.06      The drainage component includes construction of drainage collectors,
a pumping station, river dykes, 10 storage basins covering a total of 110 ha,
a new drainage canal of over 3 km, dredging of an existing canal over 10 km în
length and rerouting of an irrigation canal (map IBRD 13937).
3.07      The sewerage component includes construction of sewage collec-
tors and reticulation, a pumping station, pumping discharge mains and pilot
stabilization ponds (map IBRD 13936).
3.08      The solid wastes component consists of the construction of 560
collective dumping containers, the supply of 19 collection trucks and of
heavy equipment to upgrade and properly maintain the existing dumping site,
and the improvement of an experimental composting facility which would be
able to produce 10,000 tons of compost per year.
3.09      The traiaing component for water supply staff consists of a con-
tribution to the financing of a training program for JIRAMA. JIRAMA has
recently submitted to IDA a five-year training program which involves all
categories of staff in both the electricity and water supply operations. Part
of the program which emphasizes the training of electricity staff is financed
under Credit 817-MAG (the Andekaleka power project). It is proposed under the
present project to finance the remaining part of the program, which emphasizes
training of water supply staff. The training component under the present
project would include a contribution of 30% to the cost of extending the
JIRAMA training center in Antananarivo (construction of classrooms, workshops,
stores, administrative offices and dormitories, teaching equipment and equipment
related to administrative and social facilities). Also included in the
component are the costs associated with overseas training of selected JIRAMA
trainers and upgrading senior administrative and technical staff (air transport,
tuition fees and living expenses abroad, and salaries during the training



- 12 -
pe-iod) and the operating costs of the JIRAMA training center during the
1980-1984 period and attributable to the training and upgrading of medium and
lower level water supply staff. JIRAMA has worked with the assistance of
Electricite de France on detailing the training program, which is expected to
be ready in February 1980.
3.10      The training component for sanitation staff includes the supply of
training equipment, the costs associated with overseas training of higher
level staff (same types of costs as mentioned above) and the costs associated
with local training of lower level staff (fees of local training institutions
and staff salaries during the training period).
Cost Estimates
3.11      The estimated total cost of the project is FMG 7.08 billion (US$33.7
million) with foreign exchange costs equivalent to about US$14 million. The
cost estimates are summarized below:

3.12      The base cost estimates are expressed in January 1, 1980  prices.
They are based on data given in the UNDP/WHO study (para. 3.01), updated and
adjusted by JIRAMA, the Ministry of Public Works and the Fivondronana and
reviewed by the appraisal mission. An allowance of 12% of the costs of civil
works and equipment has been made for engineering costs; they are given
mainly in local costs as the engineering studies would be carried out mainly
by local people. The foreign exchange component of about US$70,000 for
engineering base costs is equivalent to about 10 man-months of expatriates
cooperating with local firms.
3.13      Physical contingencies of 12% have been added to the base costs
of civil works, equipment and land acquisition, and physical contingencies
of 10% have been added to the costs of training.
3.14      Price contingency allowances totaling 15.7% of the total base cost
of the project plus physical contingencies have been included in the cost
estimate. They are based on the following annual inflation rates estimated by
the mission on the basis of statistics on similar works obtained from the
Ministry of Public Works and reflect a weighted average of estimates of price
increases for foreign and local costs.

3.15      Materials and equipment imported directly for the project will be
exempt from customs duties and import taxes. However, customs duties and
taxes would be paid on supplies purchased by contractors on the local market.
Costs for sanitation components (drainage, sewerage, solid wastes and training
for sanitation staff) include a value added tax (VAT) of 10% which the Fivon-
dronana would not be able to recover as it does not collect any VAT. On the
other hand, VAT has not been included in the costs of the water supply compo-
nent as JIRAMA would be able to recover it directly from Government as a
deduction from its VAT collection. In total, the customs duties and other

taxes included in the project costs amount to about US$3.2 million, i.e.
9.5% of the total project cost.

3.17      The proposed IDA Credit of US$20.5 million would finance about 67%
of project costs net of taxes. It would cover 100% of the foreign cost
component (US$14 million) and about 39% (US$6.5 million) of the net of taxes
local cost component. It would not finance work carried out on force account
by JIRAMA (laying pipes and normal electrical equipment - see para. 3.28),
land acquisition, taxes and duties.

3.19      Qualified JIRAMA staff would complete the detailed engineering that
they have already started and supervise the construction of the water supply
component without external assistance, except for calculations relative to the
stability of the works which would be verified by a specialized affiliate of a
French bureau (SOCOTEC). On completion, the works would be subject to approval
by representatives of the Ministry which supervises JIRAMA.
3.20      JIRAMA staff would for the first time prepare tender documents,
tender evaluation reports and contracts, and supervise works in accordance
with World Bank procedures without the assistance of outside consultants.
Although inexperience would probably cause delays in implementing the project,
it is expected that such delays would be within reasonable limits and corre-
sponding allowance has been made in the project implementation schedule (Annex
3.3).
3.21      The Directorate of Urbanism and Habitat (DUH) of the Ministry of
Public Works would administer the drainage and sewerage components and act as
project manager and to some extent as engineer. DUH is being assisted by
local engineering consultants for detailed design and the preparation of
tenders for the more sophisticated part of the works (pumping stations,
rerouting of an irrigation canal, drainage canals, storage basins in the east
valley, pilot stabilization ponds and a tertiary collection system for sewage).
This represents 67% of the total drainage and sewerage components. DUH would
itself carry out the detailed engineering and the preparation of tenders for
the simplest part of the works (river dykes, storage basins, dredging of an
existing canal and the sewage collectors). It would prepare the tender
evaluation reports and supervise the construction of all parts of the works.
DUH staff have limited experience in detailed design, preparation of tender
documents, evaluation of tenders and supervision of construction and have no
experience of preparing tender documents according to Bank procedures. The
benefits of allowing DUH staff to carry out part of the engineering work
outweigh the limited risks involved (para. 4.14). Agreement was reached that
DUH will periodically review the effectiveness of these arrangements with the
Bank so that appropriate adjustments or changes, as mutually agreed, could be
quickly initiated.
3.22      The solid wastes component and the sanitation staff training com-
ponent would be administered by the Fivondronana of Antananarivo through
its Technical Department. The Fivondronana is using a local engineering
consultant to carry out the detailed engineering for the improvement of
the composting facility. The reinforcement of the Fivondronana Sanitation
Division (para. 5.09) would help the existing staff in administering the
project. A training officer has been recruited specifically to implement the
training component.
3.23      Retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 is proposed to cover the
foreign exchange costs of engineering consultancy services equivalent to about
13 man-months after January 1, 1980. Some local engineering firms are able
to obtain good outside assistance from foreign parent companies. The choice
of consultants, their terms of reference and terms and conditions of employ-
ment would be subject to prior approval from IDA.

3.24      An implementation schedule for design, procurement and construction
of the project is shown in Annex 3.3. Tenders for supply of pipes and equip-
ment and for construction of civil works for water supply would be invited
from March to September 1980 and awarded from August to December 1980.
Contracts for supply of equipment and for construction of civil works for
sewerage and drainage would be invited in August 1980 and awarded in January
1981. If the schedule is adhered to, the new installations should be in
operation by July 1983. However, various kinds of problems (transportation,
inexperience of local engineers in dealing with Bank procedures, etc.) may
lengthen the design and construction period and an allowance has been made for
a delay of six months in the commissioning date of the facilities.   Construc-
tion of the project should be completed at the end of December 1983,except for
some minor items which may still be outstanding. Consequently, the project
completion date is set as the end of December 1984. This extended construc-
tion period has been taken into account in the cost estimates and the disburse-
ment schedule.
Procurement
3.25      Construction of works for the water supply component ($10.2 million)
would involve three subdivisions: (a) supply of pipes, valves and fittings;
(b) supply of electromechanical equipment; and (c) civil works. The latter
may be subdivided into several contracts corresponding to the different work
sites.
3.26      Construction of works for the drainage and sewerage components
($17.8 million) would involve three subdivisions: (a) supply, transportation
and installation of electromechanical equipment; (b) supply and laying of
sewerage mains; and (c) other civil works.
3.27      The solid wastes component would involve several small contracts
for civil works (phased construction of collective dumping bins and composting
facilities) and for equipment supply (plastic bins, vehicles, maintenance
and composting equipment).
3.28      Water pipes would be laid and normal electromechanical equip-
ment for water supply would be installed by JIRAMA on force account through
its Water Distribution Department and its Electromechanical Department (New
Works Division). JIRAMA has successfully carried out this kind of work
with its own qualified staff. This force account work would not be financed
by the credit. All other work would be carried out under contract. All
contracts above $100,000 would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank/IDA guidelines on procurement.
Contracts under $100,000 would be awarded in accordance with local procedures
which are acceptable to IDA. Total expenditures under such contracts would
not exceed $400,000 for the water supply component and $500,000 for the
sanitation components without the prior approval of IDA. A preference of 15%
or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower, would be applied to the
bids of local manufacturers of equipment. A preference of 7.5% would be
applied to bids from local civil works contractors. It is expected that most
of the equipment and pipes would come from abroad and that most of the main
civil works contracts would be awarded to locally based foreign contractors.

Project Expenditures, Credit Disbursements
3.29      The forecasts of annual project expenditures are shown in Annex 3.2
for each component. The proposed credit would be disbursed as follows:
Amount
Costs               of credit         % of expenditures
Category         (US$ million equivalent)       allocated         to be financed

1. Civil works       Total costs: 15.3            1.4       8.0      85% of total costs
(except laying
of water mains)
2. Equipment         Total foreign costs: 8.5   5.0          3.2     100% of foreign ex-
and pipes                                                         penditures, 100% of

consultant                                                        expenditures
and training
services.
4. Unallocated                                    0.7        1.8
Total         7.3      13.2
3.30      The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed credit is
shown in Annex 3.4. The proposed closing date would be June 30, 1985. Any
unused balance of the credit after completion of the project could be used,
subject to IDA approval, for further water supply and sanitation works closely
related to the project.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.31      The expanded water supply, drainage, sewerage and solid waste sys-
tems would contribute to the reduction of waterborne diseases and diseases
associated with insects and animals in places where dumping of wastes is not
at present controlled. Elimination of the yearly flooding, dredging of the
rainstorm canals, provision of collective bins to dispose of solid wastes
and to discourage illegal disposal on the ground, in water channels or sewers,
would all greatly improve the city environnent. Sewage discharged into the
Ikopa upstream from the city would be first treated in the Ampasimbe pilot
stabilization ponds. Sewage discharged into the Ikopa downstream from the



- 18 -
city would be raw3sewage but under this project the flow would be limited
to about 17,000 m /day. Given the self-purification capacity of the river,
such a flow could easily be discharged into it while maintaining acceptable
water quality standards.
IV. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
4.01      The project would satisfy the water supply, sewerage and drainage
demands in the project area for the next five to seven years (paras. 2.15 -
2.17). The results to be obtained from the operation of the pilot stabiliza-
tion ponds in Ampasimbe (para. 3.07 and Annex 3.1) would enable the establish-
ment of design criteria for the large ponds to be constructed in the future.
The project would provide the investments needed to improve collection and
disposal of solid wastes in the Fivondronana up to 1984 (para. 2.18). The
results obtained from the experimental composting facility would permit
evaluation of the potential benefits under local conditions of a full-scale
composting plant.
4.02      The training component would improve the efficiency of management,
operation and maintenance of both the water supply facilities throughout the
sector and the sanitation facilities in the area.
4.03      The Sanitation Division of the Fivondronana would be substantially
reinforced through improved technical and administrative staffing, organiza-
tion and training. Better qualified staff would be recruited (para. 5.09).
Separate pro forma accounts would be set up for the Sanitation Division. The
water operations of JIRAMA would be placed on a sounder financial basis.
Least Cost Solution
4.04      For each of the water supply, drainage and sewerage subsectors
several alternative master plans have been studied. Within each master plan
which appeared to be the least cost solution, different detailed alternatives
have also been considered. Sensitivity of the results to discount factors
varying from 6% to 15%, to variations in demand, variations in the cost of land
(an important factor when large storage basins of stormwater and large sewage
treatment ponds are being considered) and to the shadow price of foreign
exchange and unskilled labor has been examined. The most economic alterna-
tives have been chosen. They were also generally the least costly in terms of
investment costs. Details of alternatives studied and least cost solutions
are given in Annex 4.1.
4.05      As regards solid wastes, several methods of disposal have been
considered and compared. The least costly in the case of Antananarivo are
sanitary controlled dumping and, perhaps, composting, depending on the real
operating costs and conditions for the sale of compost. Sanitary controlled
dumping has been chosen as the basic solution at present. However, a small
existing composting facility would be upgraded under the project to process



- 19 -
part of the wastes in order to acquire more practical information about
this method of disposal in the Antananarivo context. The Ministry of Rural
Development, which promoted composting in the area, has already committed
itself to buying the entire production of the composting facility. Agreement
was reached that the selling price will cover the incremental cost of com-
posting. The cost is presently estimated at about FMG 2,145/ton (US$10.2/ton)
at 1979 prices. This lies within the range of existing prices in other
countries (US$5 to $11 per ton).
Rate of Return
4.06      The internal rate of return for the water supply component has been
computed for the proposed project combined with the treatment facilities which
are being and will be constructed separately by JIRAMA to meet demand up to
1987 (para. 2.15). Revenues taken into account include the proposed tariff
increases (paras. 6.05-7) and billings to the municipalities for water supplied
through public standposts. The financial rate of return is 5.1%. The rate
of return calculated with shadow pricing of foreign exchange at 112% and of
unskilled labor at 30% and excluding all duties and taxes is 7.4% 1/, which is
acceptable. The latter rate, however, underestimates the true economic rate
of return as the water revenues alone do not reflect the full economic benefits
related to health and other environmental and social factors. A 10% increase
in capital costs and in a 10% reduction in water sales would reduce the above
economic rate of return to 6.3% and 5.4% respectively (Annex 4.2).
4.07      In 1978 and 1979 the income of the Fivondronana was derived from
property taxes and sales taxes (para. 6.14). In 1980 and the following years
the surtax for development works on water consumed will progressively increase
but will only partly cover the cost of the new services. Since there is no
direct relationship between the Fivondronana's resources and sewerage services,
the benefits of the services provided by the Sanitation Division cannot be
readily translated into economic terms.
Economic Aspects of Composting
4.08      Analysis of solid wastes collected in Antananarivo showed that
the percentages of putrescible matter (85%), and nitrogen, phosphorus, potas-
sium, calcium and magnesium are high. These are favorable factors for the
production of composts for use as fertilizers in agriculture to replace
chemical fertilizers which have to be imported. Studies carried out by OTH
concluded that composting was worth experimenting with in Antananarivo. The
experimental facility to be built under the present project would be cf
limited capacity (10,000 t/year).
4.09      The experimental facility would provide better knowledge of the
potential benefits of composting for the Antananarivo area by determining
actual investment, operating and maintenance costs, the quality of compost
produced and customers' willingness to pay. Future expansion of the plant's
capacity would depend on the results obtained during the first stage. In the
1/   It is only 2.3% at average 1979 tariffs.



- 20 -
meantime, the proceeds of the sales would cover incremental operating and
maintenance costs including depreciation (para. 4.05).
Impact on Poverty Group
4.10      The urban poverty group in the Antananarivo area (172,000 people in
1975) currently consists of about 190,000 people, 94,000 of whom are already
supplied with safe water. It is estimated that the water supply component
would meet the needs of about 190,000 additional people up to 1986, of which
93,000 people, (i.e. 49%) would be urban poor; 130,000 of the additional
people would be supplied through public facilities (standposts, laundries and
lavatories). Since, in 1986, 63,000 urban poor would be left unserved,
additional service through future projects would be required to satisfy the
residual. $5.9 million (49%) of the costs of the project's water supply
components will be directly attributable to the poor, as will $3.6 million of
the IDA credit for the water supply components.
4.11      The drainage component, especially the separation of the irrigation
and drainage functions of the existing Andriantany canal and its dredging,
would benefit the whole community but particularly the poor living mainly in
the low areas of the city which are now periodically flooded.
4.12      The sewerage component would improve health conditions in the
city center which is densely populated, especially during the day when the
large avenues are transformed into crowded markets.
4.13      The solid wastes component by increasing the number of collective
bins and by improving the collection would benefit the whole population but
especially the poor as these improvements would mainly be provided in the poor
areas.
Project Risks and Merits
4.14      The main project risks relate to the sanitation components.  DUH has
no experience of implementing projects financed by the World Bank, and delays
may occur during engineering and construction of the drainage and sewerage
components. Because of the institutional weakness of the Fivondronana Sani-
tation Division, engineering of the solid wastes component and operation
and maintenance of the sanitation components may be inadequate. These risks
are nevertheless limited because (a) the WHO/UNDP feasibility studies, which
are already exceptionally detailed and of high quality, would be used as the
basis`for the detailed engineering and (b) a major part (67%) of the engineer-
ing studies would be carried out with the assistance of local engineering
firms. However, ta let DUH carry out the engineering would have a very important
training impact and allowance for delays has been made in the project implemen-
tation schedule. Moreover, the effectiveness of these arrangements would be
reviewed periodically with the Bank (para. 3.21). To reduce the risk of
inadequate operation and maintenance of the facilities, the project provides
for increasing the sanitation staff (para. 5.09), the training of this staff
and the strengthening of the financial setup of the Fivondronana Sanitation
Division.



- 21 -
4.15      Strengthening of the sanitation staff may also encounter some
problems because of low salaries and lack of adequate management. The
image of the sanitation sector is poor and it is difficult to attract staff of
the right quality. As it is not feasible to change the salary structure of
the whole municipality, it is proposed to try to remedy the situation by
upgrading the positions and recruiting better qualified managers who would in
turn be able to recruit better staff.
4.16      If the revenues of JIRAMA and the Sanitation Division did not in the
future reach the levels indicated in the financial projections, it would
prejudice maintenance, development and even operations. The proposed finan-
cial cavenants (paras. 6.05 to 6.07, 6.12 to 6.14) are designed to remedy the
situation.
4.17      In spite of these risks the project is worth doing because it would
satisfy some of the basic needs of the population. It would achieve the
benefits listed in paras. 4.01 to 4.03 and would strengthen the institutions
which in the sanitation sector might be used as a model for other cities.
V. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
5.01      The proposed IDA Credit of US$20.5 million to the Malagasy Democratic
Republic would be oanlent to JIRAMA (US$7.3 million) and to the Antananarivo
Fivondronana (US$13.2 million) to cover the foreign cost and part of the local
cost of the project on terms detailed in Chapter VI.
JIRAMA
5.02     JIRAMA was created in 1975 with a view to achieving the national
objectives in the electricity and water supply sectors through an autonomous
and financially viable institution. It is a reasonably well organized entity
which is receiving IDA assistance for the construction of the Andekaleka power
project (Credit 817-MAG). After taking over the assets and liabilities of
EEM and SEM in January 1977, JIRAMA is now in charge of all public electricity
and, theoretically, of all urban water supply in Madagascar. It now operates
44 water supply systems but a few municipal systems are still run by local
authorities (para. 1.11).
5.03      JIRAMA's board is made up of four representatives of the State, one
JIRAMA representative and two outside members, all appointed by the Cabinet.
The Board has delegated to the General Manager the powers needed to run the
day-to-day operations and has retained the right to approve large investments,
new borrowings and other major decisions. A General Controller, appointed by
the Prime Minister, has responsibility for ensuring that the company operates
within its terms of reference and conforms to the general policy of the
Government. The "Charter of Socialist Enterprises" applies to JIRAMA but is
not yet being enforced. Under this Charter, a policy making Orientation
Council would be established and made up of representatives of the State, the
Management Committee, the staff and the National Assembly. The Management
Committee, consisting of the General Manager and representatives of the State



- 22 -
and the staff, would be the executive arm of the Orientation Council. The
General Manager would be accountable to the Management Committee. Further,
the staff would elect a Workers Committee, which would look after the well-
being of the staff and would be consulted on all reforms affecting them.
5.04      JIRAMA is satisfactorily organized.  It includes eigbt departments
(see organization chart in Annex 5.1). The day-to-day management of operations
is the responsibility of two departments: (a) the Interconnected Zone,
which covers the Antananarivo region and accounts for about two thirds of
electricity and half of water sales, and (b) Outside Zones, which deals with
the rest of the country. Five other departments support the first two in
accounting, management systems, personnel, purchasing and sales matters.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Development Department.
5.05      JIRAMA employs a total staff of about 3,900 of which about 1,300
are assigned to its water supply operations. The senior management of JIRAMA
is well qualified and competent; the General Manager, a civil engineer,
has the requisite background and experience for his assignment. At the
technical level all senior posts, and where necessary the posts below, are
occupied by qualified and experienced engineers. JIRAMA, like many companies
in Madagascar, suffers from a shortage of qualified accounting staff. (para.
5.10). As agreed under Credit 817-MAG, (i) JIRAMA will notify IDA of any
proposed appointment to the position of Interconnected Zone Manager,
Development Manager, or Administrative and Financial Manager, in advance of
any such appointment in order to afford IDA adequate opportunity to make
comments, and (ii) JIRAMA will not increase the number of its permanent
unskilled labor beyond the level required by the scope of its operations.
5.06      JIRAMA presently operates a training center in Antananarivo set up
with assistance from Electricite de France and designed to train lower cadres
and new recruits in all aspects of JIRAMA's technical and administrative
operations. Courses are given which cater to a wide variety of needs ranging
from literacy at the lowest echelons to highly specialized technical subjects.
At the upper echelons, JIRAMA sponsors full-time students in higher learning
institutions abroad and has also been sending senior staff to Europe for short
seminars. Reinforcement of training will be provided under the project
(para. 3.09).
Fivondronana of Antananarivo
5.07      In 1976, local authorities were restructured and decentralized.
The new setup was designed to provide a large amount of autonomy to local
authorities from the level of the Fokontany at the bottom (equivalent to the
former canton) to the level of the Faritany (equivalent to the former province).
The Fivondronana of Antananarivo covers the territory of the former prefecture
of Antananarivo (para. 2.01). The General Assembly of the Fivondronana elects
the members of its Executive Committee, in effect a policy making body. An
administrative body implements the policies of the Executive Committee.
5.08      The administrative body includes several operational branches:
finance, administrative and cultural matters, socio-medical, economic matters,
personnel, and technical. The technical branch is divided into several



- 23 -
divisions, one of which is the Sanitation Division. The others are: Planning,
Construction, Water (public laundries and standposts), Electricity (public
lighting), Logistics, and Architecture-Housing-Urbanism. The Sanitation
Division includes four subdivisions dealing with sewerage and drainage, solid
wastes, design and construction of minor works, and supplies and workshops.
The Fivondronana organization chart is shown in Annex 5.2.
5.09      The Sanitation Division presently has a staff of 825 whose capacities
at all levels are generally inadequate. Facilities are badly maintained.
Training is nonexistent. There is urgent need to upgrade the overall level of
qualifications. As the project will substantially extend the existing facili-
ties, new staff will have to be hired; this would provide the opportunity to
carry out this upgrading. The Fivondronana recruitment plan for the project
is as follows:
No.                     Positions                                  Year
1        Engineer, Deputy Technical Manager
1        Engineer, Chief, Sanitation Division
i        Senior Technician, Deputy Chief
of Sanitation Division
1        Training Officer
2        Senior accountants
16        Technicians                                            1980-1981
28        Foremen and skilled workers                            1980-1982
31        Semi-skilled workers                                   1980-1982
The first six key officers of the list have been appointed. Assurances have
been obtained that the remaining staff will be hired as scheduled. New higher
echelon staff would be recruited from local institutions: Collège technique,
Lycee technique, Ecole des techniciens supérieurs, Etablissement d'enseigne-
ment superieur polytechnique. The training officer would be in charge of
implementing the training program recommended for new staff (para. 3.10) and
of designing a training program for existing staff which would be implemented
later.
Accounts
5.10      JIRAMA has been plagued by accounting problems since it was formed
in 1975. Early in 1976, the Association urged the Government to appoint a
qualified person to head the financial department of the newly created company.
It was not until April 1978, though, that JIRAMA was able to find a suitable
financial manager who, unfortunately, resigned six months later. Meanwhile a
consultant was hired in 1977 to help bring up to date the accounts of the



- 24 -
previous companies (para. 1.11), solve problems of uniformity of accouats and
organize the new department. Nevertheless financial statements for 1976 and
1977 were not finalized until August 1978. Although present bookkeeping is
satisfactory, the real problems lie with analysis and interpretation of
financial information for management purposes. To remedy the situation,
in connection with the power project, JIRAMA undertook to hire a competent
financial manager and to set up a budgeting group and an internal audit unit.
The head of the budgeting group and a chief internal auditor have been appointed,
but the financial manager, who has resigned, has still not been replaced after
more than a year, since no suitable or willing Malagasy candidate has been
found in Madagascar or abroad. JIRAMA is now actively looking for an expatriate
candidate. Meanwhile, an acting financial manager has been appointed. In
addition, JIRAMA hired a consultant in May 1979 to make a thorough investigation
of its accounting structure and procedures, with a view to reorganization in
1981.
5.11      The Fivondronana's present accounting arrangements are unsatisfactory
and it proposes to set up a separate accounting unit for its Sanitation
Division to keep records of the Division's various operations and of its fixed
assets and to measure the financial performance of the Division with a pro
forma commercial accounting system (para. 6.12). It has been confirmed that
the Fivondronana will set up separate acounts for its Sanitation Division to
be retroactive, as from January 1, 1980.
Audit
5.12      Under Credit 817-MAG, JIRAMA's accounts are to be audited by inde-
pendent auditors who should submit their report within five months after the
end of the financial year. JIRAMA appointed an auditor in 1978 who is accept-
able to IDA. Because of delays in finalizing the FY77 and FY78 accounts, the
auditor submitted this report for both years in August 1979. The delay should
be reduced in the future and it has been agreed again that the auditor will
furnish certified copies of JIRAMA's financial statements and his report not
later than five months after the end of each year, beginning with FY79.
5.13      The Fivondronana's accounts are subject to audit by  state auditors,
which can be the corps of "Inspecteurs d'Etat", the corps of "Contrôleurs des
comptes" or RINDRA, the new state auditing firm. Any of these state auditors
would be suitable to audit the Sanitation Division accounts. It has been
agreed that the chosen auditing agency will furnish certified copies of the
Fivondronana's financial statements as well as a report not later than
eight months after the end of the years, 1980, 1981 and 1982 and within five
months after the end of each subsequent year.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Lending Arrangements
6.01      The IDA credit will be made to the Government of Madagascar.  The
water supply portion of the credit will be relent by the Government to JIRAMA,
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, the execution of which will be a condition
of effectiveness of the credit at an 8% interest rate aver 25 years, including



- 25 -
a five-year grace period. Interest during the construction period will be
capitalized. The sanitation portion of the credit will be relent to the
Fivondronana of Antananarivo for its Sanitation Division, under another
Subsidiary Loan Agreement, the execution of which will be a condition of
effectiveness of the credit, on the more concessionary terms of a 4% interest
rate over 35 years, including a five-year grace period. 1/ Interest during
the construction period will be capitalized. The Government will bear
the foreign exchange risk. Up to now domestic lending institutions have not
financed water and sanitation projects of this kind, which have been financed
from other sources (Government grants and concessionaries).  General bank
lending rates are about 8%. The general health benefits to the environment of
the sewerage, drainage and solid wastes components of the pr.ject make it
acceptable that some form of subsidy be incorporated into the onlending terms
of the credit to the Fivondronana. The part of the IDA funds onlent to the
Fivondronana for the sewerage and drainage components (the major components of
the sanitation part of the project) would be spent by the Ministry of Public
Works on behalf of the Fivondronana as this Ministry would be responsible for
construction (para. 3.18). The Government contribution to the project financ-
ing would be in the form of an equity investment in both JIRAMA and the
Fivondronana. The finances of the two beneficiaries are discussed separately
in the following paragraphs.
JIRAMA - Overall Financial Position
6.02      JIRAMA's auditor approved the financial accouats for FY77 and FY78
(para. 5.12). She separated the accounts of JIRAMA's two main activities,
electricity and water, as required by Credit 817-MAG. In compliance with the
same agreement, she is in the process of reviewing the evaluation of JIRAMA's
fixed assets, which were taken over from the two previous companies, EEM and
SEM (para. 1.11). These assets will then be revalued each year with appro-
priate indices under Credit 817-MAG. They are evaluated in the present report
according to the findings of an independent assessor who took EEM's existing
assets at 1973 price levels, and SEM's existing assets at 1971 book values,
and applied Electricité de France's inflation coefficients to them.
1/   Inflation rates in the most recent three year period (1976-1978) were
7.7% on average. Inflation rates for the next three years (1979-1981)
are expected to be about 12% on average.

JIRAMA's cash situation has deteriorated from a positive amount of FMG 1.4
billion, at the end of 1976, to a negative amount of FMG 1.2 billion , at the
end of 1978. It has further deteriorated to a negative amount of 2.4 billion
at the end of 1979 (respectively US$7, -6, and -11 million). This was due to
a rapid increase in operating expenses (para. 6.04), to a lack of long-term
borrowing for new fixed assets, and to financial involvement in the con-
struction of a plant for the manufacture of water meters and electrical home
appliances. To correct this situation, the Government undertook, in compliance
with Credit 817-MAG: (i) to pay administrative arrears to JIRAMA in order to
bring the administrative receivables to a maximum level of three month's
consumption - FMG 800 million (US$3.8 million) was paid in 1979, and FYG 800
million will be paid in 1980, (ii) to cover the 1978 deficit for water oper-
ations (para. 6.05), and (iii) to cause JIRAMA's 1978 construction of new
water supply assets to be financed through long-term borrowing (para. 6.05).
Further, it has been agreed that JIRAMA would limit its short term debt at any
time to not more than one sixth of its consolidated gross revenue for the
immediately preceding twelve month period, and JIRAMA would carry on exclu-
sively public utility operations and, before December 31, 1980, would transfer
to a separate entity all assets and obligations which relate to operations
other than public utilities. The debt/equity ratio 1/ is satisfactory at
13/87 at the end of 1978. The low indebtedness is explained by the fact
that in recent years there has been relatively little costruction, most of
which was financed by Government grants. To limit the indebtedness that will
rise as a consequence of the future construction program, it was agreed for
Credit 817-MAG that JIRAMA will not incur any long-term debt unless its
consolidated net revenue over the last twelve month period is at least equal
to 1.5 times future long-term debt service, including the proposed new borrow-
ing.
6.04      JIRAMA's financial statements do not show a strong performance.  The
operating income was drastically reduced between 1976 and 1978, as shown in
the table below, partly because the hydrological conditions were less favorable
in 1977 and 1978 than in 1976 and the consumption of fuel had increased, and
partly because the increase in personnel expenses was out of step with the
increase in revenues. It is expected that as a result of the current financial
investigation by a consultant (para. 5.10), the accounting procedures will be
tightened and the level of expenses more closely watched.

Water Operations
6.05      The Government's stated objectives for JIRAMA are that it should be
a financially viable entity and should recover the costs incurred for water
supplied (para. 1.19). In FY77 and FY78 JIRAMA's water services operated at a
loss of FMG 167 million (US$0.8 million) and FMG 215 million (US$1.0 million)
respectively; a further loss of FMG 223 million (US$1.1 million) is estimated
in FY79. Under Credit 817-MAG, Goverament undertook to finance the deficit
of the water operations and JIRAMA's construction program for water supply.
To this end, (i) the Treasury paid JIRAMA FMG 170 million (US$0.8 million) in
May 1979 and will pay FMG 230 million (US$1.1 million) in 1980, (ii) the
National Industrial Development Bank made a loan of FMG 400 million (US$1.9
million) to JIRAMA in December 1979 at an 8.50% interest rate, repayable3in
ten years. 19i9 levels of water tariffs, which were on average FMG 34/m
(US$0.16 per m  or US$0.61 per 1,000 gallons) are low (see footnote to



- 29 -
para. 1.17) and insufficient to cover operating expenses. Substantial
increases will be needed if JIRAMA's water services are to become financially
viable and provide the funds from internal resources necessary to meet a
reasonable proportion of development costs. As a first step, after negotia-
tions of the Credit with IDA, the Government raised the water tariffs by 12%
on January 1, 1980.
6.06      JIRAMA should aim to have tariffs based on long-term marginal cost.
However, the information necessary to determine long-term marginal costs for
the country as a whole is not available, except for Antananarivo, wMere the
long-term marginal cost of water is estimated at about FMG 54 per m  in
1979 prices, which is about 70% higher than the 1979 average tariff in
Antananarivo (Annex 4.3). A study is therefore required. It should cover
pricing policies and tariff structure since existing tariffs are complicated
and do not take account of the consumers' ability to pay or the social aims of
the country. It was agreed that consultants satisfactory to IDA will be
appointed to undertake a study of the level and structure of water tariffs in
accordance with terms of reference provided by IDA, to be completed not later
than June 30, 1982.   It was further agreed that by January 1, 1984, after
discussion with IDA, tariffs will be introduced based on long-term marginal
cost principles and the financial needs of JIRAMA's water services.
6.07      Our preliminary estimates indicate that tariffs based on the long-
run marginal cost of water would give a rate of return on net revalued fixed
assets in operation of at least 6%. Taking account of estimated price es-
calation, obtaining this rate of return would mean an average tariff increase
of about 120% by 1983. It is proposed to implement this substantial increase
in a series of steps.  It has been agreed that JIRAMA's water tariffs will be
adjusted to achieve at least the following rates of return on revalued net
fixed assets in operation (para. 6.02) as from 1980:
FY                     1980   1981   1982   1983 and subsequent years
Rate of return          0%      2%     4%      6%
On the basis of present forecasts, the estimated average annual tariff increases
required to achieve those rates of return would be as follows:
1980    1981    1982    1983    1984
Average tariff (FMG per m )                   43      52       62      74       80
(US$ per 1,000 gals)       0.78    0.94    1.12    1.34    1.44
increase in current terms %                   13      30       18      20        7
increase in real terms %                       1      16        6       9       -2
With such increases it is expected that JIRAMA would be able to finance
64% of its capital requirements for water services for the period FY80-84 from



- 30 -
its own resources, which is satisfactory.  Water will still be affordable for
connected consumers with the lowest income after new tariffs are implemented,
since their water bill will represent less than 5% of their incomes.  Water
supplied through public standposts is free to the users and JIRAMA is paid by
the Fivondronana for all standpost consumption.

Future Financial Performance

service is g4;len below.
---------------------FMG millions-------------------------

1/   including depreciation.
6.10      The expected improvement in the financial performance would be
mainly due to the planned increase in tariffs and the higher volume of water
sales. The rate of return would increase from 0% in FY80 to 6% in FY83 and
the operating ratio is expected to improve from 100% in FY80 to 75% in FY83.
The financial situation for water supply will be satisfactory. The deficit
of 1979 will be financed by Government (para. 6.05). It has also been agreed
that funds from water operations will not be transferred to electricity
operations.
Power Operations
6.11      JIRAMA is presently undertaking a large power expansion program
which includes the Andekaleka hydroelectric project, partly financed by Credit
817-MAG (para. 5.02). The cost estimate has been revised to US$141.9 million.
IDA will provide US$43 million; bilateral agencies have made commitments
amounting to US$81.1 million and JIRAMA has agreed to provide US$17.8 million.
JIRAMA is committed to maintaining tariff levels sufficient to achieve rates
of return on net revalued fixed assets in power operations of 3.5% in 1979,
4.5% in 1980, 6% in 1981, 7% in 1982, 8% in 1983 and thereafter. The tariff
increases required during the following years to reach these rates of return
are estimated as follows:
Years                  1980   1981   1982   1983   1984
in current terms %         24      17     15       0 1/  13
in real terms %             il      4       4    -10       4
1/   No tariff increase should be necessary in 1983.  The commissioning
of the Andekaleka hydroelectic plant will drastically reduce the consump-
tion of fuel and diesel oil, and that saving is estimated to be greater
than the increase of income required by the application of the 8% rate of
return to the Andekaleka assets (under a covenant of Credit 817-MAG).



- 32 -
With such increases it is expected that JIRAMA would be able to finance 33% of
its capital requirements for power operations from its own resources from
1979 to 1983.
Fivondronana of Antananarivo - Sanitation Division
6.12      The second beneficiary of the credit would be the Fivondronana
(para. 6.01). In the past, the finances of its Sanitation Division have
formed part of the overall municipal finances, with no separate accounting for
the Division. But a JIRAMA financial team had prepared pro forma accounts for
the Division for FY77. For this purpose the team had used a valuation of
assets included in the 1975 OTH study in which all sanitation assets were
valued according to age and conditinn and expressed in 1973 prices; the latter
values had been updated using similar indices to those used by JIRAMA to give
a net figure of FMG 2,246 million (US$10.7 million). However, the Fivondronana
has now agreed to set up a separate accounting unit for the Division (para.
5.11) that would prepare pro forma accounts in accordance with principles of
accrual accounting: balance sheets, statements of expenses, including operat-
ing and maintenance expenses and depreciation allowances, and statements of
capital expenditures for fixed assets' replacement and repair (other than
routine maintenance), and for new construction, debt senrice and borrowings.
Furthermore, it has been agreed with the Fivondronana that the opening balance
sheet of the Sanitation Division shall be certified as of January 1, 1980 by
an auditing agency satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.13) and that the fixed assets
in operation will be reviewed annually and revalued as necessary in accordance
with methods of valuation satisfactory to IDA.
6.13      On the basis of these pro forma accouats, the Fivondronana agreed
to provide its Sanitation Division each year, through budgetary allocations or
otherwise, with funds at least equal to its operating and maintenance costs,
and sufficient to cover capital expenditures, The Fivon£ronana
further agreed to exchange views with IDA, from time to time, on the adequacy
of its budgetary allocations for its ,anitation Division, taking into con-
sideration cost increases due to inflation and the scope of the Sanitation
Division's operations.
6.14      Although the Government ins.sts that the reso-rces 1/ of the
Fivondronana and its budgetary allocations be balanced overall, without any
relationship between sources and allocation of funds, i. has agreed to increase
part of the Fivondronana resources at the same rate as tre expenses of the
1/   In 1979, the two main sources of funds for the Fivondronana were property
taxes, FMG 730 million (US$3.5 million), and that part of sales taxes
which the Government assigned to the Fivondronana to balance its budget,
FMG 630 milion (US$3 million).

sections of the Sanitation Division related to the proposed project. Thus the
Government will cause JIRAMA to adjust each year the rate of the "surtax for
development works" on all water consumed (para. 1.18) which it collects on
behalf of the Fivondronana. (The surtax has two different rates for water
consumption from the Fivondronana ald for private consumption. Their weighted
average was approximately FMG 2.6/m in 1979.) Such adjustment will be
proportional to the increases during the preceding year, in the operating and
maintenance expenses and depreciation allowances of the Sanitation Division as
determined in the pro forma accounts for the following services and facilities
(which in 1980 will represent 28% of expenses for the whole Sanitation Division):
drainage systems, and collection, treatment and disposal of sewage and solid
wastes.
Financing Plan
6.15      In the period from 1979 to 1984, when the proposed project is
expected to be completed, the total financing requirements of the Sanitation
Division are estimated to amount to FMG 5,825 million (US$27.7 million), as
shown in the following table:

Monitoring Criteria
6.17      JIRAMA, the Ministry of Public Works and the Fivondronana will,
through periodic progress reports during the implementation of the project,
monitor critical indicators, as illustrated in Annex 6.1. This will be done
through communication with the three agencies. Within three months after the
project has been completed, JIRAMA, the Ministry of Public Works and the
Fivondronana will prepare a project completion report on the basis of an
outline agreed with IDA.
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      The following agreements have been reached with the Government:

enable its net income before interest to increase by
steps to 6% of its net revalued water assets in opera-
tion (para. 6.07);
(1)  JIRAMA will not transfer funds from its water operations
to its electricity operations (para. 6.10);
(m) The Fivondronana will set up pro forma separate accounts
for its Sanitation Division (paras. 5.11 and 6.12) whose
opening balance sheet as of January 1, 1980 will be
certified by independent auditors and whose fixed assets
will be revalued periodically (para. 6.12); the Fivondronana
will provide its Sanitation Division annually with budgetary
allocations sufficient to cover its recurrent expenses and
its capital expenditures, and will exchange views with IDA
on the adequacy of the allocations (para. 6.13);
(n) The rate of the "surtax for development works" collected by
JIRAMA on behalf of the Fivondronana will be adjusted to
increase proportionately with expenses of the Sanitation
Division (para. 6.14);



- 36 -

MADAGASCAR
ANTANANARIVO WATER AND SANITATION PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY
EXISTING FACILITIES AND WATER DEMAND
I.   Existing Facilities
1.        The municipal water supply system was created in 1910 to serve the
historic center (the "Rova"). Water was drawn from a small lake just to the
south connected to the Ikopa river. Since then, water production facilities
located at the edge of the lake have grown and the distribution networks
have spread to new quarters in the city. As urbanization spread mainly
towards the north, east and west, production facilities became more distant
from the center of consumption; on the other hand, their location on the river
upstream of the city is protected from urban pollution.
2.        The present production facilities conlist of a raw water pumpin§ sta-
tion, a rapid sand filtration plant of 60,000 m /day capacity (a 25,000 m /day
eetension is under construction), and a treated water pumping station of 70,000
m /day (based on 20 working hours per day). From this single production plant
five rising mains (working diameter ranging from 250 to 600 mm) feed thl main
reservoirs located on the city hills.  Storage capacities total 25,000 m , i.e.
53% of average daily production. The distribution networks include 340 km of
pipes, of which 125 km have diameters of 200 mm or more. Several communities
in the suburbs are served.
3.        The networks are divided into several pressure zones.  One medium-
level zone supplies 80% of the total consumption and is connected directly
to the production works. High-level zones supply high or remote areas; they
require the use of booster stations. Low-level zones supply areas on plains
or slopes.
4.        Existing facilities are in good condition, except for cast-iron
pipes which are heavily incrusted. This creates moderate problems; some old
portions of these pipes need to be replaced. The residual value of the exist-
ing facilities is estimated at more than 50% of their replacement cost.
II. Water Demand
(a) Domestic water consumption
5.        Key indicators relative to the domestic demand of people served
through private connections are expected to develop as follows:

Percentage of people served                         17       19        27        46
Number of people served                       109,000  143,000  276,000  641,000
Average per capita consumption    lcd              80        86       104       122
Total daily consumption             m3/d        8,625   12,320   29,000   78,000
6.        Key indicators relative to the domestic demand of people served
through public standposts are expected to develop as follows:
1975     1980      1990      2000
Percentage of people served                        58        58        56        47
Number of people served                       366,000  430,000  602,000  648,000
Average per capita consumption    led              25        30        35        40
Total daily consumption             m3/d        9,400   13,200   20,000   26,000
During the period 1975-90, it is estimated that the percentage of people sup-
plied through private connections or public standposts will increase from 13%
to 46% in the suburbs and will remain at 100% in the Fivondronana. This would
increase the percentage of total population served from 75% to 83%, the long-
term target being 93% by 2000.  Average domestic consumption is expected to
increase from 38 lcd to 57 lcd, the long-term figure being 80 lcd by 2000.
(b)  Industrial and commercial water consumption
7.        Industries that consume small quantities of water (tobacco, printing,
wood, etc.) presently need an average of 70 liters per day per employee. This
consumption is expected to increase to 85 liters by 1980 and to 120 by 2000.
8.        Industries that consume a moderate amount of water (food, textiles,
chemicals, etc.) presently need an average of 600 liters per day per employee.
This consumption is expected to increase to 700 liters by 1980 and to 1,000 by
2000.
9.        Industries that consume large quantities of water (tanneries, paper-
mills, etc.) at present have private water schemes and it is expected that
this will continue to be the case in the future.

Page 3 of 5
10.       Commerce's share of water consumption is presently more than 50%
of domestic consumption. As domestie consumption is expected to increase
sharply in the future, the above percentage is expected to decrease to 46%
in 1980 to 34% in 1990 and to 20% in 2000. In accordance with the above
projections, the average daily water consumption of industry and commerce is
expected to increase as follows:
Unit     1975      1980      1990     2000
Industry
Low-consumption                    m /d        920    1,500    2,710    5,350

(c) Government and municipal water consumption
11.       Government facilities now consume 20% of total consumption.  As they
are presently well served, it is expected that this percentage will gradually
decrease to less than 10% by 2000.
12.       The consumption of the municipalities (public standposts excluded)
has been 8% of total consumption for a number of years and this percentage
is not expected to change in the future.
13.       In accordance with the above projections, the average daily con-
sumption of government and municipalities is expected to grow as follows:
1975     1980      1990     2000
Government                           m /d      8,900   10,700   15,000   21,000
Municipalities                       m /d      3,600    4,500    8,000   15,500
(d) Total water demand
14.       Water losses are estimated to have been 11% of production in 1975.
This percentage is low because water used for washing streets and reservoirs,
flushing sewers and water mains and water used by the Fire Department is not
included as it is estimated and billed to the municipality. It is expected
that this percentage will remain about the same in the future.

Page 4 of 5
15.       In 1972, the peak day factor was 1.14 and the peak week factor 1.08.
As this relatively low factor will probably remain the same in the future
(no substantial change in the structure of consumption between different
categories of consumers), a peak day factor of 1.15 has been retained for
projections.
16.       In 1972, the peak hour factor was 1.5 in Antananarivo (1.725 rela-
tive to yearly average demand) and was up to 3 in the suburbs.
17.       On the basis of the above figures, total water demand is expected
to increase as follows:
1975     1980      1990     2000
Average water consumption           m /d     43,000   61,000   106,000  200,000
Average water demand (including    3
unaccounted for water)            m /d     48,500   67,500   117,000  220,000
Peak day water demand               m /d     55,500   76,000   133,000  250,000

ANTANANARIVO WATER AND SANITATION PROJECT
SANITATION COMPONENTS
EXISTING FACILITIES
I.   Sewerage and Drainage
1.        In the existing facilities of Antananarivo, sanitary sewage and
storm water are for the most part collected by a combined system. Only a few
new urban developments in the plain are serviced through a separate system
and they total only 10% of the area covered by the existing facilities.
2.        The combined system which serves the hills differs from that serving
the plain. The hills are served through an urban-type system of sewage collec-
tors (pipes, troughs, tunnels) designed also to collect storm water; the plain
is served mainly through a rural-type system of open canals. Although prac-
tically all the hill area system flows into the plain system, the
hill collectors are designed for a run off flow of up to 100 liters/sec. per
hectare, while the canals downstream can only dispose of 1 or 2 liters/sec.
per hectare. Consequently, heavy rains cause flooding in the town's low
areas.
3.        The.hill area system includes about 313 km of collectors conveying
some 8,000 m 'of waste water per day. The system is in a rather poor state.
The collectors' capacity is generally inadequate during several months of the
year; their slopes are usually not adapted to the considerable variations of
flow which occur with the combined system. Water velocities during the dry
season are too low to allow self-cleaning. When the water is at a high level
in the downstream channels (for ricefield irrigation), it backs up in the
upstream collectors where sludge settles and over an extended period of time
deposits which are hard to remove build up inside the collectors. Collectors
which pass underneath roads are usually not buried deeply enough and frequently
collapse. Catchment basins are insufficient in number and badly maintained.
4.        The plain system includes open channels (some lined with bricks).
They have low slopes (often only 1/1,000), inadequate capacity during the
rainy season, too low a water velocity during the dry season (no self-clean-
ing is possible during this period) and sometimes no outlets. They are dif-
ficult to maintain and polluted by sewage and garbage illegally dumped into
them. The most important, the Andriantany channel, serves the dual purpose
of irrigation and drainage, but at the beginning of the rainy season these
two functions conflict. In addition, sludge deposited in the bottom of the
channel causes the water level at the beginning of the irrigation period to
exceed the limit above which drainage is not effective.

Page 2 of 3
5.        A5 present,-sewage is not treated before disposal.  The daily flow
of 20,000 m (including infiltration water) has a 5-day biological oxygen
demand (BOD5) of about 220-250 mg/l. Total BOD5 disposed of per day (5,000
kg/day) corresponds to a per capita disposal of 12 g/day, which is very low.
This is mainly because only 15% of the water used is collected afterwards as
waste water and many houses use individual systems (aqua privies) for exereta
disposal.
6.        A small part of the sewage is discharged directly into the river
below the city and a major part is discharged into the canal. During the
irrigation period, water in the canal is used to irrigate the ricefields,
but during the rainy season when irrigation is not needed the water flows
15 km down the canal and is discharged into the Ikopa. Treatment before
disposal would be necessary in the medium term but is not a priority invest-
ment at present.
II. Solid Wastes
7.        The existing system for collection and disposal of solid wastes is
reasonable in terms of quantity collected but is inadequate in terms of dis-
posal and conditions of collection.
8.        People dispose of solid wastes in three types of containers:  a
small number of private bins, collective bins and numerous fixed concrete
containers. Collective bins are often stolen and concrete containers are
not well designed, so wastes are often carelessly dumped in uncontrolled
areas (outside collective bins, in illegal dumping areas, in drainage canals,
etc.).
9.        Solid wastes are collected at 820 locations spread over 14 dis-
tricts. Each district generally includes two collection routes, the col-
lecting truck being full at the end of a route. Each district is served
by one vehicle (standard 6 to 8 ton truck running about 50 to 70 km per day
and manned by two teams in shift).  Wastes are generally collected at night
and the same trucks are used during the day for sewerage maintenance. There
are only about 16 trucks in working order. Maintenance workshops are poorly
equipped and the maintenance budget is inadequate.
19.       A total of about 160 tons of solid wastes are collected a day (400
m /day), about 38,000 tons/year. The existing level of service meets about
90% of the needs. All the urban areas with population density over 25 inhab/
ha are served.
11.       After collection, wastes are dumped 9 km from the city on an area
covering 15 ha. The landfill is not carried out properly as wastes are not
covered periodically with earth. Nevertheless, burning, disinfestation, grad-
ing and compaction are performed regularly. Although in use since 1966, the
area still has spare capacity and could be used for a few more years.



- 44                          ANNEX 2.2
Page 3 of 3
12.       Small quantities of wastes are composted by facilities which incPude
some handling equipment, a hammermill and a composting area covering 450 m
where refuse stacked in heaps is periodically turned over until the putresci-
bles are degraded. The hammermill theoretically has a capacity of 10,000
t/year but lack of pre-sorting, screening, and adequate handling equipment
limits the production to 600-800 t/year. The amount of compost sold is only
200-300 t/year because its quality is poor. Although the percentage of
putrescibles is very high (75%), the quality is poor because of the presence
of dangerous debris as a result of the lack of pre-sorting equipment.

the existing dumping site as a real "controlled" sanitary
landfill;
(iv) the improvement of the existing composting facility
to enable it to produce 10,000 t/year of good quality
compost which would be purchased for fertilizer by the
Ministry of Rural Development.
V.   Training of JIRAMA Water Supply Staff
12.       The training component for water supply staff consists of a contri-
bution to the financing of JIRAMA training program. This five-year program
involves both electricity and water staff. JIRAMA, which was assisted by
Electricite de France, is presently finalizing the detailed program. Funds
were made available through Credit 817-MAG to finance the part of this
program related to electricity staff. It is proposed to supplement these
funds under the present project to finance the remaining part of the program,
which emphasizes training of water supply staff.
13.       The training component for the present project includes the fol-
lowing:
(i)  a contribution equivalent to 30% of the construction and equip-
ment costs for an extension to the JIRAMA training center at Antan-
anarivo which would be used both for training water supply and
electricity staff. Classrooms, laboratory, workshop, stores and
administrative offices and dormitories would be constructed.
Equipment would consist mainly of teaching equipment (including
teaching aid kits). It would also include equipment related to
administrative and social facilities;
(ii) the costs associated with averseas training of JIRAMA's selected
trainers and upgrading abroad of senior administrative staff and
senior water technicians. Costs include air transport, fees of the
foreign training institutions, living expenses abroad and staff
salaries during the training period. The credit would finance only
the foreign exchange costs of the program. The total amount of
training would be equivalent to 98 man-months (50 for trainers, 30
for senior water technicians and 18 for senior administrative
staff);
(iii) the operating costs of the JIRAMA training center during the
1980-1984 period and attributable to the training and upgrading of
medium and lower level staff assigned specifically to water supply
activities. This would involve training the staff who would be in
charge of the new production facilities, upgrading the staff respon-
sible for the distribution zones and teaching reading and writing to
the lower staff. These costs, all in local currency, would be
financed entirely by local funds.

VI. Training for Sanitation Staff
14.       The training component for sanitation staff includes the following:
(i)  the supply of training equipment (flowmeters of different types,
leak detectors, plumbing tools, sanitation pipeworks, audiovisual
and reproduction equipment, and drafting equipment). This equipment
would be used in the Fivondronana's different facilities (future
pilot stabilization ponds, headquarters, workshops);
(ii) the costs associated with overseas training of the head of the
Sanitation Division and 7 senior technicians to be recruited. Costs
include air transport, fees of the foreign training institution,
living expenses overseas and staff salaries during the training
period. The total amount of training would be equivalent to 60
man-months for senior technicians who would be trained for 6 months
in firms (consulting engineers, public utilities) specialized in
sanitation problems, vehicle maintenance, or heavy earthwork equip-
ment. The credit would finance only the foreign costs;
(iii) the costs associated with local training of 6 technical assistance
and 75 lower level staff to be recruited. Total training would
amount to 243 man-months: 225 man-months of workshop training for
lower level staff who would be trained in the following centers, all
located in Antananarivo: JIRAMA training center, vehicle workshop
of the Ministry of Public Works, Agronomical Research Institute and
Pasteur Institute; and 18 man-months for the 6 technical assistants
who would be sent for 2-4 months to local institutions involved in
sanitation (such as the Ministry of Health, Sanitation and sanitary
Engineering Division, certain industries, etc.). The training costs
include fees of the local training institutions and the staff
salaries during the training period. These costs, all in local
currency, would not be financed by the credit but by local funds.

ANTANANARIVO WATER AND SANITATION PROJECT
LEAST COST SOLUTION
I.   Water Supply
Least Cost Solution at Master Plan Level - Study of Different Alternatives
1.        Studies have been made by consultants (OTH) to determine the most
economic water supply system capable of gradually meeting water demand in the
Antananarivo area up to the year 2000.
2.        Unit costs in Madagascar of different types of works (boreholes,
filtration plant, reservoirs, pipes) have been estimated and analyzed. This
permitted calculation of the optimal design period for each type of works
and facilitated selection between alternate systems (rapid filtration
instead of slow filtration, for instance).
3.        Economic diameters for transmission and for distribution pipelines
have been determined. The present value of the capital cost of pipes and
recurrent costs of pumping have been calculated for a given initial flow of
water. The total present value is a function of the rate of increase in
water demand, the discount rate and the frequency with which additional
pipes have to be laid to increase capacity. Initial pipe diameters mini-
mizing the total present value have been calculated for various discount
rates (range 6% to 12%), different rates of increase in water demand (range
3% to 12%), differing periodicity of pipe-laying, and different initial flows.
Analysis of the results showed the optimal periodicity of pipe-laying to be
10 to 12 years in the case of Madagascar. The optimal maximum flow that a
pipe may carry has been calculated for each standard size of pipe.
4.        The optimal pumping schedule has been determined after comparing
four alternatives: (a) uniform pumping 24 hours per day; (b) pumping modu-
lated in relation to demand; (c) uniform pumping 20 hours per day, with
a complete stop during the 4 hours of peak power consumption; (d) uniform
pumping 20 hours per day and partial pumping during hours of peak power con-
sumption (the pipe size would be the same as in alternative (a); and only
pumping during peak hours in the last few years before pipe transit capacity
is saturated). The last alternative proved to be the most economical as soon
as the cost of energy during peak hours rose to at least twice the cost during
normal hours. As such a differential power tariff will probably be used in
the future, alternative (d) has been retained.
5.        Taking account of both the local possibilities and the physical
constraints (the nature and location of water resources to be tapped, the
number of main distribution network zones, possible sites for treatment



- 57 -                      ANNEX 4.1
Page 2 of 5
plants and reservoirs, and possible routes for transmission mains and raw
water pipelines), several major options were determined first of all, then
eleven alternatives were closely examined. These alternatives fell into
four categories. In the first category, production facilities would be
located in the southern area near the resources and water distributed through
one or two main distribution zones. In the second category, production facil-
ities would be divided between the southern and the western areas, raw water
being conveyed from the south to the west. In the third category, production
facilities would be divided between the southern and the northern area, raw
water being conveyed from the south to the north, and water would be dis-
tributed through one or two distribution zones. Finally, in the fourth
category, production facilities would be concentrated in the south but
treated water needed for the northern area would be pumped north through a
low pressure pipe and repumped in the north to feed two distribution zones.
After a first comparison of these alternatives had been made, only four were
retained for detailed study and comparison. Several aspects were considered
in the comparison: the net present value of investment and operating costs,
and the safety of the design and its flexibility with a view to possible future
adjustment. Sensitivity to variation of the discount rate has been analyzed
for rates in the 6% to 15% range.
Master Plan Retained - Least Cost Alternative
6.        The least cost alternative resulting from the above comparison is
also the most flexible. It includes no dramatic innovations. It extends
existing facilities while adapting them to the new town development. This
alternative can be characterized as follows:
production facilities would still be centered around the
existing ones; water from the Ikopa river, after
being stored in the Mandroseza lake, is the source
of raw water;
-    two main distribution zones would include, first, a high
level zone (reservoi5 level 1,340 m, pumping pressure
120 m, flow 60,000 m /day by 2000) servicing the high
and medium level quarters of the town (old town) and,
second, a low level zone (reservoir lvel 1,320 m,
pumping pressure 90 m, flow 200,000 m /day by 2000)
servicing the western part of the town, the low
northeastern hills and the town periphery (new
town);
-    suburbs at a distance of 20 km or more would be supplied
through secondary pumphouses and new reservoirs;

Least Cost Solution at 1980-85 Works Program
Level - Study of Different Alternatives
7.        Feasibility studies have been undertaken in relation to the works
to be constructed during the 1980-85 period to determine the least cost
solution.
8.        The type of production facilities to be used has been determined by
comparing several alternatives (surface vater from the Ikopa treated with
rapid or slow sand filters, groundwater from boreholes in the left or right
bank of the Ikopa with iron removal). It was found that for discount rates
above 6%, the present value of investment and operating costs (over 22 years)
of rapid filtration applied to water drawn from the Ikopa river was less than
for the other alternatives.
9.        It is proposed that pumping from the production facilities be at
a constant rate of 20 hours per day with partial pumping during hours of peak
power consumption, instead of the present uneconomic rate of 24 hours per
day. The 16 new pumps required up to 1985 would include only 6 types, for
reasons of standardization. Three new secondary pumping stations would be
constructed by 1985.
10.       For transmission lines, several possible routes and pipe sizes
have been compared, particularly for the two 700 mm diameter pipelines con-
necting the production facilities to the Fiadanana reservoir (this requires
construction of a 750 m long gallery, 2 x 2 m section through the Rova hill),
and the pipeline supplying the northern quarters of the town.
II. Drainage
11.       Master plan studies have been carried out by OTH to determine the
most economic way to meet needs up to 2000.
12.       The search for the least cost solution began by first assessing
the physical constraints existing in the area and identifying the main
options available. The convergence of flows in the valleys and the flat-
ness of the plain tend to favor the construction of storm basins in the
valleys and of canals in the plain. The fact that during the rainy season
the water level in the dyked rivers is above the level of the plain, would
favor either storing rainwater in huge basins or pumping it into the rivers.
Disposing rainwater into the Mamba would be the best solution because the
lowest part of the plain is north of the city and because the Mamba joins
the Ikopa only 15 km downstream from the city. Finally, the existence of
a water table under pressure below the peat soil of the plain makes it advis-
able to keep the upper level of the drainage system in the plain at about the
same level as the natural ground level and backfilling the areas to be developed.
13.       Alternative disposal and collection facilities have been studied
for each catchment basin. Storage basins at different upper levels and
pumping stations of different capacities have also been considered.



- 59 -
ANNEX 4.1
Page 4 of 5
14.       Different routes and sizes of collecting facilities (mains, canais)
have been weighed as well as the possibility of using pumping stations in some
low areas.  Economic comparisons showed that the construction of storm basins
in the east valley, the Masay valley and the west plain would be the best
alternative and that the use of pumping stations in some low areas (city
center, Isotry, Anatihazo) would be worth considering only if water were
previously stored in deep basins of large capacity.
15.       The results of these economic comparisons pointed to three main
alternatives. In the first alternative, disposal in the Mamba would be
by gravity but water would be stored in huge basins, and a pumping station
and a storage basin would be constructed in the city center. Under the second
alternative, disposal would be by pumping into the Mamba and a pumping station
would be constructed in the city center. In the third alternative, disposal
would be by pumping into the Mamba, but the upper limit of the water level
would be one meter lower than in the two preceding alternatives and there
would be no pumping station in the city center. Comparison of the investment
and operating costs (discounted at 6% to 15%) of the three alternatives showed
that the first was the least economic and that the other two were comparable.
The third alternative has been chosen because drainage of the city center
would be simpler with no pumping station or storage basin in the area and
keeping the upper limit of the water level in the plain at a low level would
decrease the height of backfill necessary to develop the plain.
III. Sewerage
16.       Waterborne sewerage has been considered in the Antananarivo area
only where population density in the hilly areas of the city exceeds 150 in-
habitants/ha, and on areas of the plain which are being developed. In other
areas, private sanitation systems will continue to be used.
17.       In setting up a master plan for a waterborne sewerage system to
handle needs up to 2000, the main options available were determined by physi-
cal constraints. The nine main catchment basins of the area are divided into
two groups: one group of six basins which in 2000 would collect 95% of the
sewage, and one group of three peripheral basins which are separated from each
other and from the first group by a large range of hills. It was clear that
an independent sewerage system would be more economic for the three peripheral
basins. For the first group, economic comparison showed that it was prefer-
able to have two systems, one in the southern part of the city which would
discharge about 5% of the sewage into the Ikopa river upstream from the
city, and the other in the central and northern part of the city which would
discharge about 90% of the sewage downstream from the city.
18.       Several alternatives have been considered for the downstream system:
main outfall sewers north and/or south of Ambohimanarina, a treatment plant
on the right bank of the Ikopa and/or near the Mamba river. The different
alternatives have been compared according to their investment costs discounted



- 60 -                        ANNEX 4.1
Page 5 of 5
at rates of 6% to 15%.  Different treatment alternatives have been consid-
ered: (a) conventional and accelerated treatment leading to compact facil-
ities but which is too expensive in Antananarivo where the cost of land is
low; (b) slow treatment: land treatment, stabilization ponds. Land treatment
is not possible in the areas because the soil in the plain is too impervious.
Several kinds of stabilization ponds have been studied: mixed ponds (anaero-
bic-aerobic), anaerobic then mixed ponds, aerated then mixed ponds, and
finally recycled stabilization ponds. This comparison shows that, with the
present cost of land, mixed ponds is the best alternative. Sensitivity of the
results to the cost of land has been analyzed. Finally, it has been deter-
mined that the most economic alternative would be to collect and treat all
sewage on the right bank of the Ikopa.
19.       Within the general framework of the master plan, two alternatives
have been considered: either to discharge all sewage through a new outfall
of 600 mm diameter or to postpone the construction of a new outfall by using
the existing one and constructing a small temporary pumping station. Dis-
counted cost analysis showed that the second alternative is more economic
although more complicated.
