                                P098850

                                  Restructuring Paper



1.    The Closing Date for Georgia, Infrastructure Pre-Investment Facility [IDA Grant
No. H204-GE], P098850 will be extended from September 30, 2010 until January 31,
2011.

2.     Implementation of the project is nearly completed, with review and necessary
adjustments of received draft final reports pending. Project objectives continue to be
achievable.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to complete the review of draft final reports
under Component I (Khudoni hydropower feasibility study) of the project. The review
may expectedly lead to minor additional work to make the reports final, as advised by the
Panel of Experts in their report of September 2010. Also, contractual arrangements for
the feasibility study work will be revised during the extension period.

4.     This will be the 2nd extension of the project. Cumulative extensions do not
exceed the 2 years period.

5.      There are no outstanding audit reports under the Project.6. The Designated
Account "A" (The Ministry of Energy) with the balance of USD 240,000 remains
inactive from November 18, 2009. The Task Team has agreed with the PIU that the
documentation application will be signed and sent to CTRDM PRC Zagreb not later than
September 29, 2010. However, such original withdrawal applications will not be received
by the original Closing Date (September 30, 2010) since the delivery takes 3-4 days.
Considering that the implementation of the Project is nearly completed and that limited
payments are yet to be made, any amount that will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures should be refunded from the Designated Account.
