7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The development objective of the Project is to facilitate infrastructure investments that have strategic 
importance and/or special complexity by ensuring that proper feasibility work is carried out in a timely 
manner in order to enable the government to make sound investment decisions, and where appropriate, to 
proceed expeditiously with further preparatory steps and mobilize adequate financing for implementation.  
The focus on energy and transport sectors is consistent with Governments investment priorities and CPS 
objectives. Specifically, the Project will finance technical assistance (TA) to assess the feasibility and 
effectiveness of identified investments through preparation work including technical and sectoral studies, 
engineering design, and analysis of economic, financial and environmental feasibility, as well as financial 
and legal advisory services, where required.
