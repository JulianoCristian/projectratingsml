The IPF comprises two components: 1) TA for\n            Khudoni Hydropower project (HPP) preparation, to assess its\n            technical, economic and financial viability, and to\n            determine how the hydropower project development would\n            proceed in compliance with appropriate environmental and\n            social safeguards, prioritizing on Dam safety. Should the\n            Khudoni HPP prove to be economically attractive (and\n            otherwise feasible), financial analyses would be undertaken,\n            and issues addressed concerning ownership and power sales.\n            2) TA for the preparation of transit corridor projects\n            entails two subcomponents: a) TA for the preparation of the\n            East- West Highway improvement, seeks to complete a\n            feasibility study, preliminary design, and environmental\n            assessment to upgrade the road from Natakhtari to Agaiani;\n            b) TA for the preparation of other transit corridor projects\n            shall be determined, dependent upon the availability of\n            remaining funds, following satisfactory results of the above\n            mentioned priority project components.
