                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project is to facilitate infrastructure investments that have strategic importance and/or special complexity by ensuring that
                         proper feasibility work is carried out in a timely manner in order to enable the government to make sound investment decisions, and where appropriate, to
                         proceed expeditiously with further preparatory steps and mobilize adequate financing for implementation. The focus on energy and transport sectors is
                         consistent with Governments investment priorities and CPS objectives. Specifically, the Project will finance technical assistance (TA) to assess the feasibility
                         and effectiveness of identified investments through preparation work including technical and sectoral studies, engineering design, and analysis of economic,
                         financial and environmental feasibility, as well as financial and legal advisory services, where required.

                         physical investments. Thus, further actions will be triggered in the future if/when the Government and/or investors seek to proceed with implementation of the Khudoni hydropower
                         project. No decision in that respect has been made.
