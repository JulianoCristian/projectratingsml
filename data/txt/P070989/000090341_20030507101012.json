The purpose of the reform program is to address key\n            sectoral issues, some of which need to be prioritized on the\n            basis of additional analytical work, to improve the quality\n            of education, and to realign the entire sector. The project\n            has 5 components: 1) Quality and relevance of general\n            education through curriculum reform for grades 1-11,\n            development and enhancement of teacher capabilities, and\n            provision of reading materials for school libraries. Design\n            and adopt the national curriculum framework, and prepare and\n            implement new national standards. Establish strong links\n            between education reforms and teacher professional\n            development, textbook and reading materials to stimulate\n            reading habits. 2) Reforms in financing and budgeting so as\n            to gain efficiencies in the use of financial, human, and\n            physical resources. 3) The proposed school grant program\n            will supplement limited resources of specific schools in the\n            three pilot districts to ensure that the poor are not\n            discriminated from benefiting from quality education; 4)\n            Management and planning capacity in the Ministry of\n            Education to use available resources more effectively and\n            efficiently. 5) Strengthening of coordination and monitoring\n            mechanisms under the project."}, "docdt": "2003-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
