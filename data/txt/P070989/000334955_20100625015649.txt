1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background

1.      Azerbaijan declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The country
experienced many of the similar challenges as other transition countries in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) ­ severe economic contraction during the
early 1990s, deterioration in social services and infrastructure, and a sharp increase in
poverty. In addition, the early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno-
Karabakh armed conflict with neighboring Armenia resulting in nearly one million
Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and refugees. On the positive side, the country emerged
from the Soviet Union with significant oil and gas resources. The signing of a number of
Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) with oil companies in the mid-1990s and initiation
of a stabilization and structural reform program marked the beginning of a turnaround in
Azerbaijan's development prospects. Economic recovery began in 1996 with GDP growth
averaging more than 8 percent over the period of 1997-2002. Despite this progress, at the
time of project preparation (2002), GDP was still 40 percent less than in 1989 and nearly
half the population was below the national poverty line.

2.       The task of overcoming the legacy of inefficient production, outdated technology,
monopolies, environmental neglect and the absence of the institutions of a market economy
proved more difficult in Azerbaijan than initially anticipated. The record of policy and
institutional reform had been mixed, but there had been many clearly positive development
achievements since 2001. The success of the stabilization program, growing foreign
investor interest, and the prospect and associated risks of large-scale oil revenues seemed to
have strengthened the authorities' commitment to reforms. As part of the Poverty
Reduction Support Program (PRSP), formerly known as the State Program on Poverty
Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED), the Government developed a medium-
term strategy emphasizing tackling poverty and strengthening governance, with technical
cooperation from the international community. The most significant reforms included
establishing a State Oil Fund; strengthening governance in the banking sector; starting to
address implicit subsidies and the need for greater financial transparency in the utilities
sectors; some improvements in the structure of the public sector including consolidation of
several activities in the new Ministry of Economic Development; enactment of a modern
tax code; and the adoption of a more transparent budget execution and accounting, and
strengthening of internal and external audit capacity.

Sector Background

3.      The education sector suffered during the transition years. Although enrolment rates
remained high at independence and Azerbaijan was on track to meet the education related
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the quality of education suffered due to sharp
declines in real public expenditures on education. As a percentage of GDP, the public
spending on education in Azerbaijan had continually fallen since the end of the Soviet
period from 7.6 percent in 1993 to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2006. Even though there were no
conclusive data to monitor trends in student learning outcomes during the transition, the
results from the Student University Entrance Examination at the end of general education
                                             1
(grade 11) indicate poor quality of general education. For example, more than half of the
candidates score below the failing mark (300 points). The following main problems were
likely to have contributed to the decline in the quality of general education: outdated
curriculum and teaching methods, ineffective teacher education and training system, low
teacher salaries and poor learning environment as suggested by shortages of textbooks,
reading materials and supplies. The latter point was further influenced by a shift from
Cyrillic to Latin script in Azerbaijan, in the early 1990s. Partly as a result of this shift, there
was a severe shortage of reading materials in Latin script that could foster reading habits of
students, support core curricula and encourage independent thinking. Moreover, growing
inequalities in access to high quality general education, inefficient use of available
resources and weak management, planning and monitoring capacity at the central and local
levels posed further challenges to the sector.

4.      To address the above challenges, the Government developed and approved a
comprehensive Education Reform Program in 1999, which had a strong focus on
improving the quality and relevance of student learning to meet the needs of a market
economy and strengthening the capacity for managing resources for education effectively,
efficiently and equitably. The Program targeted: (i) curriculum reform and teacher training;
(ii) provision of educational materials including textbooks; and (iii) educational
management and finance. As such, the Government followed through with reforming the
curriculum and in-service teacher training, and developed new textbooks and materials for
general education. By the time of appraisal (Spring 2003), the Government had identified
further priorities and specific directions for the development of the education sector in the
draft Ten-Year Education Reform Strategy (2003-2013) prepared by the Ministry of
Education.

5.     The capacity to carry out these ambitious reforms as well as to introduce the
required changes was largely dependent on access to additional financial and technical
resources. The Education Sector Development Project (ESDP), designed as a three phase
Adaptable Program Loan (APL), sought to support the Government's Program by
addressing four main sectoral issues:

    (i)     The need to improve the quality and relevance of general education.
    (ii)    The need to enhance efficiency in and effectiveness of the use of resources in
            the general education sector.
    (iii)   The need to reverse the deterioration of the coverage of general education
            enrolment.
    (iv)    The need to raise the capacity of the MOE, local education authorities and
            school principals to plan, manage, and monitor the education sector more
            efficiently, effectively, and equitably, including strengthening its accountability
            to the key stakeholders.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

6.      The ESDP was targeted at improving the quality of general education (grades 1 to
11) and realigning the entire sector with the needs of the emerging market economy and
social conditions. While the needs were pressing at all levels of education, it was agreed
that the proposed Program would focus on general education because of limited IDA
resources and the need for critical reforms at the general education level, which were
essential for successful reforms at the other levels. Moreover, the inclusion of other sub-
                                             2
sectors in the proposed Program would add complexity to the Program and the weak
implementation capacity of the MOE at various levels could jeopardize the reform process.

7.      The focus of the Project interventions on general education was consistent both
with the Government's State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development
(SPPRED) (2003-2005) and 2003-2005 Azerbaijan Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
since investments in general education were critical in the production of quality secondary
education graduates and poverty alleviation. The longer-term perspective of the APL was
to support the Government to carry out a system-wide reform, while providing the
flexibility to adjust and refine interventions of an ongoing basis. Moreover, the experience,
knowledge and skills gained under an earlier Bank supported education project (Learning
and Innovation Loan - LIL) had created a good prerequisite for further expansion of the
education sector reforms in Azerbaijan.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.      The Project constituted the first phase of a three-phase Program, which had the
overall objective of increasing learning achievements for all students to meet the needs of a
market economy and improve the efficiency of general education.

9.      The specific Project Development Objective (PDO) of phase 1 was to strengthen
the capacity to plan, manage and monitor the reform program more effectively and
efficiently and to initiate the highest priority investments in selected districts.1

10.     The following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were identified for monitoring
the Program, with six of them also serving as the outcome indicators for this Project.
Additionally, achievement of these six selected performance indicators would serve as
"triggers" for moving to the next phase of the Program.

11.      The key performance indicators were as follows:

(i)      Quality and Relevance of General Education
         National curriculum framework for grades 1-11 developed, standards developed
         and approved for grades 1-4 by the MOE; and new syllabi at least for two grades
         developed and ready for implementation on a pilot or nationwide basis. (Trigger 1)
         At least 9,000 general education teachers having participated in in-service teacher
         training programs.
         The results of national sample-based student assessment of grade 4 and 9 students
         in Mathematics and Azeri Language showing improved achievement between 2005
         and 2007.
         At least 90 percent of children in grades 1-5 have free of charge textbooks in "core
         subjects." (Trigger 2)

  The second phase of the Program would expand coverage and extend the scope of interventions and develop
further management skills, particularly at local levels, based on evolving needs. The final phase would
achieve full national coverage, consolidate interventions, and review the achievements of the reform program.

          District rationalization plans prepared in the three pilot districts, under terms of
          reference satisfactory to IDA, and approved by the Government and reviewed by
          IDA. (Trigger 4)
          Student-teacher ratio in general education increased from 10:1 in 2002 to 12:1 in
          2007 in the three pilot districts.

(iii)     Equity and Access to Quality General Education
          Gross enrollment rates of the age cohort 6-16 years olds increased from about 94
          percent in 2002 to about 96 percent in 2007.

(iv)      Management, Planning, and Monitoring Capacity
          Completion of a draft new organizational and staffing plan for the Ministry of
          Education (including the Institute for Education Problems). (Trigger 5)
          A Policy Analysis and Planning Unit (PAPU) in the MOE established and
          functioning by March 2004.
          Completion of a pilot sample-based reliable assessment of grade 4 student
          achievement in Mathematics and Azeri language. (Trigger 6)

          and functioning to support planning, policy analysis and monitoring.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

12.     There were no changes to the Project Development Objective and key performance
indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.    The 2003-2013 Program, including this Project, sought to benefit the entire Azeri
population because of improved quality and relevance of general education.

14.    More specifically, all children in primary and general secondary education, students
and teaching staff in the existing teacher training institutes, and all those working in the
education sector have benefited from the curriculum reform, teacher development activities,
the provision of reading materials, and strengthened planning, management and monitoring
capacity in the sector supported by the Project. This currently represents about 1.6 million
students in grades 1-11.

15.     Benefits of the Project have also accrued to about 45,000 students and 5,000
teachers in the three pilot districts who have benefited from the school improvement and
rationalization efforts as well as a school grant program.

16.    Long term benefits will be derived from the projected improvement in quality and
relevance of student learning as a result of better management and effective leadership, and
implementation of quality improvement programs in general education.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

17.    The lending instrument was a three-phase Adaptable Program Credit (APL)
designed for a ten year period (2003-2013). This Project was the first phase of the APL and
consisted of five components, as follows:

Component 1. Quality and Relevance of General Education. (Original Estimated Cost:
US$ 7.05 million equivalent)

18.    The objective of this component was to enhance the quality and relevance of
general education through the following subcomponents:

       Curriculum Development. This subcomponent aimed to strengthen the curriculum
       development capacity in the Institute for Education Problems (IEP), design and
       adopt the National Curriculum Framework, and prepare and implement new
       standards and syllabi for grades 1-11 and develop new syllabi at least for two
       grades.

       Teacher Development. This subcomponent was designed to support the MOE in
       two main areas: (a) continued development of in-service teacher training, including
       the mass-training of about 9,000 teachers (or 25 percent of the present primary
       education teachers), and (b) initial reforms for pre-service teacher education.

       Textbooks and Reading Materials. The objective of the subcomponent was to
       stimulate reading habits of grades 1-11 students and provide co-curricular reading
       materials as well as assist the Government in the development of its textbook policy.
       It was agreed that OSI-Azerbaijan would provide some of the technical assistance
       and training within the framework of the objectives of the Project in the area of
       textbook policy.

Component 2. Efficiency and Finance Reforms. (Original Estimated Cost: US$8.86
million equivalent)

19.    This component aimed to support the design and implementation of reforms in the
financing of education, rationalization and school improvement in the three pilot districts
through the following subcomponents:

       Financing and Budgeting Reforms. The subcomponent was designed to assist the
       MOE to institute reforms in financing and budgeting in order to gain efficiencies in
       the use of financial, human and physical resources in the education sector.

       Rationalization and School Improvement. The subcomponent sought to assist the
       MOE in three pilot districts to: (i) develop plans and rationalize the school network
       in order to gain efficiencies in school management and operations; (ii) develop
       standards for schools and school rehabilitation; and (iii) select and rehabilitate
       schools and provide furniture, basic equipment and teaching aids to the schools. In
       addition, this subcomponent sought to support improvement of school libraries, and
       the provision of information and communication technologies in a selected number
       of schools as part of the school improvement plans.

                                             5
Component 3. Upgrading Schooling Quality in Less Advantaged Rayons: School
Grant Program. (Original Estimated Cost: US$0.87 million equivalent)

20.    The School Grant Program (SGP) was designed to provide supplemental financing
to schools through a competitive process to improve attendance and enrollments of the poor,
as well as improve teaching and learning in poor schools. OSI-Azerbaijan support was
envisaged for the implementation of SGP through the provision of technical assistance and
Training.

Component 4. Management, Planning and Monitoring Capacity. (Original Estimated
Cost: US$2.34 million equivalent)

21.     This component aimed to strengthen the management and planning capacity in the
MOE to use available resources more effectively and efficiently. The component included
three subcomponents:

         Establishment of a New System of Student Assessment. The subcomponent sought to
         assist the MOE in developing a reliable and diagnostic system for the assessment of
         student learning outcomes.
         Establishment of Education Management Information System (EMIS). This
         subcomponent aimed to support the development of Education Management
         Information System (EMIS) in the MOE, the pilot districts and institutions integral
         to the implementation of education reforms (e.g. IEP).
         Development of Management and Planning Capacity of MOE. This subcomponent
         aimed to strengthen the capacity of the MOE to manage and plan the delivery of
         education services more effectively and efficiently, and increase accountability to
         its key stakeholders. In addition, limited support was provided for the development
         of the Center for Applied Research (CAR) in the Institute for Education Problems.

Component 5. Project Coordination and Monitoring.               (Original Estimated Cost:
US$1.87 million equivalent)

22.    The objective of this component was to support project management and
implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and the design and implementation of
communication strategy. The component would support strengthening a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) under the office of the Deputy Minister of Education (Rural
Education).

1.6 Revised Components

23.      No changes were made to the original components.

1.7 Other significant changes

24.    Appreciation of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) in relation to the US dollar
(US$). In the course of project implementation, ESDP benefited from additional project
financing resulting from the exchange rate gains. As a result of favorable exchange rate of
the SDR vis-à-vis the US Dollar, the original IDA Credit was increased from US$18
million equivalent to US$20 million equivalent. These extra resources were spent by
project completion to finance mostly participation in the international assessments of
                                            6
student learning achievement (PIRLS, TIMSS, and PISA), as well as other activities chosen
selectively to strengthen ongoing efforts aimed at improving quality of education and
consistent with the approved PDO.

25.     Project Extension. The Project closing date was extended two times from the
original closing date of March 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009:
     The first extension of the closing date was for one year, until March 31, 2009. The
        extension was granted in December 2007 to enable more time for carrying out
        activities related to the implementation of the new curriculum in Grade 1.
     The second extension was for six months, until September 30, 2009. The extension
        was granted in March 2009 to allow the Borrower additional time necessary to
        complete the selected activities with the additional funds resulting from the
        appreciation of the SDR.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26.     Participatory Design and Comprehensive Background Analysis. The Project's
quality at entry was positively influenced both by its participatory design and thorough
background analysis. The preparation of the Project relied heavily on two highly
participatory studies: (i) a social assessment in which local level stakeholders were
consulted on the issues concerning education and about their needs and priorities, and (ii) a
study of informal payments in education, which was based on a nationally representative
sample. In addition, two two-day participatory stakeholder workshops were organized to
discuss the Government's Education Reform Strategy, priorities for the next education
project, and the draft design of the proposed project.

27.     As part of project preparation, the Bank coordinated a joint identification mission
with the available donors in February 2002 to take advantage of other donor activities, in
particular, the work started by the Open Society Institute (OSI) in textbook policies and
teacher training programs and by UNICEF in pilot teacher education program and
preschool education program. It was agreed that OSI-Azerbaijan would finance limited
activities related to (i) the preparation of the school improvement plans, (ii) support of the
School Grant Program through the provision of technical assistance and training for
schools to write and implement grant proposals, and (iii) textbook policy and standards.

28.     Project preparation was supported by a PHRD grant in the amount of US$ 461,503,
which financed several studies laying the foundation for the ESDP components. The
studies were carried out in the following key areas: national standards and curriculum
reform; teacher education; education economics and finance; education management;
education research and policy; EMIS and school mapping; information technology;
instructional technology; monitoring, evaluation and assessment; and textbook
development.

29.   Strategic Relevance. The Project was consistent with the strategic goals of the
2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and responded to the needs identified in the
Government's Ten-Year Education Reform Strategy (2003).


                                              7
30.      Given the scope of education reform and the Government's commitment to a long-
term strategic vision, the three-phase, 10-year programmatic approach was chosen for
ensuring achievement of the Project's objectives and long-term sustainability. Project
design focused on quality improvement, efficiency and financing, equity and access, and
management strengthening at the general education level. Despite the various needs in the
education sector, the decision to limit the first phase of the Program to general education
(including both primary and secondary) by financing priority investments in three pilot
districts while supporting substantial reforms at the national levels was based on three
main reasons: (i) the need for critical reforms at the general education level; (ii) the need
for simplicity and clarity in the design and flexibility in implementation given the weak
implementation capacity of the MOE; and (iii) the need to strengthen the organization and
institutions tasked to implement the proposed reforms before comprehensive reforms could
be expanded at other levels of education.

31.     Lessons Learned from the Previous Bank Projects. Project design incorporated
lessons and experience from the Bank's first Education Reform Project in Azerbaijan
(Credit No. 3220-AZ), namely a US$5 million equivalent - Learning and Innovation credit
(LIL) - which was launched in 1999. The LIL piloted curriculum reform and teacher in-
service training in selected pilot institutions and schools in the country. One important
lesson from the above-mentioned LIL was the need for the Ministry to accept responsibility
for the reform process and take ownership of project implementation. During the
implementation of the LIL, the lack of involvement of key implementing units of the
Ministry in the initial design of the Education Reform Project and a lack of understanding
of their responsibility for project implementation led to weak initial ownership by the
Ministry as well as weak project implementation. For that reason, the design of the
Education Sector Development Project (ESDP) envisaged closely integrating project
management into the overall operation of the Ministry of Education. Namely, direct
responsibilities for the implementation of project components were assigned to relevant
Ministry officials, whereas PCU's responsibilities were limited to project financial
management, procurement and coordination.

32.    Design of efficiency and finance interventions. While the comprehensive sector
analysis carried out during project preparation made it possible to clearly diagnose the
needs and priorities for the reform of the education sector in Azerbaijan, the ICR team
believes that the design of the efficiency and finance reform component and related
outcome indicators to be overly ambitious since the political economy was not propitious
for advancing these reforms. In order to implement finance and efficiency reforms
successfully, strategic decisions were to be made at different levels of the Government and
by different Ministries for which political readiness was low coupled with technical
capacity constraints.

33.     Risk rating. The Project was rated as of Substantial Risk at the time of preparation.
Project risks were adequately identified, including the one related to the implementation of
finance and budgetary reforms. The latter required major changes to be instituted by the
Ministry of Finance in the existing finance and human resource policies and procedures and
were beyond the powers of the MOE.                However, as evidenced during project
implementation, mitigation measures envisaged during preparation were not sufficient to
ensure successful implementation of those components that required support and resources
from other levels of government.

                                             8
2.2 Implementation

34.     The Project was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on May 27, 2003
and the Credit became effective six months after Board approval. Delays in the date of
signing and then in the date of effectiveness were partly the result of the presidential
elections (October 15, 2003) and government approval procedures to meet the conditions of
effectiveness.

35.     The early years of project implementation (2004-2005) were marked by significant
implementation delays due to the lack of readiness and capacity constraints of the Borrower.
Based on supervision documentation, it is apparent that the initial implementation setbacks
were related to the following key factors: (i) the Bank's complex procurement procedures
coupled with relatively low procurement capacity and lack of readiness in the Ministry
resulting in delays in the identification and procurement of technical assistance and civil
works for the key activities; (ii) weak coordination with the Ministry of Finance often
resulting in long delays in the approval of contracts; and (iii) lack of coordination between
different departments of the Ministry of Education responsible for project implementation.

36.    The Bank conducted a Mid-term Review (MTR) after two and a half years of
implementation (June 2006) and concluded that while project implementation had
accelerated throughout 2006, the overall Implementation Performance rating was
Moderately Unsatisfactory due to the accumulated effect of initial implementation delays.
Namely, the new primary education curriculum was not ready for nation-wide
implementation in 2007-2008 school year and the implementation of the financing and
budgeting reforms was also behind the schedule.

37.     Despite the initial implementation delays, the Project made significant progress in
the aftermath of the MTR as it resulted in renewed commitment to an accelerated
implementation schedule. Significant progress was made in several key areas: (i) design of
the curriculum reform and introduction of a new textbook policy entailing the free
distribution of textbooks in core subjects; (ii) establishment of a national system of student
assessment involving national testing and participation in international assessment; (iii)
establishment of the EMIS and the Strategic Analysis, Planning and Personnel Units at the
Ministry of Education; (iv) approval of a plan for the reorganization and staffing of the
Ministry of Education; and (v) adoption of a national strategy for the professional
development of teachers. By July 2007 all six triggers to move toward the next phase of the
Program had been met.

38.     By the end of 2007, most of the planned activities were on track, with total
disbursements reaching 61 Percent of total credit proceeds. However, there was a
considerable delay with the envisaged in-service teacher training activities. The initial
delay with the development of the primary school curriculum had prevented the timely
development and launching of the related in-service teacher training for the 9,000 teachers
needed for the nation-wide implementation of the new curriculum starting for the 2008-
2009 academic year. It became evident that the time left before project closing was not
sufficient to carry out the training and that about US$ 800,000 equivalent would be left
undisbursed. Therefore, a one year extension was granted to support the nationwide
teacher training for the implementation of the new curriculum in Grade 1.


                                              9
39.     As previously stated, due to exchange rate gains and savings from successful
procurement processes, the original IDA Credit was increased by about US$2 million
equivalent. A decision was made to use these funds to finance the country's participation in
international assessments of student learning achievement (PIRLS, TIMSS, and PISA) as
well as other activities selectively chosen to strengthen ongoing efforts consistent with the
Project's Development Objective. Thus the Project was granted another six month
extension to allow the Borrower additional time necessary to complete those activities.

40.    Overall, the effectiveness of project implementation improved in the aftermath of
the mid-term review and ESDP was able to eventually meet its goals. This was primarily
due to the fact that project implementation, though carried out by a Project Coordination
Unit (PCU), was well integrated into the Ministry. While the PCU was responsible for
procurement, financial management, and project monitoring and evaluation, it was the
heads of the relevant departments/units of the Ministry who were directly responsible for
the implementation of day-to-day project activities associated within their mandate. Such
implementation arrangements have gradually triggered stronger ownership for the Project
and, at the same time, have contributed to building adequate reform implementation
capacity at the MOE level.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.     Project design envisioned the elaboration and implementation of a monitoring and
evaluation plan to support evaluation and policy studies to monitor and assess the outcomes
of the Program against a set of performance indicators. The PCU, under the guidance and
supervision of the office of Deputy Minister of Education, was responsible for the design
and implementation of the project monitoring plan. Largely, the Ministry was able to
carefully monitor both overall reform and implementation progress. The Project
Implementation Supervision Reports (ISRs) demonstrate that project indicators were
monitored and updated regularly.

42.      Monitoring and evaluation of the Project was undertaken through:

         Baseline and Evaluation Surveys. Baseline surveys for the Project were carried out
         in May 2005 exploring the following issues: teaching methods, school principals'
         attitudes, parents' attitudes, textbook availability, library resources, management
         review and performance audits in the pilot districts, and policy analysis and strategy
         development. The baseline survey was replicated in May 2007 and the comparative
         analysis report of baseline and follow up surveys were produced by the PCU.
         Progress Reports. The detailed quarterly reports were produced regularly providing
         information on the status of impact/outcome and output indicators set out in the
         project Results Framework.
         Selected evaluation studies. Additionally, the following evaluation studies were
         carried out: evaluation of School Grants Program and the pilot funding experience.

43.      The ICR benefited from the data and information extracted from the above sources.




                                              10
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

44.      Safeguard. The environmental category for the Project was B (Partial Assessment)
as it included financing the rehabilitation and refurbishment of schools in three pilot
districts (Ali Bayramli, Ismaili, and Ujar). As part of preparation, an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was developed by the Government and published in local papers.
Following the disclosure of the EMP, the MOE organized consultative meetings in Baku
and in the three districts, involving key stakeholders (school directors, teachers, parents and
NGOs). While both PAD and Development Credit Agreement (DCA) included a provision
for rehabilitation and refurbishment of school buildings and of the National Center for
Student Assessment, neither document included a provision for new construction. However,
as part of the region-wide Portfolio Review carried out in December, 2008, the team
realized that one construction had been carried out with Project funds in 2004 - an
extension wing was built to the Ministry of Education to provide office space for the
National Center for Student Assessment. The Bank had provided the no objection to the
NCB bidding documents for the construction of the expansion. The expansion took place
on government land and did not involve any resettlement.

45.     While the expansion was fully consistent with the Project Development Objectives
and neither triggered a new safeguard nor changed an existing one, the Bank's team
consulted with OPCS to determine the correct way to proceed in terms of ensuring
compliance with Bank procedures and consistency in project documentation. The
discussion took into account the fact that a region-wide safeguard review was carried out in
2007 in which the Project was reviewed and no issues were raised. The team was advised
to carry out a 3rd order restructuring with a corresponding amendment to the DCA and
subsequent disclosure to the Board via Monthly Operational Summaries. The amendment
to DCA was introduced on May 8, 2009 to retroactively record said change in the project
description in Part D.1 (iii) of Schedule 2 to the DCA to ensure a full compliance with the
Bank policies and procedures.

46.    Fiduciary. Project implementation was facilitated by a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) established within the Ministry of Education. Procurement, contracting processes
and financial management were the responsibility of the PCU. The Project's procurement
plan was approved and closely monitored by the Ministry of Finance. During the initial
years of project implementation there were significant delays in the procurement of
technical assistance and civil works mostly due to the slow approval of contracts by the
Ministry of Finance as well as the lack of familiarity of the PCU with the Bank's
procurement procedures. However, starting toward the end of 2005, the PCU was able to
build sufficient procurement capacity and the procurement processes significantly
improved. During implementation, the Project's annual financial and external audit reports
were presented with no significant delays, and no serious internal control observations were
reported. The Project's audit reports were unqualified throughout implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

47.    The sustainability of the Project's post-completion operation is very likely both in
terms of the availability of adequate financial resources to continue interventions launched
under ESDP and government commitment to further advance education reforms. Given that
the second phase of the APL (Second Education Sector Development Project ­ Credit No.
4394-Az) was approved in April 2008 and became effective in December 2008, adequate
                                             11
financial resources will be available to move towards a full-scale implementation of the
preparatory work carried out under the first phase of the Program. The two phases of the
APL will ensure support for the implementation of the many interventions launched under
the first phase, such as curriculum reform, teachers' professional development, student
assessment, and education reform management capacity at the national, regional and local
levels.

48.   The approval of the follow-up operation is a good demonstration of the
Government's continued commitment to long-term education reform agenda. Government
commitment is also well evidenced by mainstreaming some of the ESDP interventions into
MOE's regular operations, as described below:

49.     Pre-service teacher training. The Higher Education Unit of the MOE is
responsible for addressing the reform of pre-service teacher education. In pursuing pre-
service teacher education reforms, the Unit plans to build on the achievements made in this
area as part of ESDP.

50.   Textbook Policy. The Textbook and Publishing Unit of the MOE in collaboration
with the Textbook Approval Board has already taken ownership over systematic
implementation of the new Textbook Policy.

51.     The School Grant Program. Annual competitions for the allocation of grants to
the 100 best teachers as well as 50 best schools are evidence of sustainable implementation
of the ideas promoted by the School Grant Program implemented under the ESDP.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

52.    The Project supported key interventions targeted at improving quality, efficiency
and financing, equity and access to general education and management strengthening.

53.    The Project's objectives were relevant at the time it was prepared, and continue to
be relevant today. They are fully consistent with the Bank's 2006 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Azerbaijan as well as the new State Program on Poverty Reduction and
Sustainable Development (SPPRSD) for 2006-2015. Likewise, the Program remains
consistent with the new CPS (FY 2007-2010) strategic objective of improving the quality
of and access to social services. With respect to education, the CPS specifically mentions
the importance of developing a modern education system and globally competitive
knowledge economy.

54.   The progress made under the first phase of the APL has laid a strong foundation to
move the education reform to the next level as part of the next phase of the Program.




                                            12
3.2 Achievement of Project and Program Development Objectives

Achievement of Project Development Objectives:

55.     The Project's achievement of its Development Objective is assessed as Moderately
Satisfactory given that it was able to achieve many of its expected outcomes albeit with
some delay. Significant progress has been made in several key areas, namely in the design
of curriculum reform and introduction of a new textbook policy entailing the free
distribution of textbooks in core subjects; establishment of a national system of student
assessment involving national testing and participation in international assessment;
establishment of the EMIS and the Strategic Analysis, Planning and Personnel Units at the
Ministry of Education; the approval of a plan for the reorganization and staffing of the
Ministry of Education; adoption of a national strategy for the professional development of
teachers.

56.     One challenge in assessing performance is that the Program's 12 key performance
indicators listed in the main body of the PAD, including the six triggers applicable to this
Project, are not fully compatible with the outcome indicators listed in the PAD's results
framework (Annex 1) and in the Development Credit Agreement. Likewise, whereas the
Project's ISRs only reported on key performance indicators, the PCU quarterly reports and
evaluation surveys measured the outcome indicators of Annex 1 of the PAD. Therefore, in
order to rate the Project's achievement of its development objective, the Bank team
reviewed both sets of indicators, focusing on both the six "trigger" performance indicators,
and the nine outcome indicators listed in the results framework.

57.     The assessment of Project's outcome indicators in this ICR is consistent with the
Borrower's own completion report provided in Annex 7. The latter report indicated that all
project key performance indicators were fully met and assessed achievement of most
project outcome indicators as "Satisfactory" except for the two indicators (related to
efficiency and finance reforms and student to teacher ratio) that were assessed as
"Moderately Satisfactory".

58.     In terms of the key performance indicators, the Project was able to meet all six
indicators, as discussed below:

59.    Trigger 1: National curriculum framework for grades 1-11 developed, standards
developed and approved for grades 1-4 by the MOE, and new syllabi for at least two grades
developed and ready for implementation on a pilot or nationwide basis.

Evidence to date: Achieved. The National Curriculum Framework, including content
standards for general education (grades 1-11), was developed by the MOE and approved by
the Cabinet of Ministers in October 2006. Subject area curricula for primary grades were
approved in July, 2007. The MOE carried out the piloting of the curricula for first grade in
23 schools of Baku in the 2007-2008 academic year. The nationwide introduction of Grade
1 subject curricula was launched in the 2008-2009 academic year.

60.    Trigger 2: At least 90 percent of children in grades 1-5 have free of charge
textbooks in "core subjects."


                                            13
Evidence to date: Achieved. The project evaluation survey carried out in 2007 revealed that
over 95 percent of children in grades 1-5 received free of charge textbooks. The textbook
survey carried out in May 2009 by Sigma (a firm hired by the PCU for this purpose)
confirmed lack of disparities in access to core textbooks.

61.    Trigger 3: New funding formula and mechanism prepared and implemented on an
experimental basis in the three pilot districts.

Evidence to date: Achieved. A per-student financing formula was developed, approved by
the Cabinet of Ministers in April 2006 and implemented on an experimental basis in 59
schools in the three pilot districts in 2007.

62.    Trigger 4: District rationalization plans prepared in the three pilot districts, under
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, and approved by the Government and reviewed by
IDA.

Evidence to date: Achieved. The district rationalization plans were developed and approved
by the Ministry of Education on October 17, 2005. The rationalization plans were
implemented in the pilot districts but not on a full scale. As part of the reform, 41 schools
were rehabilitated and administrative measures were carried out to promote rationalization
of human resources including adoption of regulations for competence-based selection of
teachers and principals. The process did not result in the closure of inefficient schools. No
significant efficiency gains have been reported apart from modest increase in the student-
teacher ratio in the pilot districts, as reported elsewhere.

63.    Trigger 5: Completion of a draft new organizational and staffing plan for the
Ministry of Education (including the Institute for Education Problems).

Evidence to date: Achieved. Three new departments (Monitoring and Assessment Unit,
Education Management Information System Unit, Strategic Analysis and Planning Unit)
were established in the MOE. Structural changes were made in the Institute for Education
Problems (IEP), new regulations were approved and newly established structural divisions
(Curriculum Center, and Center for Applied Education Research) were staffed through a
competitive recruitment process. The organizational and staffing plan for MOE and IEP
was finalized in 2007 although originally planned for 2005.

64.    Trigger 6: Completion of a pilot sample-based reliable assessment of grade 4
student achievement in Mathematics and Azeri Language.

Evidence to date: Achieved. The sample-based assessments in mother tongue and
mathematics in grades 4 and 9 were conducted in April-May 2006. Analysis of the
assessment results was made available in the spring of 2007. Results were widely discussed
with the MOE and stakeholders.

65.     In terms of the nine outcome indicators listed in Annex 1 of the PAD, as described
below, the Project was able to fully achieve five of its nine outcome indicators and to
partially achieve the reminder four outcome indicators. Most of these indicators, as
pointed out below, are directly related to the six indicators discussed above.


                                             14
66.     Outcome Indicator 1: Curriculum development capacity established in the
restructured Institute for Education Problems by 2006. (Related to indicator 1 above:
National curriculum framework for grades 1-11 developed, standards developed and
approved for grades 1-4 by the MoE; new syllabi developed at least for two grades and
ready for piloting)

Evidence to date: Achieved. A Curriculum Center was established within the restructured
Institute for Education Problems (IEP) in December 2004. Adequate capacity, both in terms
of human and physical resources, has been built in the Curriculum Center as evidenced by
the fact that the Center was able to successfully develop the National Curriculum
Framework and launch phased nationwide introduction of the new curriculum in Azeri
schools in 2008/2009 academic year.

67.    Outcome Indicator 2: Management and planning capacity of the MOE and local
governments strengthened and performing their functions efficiently and effectively.
(Related to indicator 5 above: Completion of draft organizational and staffing plan for the
Ministry of Education, including the Institute of Educational Problems.)

Evidence to date: Achieved. The activities supported in the course of the ESDP
implementation have resulted in the strengthened management and planning capacity at the
MOE as evidenced by the (i) introduction of planning and reporting system at MOE
prompting each department to develop a three-year strategic plans; (ii) the establishment of
key new units in the MOE (such as Strategic Analysis and Planning Unit (SAPU),
Monitoring and Assessment Unit (MAU), Education Management Information Unit
(EMISU), which are critical for improved management and planning of the system. These
new units have played an important role in pursing education reforms in the country. No
research based evidence is available that would evaluate management and planning
capacity of the local government. Nonetheless, as part of ESDP, management trainings
were provided to the rayon education department administrators. Representatives of the
district education departments were also involved in the implementation of the School
Grants Program. These activities have likely contributed to capacity building at the local
government level as well.

68.    Outcome Indicator 3: Education statistics, including learning outcomes, are
readily available at the national level and pilot districts and published in the form of
"Education Indicators" for policy makers and the public by 2006. (Related to indicator 6
above: Completion of a pilot sample-based assessment of grade 4 student achievement in
Math and Azeri language.)

Evidence to date: Achieved. Despite significant initial delays, the new EMIS was able to
generate and make publicly available (through the MOE website) a school-by-school
database. The first MOE statistical report was issued in 2008. Results of the examinations
as well as data on student assessments are also available on the Ministry's website.

69.    Outcome Indicator 4: Policy makers and education stakeholders use the results of
learning outcomes and reliable statistics in their policy analysis and strategy development.

Evidence to date: Achieved. ESDP produced excellent progress in terms of making
available reliable school statistics and data on student learning outcomes. Both the
education statistics generated by the EMIS and data on student learning outcomes based on
                                            15
national sample based assessments, centralized graduation examinations in 9 regions of
Azerbaijan and international assessment (PISA 2006) is available on the MOE's website.
However, the evidence to judge the actual application of education data to inform policy
making by the MOE leadership is not available.

70.    Outcome Indicator 5: 25 percent of primary teachers (about 9,000) are familiar
with the new curriculum, teaching methods, and assessment targets and begin to reflect
those changes in their teaching practices during the 2007-2008 school year.

Evidence to date: Achieved. About 18,000 primary school teachers have received training
in modern teaching methodology and assessment tools required for the implementation of
the new curriculum. According to the "Textbooks and Curriculum Implementation Survey"
carried out in 2009, 40 percent of 1st grade teachers are satisfied with the quality of
trainings received, 80 percent of the same teacher group indicate the need for more
trainings.

71.     Outcome Indicator 6: Present disparities in access to core textbooks (based on
new curricula) in basic education grades (grades 1-9) eliminated by 2006. (Related to
indicator 2 above: At least 90 percent of children in grades 1-5 have free of charge
textbooks in core subjects.)

Evidence to date: Achieved. The "New Textbook Policy in General Education System,"
entailing free distribution of textbooks in core subjects, was developed and approved in
March 2006. The ESDP evaluation survey (2007) revealed that over 95 percent of children
in grades 1-5 received free of charge textbooks. No disparities in access to core textbooks
for basic education are reported by the "Textbooks and Curriculum Implementation Survey"
carried out in May 2009. ESDP also provided supplementary reading materials to all school
libraries.

72.     Outcome Indicator 7: Student-teacher ratio in general education increased from
10:1 in 2002 to 12:1 in 2007 in the three pilot districts.

Evidence to date: Partially achieved. As a result of rationalization activities as part of the
ESDP, only moderate increase in STR was achieved based on EMIS data.2

                                                   2002                                2006
    Ismaili                                        8.9/1                              10.9/1
    Ujar                                          10.7/1                              11.8/1
    Ali Bayramli                                  10.9/1                                12/1

73.     Outcome Indicator 8: Efficiency and finance reforms, including district
rationalization plans, prepared and implemented successfully in the three pilot districts by
2007. (Related to indicators 3 and 4 above: New funding formula and mechanism prepared
and implemented on an experimental basis in three pilot districts. District rationalization
plans prepared in three pilot districts and approved by the Government and IDA.)


2
  According to the information provided by the Ministry of Education, Student to Teacher Ratio was 9 to 1 in
the pilot districts in 2007. The difference is due to different methodology used to calculate STR.

                                                    16
Evidence to date: Partially Achieved. Under the efficiency and finance reforms, ESDP
supported two key interventions in the three pilot districts: design and implementation of
reforms in the financing and budgeting of education (introduction of the new financing
formula and resource allocation mechanism, and the implementation of a system of school
accountability) and school rationalization and improvement (school district rationalization
plans; rehabilitation and provision of furniture, basic equipment and teaching aids to
selected schools). These interventions were targeted at increasing the efficiencies in the use
of financial, human and physical resources in the education sector.

74.     Despite important progress in the development and initiation of activities under the
efficiency and finance component of ESDP, implementation faced serious shortcomings
due to existing legal constraints in budgeting and financing of education. At the time of
ESDP preparation, there was a clear gap in the existing legal framework that constituted a
real obstacle to the successful implementation of the anticipated reforms in financing and
budgeting. Therefore, one of the objectives of the Project was to promote changes in
budgeting and financing system in order to achieve the much needed flexibility, efficiency
and local accountability. However, as explained in further detail below, throughout ESDP
implementation, there was insufficient support within the relevant Government entities for
adjusting the framework and removing the existing obstacles.

75.     A per student financing formula was designed under the Project. The Government
approved the piloting of a new funding formula for 59 schools in the three pilot sites
(Shirvan city, Ismailli and Ujar districts) in early 2007. Since 2005, these pilot schools had
operated their own treasury accounts and employed school accountants. However, the
implementation of the new funding scheme in the pilot schools experienced serious
shortcomings.. An initial evaluation of pilot experience in the 59 schools by the MOE has
revealed several key weaknesses in the implementation of the new funding system. Namely,
the following issues were raised: (i) although the per capita formula was used to calculate
budget of the pilot schools, several cases were reported when the school budget was
afterwards randomly changed (either increased or decreased) by the district finance
departments without reapplying the formula; and (ii) the MOF approved the pilot school
budgets not as a lump-sum amount but as a line-item, thus preventing schools to shift
between line item expenditures. The latter has limited autonomy of schools to prioritize
spending at their discretion. These issues stemmed from the existing legal and regulatory
gaps in the sector. The Budget Law of Azerbaijan prohibits making changes to line-item
budgets allocated to schools. Although the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers had exempted
59 pilot schools from this requirement in order to provide them with a certain degree of
financial autonomy, from the legal perspective the law prevails over the decision of the
Cabinet of Ministers. Moreover, familiarity with the objectives of the new funding system
was low among finance departments and school councils of the pilot districts; this, coupled
with the limited technical capacity and readiness of the school administrators to manage
under the new system, contributed significantly to the weaknesses mentioned above

76.     The district rationalization plans were developed, approved (Ministerial order #715
as of October 2005) and implemented in the three pilot districts. The plans envisaged
closure of small and inefficient schools, rehabilitation of needy schools, and increase in
Student Teacher Ratio through rationalization of human resources. As part of the reform, a
total of 41 schools were rehabilitated (23 in Ismailli, 3 in Ali Bayramli and 15 in Udjar)
and provided with furniture and ICT equipment. Administrative measures were also carried
                                              17
out to promote rationalization of human resources, but no significant efficiency gains have
been reported. Moderate increase in STR was achieved through the implementation of the
district rationalization plans in the pilot districts, as reported above. However, as part of
implementing district rationalization plans, optimization of small and inefficient schools
did not take place.

77.    The implementation of the two key interventions supported by the efficiency and
finance component did not translate into significant efficiency gains due to the
implementation shortcomings explained earlier. The Bank does not consider that the
reforms were fully and/or successfully implemented. For this reason, this indicator is
considered partially achieved, while the related indicators, which are defined in a narrow
manner, are considered achieved. A comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency and finance
reforms carried out under ESDP may provide solid basis for continuing dialogue with the
Government and expanding finance reforms under the second stage of the program.

78.   Outcome Indicator 9: Society at large express support for education reform by
2007.

Evidence to date: Partially achieved. A survey of parents, teachers and school officials
carried out in 2007 revealed that 58 percent of school principals (52 percent in baseline), 54
percent of parents (50 percent in baseline) and 53 percent of teachers (51 percent in
baseline) were satisfied with the educational system, which shows a moderate increase
from the baseline survey conducted in 2005. In the pilot districts, satisfaction was 4 percent
to 9 percent higher among teachers, parents and school directors. However, the satisfaction
of rural population with education reform decreased from 42 percent at baseline to 37
percent in follow-on survey.


3.3 Efficiency

79.     Given that this is the first phase of an APL, one would not expect significant
efficiency gains until the completion of the Program, particularly as the full-scale
implementation of many reforms launched under this project, and results from these
interventions, would most likely be measurable toward the end of the Program. For this
reason, an economic analysis of the Project was not carried out for this ICR.

80.      An important future economic benefit of the Project, and the Program at large, is
that it is expected to contribute to laying an important foundation to promote the efficient
use of the education budget, and ensuring that students benefit from quality education and
acquire the necessary skills to eventually join Azerbaijan's labor market. For example, the
large economic benefits of the Project's investments in curriculum implementation will
only be reaped 10-15 years from now when these same students learning under the
improved curriculum enter the labor market.

81.     At the same time, the Bank team recognizes that the contribution of the
interventions supported under the Project to make the education system more internally
efficient, by piloting a new funding formula and district school network rationalization
plans, was modest. Nonetheless, as a result of the implementation of the efficiency and
finance component, the average student teacher ratio increased up to 11 in 3 pilot regions in
2009 as reported earlier.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.      The Project's overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory given that the
Project was able to achieve many but not all of its expected outcomes. The first phase of
the Program has built an excellent basis for improving the education system in Azerbaijan
over the Program's remaining life-span. As a result of Project interventions, management
and planning capacity of the MOE and local governments was significantly strengthened.
In this regard, good progress was achieved in the reorganization of the Ministry's structure
and establishment of several key new units, such as Strategic Analysis, Planning and
Personnel Unit (SAPU), Monitoring and Assessment Unit (MAU) and Education
Management Information System Unit (EMISU). The establishment of the Education
Management Information System (EMIS) and introduction of national assessments of
student learning achievement have provided adequate tools for the Ministry to strengthen
capacity for planning and monitoring education reforms. At the same time, trainings in
management and planning techniques were provided to the rayon education department
administrators. The Project produced some excellent results in the design and introduction
of new curriculum, free provision of textbooks to students in core textbooks, and, on a
more limited basis, in teacher training and development. At the same time, not all activities
were implemented to the full scale envisioned during project design and have demonstrated
mixed results. This is particularly true of the efficiency and finance component envisaged
under the Project as previously explained. The component accounted for a significant share
of project costs and the fact that it did not succeed in achieving the intended outcomes to
the full extent results in a Moderately Satisfactory rating.

83.     The Project's relevance was high both with respect to the Government's overall
strategy for education and the Bank's 2006 CPS. Quality and efficiency reforms supported
by the Project still remain as priorities for further development of the education system in
Azerbaijan. The majority of interventions under this Project laid solid foundation for
further education reform to be pursued under the second phase of the Program.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

84.     There is strong evidence that the Government remains committed to the majority of
project priorities as evidenced by the launch of the follow-up operation focusing on scaling
up the implementation of the new curriculum, teachers' professional development, student
assessment, and education reform management capacity.

85.     One area of concern that poses risk to the full achievement of the Program
Development Objective is that there is yet no final strategy in place to expand pilot
activities supported under the finance and efficiency component of the Project to the
national level. Taking finance reform to the next level will be critical given the remaining
needs to improve efficiency in the use of resources in the general education sector through
increased student to teacher ratio and greater increase in the share of non-salary items in the
general education budget.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.     Project preparation was supported by analytical work and financial support
extended as part of the PHRD grant, which was approved in 2001 to assist the Government
to prepare the ESDP. The main strength of project design and preparation lay in the ability
to accurately identify and prioritize the reform needs of the country in the framework of the
Government's Education Reform Program of 1999 and the draft Ten Year Education
Reform Strategy. Given the Government's long-term agenda and commitment for education
reforms, the choice of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument was appropriate for
ensuring achievement of the operation's development objectives and sustainability. Quality
at entry was also strengthened through intensive consultation with stakeholders as part of
the participatory stakeholder workshops undertaken throughout project preparation (2002-
2003) as well as through close dialogue and partnership with the existing donors.

87.     The quality at entry was reviewed by a World Bank internal Quality Enhancement
Review (QER) Panel in September, 2002. The QER panel highlighted positive aspects of
the project design, namely the relevance of the project design to the client's needs and
preferences, the Bank's experiences with the first education project (LIL) in Azerbaijan and
the political realities of the country that would affect implementation possibilities. The
QER panel also stressed the areas which needed improvements. These were: to simplify
and constrain the project design considering weak implementation capacity of the Ministry
and to build on the successes under the LIL; to limit the scope of the project to components
that the MOE had the power to implement and that were proper functions of the central
ministry since the sector had significant problems that ideally should but could not be
tackled because they were outside of the control of the ministry. The one shortcoming in
the Bank's performance during the lending phase is that implementation capacity was
overestimated. As a result there were significant implementation delays in the early stages
of implementation. Moreover, the team had underestimated lack of support for advancing
efficiency and finance reforms under the Project. Mitigation measures envisaged during
preparation were not sufficient to ensure successful implementation of those components
that required support and resources from different levels of government apart from the line
Ministry.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

88.     The Bank invested ­ in close cooperation with the Government ­ an enormous time
and effort into very close supervision of project activities in order to proactively apply
reality checks to the effective implementation of the Project and address issues on a timely
basis.

89.     Given the slow implementation progress during the earlier implementation years,
the final achievements of the Project are impressive. Throughout implementation, the Bank
was proactive in supporting the main counterparts in implementing the Project. Bi-annual
                                             20
supervision missions (a total of 13) and a mid-term review helped the counterparts with the
implementation, and problem areas were identified and addressed promptly, as well as
recorded in Aide Memoires and Implementation Status and Results (ISRs) Reports. Given
the initial procurement problems resulting from low capacity, as described earlier, the
Bank's team was very proactive in identifying the bottle-necks and addressing issues as
they arose.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.   The Bank's performance during project preparation and supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory as discussed above.




                                            21
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.      The Government remained committed to project goals throughout the entire period.
The Government's Ten-Year Education Reform Strategy laid a strong foundation for the
project design. A Special Working group established under the MOE played an effective
role at the project preparation stage.

92.     The performance of the Government varied between the earlier and later stages of
project implementation. There were shortcomings in the Government's performance in the
early stages (2003-late 2005) related to micro-management and heavy bureaucratic
procedures. Initial slow disbursements and serious implementation delays resulted from the
extensive and bureaucratic requirements for most of the procurement processes that
involved required approvals by the Ministry of Finance and placed an unnecessary burden
on the PCU staff during the initial years. Following the MTR, the Government's
performance improved substantially and government officials worked closely with the
Bank's team on a continual basis and were proactive in resolving the start-up delays. The
Government demonstrated its full commitment by accelerating project implementation and
producing the desired results. At the same time, lack of support for the financing and
efficiency reforms meant that this part of the Project did not achieve its full potential.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

93.     One of the strong aspects of the Project was that implementation was well
integrated into the Ministry of Education since the responsibility for the execution of
project activities under each and every component and subcomponent was clearly assigned
to the managers heading organizational units within the Ministry and not to the PCU. This
feature has strongly contributed to the strong ownership and commitment towards ESDP.
The high level of commitment of all MOE departments to the overall goals of the
Government's educational reform program and to the implementation of the Project made
it possible to largely achieve the ESDP goals despite serious initial delays.

94.     The PCU team had a high degree of commitment to achieving the development
objectives and it had adequate skills for fulfilling this commitment. The several staffing
constraints of the PCU that arose at different points in the course of ESDP implementation
were effectively addressed. The PCU managed the Project well and provided effective
communication between the Bank and the MES staff responsible for the project
components. All representatives of MES with whom the ICR team consulted expressed
great appreciation of the hard work and professionalism of the implementing agency and its
team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     Overall, this ICR's assessment of the Borrower performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

                                           22
6. Lessons Learned

96.     Reflecting on the overall Project, the key lessons that have been learned and/or
reinforced during implementation are as follows:

       The choice of APL instrument was appropriate given the Government's long-term
       vision and comprehensive reform agenda reflected in the Ten-Year Education
       Reform Strategy. The APL provided an overall framework for the achievement of
       the program's development objectives over time and ensuring continuity and
       sustainability of sector policies.
       Given the complexity and range of needed reforms, carrying out systematic sector
       assessments during project preparation is essential and contributes to better project
       design. Throughout implementation, the MoES carried out studies in the following
       key areas: national standards and curriculum reform; teacher education; education
       economics and finance; education management; education research and policy;
       EMIS and school mapping; information technology; instructional technology;
       monitoring, evaluation and assessment; and textbook development.
       Integrating project management into the overall operation of the line Ministry
       triggers greater ownership and responsibility for the reform process. ESDP was
       designed as such that while the PCU was responsible for procurement, financial
       management, and project monitoring and evaluation, it was the heads of the
       relevant departments/units of the Ministry who were directly responsible for the
       implementation of project activities associated within their mandate. Such
       implementation arrangements gradually triggered stronger ownership for the Project
       and at the same time contributed to building adequate reform implementation
       capacity at the MOE level.
       The implementation of comprehensive finance reforms involving changes in the
       structure and management of the system requires political support as well as strong
       leadership of the respective line Ministry in order to stimulate the needed inter-
       ministerial collaboration and sufficient support for the change at all levels of the
       Government. This factor coupled with technical capacity constraints prevented
       scaling up efficiency and finance reforms under the ESDP.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

97. The Borrower's completion report was provided by the Ministry of Education and was
    incorporated in annex 7. The assessment of the ESDP implementation progress and
    achievements presented in the Borrower's report is consistent with the findings of this
    ICR.
    Comments on the ICR were received from the Cabinet of Ministers, including feedback
    from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of
    Finance. Government comments have been reflected in the ICR. An unofficial

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Quality and Relevance of General Education

Curriculum Reform

By Project completion, this component was considered Satisfactory as it had achieved most
of its outputs.

The National Curriculum Framework, including content standards, has been developed and
approved in 2006. The new curriculum is outcomes oriented and student centered, designed
to promote active teaching and learning environment as opposed to rote learning and
mechanical transfer of knowledge. The National Curriculum provided a framework for the
development of subject syllabi for primary grades (1-6), which were adopted in 2007. The
new curriculum was successfully piloted in grade 1 in 2007-2008 academic year in the
selected schools. The nationwide introduction of the new curriculum in grade 1 was
launched in 2008-2009 academic year.

Teacher Development

The new policy document, namely the Strategy for Teacher Professional Development, was
approved by the government. New subject "Foundations of Education", encompassing
pedagogy, psychology, teaching methods and skills development through interactive
learning methodology, was introduced in pre-service teacher training of primary school
teachers. Introduction of new syllabi for pre-service training of primary school teachers
was launched on a pilot basis in the State Pedagogical University, Azerbaijan Teachers
Institute and Ganja State University. The staff of these institutions was trained to acquire
knowledge and skills required for the implementation of new pre-service training curricula.

The development of in-service teacher training programs based on new syllabi was
supported by the Curriculum Center. To support these trainings, all affiliates of Azerbaijan
Teachers Institute were provided with ICT, furniture and other equipment. In addition, two
branches (Mingachevir and Jalilabad) were renovated. Approximately 18000 primary
school teachers ware provided with in-service teacher trainings under this subcomponent.

Textbooks and Reading Materials

The achievements of this subcomponent have been significant.

The results indicate considerable successes in improving access to textbooks and the
availability of supplementary teaching and learning materials in schools. The end of ESDP
evaluation survey conducted in 2007 revealed that 97 percent of students in grades 1-5
have free of charge textbooks. Survey results also indicate that by 2007 the MOE has
improved provision of free of charge textbooks in other grades of general education as well.
As part of the ESDP, all schools were provided with child encyclopedia (18 titles) and
maps (19 titles).

The subcomponent also supported the development of the new textbook policy. The new
document "Textbook Policy in General Education System was developed and approved as
part of the ESDP. Independent Textbook Evaluation Board was established in order to
                                        26
ensure transparency in textbook development and procurement. Based on the new policy
document, all textbooks are required to include teacher's guide and student's workbook.

Textbook policy development under the project was supported by the OSI-Azerbaijan
through the provision of textbook consultancy and a number of trainings, seminars and
roundtables for policy makers, textbook publishers, evaluators and authors.

Component 2: Efficiency and Finance Reforms

By Project completion, this component was able to only partially achieve its original
outputs. This component was rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

Finance and Budgetary Reforms

Although important steps were made in designing and implementing on a pilot basis the
efficiency and finance reforms under this subcomponent, the implementation process faced
significant shortcomings and the government was not ready to scale up these reforms as
part of the phase one of the program.

The government approved the piloting of a new funding formula for 59 schools in the three
pilot sites in early 2007. The reform involved an introduction of per-capita financing and
the lump-sum budgets for the pilot schools. Since 2005, these pilot schools had operated
their own treasury accounts and employed school accountants. However, the
implementation of the new funding scheme in the pilot schools experienced serious
shortcomings as it relates to granting adequate level of school financial autonomy to
schools, including for reallocation of funds from salary to non-salary budget lines. The
difficulties, as explained in details earlier, were related both to legal gaps and lack of buy-
in and adequate support in this part of the reforms by the Ministry of Finance at the time of
implementation.

However, the comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency and finance reforms carried out
under ESDP is envisaged under the phase two of the program and may provide solid basis
for continuing dialogue with the government and expanding finance reforms under the
second stage of the program.

Rationalization and School Improvement

The district rationalization plans were developed, approved (Ministerial order #715 as of
October 2005) and implemented in the three pilot districts. The plans envisaged closure of
small and inefficient schools, rehabilitation of needy schools, increase in STR through
rationalization of human resources. As part of the reform, Total of 41 (25 in 2006 and 16
in 2007) schools were rehabilitated (23 in Ismailli, 3 in Ali Bayramli and 15 in Udjar) and
provided with furniture and ICT equipment. Administrative measures were also carried out
to promote rationalization of human resources, but no significant efficiency gains have
been reported. Moderate increase in STR was achieved through the implementation of the
district rationalization plans in the pilot districts, as reported elsewhere.

The activities under this subcomponent were also supported by OSI-Azerbaijan, as a result
of which trainings were provided to school teachers in the pilot district in the application of
Information Communication Technologies (ICT). Moreover, framework on ICT
                                              27
application policy was developed and educational multimedia resources were piloted and
disseminated in secondary schools.

Component 3: Upgrading Schooling in Less Advantage Rayons: School Grant
Program

The component was rated Satisfactory as it had achieved its intended outputs.

The objective of the School Grant Program (SGP) was to supplement the limited resources
of schools and to promote equity and access to quality education in order to improve
enrollment and attendance rates. Implementation of SGP was also accompanied with
comprehensive training programs in partnership with the Open Society Institute of
Azerbaijan. OSI facilitated networking among school communities from non-pilot and pilot
regions and supported the development of manual on school proposal design,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Total of 173 schools received grants
throughout the three phases of SGP implementation. In addition, given the success of this
component in terms of making non-salary resources accessible to schools, the MOE
decided to expand this activity country wide and administer school grants program
annually. By the Presidential decree dated Sept. 2007, grants were awarded to the best 50
schools to improve the quality of education.

Component 4: Management, Planning and Monitoring Capacity

The component was rated Satisfactory, as it had achieved most of its intended outputs.

The component supported carrying out the national assessment of Mathematics and Azeri
language in the 4th and 9th grades, and school-leaving graduation examinations at the end of
the 11th grade, developing assessment standards for the new curricula to be used in the first
four grades, elaborating a Concept Paper on the National System of Student Assessment,
participating in PISA 2006. The National Center for Student Assessment was established to
become a national agency for the evaluation of quality of education. Furthermore, the APL
1 has helped the Ministry of Education to establish a new EMIS Department. The
department has already finalized the development of School Mapping, Human Resources,
Financial, and Archive modules. In addition, APL 1 supported the MOE in drafting a new
organizational and staffing plan, including job descriptions and job requirements.

Component 5: Project Coordination and Monitoring

By project completion, the achievements of this component were considered Satisfactory.

The management of ESDP was streamlined into the overall operations of the MOE since
project components were managed by the respective MOE officials (department heads).
The PCU was fully incorporated in the MOE and successfully carried out project
coordination, procurement, financial management, monitoring and reporting.

The following table provides detailed description of outputs by components.

                                                           implementation of the new funding system. Namely, the
                                                           following issues were raised: (i) although per capita formula
                                                           was used to calculate budget of the pilot schools, several
                                                           occasions of interference were reported with the budget by
                                                           the district finance departments; (ii) MoF approved the pilot
                                                           school budgets not as a lump-sum amount but as a line-item
                                                           budget therefore limiting autonomy of schools to reallocate
                                                           between the line items and prioritize spending at their
                                                           discretion; (iii) both the awareness and support for the
                                                           objectives of the new funding system was low among
                                                           finance departments and school councils of the pilot
                                                           districts. This is further exacerbated by the fact that there is
                                                           no permission from MoF to shift budget across line items.

                                                              Difficulties are related to legal and regulatory gaps. The

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

To solicit comments and assessments around the key interventions implemented as part of
ESDP, the Bank education team organized phone interviews with six project stakeholders
(teachers, school principals, head of district education department). Main findings and
observations are summarized below:

       Curriculum Development

Teachers and principals provided positive assessment of the new curriculum framework
developed as part of ESDP. The new curriculum was thought to provide more freedom to
teachers in selecting teaching materials and resources as well as better opportunities for
increasing student motivation:

       New curriculum is implemented in grades 1 and 2. It allows the teachers to choose
       the teaching method they prefer, encourages them to use materials from the Internet
       and other resources in addition to textbooks. It also prompts students to search for
       information, which enables them to grasp the materials better and more deeply.

       Teacher Development

The respondents indicated that workshops and teacher professional development
opportunities offered as part of ESDP have equipped teachers with new knowledge and
skills to improve the teaching and learning process. However, some concerns were raised
about the duration of the training sessions.

       I have regularly taken part in the workshops organized by the Ministry of Education
       under the World Bank supported project. These workshops have helped me to learn
       and apply new teaching methodologies. Thanks to these workshops, I learned how
       to organize my classes more effectively and integrate new approaches.

       Around 90% of our teachers have taken part in in-service teacher training
       programs. The results are positive. In 2006, 3 of the 15 students enrolled in grade
       11 were able to receive high scores and enter good universities. Since the project
       implementation 60-65 percent of our graduates enter universities. Our School also
       became one of the winners in best school competition in 2008.

       Many of our teachers have been trained in 2008-2009. Also, out primary teachers
       were trained in the implementation of new curriculum. The trainings have
       contributed to teachers' development. Unfortunately, these trainings are a bit short
       (one week long).




                                            41
       Textbooks and Learning Materials

All respondents were satisfied with the availability of core textbooks and other teaching
and learning resources available in their schools.

       We receive textbooks and learning materials from the Ministry of Education and
       Heydar Aliyev Foundation. Also, our library is connected to the Internet. Moreover,
       our school is subscribed to the Curriculum Journal published on a quarterly basis
       by the Ministry of Education.
       We received 18 titles of books and encyclopedias under ESDP.

       We receive books on time and there is no shortage of them.

       School Grants Program

The respondents have reported that the school grants program has enabled to improve
learning environment in schools.

       We took part in three projects: new library for innovative learning in school,
       implementing innovations in chemistry classes, and implementing innovations in
       math classes.

       Schools in my rayon education department have taken part in various school grant
       projects.

       Implementation of New Funding Formula and District Rationalization Plans

Overall familiarity of the respondents on this part of the reform was relatively low as
opposed to other parts of the reform. Those respondents who were knowledgeable about
the efficiency and finance reform have reported implementation shortcomings both with
respect to the introduction of the new funding formula and district rationalization plans.

       Unfortunately, the Finance Department does not grant us autonomy to distribute
       the funds we receive according to our needs. New funding formula is not fully
       implemented.

       25 of schools have received autonomy to use budgets according to their needs. The
       system has not been efficient so far.

       Rationalization plan is not implemented even though there is a draft plan, which
       has been developed several years ago.

       I.      EDUCATION CONTEXT IN AZERBAIJAN PRECEDING THE
               ESDP

1. At independence in 1991, Azerbaijan, like other countries in the Commonwealth of
   Independent States (CIS), inherited a relatively well-developed educational system
   from former Soviet Union. However, since independence, the educational system has
   been deprived of resources, and the general standard of education has visibly declined.
   The situation has further deteriorated by the emigration of many highly educated
   professionals. In addition, the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, which led to the
   displacement of over one million people, also resulted in the loss of all schools in that
   territory, amounting to about one-fifth of Azerbaijan's total number of schools.
   Azerbaijan has been struggling to retain the positive achievements of the past education
   system while introducing education sector reforms appropriate to the needs of an
   independent democratic state and an emerging market economy. Though some reform
   efforts were made after independence the real education reforms in Azerbaijan started
   with a comprehensive Education Reform Program approved by the President and the
   National Parliament in 1999. The program aimed at (i) improving the quality and
   relevance of student learning; and (ii) strengthening its capacity to manage its resources
   effectively, efficiently and equitably. The Education Reform Program stressed the need
   to improve the quality of services to meet the needs of the market economy and
   targeted: (1) curriculum reform and teacher training; (2) provision of educational
   materials including textbooks; and (3) educational management and finance. On the
   wave of this Program the Government of Azerbaijan implemented the first Education
   Reform Project financed by Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) of the World Bank
   during 1999-2004 (Note: Implementation of LIL was rated "satisfactory" in the
   Completion Report prepared by World Bank hired consultant). Since the approval of
   Education Reform Program, Azerbaijan made some progress in initiating reforms in the
   education sector, with particular focus on curriculum reform and in-service teacher
   training, and the development of new textbooks and materials for general education. In
   2003, the Government of Azerbaijan in cooperation with the World Bank prepared the
   Ten-Year Education Reform Strategy with reflection of the following main areas of
   concerns: (i) improvement of the quality of teaching and learning; (ii) the establishment
   of a student learning assessment system; (iii) teacher development (pre-service and in-
   service teacher training); (iv) strengthening of management and governance; (v)
   improvement in the efficiency in the use of resources; (vi) upgrading curriculum for
   general education; (vii) provision of new equipment and learning materials; (viii)
   improvement in access to quality education; (ix) improvement of the availability and
   the quality of textbooks in general education; and (x) improvement of the quality of
   higher education. Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument was chosen to finance
   the Ten-Year Education Reform Strategy in three phases. Education Sector
   Development Project (ESDP) has been designed to cover the first phase of APL in
   2003-2008.

       II.     ACHIEVEMENTS OF ESDP

Component 1: Quality and Relevance of General Education

Sub-Component 1: Curriculum Reform

2. Institutional building for curriculum development: Major curriculum reform and
   implementation related problems in general education of Azerbaijan were inadequate
   institutional capacity to conceptualize, design, develop and implement the new school
   curricula, including: (i) shortage of qualified and experienced curricula developers; (ii)
   limited knowledge and expertise among teacher trainers, administrators, supervisors,
   and methodology personnel on curricular issues in particular outcome based curriculum
   model; (iii) insufficient resources that restrict the curriculum development institution to
   perform its basic functions (e.g., lack of financial resources for staff development and
   basic education equipment and materials, etc.); (iv) limited consultation with teachers,
   parents, civil society, NGOs and regional representatives in the curriculum
   development process; and (v) lack of a systematic approach to curriculum development
   with the result that the curriculum development process appears very fragmented. With
   the aim to overcome these problems a Curriculum Center at the Institute of Education
   Problems has been established, staffed and provided with necessary facilities and
   equipment to play the role of key organization responsible for curriculum development
   and reform process. Implementation of staff development activities for the Center such
   as local and international trainings, study visits etc. provided valuable support to
   building capacity for sustainable curriculum development. Contracting international
   and local consultancies has even empowered the Center and ensured necessary
   expertise required for curriculum reform process during ESDP life. The Center has got
   knowledge and skills to engage, train and manage curriculum developers and produce
   relevant curricula for general education in Azerbaijan.

3. Curriculum development and introduction: Outdated curricula were a major concern
   for the improvement of quality and relevance of general education in Azerbaijan.
   Curricula for general education were outdated and overloaded with large percentage of
   the information irrelevant for the needs of the emerging market-based economy and
   democratic society. The whole curriculum in its form of "Educational Programs"
   lacked coherence and didn't not provide the opportunity for the systematic development
   of knowledge and skills by the progressive movement from simple to complex and by
   the integration of overlapping subject topics. Also, the knowledge and skills taught
   through these subjects focused on facts, rigid procedures, the ability to recall
   information and to carry out computations etc. Many of the subjects lacked content that
   could stimulate children's thinking and reasoning abilities. In this regard the main
   achievement under ESDP has been the development of National Curriculum for general
   education and its approval in 2006 by the Cabinet of Ministers. Learning outcomes and
   content standards, subjects taught at each level of general education, organization of
   pedagogical process, basic principals of evaluation and monitoring of learning
   outcomes are presented in National Curriculum. National Curriculum has provided a
   framework for development of the subject syllabi for primary grades of general schools
   and their approval by the Ministry of Education in 2007. Learning outcomes per grades,
   content and assessment standards as well as relevant learning strategies are covered in
   subject curricula. The didactic bases of these curricula are demand-driven, outcome-
   based and student-oriented principles. Outcome-based principle is the predetermination
                                           44
   of outcomes; demand-driven principle is the responsiveness of learning goals for the
   needs of society, state and individual; student-oriented principle is to teach the learners
   the life relevant skills and knowledge. Introduction of new curricula in first grade of
   general schools started in 2008-2009 school year all over the country. Introduction of
   new curricula up to 2009-2010 school year have been supported under ESDP by:
    implementation of public communication campaign on new curricula including
       dissemination seminars throughout the country and printing and dissemination of
       curriculum sensitization materials including school calendars etc.
    development of "Curriculum Internet Portal",
    establishment of "Curriculum" journal.

Sub-Component 2: Teacher Development

4. Teacher development concept: The overall quality of both pre-service teacher
   education and in-service teacher training in Azerbaijan was deteriorated considerably
   during the transition period after independence. Though teachers in general education
   have been required to undertake in-service education every five years, resource
   constraints have restricted the provision of in-service teacher training in Azerbaijan.
   Despite this requirement a significant percent of teachers in rural areas never attended
   in-service teacher training programs. Baku In-service Education Institute and
   Azerbaijan Teachers Institute with its affiliates around the country are the main
   recognized providers of in-service teacher training in Azerbaijan. Most of these teacher
   training institutions were poorly staffed and equipped to deliver effective teacher
   training. The teacher training process has been rather mechanical and more supply- than
   demand-driven. Pre-service teacher training is offered in both specialized secondary
   institutions (technicums) for primary school (grades 1-4) teachers and in universities for
   teachers in grades 5-11. The system of pre-service teacher education in Azerbaijan has
   also been facing numerous challenges, including: (i) a lack of professional linkages
   between teacher training institutions and schools (as well as between the teacher
   training curricula and the school curricula); (ii) emphasis on narrow specialization,
   which needs serious revision in order to reduce the number of subjects studied; (iii)
   limited awareness of the range of new and innovative teaching and learning
   methodologies and the use of teaching materials and equipment in the preparation and
   professional development of teachers; (iv) limited qualifications and experience of
   teacher training staff and limited staff development opportunities; (v) lack of basic
   equipment and materials for effective teaching and learning in teacher education
   institutions. In order to address these problems comprehensively, the Strategy and
   Concept Document for Continuous Teacher Development has been developed and
   approved in 2007 by the Cabinet of Ministers. As seen from the title, all aspects of
   teacher development are integrated as a conception in this document. The document
   focuses on strategic development priorities, such as, the changes of the content of
   teacher development (pre- and in-service training and retraining), structure and
   management of the system of teacher recruitment, teacher development, and
   establishment of quality assurance system.

5. Pre-service teacher training: The main achievement in changing the content of teacher
   development has been the development of Curriculum Framework as well as Subject
   Syllabi for Pre-service Training of Primary School Teachers and their approval by the
   MoE in 2008. The process of curricula development included involvement of

                                             45
   international and local consultancies as well as local and international trainings and
   study visits. The special peculiarity of these curricula is that they are outcome-based.
   Initially competencies for teachers were identified in new curricula, then competencies
   were transferred into learning outcomes and content lines were drafted in a way that
   will enable to achieve the learning outcomes. The other special feature of curricula is
   that Education Foundations subject, comprising of pedagogy, psychology, teaching
   methods, and principally, skills development through active/interactive learning
   technology was included in new curricula. Teaching this subject will play an important
   role in upgrading the quality of teacher development and in moving from theory to
   practice. Introduction of new syllabi for pre-service training of primary school teachers
   started on a pilot basis at the State Pedagogical University, Azerbaijan Teachers
   Institute and Ganja State University in 2008. Teaching staff of these institutions have
   been trained to get knowledge and skills on implementation of new pre-service training
   curricula. A new textbook has been developed to support "Foundations of Education"
   subject newly introduced in pre-service teacher training of primary school teachers.

6. In-service teacher training: As was described in previous paragraphs in-service teacher
   training in Azerbaijan required a new content and regulation framework, which could
   be developed only after approval of Strategy and Concept Document for Continuous
   Teacher Development. Since approval of Strategy document could be late for
   introduction of new curricula in general schools the MoE had to offer a new in-service
   training for school teachers based on new school curricula. These in-service teacher
   training programs have been developed with the help of Curriculum Center. All
   affiliates of Azerbaijan Teachers Institute were provided with ICT, furniture and other
   office equipment as well as two branches (Mingachevir and Jalilabad branches) have
   been renovated to support these trainings. These trainings covered approximately 18000
   primary school teachers during the ESDP implementation period. After approval of
   Strategy and Concept Document for Continuous Teacher Development the MoE with
   engagement of international expert and broad consultation process started developing
   new regulation framework for in-service training. New regulation has been based on the
   following main principles:
    shifting from an input-based and supply driven to an output-based (demand driven)
       in-service training;
    opening of in-service training system to multiple public and private training
       providers and accordingly to multiple training contents and thus creating a
       competitive environment in-service training system.
   Implementation of new in-service training regulations is envisaged under Second ESDP.

Sub-Component 3: Textbooks and Reading Materials

7. Textbook policy: The Government of Azerbaijan made significant efforts to provide
   textbooks for grades 1-4 during years preceding the ESDP. For grades 5-11, textbooks
   have been normally purchased by households, but some parents of children in rural
   areas were not able to afford them because of income constraint. According to
   Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy the textbooks became free for all students in
   general education. The ESDP being part of the Poverty Reduction Strategy has
   monitored implementation of this committment throughout the project life. "End-of-
   project evaluation survey" of ESDP conducted in 2007 provided that 97 percent of
   pupils in grades 1-5 of general schools have free of charge textbooks. Survey results
   confirmed that by 2007 the MoE has improved provision of free of charge textbooks in
                                           46
   other grades of general education. In order to approach textbook development and
   provision in a comprehensive manner, a new policy document entitled "Textbook
   Policy in General Education System" has been drafted under ESDP. New textbook
   policy included the following sub-documents: (i); Textbook content (ii) Textbook
   evaluation criteria; (iii) Rules for development of new textbooks; and (iv) Technical
   and hygienic standards for textbooks. New textbook policy was approved after being
   agreed with relevant Government bodies and Cabinet of Ministers. Independent
   Textbook Evaluation Board was established in order to ensure transparency in textbook
   development and procurement. Since 2008 the textbooks developed on the basis of new
   school curricula have been printed and delivered to schools after being evaluated by
   this board. According to new policy the textbooks are now required to be accompanied
   by the teacher's guide and student's workbook. This set of books shall enrich the
   content of general education, and efficiently serve achieving learning outcomes of new
   curriculum.

8. Learning materials: The quality of learning environment in general schools was low in
   the period preceding the ESDP. This was due to the lack of access to teaching and
   learning materials. In the early 1990s, Azerbaijan shifted from Cyrillic to Latin script.
   As a result of this shift, there was a severe shortage of reading materials in Latin-script
   in the schools. To stimulate reading habits, support core curricula and encourage
   independent study and thinking, the ESDP financed procurement and supply of 18 titles
   of child encyclopedia (846 thousand copies) to all general school libraries in Azerbaijan.
   In order to improve learning environment in the schools the ESDP also financed
   provision of 19 titles of different maps to all schools.

Component 2: Efficiency and Finance Reforms

Sub-Component 1: Finance and Budgetary Reforms

9. The education budget in Azerbaijan, like in the other sectors, is a line-item budget
   based mainly on the Soviet era planning norms, and spending cannot be shifted across
   line items or between budget years. The rigid nature of this budgeting has undermined
   the ability of local education administrations to prioritize expenditures and to allocate
   resources according to local needs. To start addressing these obstacles 59 schools of
   Shirvan city, Ismailli and Ujar districts (pilot regions) have got financial independence
   under ESDP. Per-capita funding formula has also been developed and applied on pilot
   basis in these schools by the decree of Cabinet of Ministers. The development and
   application of financial autonomy and per-capita funding formula has been
   accompanied by international and local consultancies as well as local and international
   trainings and study visits. The new financing mechanisms have aimed to eliminate
   inequality in funding, involving school councils represented by the parents in budget
   planning, and stimulating the efficient use of funds. There were difficulties encountered
   during the implementation of the new mechanisms. Thus, during the monitoring
   conducted by the Working Group of the MoE it has been found out that there are
   violations of 3 basic principles of new financing mechanisms, which are as follows:
    Allocation of school budget on the basis of per-capita formula: Though the
    school budget was calculated pursuant to the per-capita formula, afterwards there
    were some cases of interference with the budget. The occurred cases of interference
    (either with increasing or decreasing the school budget) contradicted the principle

                                             47
       of per-capita funding. Though the school budget is calculated pursuant to the
       formula, afterwards finance departments interfered and randomly increased and/or
       decreased the funds (in most cases they were decreased). If the school budget
       calculated on the basis of the norms had not reflected the reality, it should not have
       been amended randomly but rather recalculated after having revised the relevant
       norms of the formula.
    Lump-sum allocation of school budget: The school budget has been submitted to
    the Ministry of Finance by the district education and finance departments not as
    lump-sum amount but broken down into expenditure line-items. Therefore, the
    Ministry of Finance approved the school budget not as a lump-sum amount but by
    expenditure line-items. However, normally the funds should have been allocated as
    lump-sum amount, and the school should have developed its annual breakdown of
    expenditures through distributing that amount among line-items. On the contrary,
    finance departments allocated funds by expenditure line-items, which limit
    autonomy of schools.
    Shifting between expenditure line-items by schools: This principle has not been
    understood by school councils and is not accepted by the finance departments of
    pilot districts. The reason is said to be the fact that the funds allocated by the
    Ministry of Finance are in reality by expenditure line-items (not lump-sum) and
    there is no permission from the Ministry of Finance to shift between items.
   Legal and regulatory gaps are the basis of these problems encountered during
   implementation. Thus, the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Budget System
   adopted in 2006 prohibits making any changes in any line-items of the budget allocated
   to a school which, in fact, decreases financial autonomy of schools. In accordance with
   the Decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, schools involved in the pilot have been
   permitted to make such changes to ensure that schools exercise financial autonomy and
   spend allocated funds for their needs. But because from the legal perspective the law
   prevails over the Decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, schools have not been able to
   fully benefit from the granted autonomy. Such legislative gaps allowed for mentioned
   interference with the development of school budgets and expenditure of funds.
   However it would be worth mentioning that all 59 schools which were financially
   independent managed their own grant funds themselves. This gives evidence that
   schools with relevant instructive and reporting arrangements can efficiently manage
   their own resources.

Sub-Component 2: Rationalization and School Improvement

10. School network rationalization: The high wage bill reflects over-staffing in the
    educational sector of Azerbaijan. If Azerbaijan were to achieve the average staffing
    ratio of the OECD countries for each of the three levels of education, it would employ
    36 percent fewer teachers. The small number of students per teacher in general
    education is the result of a complex chain of events. First, the highest ratios of students
    to teachers are found in the smallest rather than the largest schools. Second, low
    workloads are a major contributor to high staffing needs in general education. Third,
    the policy of permitting teachers to teach only in their area of specialization plays a
    substantial role in raising the number of teachers employed and in determining the low
    ratio of students to teachers. Taking all these factors into consideration the school
    network rationalization has been launched in the same 3 pilot regions (Shirvan city,
                                              48
   Ismailli and Ujar districts). Separate rationalization plan for each pilot region has been
   developed with the support of international consulting company and national
   consultants. The mentioned rationalization plans has been based on the analyses and
   social assessment carried out in these districts. The plans included closure of small and
   inefficient schools, transportation of students to other ones by buses, rehabilitation of
   needy schools, increase of student teacher ratio as a result of reduction of personnel
   resources and thereby rationalization of school network to considerable extent. But
   these plans, in account of objective reasons, have been carried out to a limited extent.
   The main reason is that the project didn't envisage procurement of transportation means
   (buses). However there have been following administrative activities which resulted in
   rationalization to some extent:
    identification of minimum class size with regard to establishing additional parallel
       classes in selected schools;
    pensioning off the teachers who have reached the pension age by taking into
       consideration level of their labor productivity;
    consideration of the issue of whether or not to employ the teachers with secondary
       education degree employed by schools;
    consideration of the issue of whether or not to employ the teachers with incomplete
       higher education who failed to proceed with their education in higher education
       institutions and thereby expelled from these institutions;
    adjustment of number of teachers, and especially of the master teachers in schools
       in accordance with workload (number of classes);
    suspension of recruitment of new teachers who are not necessary for schools;
    fixing a teacher's minimum workload at 12 hours.
   In support of rationalization activities 41 schools were rehabilitated and provided with
   furniture and ICT equipment. As a result of rationalization activities the average student
   teacher ratio increased up to 11 in 3 pilot regions in 2009. This increase has been
   achieved in spite of a sharp decrease of the number of pupils in Ismailli and Ujar
   districts from year to year. In these districts decrease of the number of pupils is
   especially related with demographic problems, migration, and with the pupils
   continuing their education in vocational and special secondary schools after completing
   9th grade. It is very important to note that while in the pilot regions the student-teacher
   ratio has increased (mainly because of ESDP intervention), the ratio has decreased
   nationally.

11. School building norms: The majority of school buildings in Azerbaijan were built
    according to old/Soviet standards for educational infrastructure, which are rigid in
    many respects and inefficient compared to generally recognized/international norms for
    education facilities. Most school infrastructures were outdated and largely inappropriate
    for modern/effective teaching methods. The existing school building norms, which
    were inherited from the former Soviet Union, have not been revised. On the other hand,
    planned transition to new national curriculum in the general education necessitated the
    change and efficiency of learning premises. An improved school building should create
    a condition for applying new teaching methods in new learning premises of 21 century.
    To achieve that a new "School Building Design Guidelines" has been drafted under
    ESDP using the international experiences and expertise of international and local
    consultants. Modern standards and norms for school construction are part of Guidelines
    which create great opportunities for efficient learning premises. The Guidelines have
    been developed for designing new type school buildings in Azerbaijan and is meant for

                                             49
   piloting during first years. These Guidelines, having been tested and improved every
   time may well contribute to the development of new norms and rules for construction
   nationwide. Requirements, proposals and recommendations for designing school
   buildings, considering local natural condition and climate, modern construction
   structure, new security and fire safety rules are provided in the Guidelines in order to
   apply new organizational forms of teaching. Principles of design are given in the
   Guidelines in a way that classrooms present inter-disciplinary, project-based,
   collaborative learning studio or flexible learning center and support 18 different
   learning modules. The objective of the Guidelines is to provide the compliance of the
   quality and character of the environment to be established with the educational goals of
   school, turn the schools to be built in the future into a place which is relevant for
   intellectual, creative, physical, and social activities, and at the same time a lively and
   hospitable place owned by pupils.

Component 3: Upgrading Schooling in Less Advantaged Rayons: School Grant
Program

12. The School Grant Program (SGP) has been designed to supplement the limited
    resources of schools and to promote more fully equity and access to quality and
    innovative education to improve enrollment and attendance rates. To implement the
    SGP a Manual has been developed and approved by the MoE. The Manual, later on,
    has been updated according to experiences from the preparation and implementation of
    the SGP. Based on the design, institutional arrangements and the selected criteria in
    approved Manual, the SGP has been implemented, monitored and evaluated for three
    phases in the three pilot regions (Shirvan city, Ismailli and Ujar districts).
    Implementation of each phase has always started with comprehensive training
    programs supported by the Open Society Institute of Azerbaijan, which has been a
    partner of the MoE for this component. Grants were provided to 46 winning projects in
    3 pilot regions in the 1st stage of the SGP for an aggregate utilized amount of USD
    175000. In the 2nd stage grants were rewarded to 73 winning projects for which USD
    351000 has been spent. Finally, 54 winning grant projects have implemented in the 3rd
    stage for an amount of USD 187000. Given the success of this component in terms of
    making non-salary resources available to schools, the MoE initiated allocating
    resources for such grants countrywide. In September 2007, the President of Azerbaijan
    Republic issued a Decree to award grants to the 50 best schools to further improve the
    quality of education and motivate the teachers. The regulation for the competition has
    been elaborated by the MoE and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Such allocation
    of grants became an annual practice of the MoE.

Component 4: Management, Planning, and Monitoring Capacity

Subcomponent 1: Establishment of a New System of Student Assessment

13. Student assessment concept: The peculiarity of assessment rules of Soviet period was
    that learners' assessment and assessment standards was never considered as a
    component of curriculum. This resulted in assessment being always based on the
    subjective observation of teachers which pushed pupils to study only for the sake of
    getting mark. Along with education standards, the assessment standards have also been
    integrated into the content of general education curricula. In order to comprehensively
    approach student assessment in Azerbaijan a document entitled "National Assessment
                                             50
   Concept for General Education" has been developed and approved by the Government.
   School-based, national and international student assessments are the main three
   types of assessment defined in the Concept to be implemented in Azerbaijan. As a first
   step in institutional arrangement for student assessment the ESDP supported
   establishment of a Student Assessment Unit in the MoE. This unit has been provided
   with building and all necessary equipment for administration of the assessments. The
   staff of the unit has been trained locally and internationally to better cope with the
   challenges of the unit.

14. National assessment: ESDP financed national assessment for Mother tongue and Math
    subjects in grades IV-IX in 2006. An internationally reputable organisation (CITO,
    Netherlands) has been involved in administration of this national assessment. The main
    finding of this assessment has been a difference in performance between rural and
    urban areas in both grades and subjects. Indeed, Baku (capital city) population scored
    highest. The availability of better equipment, materials and better qualified staff could
    be part of the explanation for the higher performance in urban areas. It is worth noting
    that students in both grades have been better at reading fictional texts than so-called
    every-day texts that any reader will come across in newspapers, magazines etc.

15. International assessment: International assessment in Azerbaijan started with the
    joining the PISA in 2006 under ESDP financing. The level of skills in mother tongue,
    math and sciences of 6500 15-year-old pupils in 72 general schools has been assessed
    under PISA in 2006. The performance of our pupils in math was very positive. They
    held the 4th place for theoretical skills among 57 countries in the rating chart. But as for
    the practical skills the performance of our pupils has been unsatisfactory. In order to
    track performance of Azerbaijan education in the world arena and get the best
    evidences of implications of education reforms in Azerbaijan the MoE during project
    life continued particpation in PISA 2009 and joined two more international student
    assessment programs namely PIRLS and TIMSS. The results of latter assessments are
    not known yet and therefore not part of the report.

16. School-based assessment: As a first step of changing school-based assessment,
    Ministry of Education has started to apply centralized general school leaving exams
    since 2005/2006 school year. The response cards in new exams are checked by optical
    mark readers and the results are disclosed in a short term. Such a way of organizing the
    examination minimizes the subjectivity factors. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of
    the MoE produced a first analytical report on the results of the secondary school
    graduation exam in 2008. This report deals with "quality indicators" by school and by
    subject and is certainly a significant contribution in terms of data availability for
    evidence-based policy decision-making in MoE.

Subcomponent 2: Establishment of Education Management Information System (EMIS)

17. At the start of the ESDP the MoE had the following deficiencies with regard to efficient
    operations and management: labor-intensive, slow for data aggregation, difficult for
    data analysis, time consuming and limited information. There was no centralized policy
    with regard to information (data) gathered (and reported) by the databases. At the MoE
    (and in the districts) there was no expertise or experience for EMIS implementation and
    management; and no responsible department or unit. Therefore, the ESDP supported
    establishment of EMIS unit at the MoE. This support has been provided by engagement
                                               51
   of international and local consultancies as well as financing of hardware and software
   for EMIS installation in MoE and district education departments including provision of
   necessary training. The EMIS unit started implementation of EMIS throughout the
   MoE and local education departments. Today, the EMIS database comprises
   information on general schools including comprehensive information on students and
   teachers, school principals and other staff, physical facilities etc. The EMIS Unit made
   publicly available a school-by-school database at the MoE official website. The Unit is
   also able to electronically receive and handle education statistics from the Rayon
   Education Departments. Although the EMIS database is rich of information about
   general schools and is available on MoE LAN there are not many users of EMIS
   nowadays. The main user of the EMIS is the Monitoring and Evaluation unit of the
   MoE for purposes related to implementation of different types of assessments including
   exams, national and international assessments. The main reason for limited use of
   EMIS is the lack of culture and skills to use computerised information database.

Subcomponent 3: Management and Planning Capacity

18. In 2003 the education sector was inadequately organized and managed for the delivery
    of education services. The MOE had a weak management and planning capacity to
    support tasks such as policy development and long term planning, and an effective
    monitoring and evaluation system that will assess the performance of the education
    system and the reform process. The functions required for implementations of
    challenging education reforms had not been appropriately reflected in the structure of
    the MoE. To address these problems first an Organization Plan for MoE and Institutte
    of Education Problems (IEP) has been developed and approved by the Minister of
    Education. Strategic planning and reporting has been introduced in MoE that implied
    introduction of 3-year planning by departments of MoE. By reorganizing the structure
    of the Ministry of Education the following new structural units have been established:
    (1) Strategic Analysis and Planning unit (SAPU); (2) Monitoring and Assessment unit
    (MAU); (3) Education Management Information System unit; (4) Preschool Education
    unit. These units made great contribution in reforms and development activities under
    ESDP. In order to support policy decisions with applied researches a Center for
    Applied Education Researchs (CAER) has been established in IEP. Taking the
    advantage of the wealth of information collected in the EMIS the SAPU has been able
    to produce MoE's first annual "Education Indicators Report". Such report is an
    important step in building the capacity within the MoE to analyze and make sense of
    large data sets. The most important achievement under this sub-component is the
    MoE's capacity built throughout the project implementation for designing, initiation
    and implementation of ambitious reforms in education sector.

Component 5: Project Coordination and Monitoring

19. Following a lesson learned from previous experience, management of ESDP has been
    integrated into the overall operations of the MoE. The project implementation scheme
    was quite complex and well managed and coordinated by the MoE staff (sub-
    components coordinators are civil servants employed in the MoE). Project Coordination
    Unit (PCU) has been fully incorporated in the MoE with the following functions:
    assisting MoE in coordination of project activities; monitoring and reporting on
    implementation progress, procurement and financial management.

                                           52
20. Coordination of ESDP activities: The PCU has made every effort to ensure that ESDP
    is coordinated at all levels as follows:
     Coordination at the Government level: The example of coordination at the
        Government level could be coordination of school financing reforms within the
        Government especially with the Ministry of Finance.
     Coordination at the MoE level: During implementation of ESDP the MoE has been
        implementing over 14 other state financed projects. These projects included
        activities related to the ESDP scope, which might lead to duplication or at least
        confusion if not coordinated in time.
     Coordination at the Project level: This included coordination between components
        and sub-components as well as with the partners of MoE in the ESDP such as Open
        Society Institute in Azerbaijan. The main instruments utilized here have been
        regular meetings of MoE leadership with ESDP implementers dedicated mainly to
        reviewing and analyzing reports by ESDP (sub) component coordinators.
     Coordination with the World Bank: This has been probably the most systematic and
        routine coordination and included all aspects of ESDP implementation. The PCU
        has been in day-to-day contact with the World Bank for every project issue. In
        addition there have been at least two supervision missions a year on ESDP
        implementation.
     Coordination with relevant activities financed from other sources: The best
        example of such coordination has been collaboration with UNICEF and Eurasia
        Foundation. Due to such collaboration, mainly achieved through ad-hoc meetings,
        the UNICEF financed international review of school and teacher development
        curricula prepared under the ESDP. Another result of such coordination has been
        the support of Eurasia Foundation to financially autonomous schools on topics
        related to school management.

21. Monitoring and reporting on implementation progress: Monitoring and Evaluation
    Plan of ESDP has been developed and agreed with the World Bank. Reporting system
    for ESDP has been introduced to be on quarterly basis. These quarterly progress reports
    have been prepared and submitted to the World Bank on time. The detailed M&E
    Report for the Second and Third Phases of School Grant Program (SGP), and an
    Overall Report of all the three phases of SGP has been prepared and submitted to the
    World Bank also on time. Based on Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, ESDP
    performance has been monitored closely through the list of key performance indicators.
    Progress towards key performance indicators has been reported regularly during the
    implementation of the ESDP. Baseline survey of ESDP was conducted in May 2005,
    mid-term evaluation in 2006 and end-of-project evaluation in 2007 with involvement of
    international M&E consultant and local consulting company. The comparative analysis
    report of baseline, midterm and end-of-project evaluation has been submitted in
    implementation progress report on September 30, 2007. Compliance with some of them
    has been given a function of "triggers" for authorization of the second phase of
    Program. The below table provides information on fulfillment of triggers during ESDP.

                     Triggers                             Implementation of triggers

      approved by the Government and                   Education on October 17, 2005.
      reviewed by IDA
 6.   Completion of a new organizational               Structural changes were made in Education
      and staffing plan for the Ministry of            Problems Institute and this trigger was met. New
      Education (including the Institute for           Regulations was approved and newly established
      Education Problems)                              structural divisions (Curriculum Center, and
                                                       Center for Applied Educational Researches)
                                                       were staffed through competition. 3 new units
                                                       were already established in the structure of the
                                                       Ministry of Education (Monitoring and
                                                       Assessment Unit, Education Management

                                                       Planning Unit) and were staffed through
                                                       competition.
 7.   Completion of a pilot sample-based               Census-based assessment in the mother tongue
      reliable assessment of grade 4 student           and mathematics subject of 4th and 9th grade
      achievement in Mathematics and Azeri             students were carried out in April-May 2006.
      language                                         Analysis of the outcomes was ready in the spring
                                                       of 2007.

22. Procurement management: Procurement plans have been developed and updated
    always on time and procurement process followed implementation schedule of ESDP.
    Goods, works and services for the ESDP have been procured in accordance with the
    Credit Agreement and World Bank procurement procedures were diligently followed.
    Training and guidance to pilot rayon education departments on procurement procedures
    under School Grant Program has been implemented on time. Almost 285 procurement
    packages have been processed, contracts signed and completed by the closing date of
    the ESDP.

23. Financial management: Project disbursements under ESDP amounted to total USD
    21.83 million. Implementation of these disbursements including (i) implementation and
    recording of daily financial transactions and tax payments, (ii) preparation and

                                                  54
   processing withdrawal applications for the World Bank and Government funds, (iii)
   preparation of different types of financial reports as well as (iv) arrangements for
   annual audits has always been on time.

       III.   RATING OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

The development objective of ESDP has been to strengthen the capacity to plan, manage
and monitor the reform program more effectively and efficiently and initiate the highest
priority investments in selected districts. This development objective is achieved by the
project as explained below by the status of outcome/impact indicators.

Outcome/impact indicators:

1. Curriculum development capacity established in the restructured Institute for
   Education Problems by 2006.

   Satisfactory: A new Organization Plan for Institutte of Education Problems (IEP) has
   been developed and approved by the Minister of Education in December 2004.
   Curriculum Center has been established at IEP, staffed and provided with necessary
   facilities and equipment to play the role of key organization responsible for curriculum
   development and reform process.

2. Management and planning capacity of the MoE and local governments strengthened
   and performs its functions efficiently and effectively

   Satisfactory: Strategic planning and reporting has been introduced in MoE that implied
   introduction of 3-year planning by departments of MoE. By reorganizing the structure
   of the Ministry of Education the following new structural units have been established:
   (1) Strategic Analysis and Planning unit (SAPU); (2) Monitoring and Assessment unit
   (MAU); (3) Education Management Information System unit (EMISU). The staff of
   these units has been trained by provision of local and oversees trainings. These units
   made great contribution in reforms and development activities under ESDP.

3. Education statistics, including learning outcomes, are readily available at the
   national level and pilot districts and published in the form of "Education Indicators"
   for policy makers and the public by 2006.

   Satisfactory: Since 2006 the EMIS database comprises information on general schools
   including comprehensive information by grade level, gender and location (rural and
   urban) on students and teachers, school principals and other staff, physical facilities etc.
   The EMIS unit made publicly available a school-by-school database at the MoE official
   website (www.edu.gov.az). Results of the examinations as well as reports on
   international and national student assessments are also posted on MoE website. Using
   these data the MoE issued first education statistics report in 2008.

4. Policy makers and education stakeholders use the results of learning outcomes and
   reliable statistics in their policy analysis and strategy development.

   Satisfactory: Policy analysis and strategy development is usually initiated by the high
   level leadership of the MoE to support and justify policy interventions from MoE.
                                            55
   Except SAPU the MoE units don't use extensively information about learning
   outcomes and education statistics in their work.

5. 25 percent of primary teachers (approximately 9,000) are familiar with new
   curriculum, teaching methods, and assessment targets and begin to reflect those
   changes in their teaching practices during the 2007-2008 school year.

   Satisfactory: Approximately 18000 primary school teachers have been trained on new
   curriculum including teaching methods and assessment tools during the ESDP
   implementation period.

6. Present disparities in access to core textbooks (based on new curricula) in basic
   education grades (grades 1-9) eliminated by 2006.

   Satisfactory: Evaluation survey conducted in 2007 (ARTIM, 2007) provided that
   availability of free of charge textbooks (based on old curriculum) in basic education
   grades (grades 1-9) does not show disparity in access to textbooks between pilot and
   non-pilot rayons. "Textbooks and Curriculum Implementation Survey" conducted in
   May 2009 (Sigma, 2009) confirmed lack of disparities in access to textbooks based on
   new curriculum.

7. Student-teacher ratio in general education increased from 10:1 in 2002 to 12:1 in
   2007 in the three pilot districts.

   Moderately satisfactory: As a result of rationalization activities under ESDP the student
   teacher ratio in general education has been reported by Economics unit of MoE to be as
   follows in three pilot districts in 2007:
         12.00 in Shirvan city (former Ali Bayramli);
         10.90 in Ismailli district;
         11.80 in Ujar district.

8. Efficiency and finance reforms, including district rationalization plans, prepared and
   implemented successfully in the three pilot districts by 2007.

   Moderately satisfactory: Efficiency and finance reforms including rationalisation plans
   have been really implemented in the three pilot districts. However difficulties
   encountered in implementation process and explained under Component 2 of Section II.
   Achievements of ESDP makes it difficult to say that these reforms have been
   successful.

9. Society at large express support for education reform by 2007.

   Satisfactory: Main finding of Evaluation survey conducted in 2007 is that "Society at
   large (school directors, parents, teachers) express support for education reform across
   all the items in 2007" (ARTIM, 2007).

       IV.     LESSONS LEARNED FROM ESDP IMPLEMENTATION

EDSP demonstrates that in spite of large interventions and investments in education from
the state budget the projects implemented with the Bank are the most important tools in
initiating major reforms in education sector.

The major lessons learned from ESDP are as follows:
 Good sustainability vision for project activities is very crucial right from the beginning
   of the project.
 A reform to be successful needs to have a dedicated leader within MoE. Lack of such
   leader was the main reason for problems under Component 2;
 Unfortunately, inter-ministerial collaboration in Azerbaijan succeeds not much beyond
   formal correspondence between the ministries;
 A `Quality Monitoring Framework' should be put in place by MoE and staff capacity is
   enhanced for this purpose. Results framework for projects should be well understood by
   MoE and M&E plan should be effective right from the beginning of the project;
 Comprehensive public awareness and information campaign is critical to avoid
   unnecessary slow down of public embrace of the education reforms and their impact. In
   order to put more emphasis on this very important function and in order to make it
   sustainable throughout the project operation it should integrated into MoE and not seen
   as PCU function.
 Formal performance appraisal linked to appropriate incentives is needed to motivate
   and reward project staff for the high-pressure work environment of PCU.

       V.      PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER

The Government of Azerbaijan has since the initiation of the ESDP, remained committed
to the project objectives. The total estimated Government contribution to the Project
implementation has amounted to USD 2,894,251.

Initially, there was lack of coordination between different agencies involved with the
project and the project received `unsatisfactory' rating from the Bank Supervision Mission
for a few components. The situation vastly improved from early 2005.

PCU has been very active in coordinating the project. It has a highly motivated staff. This
aspect, along with the increased cooperation from the different departments of MoE, has
lead to successful implementation of the project and achievement of Project Development
Objective.

       VI.     PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK

The Bank worked closely with the Borrower to support its efforts to successfully
implement the project. Despite change in the Task Managers, the dialogue during the
implementation process was smooth and both parties sought and found solutions to
implementation bottlenecks (civil works procurement and financial aspects). The bank
supervised the project regularly (twice a year) and this intensive supervision was one of the
major contributing factors in achieving the targets. The Bank has agreed to the request for
project extension from March 31, 2008 to March 31, 2009. The Bank' performance has
been very positive especially for:
                                             57
       Good supervision and extension of the life span of the project;
       Flexible response to the needs of the country and the education sector.
       Good team work and communications with the Government including per-capita
       financing reforms topics.
       Field visits and meetings with the stakeholders and the beneficiaries.
       Strong support in procurement and finance.

All these efforts created a positive relationship between the Bank and the Borrower that led
to a successful implementation of the project.

          VII.   PLANS FOR SUSTAINABILITY OF ESDP ACHIEVEMENTS

The general plan for sustainability of the achievements of ESDP is the initiation of the
Second Education Sector Development Project (SESDP). The SESDP includes
continuation of the majority of achievements under ESDP. Those achievements and
interventions which are not included in the SESDP are addressed by the Government of
Azerbaijan with the following arrangements:

(i)     Pre-service teacher training: The Higher Education Unit of the MoE has taken an
        ownership over the achievements and interventions of ESDP in pre-service teacher
        training area. It is believed that this unit will continue a decent work towards
        improvement or quality of pre-service teacher training especially in the view of the
        two facts described below:
         The Higher Education Unit is no longer responsible for in-service teacher training,
            which releases its staff from many related duties and the staff may and is actually
            more concentrating on pre-service teacher training;
         MoE is in the process of preparation of Higher Education Project, which shall
            partially address pre-service training it takes place in higher education institutions.

(ii)    Textbook policy: Textbook and Publishing Unit of the MoE in collaboration with
        Textbook Approval Board has already taken ownership over systematic
        implementation of new Textbook Policy. The work that these unit and board
        completed during last and this year provides evidence of sustainability for
        implementation of textbook policy.

(iii) The School Grant Program: Annual competitions of the Government of Azerbaijan
      for allocation of grants to the 100 best teachers as well as 50 best schools is an
      evidence of sustainable implementation of the ideas promoted by the School Grant
      Program implemented under ESDP.

Dear Elchin ,

We have reviewed the "Report on Completion of Implementation and Results of the Project"

  Opinion about the Report on Completion and Results of the completed first phase of the
                         "Azerbaijan Education Sector Reform"

                                     Dear Mr. Elchin Afandiyev,

         Further to your instructions the Ministry of Economic Development has reviewed
the letter requesting to express the opinion about the Report on Completion and Results of
the completed first phase of the "Azerbaijan Education Sector Reform" program of the
World Bank.
         As it is indicated in the said report, the project considers the measures such as the
creation of the basis for preparation of the curriculum in the reorganised Institute of
Educational Problems by 2006, strengthening of the management and planning potential of
the Ministry of Education and local education authorities, development and public
disclosure of the education statistics, the training of primary school teachers in connection
with the implementation of the new curriculum, development of the new school financing
formula and its implementation in three pilot districts and increase in the number of
students.
           The implemented measures resulted in establishment of the Curriculum Centre in
the Institute of Educational Problems, preparation and public disclosure of the first
statistical report of the Ministry of Education in 2008, the creation of the three new
departments (Monitoring and Evaluation, Information System and Strategic Analysis of the
Education Management, Planning and Human Resources) in the Ministry of Education and
the Institute of Educational Problems was reorganised, financing of the renovation of a
selected number of schools in the three pilot districts was implemented, participation of
approximately 18 000 primary school teachers in trainings on modern education
methodology and evaluation methods required for implementation of the new curriculum
and in minor increase in student-teacher ratio in three pilot districts.
      Considering the above, we would like to note that we have no comments or
recommendations to the Report on Completion and Results of the said project.
Please consider the above.
Yours sincerely,
Shahin Mustafayev

dated 5 April 2010

                  Regarding the World Bank Report on the final results of
                    the first phase of the education sector development


The Ministry of Finance having reviewed the World Bank Report on the final results of the
first phase of the education sector development notes the following:

With regard to the increase of the student-teacher ratio in three pilot districts from 10:1 in
2002 to 12:1 in 2007 (section "Efficiency and Financial Reforms", paragraph 3 of the main
performance indicators of the report), we would like to note that as per the analysis
performed in general education system of the pilot schools the student-teacher ratio was 9:3
instead of 12:1. It must be noted that the level of the teacher-student ratio directly depends
on the weekly lesson load of the teachers. Although the weekly lesson load of the teachers
in general education schools in most countries is 18-20 hours, the weekly lesson load of the
teachers in Azerbaijan is 12 hours and this fact does not allow the significant changes
(increase) in student-teacher rate in general education schools.

The expert opinion expressed in article 2.2, paragraph 3 "lack of agreement between the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education on the responsibility mechanisms of
budget management schools" is absolutely groundless. Thus, during the reform period the
budget of pilot schools was developed together with the project group of the Ministry of
Education as per the formula based on the expenses per student and the Ministry of Finance
took all the required measures in this direction supporting this component together with all
other phases of the reform.

In connection with the 2nd Component: Efficiency and financing reforms" paragraph of the
8th section "Results indicator", i.e. "allocation of lumpsum budgets to pilot schools", we
must note that in accordance with the requirements of the statutory documents regulating
the budget legislation the budgets of the budget entities are approved as per the expense
articles for the given year.
Therefore inclusion of these ideas into the report conflicts with the legislation. The opinion
of the experts expressed in the third and fourth paragraph of section 8 of the Report

                                             62
"Results indicators" - "the gaps in legislation and lack of Ministry of Finance support
during the implementation", as well as "the lack of self-sufficiency of pilot schools,
limitation of substitutability of wage and non-wage items" is not clear. Thus, in accordance
with Article 18.4 of Azerbaijan Republic Law "On budget system" if needed, certain
changes between the expenditure items may be made".

During this year there were no limitations in financing of all required spheres using the
saved expense items and this process was performed by local financial authorities and
Ministry of Finance. Thus, after the Decree No 36 of the Cabinet of Ministers of
Azerbaijan Republic on execution of the "Financing and budget reforms" subcomponent of
the "Education sector Development Project" dated 22nd February 2007, there was the
necessity of the diversification between expense items in some of the pilot schools
(Ismailly region), which was supported by the Ministry of Finance and 47.6 thousand
manats difference between the schools was approved on 12th December 2007.

Therefore we cannot agree with the expression of "limited self-sufficiency" of pilot schools.

In addition, it must be noted that in accordance with the requirements of the Law of
Azerbaijan Republic "On budget system" the reform program does not consider the
requirements of the Unified Budged Classification developed together with the
representatives of the International Financial Fund and approved by the Government. Thus,
the budget expenses or each budget funded entity for the given year is approved by the
expense items as per the requirements of the Unified Budget Classification and the cash
execution of the budget for the year is performed as per statutory documents of the treasury.
However the reform program does not consider these requirements of the budget legislation
and demands the forecasting of secondary school budgets on the basis of the unified
expense principle and full independence of the schools in usage of the expenses. Moreover,
the Ministry of Finance recommended to include Baku schools with better infrastructure
rather than the schools in far rural regions into the pilot program in order to better direction
of the reform programs in the secondary school.

Notwithstanding the numerous discussions of the representatives of Ministry of Education
and the World Bank held in the Ministry of Finance about the conflict of these
requirements with the country legislation, the recommendations, comments and suggestions
of the ministry were not considered in the development of the reform project.

With respect of the last sentence of the 4th paragraph of the Report ­ "the education and
support with respect of the new financing system between financial departments and pilot
regions was weak" ­ we must note that the numerous discussions with local financial
authorities have revealed the formal nature of the boards' activity, they were not familiar
with the reforms in the schools and neither boards, nor the local financial authorities
participated in decisions made at schools. At the same time, the local education authorities
were reorganised in order to accommodate the new financial issues in pilot schools and
each pilot school has employed accountants for preparation of financial documents.
However, the insufficient economical knowledge of the accountants created serious
difficulties in their work with the financial documents. In most cases the financial
documents of the pilot schools were prepared with the assistance of the specialists of
financial authorities.


                                              63
Section 9 of the Report - "Result indicator" - indicates the support level of this reform in
the society and the status of the acceptance of this reform by the country citizens. Thus, in
pilot schools 42% of principals, 47% of teachers and 46% of teachers were unsatisfied with
the reforms. However, the satisfaction level of the village dwellers has reduced from 42%
during the initial poll to 37% at later stages.

"3.3. Efficiency" section of the Report only covers the economical part of the reform and
prioritises the financial independence of the pilot schools for success of the reform. We
think that the efficiency of the reforms in the schools is measured not only with the
financial independence, but also with the level of the teaching and getting the education,
with the achieved results in education since the start of the reform, or with the information
about the level of admission of the students of the pilot schools to the colleges or about the
aspects of the general knowledge levels. However the report did not reflect these issues and
did not give any conclusions with this regard

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Open Society Institute (OSI) Azerbaijan provided co-financing for the selected number of
activities under the following three subcomponents of ESDP: Textbook Policy
Development, Improving Equity and Access of the Poor to Education and Rationalization
and School Improvement. The detailed description of OSI contribution to the Project is
reflected in Annex 2. In addition, the Bank team collected feedback from OSI staff, Ms.
Elmina Kazimzade, with regard to the collaboration as part of ESDP. The following
comments were received:

       "This partnership between OSI, WB and MOE within ESDP Program in Azerbaijan
       was a first experience of such cooperation between government, international
       finance agency and non-governmental organization. The cooperation allowed to
       apply OSI expertise in education in reforming process and created an opportunity to
       shift from grassroots activities to policy impact initiatives. The cooperation might
       be suggested as a good example of consolidation model of joint efforts of different
       donors, state and civil society institutions. There are list of outcomes of the
       cooperation that can be considered as success indicators of this cooperation:
           - Empowerment of Civil Society Institutions as influential actors in Education
               Reform. Example: Establishing Textbook Approval Board
           - Strengthening of the education quality through partnership between state
               and non-governmental institutions. Example. OSI spin off Education Center
               for Innovations in Education was engaged in second phase of ESDP".
