A.

and 
Project 
Development 
Objective 
1. 
Program 
purpose 
and 
program 
phasing: 
The 
Government 
of 
Azerbaijan 
(GOA) 
is 
committed 
to 
sectoral 
reforms 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
based 
on 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
of 
1999, 
the 
draft 
Ten-Year 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy 
(2003.2013), 
prepared 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
(MOE), 
and 
the 
Government’s 
Letter 
of 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Policy 
(see 
Annex 
11). 
The 
GOA 
has 
asked 
the 
World 
Bank 
for 
help 
in 
implementing 
this 
long-term 
reform 
program. 
The 
main 
purpose 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
is 
to 
address 
many 
key 
sectoral 
issues, 
some 
of 
which 
need 
to 
be 
prioritized 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
additional 
analytical 
work, 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
and 
to 
realign 
the 
entire 
sector 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
emerging 
market 
economy 
and 
social 
conditions. 
The 
purposes 
of 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
are 
to 
increase 
learning 
achievements 
for 
all 
students 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
market 
economy 
and 
improve 
efficiency 
of 
general 
education. 
The 
longer-term 
perspective 
of 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Credit 
(APC) 
would 
provide 
the 
Government 
with 
support 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
system-wide 
reform, 
while 
providing 
the 
flexibility 
to 
adjust 
and 
refine 
interventions 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis. 
The 
proposed 
APC 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
three 
phases 
over 
a 
period 
of 
ten 
years. 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APC 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$18.0 
million, 
and 
the 
estimated 
amounts 
for 
Phase 
2 
and 
Phase 
3, 
if 
approved, 
are 
about 
US$20 
million 
and 
US$25 
million, 
respectively. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
Phase 
3, 
the 
education 
sector 
will 
be 
better 
equipped 
to 
meet 
satisfactorily 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
knowledge-based 
economy, 
to 
increase 
access 
to 
high 
quality 
general 
education 
and 
tertiary 
education, 
and 
to 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
make 
a 
more 
efficient 
and 
effective 
use 
of 
its 
physical, 
financial 
and 
human 
resources 
to 
deliver 
quality 
education 
for 
all. 
(Annex 
12 
provides 
a 
summary 
framework 
for 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program). 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program 
(2003-2007) 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
to 
plan, 
manage 
and 
monitor 
the 
reform 
program 
more 
effectively 
and 
efficiently 
and 
initiate 
the 
highest 
priority 
investments 
in 
selected 
districts. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
program 
will 
focus 
on 
a 
set 
of 
key 
issues 
in 
general 
education, 
namely: 
0 
i 
(ii) 
(iii) 
W) 
quality 
improvement 
(through 
curriculum 
reform, 
teacher 
development, 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
and 
reading 
materials); 
efficiency 
and 
financing 
(through 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms, 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement); 
equity 
and 
access 
to 
general 
education 
(through 
school 
grants 
in 
selected 
less 
advantaged 
districts); 
and 
management 
strengthening 
(through 
student 
assessment, 
management 
information 
systems, 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity). 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
support 
reforms 
at 
the 
national 
level 
(e.g., 
curriculum 
reform, 
teacher 
training, 
providing 
reading 
materials 
for 
all 
general 
schools, 
and 
strengthening 
the 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE 
and 
selected 
local 
education 
authorities) 
and 
a 
set 
of 
specific 
interventions 
and 
reforms 
in 
three 
pilot 
districts 
(e.g., 
efficiency 
and 
budgetary 
reforms, 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement, 
and 
school 
grants). 
These 
specific 
reforms 
and 
interventions 
at 
the 
district 
level 
would 
be 
expanded 
under 
the 
Second 
Phase 
based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
First 
Phase 
and 
consolidated 
and 
completed 
under 
the 
Third 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program. 
While 
the 
First 
Phase 
will 
focus 
on 
general 
education, 
policy 
links 
with 
early 
childhood, 
vocational 
and 
tertiary 
education 
will 
be 
developed 
through 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
additional 
sector 
work. 
Page  10
Phase 
1 
(2003-2007) 
will 
address 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
by: 
(i) 
completing 
on-going 
curriculum 
reform 
for 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
providing 
institutional 
development 
for 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
and 
training 
of 
teacher 
trainers, 
teachers 
and 
school 
directors; 
(iii) 
providing 
reading 
materials 
for 
school 
libraries; 
and 
(iv) 
establishing 
a 
new 
student 
assessment 
system 
and 
assessing 
the 
results 
of 
student 
learning 
outcomes 
in 
selected 
core 
subjects. 
These 
interventions 
will 
be 
supplemented 
by 
specific 
interventions 
and 
reforms 
to 
strengthen 
the 
management 
and 
policy 
development 
capacity 
at 
the 
national 
and 
selected 
district 
levels 
to 
improve 
efficient 
and 
effective 
use 
of 
available 
resources 
for 
the 
education 
sector. 
Phase 
2 
(2007-20 
lo), 
if 
approved, 
will 
have 
a 
duration 
of 
three 
years 
and 
support 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
to 
expand 
coverage 
and 
extend 
the 
scope 
of 
interventions 
and 
develop 
further 
management 
skills, 
particularly 
at 
local 
levels, 
based 
on 
evolving 
needs. 
Phase 
3 
(2010.2013), 
if 
approved, 
will 
have 
a 
duration 
of 
three 
years 
and 
support 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
for 
the 
completion 
of 
interventions 
at 
the 
general 
education 
level 
during 
the 
previous 
two 
phases 
until 
Program 
objectives 
are 
fully 
met. 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
Phase 
3 
would 
be 
to 
achieve 
full 
national 
coverage, 
consolidate 
interventions, 
and 
review 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
reform 
program. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
Phase 
3, 
the 
following 
achievements 
would 
be 
expected: 
(i) 
an 
increase 
in 
access 
to 
quality 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
students 
better 
equipped 
to 
meet 
the 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
needs 
of 
a 
market 
economy; 
and 
(iii) 
more 
capacity 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
to 
use 
resources 
efficiently 
and 
effectively. 
2. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
Program 
seeks 
to 
increase 
learning 
achievements 
for 
all 
students 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
market 
economy 
and 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
general 
education. 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
Phase 
1 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
to 
plan, 
manage 
and 
monitor 
the 
reform 
program 
more 
effectively 
and 
efficiently 
and 
initiate 
the 
highest 
priority 
investments 
in 
selected 
districts. 
3. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Program 
performance 
will 
be 
monitored 
closely 
through 
the 
following 
list 
of 
key 
performance 
indicators. 
Progress 
towards 
these 
indicators 
will 
be 
monitored 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
different 
phases 
of 
the 
Program 
by 
developing 
a 
strong 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
component 
under 
Phase 
1. 
Compliance 
with 
some 
key 
performance 
indicators 
for 
Phase

would 
also

[IFCR99-145/l] 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
September 
14, 
1999 
The 
proposed 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
will 
assist 
the 
country 
in 
its 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
through 
investment 
in 
education. 
The 
most 
recent 
CAS, 
for 
FYOO-02, 
was 
discussed 
by 
Executive 
Directors 
on 
September 
14, 
1999. 
A 
new 
CAS, 
covering 
FY03-05, 
is 
scheduled 
for 
discussion 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
the 
proposed 
education 
credit. 
The 
new 
CAS 
for 
FY03-05 
highlights 
the 
need 
for 
investment 
in 
social 
development 
to 
provide 
access 
to 
quality 
social 
services 
by 
reversing 
decline 
in 
social 
services 
and 
assistance 
and 
in 
infrastructure, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
Bank-supported 
four-pronged 
strategies 
to 
support 
Azerbaijan’s 
development 
agenda 
for 
FY03-05. 
It 
notes 
that 
“in 
education, 
the 
issues 
are 
not 
so 
much 
of 
access 
as 
of 
deterioration 
in 
quality....Azerbaijan 
still 
maintains 
an 
extensive 
network 
of 
education 
institutions 
across 
the 
country, 
but 
the 
quality 
of 
physical 
infrastructure, 
teaching 
and 
learning 
environment 
has 
deteriorated 
sharply 
along 
with 
teachers’ 
salaries 
and 
the 
availability 
of 
learning 
materials. 
At 
the 
upper 
secondary 
(grades 
10-l 
1) 
and 
higher 
education 
levels, 
there 
are 
sharp 
drops 
in 
student 
enrollments, 
particularly 
for 
the 
poor.” 
To 
address 
these 
issues, 
and 
based 
on 
the 
lesson 
learned 
from 
the 
ongoing 
Education 
LIL, 
the 
new 
CAS 
proposes 
to 
support 
a 
comprehensive 
ten-year 
education 
Page  12
reform 
program 
through 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Credit 
(APC), 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
which 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
the 
new 
CAS 
period. 
The 
expected 
outcomes 
from 
investments 
in 
education 
during 
the 
new 
CAS 
are 
to: 
(i) 
reduce 
dropout 
rate 
of 
school 
age 
children, 
especially 
among 
poor 
households; 
(ii) 
revise 
curriculum 
for 
all 
grades 
to 
meet 
standards 
of 
a 
market-based 
economy; 
and 
(iii) 
equip 
education 
authorities 
with 
managerial 
skills 
to 
lead 
education 
reforms. 
Both 
the 
new 
CAS 
and 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
have 
been 
designed 
with 
a 
view 
to 
supporting 
the 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Economic 
Development 
(SPPRED) 
(i.e., 
the 
Government’s 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP), 
which 
also 
emphasizes 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education). 
The 
PRSP 
is 
also 
scheduled 
for 
discussion 
by 
Executive 
Directors 
along 
with 
the 
new 
CAS 
and 
the 
proposed 
education 
credit. 
The 
Program’s 
focus 
on 
general 
education 
fits 
well 
into 
the 
SPPRED 
and 
the 
overall 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
under 
the 
new 
CAS 
since 
investments 
in 
general 
education 
are 
critical 
in 
the 
production 
of 
quality 
secondary 
education 
graduates 
and 
poverty 
alleviation. 
International 
evidence 
also 
suggests 
that 
social 
rates 
of 
return 
to 
general 
education 
are 
generally 
high. 
Without 
quality 
general 
education, 
the 
education 
system 
will 
have 
difficulties 
producing 
graduates 
who 
will 
become 
flexible 
workers 
in 
the 
emerging 
market 
economy. 
Primary 
and 
secondary 
education 
is 
also 
the 
foundation 
of 
quality 
vocational 
and 
tertiary 
education, 
which 
will 
help 
the 
country 
produce 
the 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
required 
by 
the 
emerging 
economy. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
The 
current 
Azerbaijan 
education 
system 
consists 
of: 
(i) 
general 
education 
programs, 
and 
(ii) 
vocational 
and 
professional 
programs. 
General 
education 
consists 
of 
pre-school 
education 
(ages 
3-6) 
and 
general 
schools 
(grades 
l-l 
1). 
Vocational 
and 
professional 
education 
includes: 
(i) 
vocational 
schools; 
(ii) 
technicurns 
(i.e., 
specialized 
secondary 
education); 
and 
(iii) 
higher 
education 
institutions. 
Enrollments 
in 
2000 
were: 
120,000 
in 
pre-school; 
1,640,OOO 
in 
general 
education 
(grades 
l-l 
1); 
22,900 
in 
vocational 
schools; 
42,600 
in 
technicurns; 
and 
119,700 
in 
higher 
education 
institutions. 
In 
general 
education, 
in 
2000, 
there 
were 
470 
primary 
schools 
(grades 
l-4); 
922 
basic 
schools 
(grades 
l-9); 
and 
3,136 
general 
schools 
(grades 
l-l 
1). 
There 
was 
a 
total 
of 
165,000 
teachers 
in 
these 
schools. 
The 
public 
education 
system 
has 
three 
main 
sources 
of 
revenue: 
(i) 
the 
state 
budget; 
(ii) 
student 
fees 
in 
specialized 
secondary 
and 
higher 
education 
institutions; 
and 
(iii) 
parental 
and 
community 
contributions. 
In 
the 
period 
of 
1992-1995, 
the 
education 
budget 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
and 
as 
a 
share 
of 
the 
total 
state 
budget 
fell 
sharply 
due 
to 
declines 
in 
GDP 
and 
Government 
revenue. 
The 
share 
of 
education 
budget 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
fell 
from 
approximately 
7 
percent 
to 
less 
than 
3.5 
percent 
for 
the 
same 
periods. 
In 
1995, 
in 
real 
terms, 
Government 
spending 
on 
education 
was 
only 
27 
percent 
of 
its 
level 
in 
1992. 
In 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
199Os, 
considerable 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
protect 
education 
expenditures. 
In 
2001, 
the 
education 
budget 
was 
4.8 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
compared 
to 
2.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
low-income 
countries 
and 
3.8 
for 
middle-income 
countries. 
In 
constant 
prices, 
however, 
public 
spending 
on 
education 
in 
1998 
was 
only 
about 
34 
percent 
of 
the 
1992 
level. 
The 
main 
reason 
for 
this 
sharp 
decline 
was 
a 
drastic 
decline 
in 
real 
GDP. 
At 
independence, 
Azerbaijan 
inherited 
a 
relatively 
well 
developed 
education 
system 
from 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union 
(FSU) 
with 
relatively 
high 
enrollment 
rates 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
education. 
At 
present, 
Azerbaijan 
has 
been 
trying 
to 
retain 
the 
positive 
achievements 
of 
the 
past 
education 
system 
while 
pursuing 
reform 
to 
meet 
the 
demand 
of 
a 
market 
economy 
and 
an 
independent 
democratic 
state. 
A 
closer 
look 
at 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
education 
sector 
from 
available 
data 
shows 
that 
the 
education 
system 
is 
confronted 
with 
several 
major 
challenges, 
and 
is 
not 
equipped 
to 
meet 
the 
demands 
of 
a 
modem 
economy, 
especially 
a 
knowledge-based 
economy. 
The 
main 
issues 
facing 
the 
Azerbaijan 
education 
Page  13
system 
are: 
(i) 
reduction 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
services, 
largely 
due 
to 
sharp 
declines 
in 
real 
public 
expenditures 
on 
education; 
(ii) 
growing 
inequities 
in 
access 
to 
high 
quality 
general 
education; 
(iii) 
inefficient 
use 
of 
available 
resources; 
and 
(iv) 
weak 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
at 
the 
central 
and 
local 
levels.

Reduction 
in 
the 
Quality 
and 
Relevance 
of 
General 
Education. 
Declines 
in 
real 
budgetary 
resources 
after 
independence 
have 
had 
considerable 
adverse 
effects 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
education, 
but 
especially 
in 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education 
(see 
MoED, 
2002, 
p.38). 
Indicators 
relating 
to 
education 
outcomes 
(e.g., 
student 
learning 
achievements) 
are 
not 
available 
to 
examine 
the 
effects 
of 
sharp 
declines 
in 
real 
resources 
available 
for 
education. 
Limited 
data, 
however, 
suggest 
that 
the 
education 
sector 
has 
serious 
cha 
llenges 
to 
produce 
general 
school 
graduates 
with 
minimum 
standard 
.s 
to 
meet 
the 
skill 
and 
knowledge 
demands 
of 
the 
market 
economy 
or 
the 
minimum 
qualifications 
required 
by 
tertiary 
education 
institutions. 
Although 
there 
are 
no 
conclusive 
data 
to 
monitor 
trends 
in 
student 
learning 
outcomes 
during 
the 
transition, 
the 
results 
from 
the 
Stud 
bent 
University 
Entrance 
Examination 
which 
i 
s 
given 
at 
the 
end 
of 
grade 
11, 
are 
instructive 
to 
present 
the 
overall 
decline 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education. 
For 
example, 
despite 
some 
recent 
improvements, 
it 
was 
reported 
that 
more 
than 
half 
of 
candidates 
score 
below 
300 
(the 
failing 
mark). 
This 
finding 
suggests 
that 
far 
too 
many 
general 
school 
leavers 
fail 
to 
achieve 
a 
satisfactory 
level 
of 
knowledge 
on 
State 
Student 
Entrance 
Examination. 
Such 
failures 
should 
be 
discovered 
and 
remedied 
much 
earlier 
during 
a 
student’s 
school 
career, 
while 
there 
is 
still 
time 
to 
ensure 
that

Outdated 
curriculum 
and 
teaching 
methods. 
In 
Azerbaijan, 
despite 
recent 
reforms, 
outdated 
curricula 
and 
teaching 
methods 
are 
still 
major 
concerns 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
to 
meet 
the 
need 
for 
standards 
of 
the 
market-economy 
and 
social 
change 
(MoED, 
2002, 
pp.38,39). 
The 
education 
system 
must 
increasingly 
foster 
the 
development 
of 
skills 
that 
support 
success 
in 
a 
world 
of 
rapid 
and 
unpredictable 
economic 
and 
social 
change. 
This 
implies 
that 
formal 
education 
must 
place 
greater 
emphasis 
on 
developing 
skills 
in 
problem 
solving, 
critical 
thinking, 
and 
effective 
communication. 
In 
addition, 
Azerbaijan 
must 
ensure 
that 
ail 
students 
receive 
an 
adequate 
education 
in 
order 
to 
equip 
them 
for 
productive 
roles 
in 
the 
economy 
and 
society. 
However, 
the 
current 
educational 
system 
does 
not 
generally 
produce 
graduates 
with 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
that 
will 
meet 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
emerging 
economic 
and 
social 
environment. 
While 
there 
have 
been 
changes 
made 
to 
the 
old 
Soviet 
curri 
culum 
during 
the 
past 
decade, 
curricula 
for 
general 
education 
are 
generally 
outdated 
and 
overloaded. 
It 
is 
reported 
that 
a 
large 
percentage 
of 
the 
information 
is 
irrelevant 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
emerging 
market-based 
economy 
and 
democratic 
society. 
At 
present, 
“the 
whole 
curriculum 
in 
its 
current 
form 
lacks 
coherence 
and 
does 
not 
provide 
the 
opportunity 
for 
the 
systematic 
development 
of 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
by 
the 
progressive 
movement 
from 
simple 
to 
complex 
and 
by 
the 
integration 
of 
overlapping 
subject 
topics. 
Also, 
the 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
taught 
through 
these 
subjects 
focus 
on 
facts, 
rigid 
procedures, 
the 
ability 
to 
recall 
information 
and 
to 
carry 
out 
computations 
etc. 
Many 
of 
the 
subjects 
lack 
content 
that 
can 
stimulate 
children’s 
thinking 
and 
reasoning 
abilities” 
(see 
Pillay 
et 
al., 
2003, 
p.9). 
Similarly, 
teaching

methods 
usually 
do 
not 
reflect 
modem 
teaching 
practices 
and 
are 
based 
on 
rote-learning 
rather 
than 
problem-solving 
skills 
(see 
McBride, 
et 
al., 
2003; 
and 
Riley 
et 
al., 
2003). 
Even 
where 
there 
is 
a 
desire 
to 
move 
away 
from 
this 
model, 
teachers 
often 
lack 
professional 
development 
opportunities 
for 
such 
skills 
and 
lack 
new 
teaching 
resources 
on 
contemporary 
teaching 
methods. 
One 
of 
the 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program, 
announced 
by 
the 
GOA 
in 
1999, 
is 
to 
revise 
the 
general 
education 
curriculum, 
and 
strengthen 
the 
skills 
and 
teaching 
methods 
of 
the 
teaching 
force 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
teacher 
professional 
development 
opportunities 
in 
modem 
teaching 
methods, 
emphasizing 
students 
and 
inter-active 
teaching 
methods. 
Since 
1999, 
the 
MOE 
has 
attempted 
to 
gradually 
introduce 
a 
new 
general 
education 
curriculum 
designed 
to 
better 
prepare 
students 
for 
participation 
in 
Azerbaijan’s 
rapidly 
changing 
economy 
and 
society. 
This 
reform 
has 
also 
been 
supported 
through 
the 
IDA-assisted 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL) 
that 
started 
the 
curriculum 
reform 
process 
for 
selected 
grades. 
Under 
the 
LIL, 
there 
has 
been 
good 
progress 
in 
some 
areas 
such 
as 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
through 
the 
rationalizing 
of 
educational 
institutes 
(e.g., 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems). 
There 
has 
also 
been 
some 
progress 
in 
the 
revision 
of 
the 
selected 
syllabi 
for 
some 
subjects 
in 
the 
general 
education 
curriculum. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
curriculum 
reform, 
and 
based 
on 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
LIL, 
it 
intends 
to 
scale 
up 
the 
curriculum 
reform 
to 
include 
all 
subjects 
and 
all 
grades 
from 
grade 
l-l 
1 
and 
implement 
at 
a 
national 
scale 
under 
the 
proposed 
Program 
(see 
Pillay 
et 
al., 
2003, 
pp.6-7). 
Major 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
implementation 
related 
problems 
in 
general 
education 
can 
be 
grouped 
into 
the 
two 
main 
categories. 
The 
first 
group 
includes: 
(i) 
an 
outdated 
and 
subject-driven 
curriculum 
model, 
which 
needs 
to 
be 
re-aligned 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
emerging 
market-based 
economy 
and 
democratic 
society; 
(ii) 
a 
lack 
of 
national 
curriculum 
framework 
that 
would 
provide 
a 
basis 
for 
rationalizing 
and/or 
reinforcing, 
topics, 
learning 
outcomes, 
and 
examinations, 
etc; 
(iii) 
a 
lack 
of 
the 
use 
of 
assessment 
as 
a 
formative 
tool 
in 
student 
learning; 
and 
(iv) 
lack 
of 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
integration 
of 
subjects; 
The 
second 
group 
includes 
inadequate 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
conceptualize, 
design, 
develop 
and 
implement 
the 
new 
school 
curricula, 
including: 
(a) 
shortage 
of 
qualified 
and 
experienced 
curricula 
developers; 
(b) 
limited 
knowledge 
and 
expertise 
among 
teacher 
trainers, 
administrators, 
supervisors, 
and 
methodology 
personnel 
on 
curricular 
issues 
in 
particular 
outcome 
based 
curriculum 
model; 
(c) 
insufficient 
resources 
that 
restrict 
the 
curriculum 
development 
institution 
to 
perform 
its 
basic 
functions 
(e.g., 
lack 
of 
financial 
resources 
for 
staff 
development 
and 
basic 
education 
equipment 
and 
materials, 
etc.); 
(d) 
limited 
consultation 
with 
teachers, 
parents, 
civil 
society, 
NGOs 
and 
regional 
representatives 
in 
the 
curriculum 
development 
process; 
and 
(e) 
lack 
of 
a 
systematic 
approach 
to 
curriculum 
development 
with 
the 
result 
that 
the 
curriculum 
development 
process 
appears 
very 
fragmented 
(see 
Pillay 
et 
al., 
2002).

Poor 
learning 
environment. 
The 
quality 
of 
the 
learning 
environment 
in 
most 
general 
schools 
has 
deteriorated 
considerably, 
contributing 
to 
low 
learning 
outcomes, 
low 
attendance, 
and 
the 
production 
of 
poorly 
trained 
school 
leavers, 
due 
largely 
to: 
(i) 
the 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
textbooks 
and 
reading 
materials; 
(ii) 
the 
shortage 
of 
basic 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials 
and 
equipment; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
deterioration 
of 
the 
physical 
facilities. 
The 
quality 
of 
schooling 
is 
also 
uneven 
across 
the 
country, 
contributing 
to 
inequities 
in 
access 
to 
quality 
schooling. 
Many 
schools, 
urban 
and 
most 
especially, 
rural, 
lack 
adequate 
supplies 
of 
educational 
materials 
and 
have 
poor 
physical 
facilities 
for 
satisfactory 
teaching 
and 
learning. 
Learning 
materials 
and

Pupils 
in 
grades 
l-4 
are 
generally 
provided 
free 
textbooks, 
but 
the 
provision 
of 
free 
textbooks 
has 
often 
been 
limited 
due 
to 
inadequate 
public 
resources 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas. 
However, 
the 
Government 
has 
made 
significant 
efforts 
to 
provide 
additional 
resources 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
for 
grades 
l-4 
during 
the 
past 
few 
years. 
For 
grades 
5-l 
1, 
textbooks 
are 
-8- 
Page  15
normally 
purchased 
by 
households, 
but 
some 
parents 
of 
children 
in 
rural 
areas 
cannot 
afford 
them 
because 
of 
income 
constraint. 
For 
example, 
qualitative 
reports 
suggest 
that 
only 
about 
60-70 
percent 
of 
the 
pupils 
in 
grades 
5-l 
1 
in 
rural 
areas 
have 
core 
textbooks. 
Most 
education 
institutions 
also 
lack 
adequate 
supplies 
of 
basic 
materials 
for 
satisfactory 
teaching 
and 
learning. 
In 
the 
early 
199Os, 
Azerbaijan 
shifted 
from 
Cyrillic 
to 
Latin 
script. 
Partly 
as 
a 
result 
of 
this 
shift, 
there 
is 
a 
severe 
shortage 
of 
reading 
materials 
in 
Latin 
script 
for 
such 
books 
and 
reference 
materials 
to 
stimulate 
reading 
habits, 
support 
core 
curricula 
and 
encourage 
independent 
study 
and 
thinking. 
Most 
school 
libraries 
fitnction 
as 
the 
old 
book 
storage 
room, 
mostly 
storing 
books 
and 
reference 
materials 
in 
Cyrillic 
script 
from 
the 
Soviet 
period, 
rather 
than 
a 
resource 
center 
for 
individual 
study. 
There 
is 
an 
urgent 
need 
to 
re-stock 
and 
upgrade 
school 
libraries 
based 
on 
Latin-script 
Azeri 
reading 
and 
reference 
materials 
to 
stimulate 
reading 
habits 
in 
general 
education 
and 
provide 
students 
with 
resources 
for 
individual 
study 
and 
to 
open 
up 
the 
whole 
notion 
of 
choice, 
variety 
and 
different 
points 
of 
view. 
Although 
secondary 
education 
curricula 
include 
a 
course 
on 
“informatics,” 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
general 
schools 
do 
no 
have 
computer 
rooms 
to 
teach 
and 
use 
information 
and 
communication 
technologies 
or 
have 
computer 
rooms 
which 
often 
contain 
a 
small 
number 
of 
antiquated 
computers, 
supplied 
circa 
1986. 
At 
present, 
about 
10 
percent 
of 
general 
schools 
are 
equipped 
with 
new 
computers 
supplied 
by 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL) 
and 
other 
donors 
during 
the 
past 
few 
years. 
Science 
laboratories, 
which 
are 
generally 
found 
in 
large 
urban 
schools, 
are 
very 
poorly 
equipped 
by 
Western 
standards, 
contain 
mostly 
outdated 
equipment 
and 
materials 
inherited 
from 
the 
Soviet 
period, 
and 
are 
in 
very 
limited 
quantities 
(most 
of 
the 
laboratory 
equipment 
in 
schools 
is 
no 
longer 
serviceable). 
School 
Buildings 
and 
Building 
Standards. 
The 
majority 
of 
school 
buildings 
(about 
4,5 
13) 
in 
Azerbaijan 
were 
built 
according 
to 
old/Soviet 
standards 
for 
educational 
infrastructure, 
which 
are 
rigid 
in 
many 
respects 
and 
inefficient 
compared 
to 
generally 
recognized/international 
norms 
for 
education 
facilities. 
Some 
schools 
fail 
to 
meet 
even 
the 
prescribed 
Azerbaijan 
norms. 
Most 
school 
infrastructures 
are 
outdated 
and 
largely 
inappropriate 
for 
modern/effective 
teaching 
methods. 
About 
72 
percent 
of 
these 
buildings 
were 
not 
originally 
intended 
and 
designed 
as 
schools 
(e.g., 
houses, 
barns, 
apartment 
blocks), 
and 
had 
been 
converted/reconverted 
(also 
largely 
inadequately 
and 
inappropriately) 
over 
the 
years 
for 
educational 
use 
with 
very 
limited 
budgets. 
According 
to 
a 
school 
infrastructure 
survey 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
MOE 
in 
2002, 
approximately 
42 
percent 
of 
existing 
schools 
need 
substantial 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
due 
to 
long 
foregone 
maintenance 
and 
repairs. 
In 
many 
cases, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
deteriorated 
school 
buildings 
present 
a 
serious 
hazard 
due 
to 
disrepair 
and 
damage 
(e.g., 
sagging 
roofs, 
exposed 
electrical 
wires, 
damaged 
structure, 
absence 
of 
sewage 
system, 
crumbling 
asbestos 
roofing 
materials, 
etc.). 
Many 
schools 
in 
rural 
areas 
lack 
regular 
electricity. 
Very 
few 
of 
the 
antiquated 
heating 
systems 
in 
schools 
function. 
Moreover, 
in 
urban 
areas 
(e.g., 
Baku) 
official 
data 
suggest 
an 
acute 
shortage 
of 
school 
buildings 
because 
new 
school 
buildings 
have 
not 
been 
constructed 
to 
accommodate 
a 
growing 
population 
during 
the 
transition, 
resulting 
in 
overcrowding 
in 
urban 
schools. 
On 
the 
other 
extreme, 
are 
large 
school 
buildings 
with 
very 
few 
students. 
The 
unit 
gross 
areas 
per 
student 
place 
range 
from 
1 
.I 
square 
meters 
per 
place 
to 
as 
high 
as 
11.5 
square 
meters 
per 
place 
in 
the 
pilot 
Rayons 
served 
by 
the 
proposed 
APC. 
An 
increasing 
number 
of 
schools 
(75 
percent) 
have 
adopted 
two 
and 
sometimes 
three 
and 
even 
four 
shifts 
per 
day. 
Because 
of 
the 
poor 
physical 
learning 
environment, 
qualitative 
reports 
suggest 
that 
teachers 
and 
students 
are 
demoralized 
and 
have 
little 
incentive 
to 
remain 
in 
schools. 
One 
major 
constraint 
to 
rationalizing 
the 
function 
and 
improving 
the 
learning 
physical 
environment 
is 
the 
strong 
resistance 
to 
change/modernization 
of 
school 
design 
norms. 
All 
school 
building 
plans, 
construction 
and 
repair 
are 
regulated 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
State 
Construction 
and 
Architecture 
Commission 
(SCAC). 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
existing 
school 
building 
norms, 
which 
were 
inherited 
from 
the 
FSU, 
have 
not 
been 
revised. 
The 
use 
of 
the 
inherited 
FSU 
norms 
is 
likely 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
continued 
deficiencies 
and 
inefficiencies 
in 
the 
educational 
physical 
plant 
especially 
because 
of 
the 
start 
of 
a 
large 
public 
school 
infrastructure 
program. 
On 
February 
17, 
2003, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Azerbaijan 
Republic 
approved 
the 
State 
School 
Infrastructure 
Improvement 
Program 
(SSIIP). 
According 
to

SSIIP, 
the

to 
build 
new 
educational

has

about 
34 
billion 
Manat 
in 
2003 
for 
completoin 
19 
new 
schools, 
major 
rehabilitation 
of 
45 
schools, 
and 
extension 
of 
28 
schools 
(an 
additional 
of 
252 
new 
classrooms). 
The 
SCAC 
is 
mandated 
to 
implement 
this 
new 
school 
building 
program 
including 
the 
design 
of 
the 
schools 
and 
supervise 
the

The 
MOE 
is 
responsible 
for 
providing 
SCAC 
with 
information 
regarding 
the 
required 
teaching 
spaces 
for 
planning 
the 
new 
schools. 
Considering 
the 
lack 
of 
sufficient 
MOE 
expertise 
in 
this 
area, 
it 
is 
reasonable 
that 
the

Despite

recent 
innovations 
and

in 
the 
delivery 
of 
teacher 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan, 
the 
overall 
quality 
of 
both 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
and 
in-service

training 
has 
deteriorated 
considerably

2003). 
Improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
teacher 
education 
and 
training 
will 
be 
essential 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education. 
In 
addition, 
effective 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
curriculum 
will 
require 
teachers 
to 
have 
in-depth 
knowledge 
of 
the 
subject 
matter 
and 
a 
much 
wider 
variety 
of 
teaching 
methods 
than 
are 
currently 
practiced 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
new 
curriculum 
will 
be 
particularly 
difficult 
for 
inexperienced 
or 
under-qualified 
teachers 
and 
teacher 
trainers 
in 
the 
existing 
teacher 
training 
institute. 
A 
summary 
of 
sectoral 
issues 
related 
to 
both 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
and 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
follows: 
In-service 
teacher 
training. 
In 
Azerbaijan, 
teachers 
in 
general 
education 
are 
required 
through 
the 
existing 
education 
code 
to 
undertake 
a 
minimum 
of 
156 
hours 
of 
in-service 
education 
every 
five 
years 
to 
achieve 
re-certification, 
even 
though 
resource 
constraints 
have 
restricted 
the 
provision 
of 
in-service 
training 
in 
recent 
years. 
Despite 
this 
requirement, 
however, 
a 
recent 
survey 
of 
92 
teachers 
in 
the 
country, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Monitoring 
Learning 
Achievement 
Study, 
indicated 
that 
about 
15 
percent 
of 
teachers 
in 
rural 
areas 
never 
attended 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
programs 
(MOE/UNICEF/UNESCO, 
2002 
p. 
53). 
The 
Personnel 
Services 
Department 
of 
the 
MOE 
prepares 
the 
schedule 
for 
such 
in-service 
training 
programs, 
and 
notifies 
teachers 
of 
the 
date 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
courses 
they 
will 
attend. 
Current 
practice 
results 
in 
the 
scheduling 
of 
in-service 
education 
for 
about 
16 
percent 
of 
teachers 
every 
year. 
This 
is 
usually 
a 
month-long 
course 
offered 
during 
the 
summer 
months, 
but 
it 
may 
also 
be 
offered 
one 
day 
each 
week 
from 
October 
through 
May. 
In-service 
teacher 
training 
is 
provided 
in 
Baku 
by 
the 
Baku 
In-service 
Education 
Institute, 
and 
outside 
Baku, 
through 
twelve 
regional 
affiliates 
of 
the 
Azerbaijan 
Teachers 
Institute 
(ATI). 
However, 
most 
of 
these 
fourteen 
teacher 
training 
centers 
are 
poorly 
staffed 
and 
equipped 
to 
deliver 
effective 
teacher 
training. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program, 
the 
MOE 
initiated 
reforms 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
in 
2000 
to 
strengthen 
the 
quality 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
programs. 
Several 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
(e.g., 
Azerbaijan 
Teachers 
Institute 
and 
its 
affiliates 
in 
Genja 
and 
Nakchevan 
and 
Baku 
Teacher 
Training 
Institute) 
received 
limited 
support 
under 
the 
on-going 
Education 
LIL 
to 
strengthen 
their 
institutional 
capacities 
to 
carry 
out 
an 
effective 
delivery 
of 
in-service 
training 
programs. 
Some 
promising 
developments 
are 
also 
emerging 
through 
the 
development 
of 
shorter 
programs 
where 
teachers’ 
needs 
are 
assessed 
and 
programs 
are 
delivered 
based 
on 
the 
needs 
of 
schools 
(see 
Riley 
et 
al., 
2003). 
There 
are 
few 
innovative 
delivery 
mechanisms 
to 
provide 
continuous 
professional 
development 
for 
teachers 
(e.g., 
short 
courses 
offered 
by 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
institutions, 
distance 
education 
and 
other 
technology-based 
delivery 
mechanisms, 
school-based 
training, 
or 
NGO-provided 
training 
activities). 
The 
Education 
LIL 
and 
other 
few 
teacher 
activities 
(e.g, 
UNICEF 
pilot 
teacher 
training 
program 
and 
Open 
Society 
Institute’s 
Reading 
and 
Writing 
for 
Critical 
Thinking 
Program) 
emphasized 
- 
IO- 
Page  17
the 
delivery 
of 
school-based 
teacher 
training 
activities. 
It 
is 
reported 
that 
these 
professional 
development 
programs 
have 
been 
found 
satisfactory 
and 
teachers 
are 
overwhelmingly 
enthusiastic 
about 
these 
training 
programs. 
Moreover, 
teachers 
have 
made 
substantial 
changes 
in 
their 
classroom 
practices, 
focusing 
on 
student-based 
learning 
methods 
(Riley 
et 
al, 
2003; 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Education/UNICEF, 
2002). 
Despite 
these 
recent 
promising 
developments 
based 
on 
demand 
driven 
principles, 
most 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
are 
still 
poorly 
equipped 
and 
staffed 
to 
deliver 
effective 
teacher 
training 
programs 
and 
need 
to 
be 
developed 
with 
particular 
attention 
given 
to 
on-going 
training 
needs, 
re-training 
and 
multi-subject 
teaching, 
and 
school-based 
training 
models. 
At 
present, 
the 
teacher 
training 
process 
is 
still 
rather 
mechanical, 
is 
more 
supply- 
than 
demand-driven 
and 
shows 
some 
deficiencies 
in 
quality 
and 
effectiveness. 
It 
is 
also 
reported 
that 
teacher 
training 
programs 
focus 
more 
on 
theory 
(especially 
psychology, 
methodology, 
pedagogy, 
and 
subject 
content) 
rather 
than 
the 
realities 
of 
schools. 
Teacher 
education 
institutions 
also 
do 
not 
carry 
out 
any 
in-depth 
applied 
education 
research 
in 
schools. 
This 
often 
results 
in 
a 
substantial 
gap 
between 
teacher 
training 
programs 
and 
teaching 
in 
schools, 
reducing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
teacher 
training 
programs 
(see 
McBride 
et 
al., 
2002). 
There 
are 
also 
few 
incentives 
or 
recognition 
for 
teachers 
to 
receive 
additional 
professional 
preparation. 
No 
credits 
are 
given 
for 
attending 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
courses, 
and 
teachers 
receive 
no 
salary 
increases 
or 
promotion 
because 
of 
attendance. 
As 
a 
result, 
available 
reports 
suggest 
that 
motivation 
is 
very 
low, 
and 
courses 
are 
poorly 
attended, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas 
where 
travel 
and 
subsistence 
costs 
are 
additional 
barriers 
(see 
Crawford, 
2000). 
There 
are 
also 
considerable 
differences 
in 
the 
availability 
of 
teacher 
development 
opportunities 
by 
location. 
For 
example, 
a 
recent 
study 
suggested 
that 
while 
virtually 
all 
teachers 
in 
Baku 
and 
other 
urban 
areas 
are 
involved 
in 
in-service 
training 
courses 
at 
least 
once 
per 
year, 
about 
only 
50 
percent 
of 
teachers 
in 
rural 
areas 
annually 
receive 
training 
(Ministry 
of 
Education/UNICEF, 
2002). 
PrP--rewice 
teacher 
education. 
In 
Azerbaijan, 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
is 
offered 
in 
both 
specialized 
secondary 
institutions 
(technicums) 
for 
primary 
school 
(grades 
l-4) 
teachers 
and 
in 
universities 
for 
teachers 
in 
grades 
5-l 
1 
(e.g., 
specialized 
subject 
teachers 
in 
general 
education). 
Throughout 
the 
country, 
there 
are 
8 
universities 
and 
15 
specialized 
secondary 
institutions 
offering 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
programs. 
The 
system 
of 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan 
also 
faces 
numerous 
challenges, 
including: 
(i) 
separation 
of 
pre-service 
and 
in-service 
and 
retraining; 
(ii) 
a 
lack 
of 
professional 
linkages 
between 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
and 
schools 
(as 
well 
as 
between 
the 
teacher 
training 
curricula 
and 
the 
school 
curricula); 
(iii) 
emphasis 
on 
narrow 
specialization, 
which 
needs 
serious 
revision 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
subjects 
studied, 
provide 
sequences 
for 
learning 
related 
to 
children 
in 
the 
lower 
grades 
(l-4), 
and 
be 
sufficiently 
broad 
and 
flexible 
to 
prepare 
secondary 
teachers 
(grade 
5-l 
1) 
in 
at 
least 
two 
major 
subject 
disciplines; 
(iv) 
limited 
awareness 
of 
the 
range 
of 
new 
and 
innovative 
teaching 
and 
learning 
methodologies 
and 
the 
use 
of 
teaching 
materials 
and 
equipment 
in 
the 
preparation 
and 
professional 
development 
of 
teachers; 
(v) 
limited 
qualifications 
and 
experience 
of 
teacher 
training 
staff 
and 
limited 
staff 
development 
opportunities; 
(vi) 
lack 
of 
basic 
equipment 
and 
materials 
for 
effective 
teaching 
and 
learning 
in 
teacher 
education 
institutions; 
and 
(vii) 
an 
oversupply 
of 
teacher 
education 
graduates 
produced 
by 
teacher 
education 
institutions 
in 
certain 
subjects, 
while 
there 
are 
still 
shortages 
in 
several 
subjects 
(e.g., 
foreign 
languages, 
information 
technology) 
(see 
McBride, 
et 
al., 
2002; 
Riley, 
et 
al., 
2003). 
At 
present, 
the 
Government 
plans 
to 
address 
these 
problems 
through 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
national 
teacher 
education 
strategy. 
(4 
Low 
teacher 
salaries. 
Although 
teacher 
salaries 
account 
for 
a 
large 
share 
of 
the 
education 
budget 
(about 
82 
percent 
in 
2002), 
they 
have 
declined 
rapidly 
during 
the 
transition 
and 
today 
are 
low 
and 
compressed 
compared 
with 
the 
national 
average. 
Average 
wages 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
were 
AZM 
-II- 
Page  18
123,705 
in 
1999, 
which 
is 
only 
75 
percent 
of 
the 
average 
public 
sector 
wage 
and 
about 
60 
percent 
of 
their 
private 
sector 
counterparts. 
Furthermore, 
teacher 
salaries 
are 
flat 
and 
largely 
determined 
by 
years 
of 
service 
and 
the 
number 
of 
teaching 
hours 
rather 
than 
by 
professional 
advancement 
and 
performance. 
Low 
pay 
makes 
it 
difficult 
to 
attract 
high 
quality 
candidates 
to 
the 
profession 
and 
a 
weak 
incentive 
system 
makes 
it 
difficult 
to 
motivate 
teachers 
to 
teach 
full 
time 
or 
engage 
in 
professional 
development, 
especially 
outside 
of 
the 
major 
urban 
areas. 
Qualitative 
reports 
suggest 
that 
existing 
low 
wages 
lead 
to 
poor 
teaching 
and 
make 
some 
teachers 
teach 
below 
their 
capacity 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
extra 
income 
through 
private 
tutoring 
or 
make 
some 
teachers 
susceptible 
to 
accepting 
informal 
payments 
(see 
Shahriari, 
2003). 
(ii) 
Inefficient 
Utilization 
of 
Available 
Resources. 
The 
educational 
system 
is 
characterized 
as 
inefficient 
in 
the 
use 
of 
available 
resources. 
For 
example, 
expenditures 
on 
wages 
continue 
to 
crowd 
out 
other 
essential 
expenditures, 
thereby 
distorting 
the 
input 
mix. 
The 
unsustainable 
composition 
of 
expenditures 
can 
best 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
high 
share 
of 
education 
spending 
on 
salaries 
(around 
82 
percent 
of 
the 
education 
budget 
in 
2002) 
and 
the 
failure 
to 
finance 
basic 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials 
and 
capital 
expenditures 
during 
the 
past 
decade 
(see 
World 
Bank, 
2003a; 
2003b). 
There 
are 
likely 
misallocations 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
that 
are 
likely 
to 
have 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
learning 
outcomes. 
In 
1999, 
only 
one 
percent 
of 
education 
spending 
was 
on 
textbooks 
and 
reading 
materials. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
there 
are 
considerable 
shortages 
of 
classrooms 
in 
urban 
areas, 
leading 
to 
about 
75 
percent 
of 
schools 
to 
operate 
on 
double 
and 
triple 
shifts. 
In 
addition, 
most 
schools 
in 
rural 
and 
impoverished 
areas 
need 
substantial 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
due 
to 
long 
foregone 
maintenance 
and 
upkeep 
and, 
consequently, 
rapid 
deterioration 
of 
the 
physical 
facilities 
during 
the 
transition. 
Budget 
allocations 
for 
utilities 
and 
communal 
services 
are 
often 
insufficient 
to 
cover 
the 
basic 
needs. 
Schools 
have 
been 
subjected 
to 
frequent 
power, 
heating 
and 
water 
shortages, 
where 
they 
have 
access 
to 
these 
services. 
Inefficient 
school 
design 
norms 
continue 
to 
be 
used 
for 
building 
new 
schools. 
Until 
these 
norms 
are 
updated, 
the 
limited 
government 
investment 
funds 
available 
for 
badly 
needed 
new 
school 
buildings 
are 
bound 
to 
be 
inefficiently 
utilized. 
The 
high 
wage 
bill 
continues 
to 
reflect 
over-staffing 
in 
the 
educational 
sector. 
For 
example, 
the 
average 
student-teacher 
ratio 
for 
grades 
l-l 
1 
was 
10.1 
to 
1 
in 
2002. 
The 
means 
of 
the 
country 
averages 
for 
the 
thirty 
OECD 
countries 
are 
17.7 
to 
1 
for 
primary 
schools; 
15.0 
to 
1 
for 
lower 
secondary 
schools; 
and 
13.9 
to 
1 
for 
upper 
secondary 
schools. 
If 
Azerbaijan 
were 
to 
achieve 
the 
average 
staffing 
ratio 
of 
the 
OECD 
countries 
for 
each 
of 
the 
three 
levels 
of 
education, 
it 
would 
employ 
36 
percent 
fewer 
teachers. 
The 
small 
number 
of 
students 
per 
teacher 
in 
general 
education 
is 
the 
result 
of 
a 
complex 
chain 
of 
events. 
First, 
the 
highest 
ratios 
of 
students 
to 
teachers 
are 
found 
in 
the 
smallest 
rather 
than 
the 
largest 
schools. 
Second, 
small 
classes, 
rather 
than 
low 
workloads, 
is 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
high 
staffing 
needs 
in 
general 
education. 
For 
exarnple, 
the 
average 
class 
size 
in 
Ismayilli 
for 
grades 
l-9 
is 
8.3 
and 
for 
upper 
secondary 
education 
is 
6.3. 
The 
average 
class 
size 
in 
public 
education 
institutions 
in 
OECD 
countries 
is 
22.1--three 
and 
a 
half 
times 
larger 
than 
the 
class 
size 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
Third, 
the 
policy 
of 
permitting 
teachers 
to 
teach 
only 
in 
their 
area 
of 
specialization 
plays 
a 
substantial 
role 
in 
raising 
the 
number 
of 
teachers 
employed 
and 
in 
determining 
the 
low 
ratio 
of 
students 
to 
teachers 
(see 
Golladay 
and 
Abdullayev, 
2003). 
The 
above 
data 
suggest 
that 
the 
exceptionally 
intensive 
staffing 
of 
schools 
in 
Azerbaijan 
is 
not 
the 
result 
of 
overhiring 
but 
rather 
the 
result 
of 
having 
large 
numbers 
of 
relatively 
small 
schools 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
teach 
a 
complex 
curriculum 
using 
teachers 
who 
have 
specialized 
training 
in 
the 
subject 
being 
taught. 
However, 
consolidation 
of 
small 
schools 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
average 
class 
size 
and 
improve 
the 
utilization 
of 
teaching 
staff 
and 
teaching 
facilities 
would 
be 
a 
practical 
solution 
for 
only 
a 
small 
number 
of 
schools. 
The 
high 
cost 
of 
student 
transportation 
makes 
consolidation 
uneconomic 
for 
most 
rural 
schools. 
Moreover, 
the 
relative 
prices 
of 
teachers 
and 
transportation 
(i.e., 
buses) 
imply 
that 
more 
intensive 
employment 
of 
teachers 
will 
be 
cheaper 
than 
busing 
students 
in 
many 
instances. 
The 
most 
-12- 
Page  19
promising 
option 
for 
improving 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
expenditures 
on 
education 
in 
rural 
areas 
would 
be 
the 
simplification 
of 
the 
curriculum 
and 
training 
teachers 
to 
teach 
in 
two 
or 
more 
subjects 
(see 
Golladay 
and 
Abdullayev, 
2003). 
Rigidity 
in 
the 
budgeting 
norms 
leads 
to 
inefficiencies. 
The 
education 
budget, 
like 
in 
the 
other 
sectors, 
is 
a 
line-item 
budget 
based 
mainly 
on 
the 
Soviet 
era 
planning 
norms, 
and 
spending 
cannot 
be 
shifted 
across 
line 
items 
or 
between 
budget 
years. 
The 
rigid 
nature 
of 
this 
budgeting 
has 
undermined 
the 
ability 
of 
local 
education 
administrations 
to 
prioritize 
expenditures 
and 
to 
allocate 
resources 
according 
to 
local 
needs. 
(iii) 
Growing 
Concerns 
About 
Equitable 
Access 
to 
Education. 
Public 
schooling 
in 
general 
schools 
(grades 
l-l 
1) 
is 
compulsory 
and 
free 
of 
charge. 
Available 
enrollment 
data 
vary 
by 
data 
sources. 
Officially, 
dropout 
rates 
during 
the 
compulsory 
cycle 
are 
low 
(about 
l-2 
percent) 
but 
these 
official 
figures 
are 
based 
on 
enrollments 
rather 
than 
actual 
attendance. 
However, 
available 
household 
surveys 
and 
qualitative 
reports 
suggest 
that 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
children 
of 
compulsory 
school 
age 
do 
not 
attend 
school 
or 
attend 
irregularly, 
especially 
in 
poor 
areas 
with 
large 
refugee 
populations. 
In 
1995, 
the 
enrollment 
rates 
for 
6-l 
6 
year 
olds 
was 
91.4 
percent. 
The 
enrollment 
rate 
for 
17 
years 
and 
above 
was 
3 
1.1 
percent. 
There 
was 
little 
variation 
in 
enrollment 
rates 
by 
poverty 
groupings. 
In 
2002, 
enrollment 
rates 
for 
children 
in 
ages 
6-16 
were 
95 
percent, 
suggesting 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
enrollment 
rates 
during 
the 
past 
five 
years 
(World 
Bank, 
1997; 
2003a). 
Beyond 
this 
age, 
however, 
enrollment 
rates 
drop 
off 
sharply, 
and 
only 
13 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
ages 
17-24 
enrolled 
in 
post-secondary 
education 
institutions. 
There 
are 
also 
large 
disparities 
in 
enrollment 
rates 
by 
poverty 
groups. 
Only 
9 
percent 
of 
the 
poor 
population, 
ages 
17-24, 
were 
enrolled, 
compared 
with 
15 
percent 
of 
the 
non-poor. 
With 
regard 
to 
enrollment 
rates 
by 
residence 
and 
poverty 
grouping, 
recent 
data 
suggest 
that 
there 
is 
no 
or 
little 
disparity 
in 
access 
to 
basic 
education 
(grades 
l-9), 
but 
there 
are 
considerable 
differences 
in 
access 
to 
upper 
secondary 
education 
(grades 
10-l 
1) 
and 
post-secondary 
education. 
While 
enrollment 
rates 
for 
non-poor 
post-secondary 
age 
group 
(17-24) 
is 
15 
percent, 
but 
it 
is 
only 
10.6 
percent 
for 
the 
poor 
and 
9 
percent 
for 
the 
very 
poor. 
The 
most 
significant 
disparity 
is 
in 
access 
to 
post-secondary 
education 
by 
residence. 
Rural 
households 
have 
greater 
problems 
of 
access 
to 
quality 
schooling. 
In 
rural 
areas, 
the 
enrollment 
rate 
for 
the 
very 
poor 
is 
only 
5 
percent, 
but 
it 
is 
about 
25 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas, 
indicating 
large 
disparities 
between 
urban 
and 
rural 
population 
in 
access 
to 
education. 
These 
findings 
suggest 
that 
there 
have 
been 
considerable 
declines 
in 
enrollment 
rates 
after 
compulsory 
education 
during 
the 
past 
six 
years, 
especially 
for 
the 
poor. 
Qualitative 
reports 
also 
suggest 
that 
there 
are 
concerns 
about 
low 
attendance 
rates 
and 
poor 
learning 
outcomes 
in 
general 
education, 
but 
the 
data 
are 
not 
available 
to 
examine 
these 
trends. 
There 
is 
also 
no 
systematic 
data 
collection 
and 
analysis 
of 
enrollment 
and 
attendance 
rates, 
which 
would 
help 
in 
efforts 
to 
examine 
the 
determinants 
of 
enrollments 
in 
upper 
secondary 
education 
and 
post-secondary 
education. 
Private 
costs 
associated 
with 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan, 
as 
in 
other 
transition 
economies, 
have 
gone 
up 
sharply 
during 
the 
transition. 
There 
is 
some 
evidence 
that 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
poor 
families 
cannot 
afford 
the 
increasing 
cost 
of 
education, 
particularly 
that 
of 
high 
quality 
education. 
For 
example, 
the 
1997 
Poverty 
Assessment 
found 
that 
reduced 
real 
government 
spending 
on 
critical 
economic 
categories 
had 
been 
replaced, 
in 
part, 
by 
increased 
private 
spending 
for 
education. 
Since 
the 
mid-1990s 
and 
as 
shown 
by 
the 
new 
household 
budget 
survey 
results, 
real 
private 
spending 
on 
education, 
some 
of 
which 
is 
informal 
payments, 
has 
increased 
sharply. 
Such 
sharp 
increases 
in 
out-of-pocket 
payments 
highlight 
problems 
not 
only 
of 
access 
to 
education 
for 
students 
from 
poor 
families 
but 
also 
of 
transparency. 
According 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
household 
survey 
data 
in 
2001, 
the 
non-poor 
spend 
six 
times 
more 
than 
the 
very 
poor. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
type 
of 
education 
expenditures, 
there 
appear 
to 
be 
large 
disparities 
by 
consumption 
quintile. 
For 
instance, 
the 
very 
poor 
households 
spend 
about 
AZM 
434 
- 
13- 
Page  20
per 
month 
per 
child 
for 
tuition 
and 
tutorials, 
but 
the 
non-poor 
households 
spend 
about 
AZM 
26,178 
per 
month 
per 
child. 
This 
finding 
confirms 
that 
the 
very 
poor 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
have 
access 
to 
quality 
secondary 
education, 
receive 
private 
tutoring, 
and 
attend 
post-secondary 
education 
(see 
World 
Bank, 
2003a). 
These 
findings 
suggest 
that 
the 
poor 
are 
more 
likely 
than 
the 
non-poor 
to 
have 
been 
affected 
considerably 
from 
a 
rapid 
deterioration 
of 
educational 
quality 
during 
the 
transition 
since 
schools 
in 
rural 
districts 
have 
suffered 
from 
the 
poor 
quality 
of 
education 
as 
measured 
by: 
(i) 
the 
availability 
and 
quality 
of 
teaching 
staff; 
(ii) 
the 
availability 
and 
quality 
of 
basic 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials 
and 
equipment; 
(iii) 
the 
physical 
conditions 
of 
school 
buildings, 
laboratories, 
and 
other 
facilities; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
sharp 
increase 
in 
the 
direct 
costs 
of 
education. 
The 
poor 
also 
have 
less 
access 
to 
supplementary 
education 
opportunities 
in 
the 
form 
of 
private 
tutoring 
and 
private 
expenditures 
for 
basic 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
the 
new 
labor 
market 
entrants 
have 
lower 
levels 
of 
education, 
resulting 
in 
inequitable 
labor 
market 
outcomes 
(see 
World 
Bank, 
2003a). 
Gender 
issues 
in 
education. 
Gender 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
a 
problem 
in 
access 
to 
schooling 
in 
Azerbaijan 
at 
the 
general 
level. 
According 
to 
the 
latest 
household 
budget 
survey, 
male 
and 
female 
enrollment 
rates 
are 
almost 
equal. 
However, 
there 
is 
some 
evidence, 
based 
on 
the 
qualitative 
data 
collected 
for 
the 
social 
assessment, 
that 
some 
households 
in 
rural 
areas 
may 
stop 
sending 
their 
daughters 
to 
school 
when 
they 
reach 
puberty. 
In 
general, 
there 
is 
no 
hard 
data 
on 
which 
girls 
schooling 
is 
more 
disrupted 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
among 
the 
poor; 
what 
is 
evident 
is 
that 
the 
poor 
take 
their 
children 
out 
of 
school, 
usually 
after 
the 
primary 
level, 
and 
boys 
may 
suffer 
even 
more 
since 
they 
are 
the 
ones 
sent 
to 
earn 
a 
living 
outside 
the 
home. 
Education 
status 
of 
children 
of 
IDP 
families. 
Another 
issue 
facing 
the 
education 
system 
is 
the 
access 
to 
and 
quality 
of 
education 
received 
by 
the 
children 
of 
internally 
displaced 
people 
(IDP), 
despite 
the 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
assist 
them 
through 
special 
programs 
such 
as 
financial 
assistance. 
According 
to 
the 
national 
household 
survey 
results, 
individuals 
living 
in 
a 
rural 
IDP/refugee 
household 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
poor 
than 
the 
average. 
A 
possible 
reason 
for 
this 
may 
be 
because 
IDPs 
and 
refugees 
did 
not 
receive 
land 
and 
other 
agricultural 
assets 
in 
the 
farm 
privatization 
process. 
However, 
the 
results 
of 
a 
more 
detailed 
survey 
focused 
on 
IDPs 
concluded 
that 
they 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
significantly 
lower 
incomes 
than 
the 
other 
groups 
in 
the 
same 
areas 
with 
whom 
they 
were 
compared, 
although 
the 
survey 
did 
find 
some 
substantial 
differences 
in 
the 
income 
levels 
of 
IDPs. 
What 
is 
clear, 
however, 
is 
that 
the 
IDPs 
are 
a 
core 
group 
of 
vulnerable, 
as 
they 
lack 
assets 
and 
their 
livelihood 
depends 
heavily 
on 
state 
transfers 
or 
donor 
assistance. 
It 
also 
appears 
that 
the 
IDP 
population 
in 
Baku 
is 
of 
particular 
concern, 
as 
they 
tend 
to 
be 
significantly 
worse-off 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
population 
in 
the 
capital 
city 
(World 
Bank, 
2003a). 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
also 
indicate 
that 
IDP 
children 
attend 
school 
less 
regularly, 
and 
some 
of 
the 
IDP 
children 
are 
kept 
out 
of 
school 
for 
a 
year 
or 
two 
due 
to 
the 
relocation 
of 
the 
family. 
This 
then 
means 
that 
older 
children, 
for 
instance 
at 
the 
age 
of 
11, 
are 
being 
forced 
to 
sit 
next 
to 
8 
year 
olds, 
causing 
some 
of 
these 
children 
not 
to 
want 
to 
continue. 
Most 
IDPs 
also 
have 
their 
separate 
schools 
with 
mostly 
IDP 
teachers. 
In 
these 
cases, 
classes 
are 
held 
in 
different 
buildings 
and 
sometimes 
in 
regular 
schools, 
sharing 
school 
buildings 
and 
other 
facilities. 
In 
such 
cases, 
most 
IDP 
schools 
not 
only 
lack 
basic 
teaching 
and 
learning 
resources, 
affecting 
the 
quality 
of 
education, 
but 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
existing 
poor 
learning 
environment 
due 
to 
overcrowding. 
Another 
general 
issue 
is 
the 
IDPs 
moving 
to 
the 
Baku 
area. 
This 
has 
created 
a 
problem 
for 
both 
host 
community 
and 
IDPs. 
Schools 
in 
the 
Baku 
area 
are 
usually 
overcrowded 
largely 
due 
to 
an 
influx 
of 
internal 
migration, 
including 
IDPs 
and 
refugee 
families, 
during 
the 
past 
decade. 
Many 
schools 
were 
built 
to 
have 
about 
20 
to 
24 
students 
per 
classroom, 
but 
many 
schools 
now 
have 
not 
only 
two 
or 
three 
shifts 
a 
day, 
but 
also 
have 
average 
class 
sizes 
of 
about 
33 
- 
140 
Page  21
and 
43 
students. 
This 
has 
both 
social 
and 
educational 
implications, 
receive, 
which 
is 
discussed 
in 
the 
social 
assessment 
(see 
Annex 
15).

The 
education 
sector 
is 
inadequately 
organized 
and 
managed 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
education 
services. 
Additionally, 
the 
MOE 
has 
a 
weak 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
to 
support 
tasks 
such 
as 
policy 
development 
and 
long 
term 
planning, 
and 
an 
effective 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
that 
will 
assess 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
education 
system 
and 
the

process. 
Fragmentation 
of 
decision-making. 
In 
Azerbaijan, 
the 
financing 
and 
management 
of 
the 
education 
system 
continues 
to 
be 
highly 
fragmented. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
financing 
of 
education, 
while 
the 
MOE 
has 
the 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
overall 
policy 
and 
planning, 
curriculum 
and 
textbook 
development, 
teacher 
training, 
and 
monitoring 
for 
the 
general 
education 
system, 
the 
MOF 
is 
responsible 
for 
allocating 
the 
state 
budget 
for 
general 
education 
through 
local 
governments, 
often 
without 
substantial 
inputs 
from 
the 
MOE. 
This 
deficiency 
is 
one 
of 
the 
major 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
management 
of 
the 
delivery 
of 
education 
services 
since 
the 
fragmentation 
in 
the 
financing 
and 
management 
of 
education 
institutions 
hampered 
the 
formulation 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
consistent 
education 
policy. 
This 
fragmentation 
of 
authority 
has 
led 
to 
duplication 
of 
facilities, 
particularly 
for 
vocational 
and 
technical 
education 
(VTE) 
and 
higher 
education. 
In 
1992, 
the 
management 
and 
financing 
of 
general 
education 
was 
devolved 
to 
the 
district 
departments 
of 
education. 
However, 
this 
process 
has 
not 
been 
accompanied 
with 
sufficient 
provisions 
of 
fiscal 
resources 
and 
development 
of 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
at 
the 
local 
levels. 
Weak 
management 
andplunning 
capacity. 
The 
MOE 
does 
not 
have 
a 
clear 
strategy 
on 
policy 
and 
management 
development. 
No 
staff 
development 
policy 
has 
been 
designed 
for 
managerial 
staff, 
neither 
at 
the 
central 
nor 
local 
levels. 
Retraining 
activities 
take 
place, 
incidentally, 
at 
the 
initiative 
of 
the 
department 
where 
a 
staff 
member 
works. 
Apart 
from 
ad 
hoc 
attendance 
at 
short 
courses, 
seminars 
and 
conferences, 
managers 
and 
staff 
are 
not 
systematically 
retrained 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
individual 
training 
needs 
assessment. 
No 
special 
fund 
is 
reserved 
for 
retraining 
of 
staff 
and 
the 
personnel 
department 
has 
not 
been 
given 
a 
role 
in 
making 
inventories 
of 
training 
needs 
and 
retraining 
supply 
infrastructure. 
The 
existing 
retraining 
infrastructure, 
which 
itself 
shows 
many 
deficiencies, 
is 
not 
tuned 
towards 
managerial 
development. 
Some 
private 
and 
state 
universities 
may 
offer 
management 
and 
technical 
courses 
suitable 
for 
retraining 
of 
ministerial 
staff, 
e.g., 
educational 
management 
under 
the 
Public 
Administration 
Institute, 
but 
in 
general, 
higher 
education 
institutions 
lack 
an 
academic 
unit 
to 
educate 
future 
leaders 
and 
policy 
analysts 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
and 
to 
carry 
out 
independent 
education 
policy 
research. 
Lack 
of 
un 
education 
management 
information 
system. 
Another 
function 
that 
is 
not 
well 
represented 
in 
the 
organizational 
structure 
of 
the 
MOE 
is 
a 
Management 
Information 
System. 
At 
present, 
different 
departments 
collect 
management 
information 
for 
their 
own 
purposes, 
but 
the 
collection 
of 
data 
and 
information 
is 
not 
targeted 
on 
any 
systematic 
assessment 
and 
evaluation 
of 
educational 
performance. 
The 
data 
collected 
by 
the 
MOE 
is 
insufficiently 
disseminated 
and 
used 
for 
policy 
making. 
Very 
little 
information 
is 
currently 
collected 
for 
international 
comparison, 
especially 
concerning 
the 
performance 
and 
productivity 
of 
the 
education 
sector. 
Moreover, 
international 
standards 
and 
indicators 
are 
not 
systematically 
used 
in 
the 
renewal 
of 
the 
Azerbaijan 
educational 
reform 
process. 
Although 
data 
and 
information 
collection 
and 
exchange 
is 
in 
some 
way 
organized, 
there 
is 
no 
clear 
concept 
of 
the 
type 
and 
management 
purposes 
for 
which 
it 
is 
to 
be 
used. 
A 
clear 
information 
strategy, 
derived 
from 
educational 
and 
managerial 
priorities, 
is 
lacking. 
The 
driving 
force 
behind 
an 
information 
strategy

the 
Division 
for 
Analysis 
and 
Forecast 
of 
the 
MOE, 
but 
this 
division 
lacks 
a 
work 
program 
corresponding 
with 
the 
name 
of 
the 
division. 
The 
design 
of 
a 
good 
management 
information 
system 
has 
never 
been 
formulated 
or 
effectuated, 
neither 
by 
this 
division 
nor 
by 
any 
other 
unit. 
No 
work 
program 
has 
been 
developed 
and 
implemented 
for 
policy 
analysis 
(e.g., 
demography, 
student 
flows, 
labor 
market 
demand, 
teacher 
demand 
and 
supply, 
or 
school 
infrastructure, 
equipment 
or 
maintenance 
needs). 
Weak 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
capacity. 
There 
is 
no 
systematic 
and 
reliable 
information 
on 
students’ 
learning 
outcomes 
in 
general 
education 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
national 
student 
assessment 
system. 
There 
is 
also 
no 
capacity 
to 
make 
an 
objective 
evaluation 
of 
the 
performance 
of 
schools 
as 
the 
unit 
of 
change. 
In 
1992, 
the 
State 
Student 
Admission 
Commission 
(SSAC) 
was 
established, 
modeled 
after 
the 
Turkish 
Student 
Entrance 
Examination 
Center, 
to 
carry 
out 
university 
entrance 
and 
placement 
examinations. 
Over 
the 
past 
decade, 
the 
SSAC 
has 
improved 
its 
technical 
capacity 
significantly 
to 
carry 
out 
more 
transparent, 
fair 
and 
large 
scale 
national 
university 
entrance 
examinations, 
but 
it 
has 
no 
experience 
and 
responsibility 
for 
student 
assessments 
in 
general 
education. 
Mastery 
of 
basic 
learning 
competencies 
is 
equated 
with 
successful 
completion 
of 
grades. 
Nearly 
all 
assessment 
of 
student 
learning 
in 
grades 
l-l 
1 
is 
classroom-based, 
carried 
out 
by 
teachers 
evaluating 
their 
own 
students. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
existing 
assessment 
is 
to 
ascertain 
what 
students 
can 
remember 
rather 
than 
their 
learning 
abilities. 
The 
present 
school-based 
and 
teacher-centered 
system 
is 
not 
providing 
a 
sufficiently 
clear 
picture 
of 
what 
students 
actually 
know, 
understand, 
and 
are 
able 
to 
do 
in 
terms 
of 
nationally 
set 
standards. 
While 
the 
present 
system 
respects 
the 
experience 
and 
judgment 
of 
teachers, 
it 
does 
not 
provide 
the 
Ministry 
enough 
reliable, 
valid 
and 
comparable 
information 
about 
student 
learning 
outcomes 
or 
school 
performance 
in 
achieving 
national 
objectives 
across 
the 
country. 
The 
absence 
of 
a 
national 
student 
assessment 
system 
makes 
it 
difficult 
to 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
decentralization 
or 
any 
other 
reform 
on 
student 
learning 
outcomes 
and 
the 
system’s 
performance. 
The 
MOE 
plans 
to 
develop 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
assess 
student 
learning 
outcomes. 
The 
information 
collected 
can 
then 
be 
utilized 
to 
develop 
national 
policies 
to 
address 
the 
regional 
variations 
in 
coverage 
and 
educational 
quality. 
The 
Government’s 
Education 
Reform 
Program. 
In 
1999, 
the 
President 
and 
the 
National 
Parliament 
approved 
a 
comprehensive 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
that 
aims 
at: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
student 
learning; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening 
its 
capacity 
to 
manage 
its 
resources 
effectively, 
efficiently 
and 
equitably. 
The 
reform 
program 
targeted: 
(1) 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
teacher 
training; 
(2) 
provision 
of 
educational 
materials 
including 
textbooks; 
and 
(3) 
educational 
management 
and 
finance. 
The 
reform 
program 
stresses 
the 
need 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
services 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
market 
economy. 
Since 
then, 
Azerbaijan 
has 
made 
some 
progress 
in 
initiating 
reforms 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
with 
particular 
focus 
on 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
training, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
new 
textbooks 
and 
materials 
for 
general 
education. 
However, 
the 
reform 
has 
still 
a 
long 
way 
to 
go 
before 
being 
completed. 
The 
Government 
plans 
to 
continue 
implementing 
the 
reforms 
initiated 
with 
the 
assistance 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
other 
interested 
donors 
through 
the 
follow-up 
investment 
operation. 
The 
Government 
plan 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
draft 
Ten-Year 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy 
that 
shows 
the 
Government’s 
specific 
strategic 
directions 
and 
priorities 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
following 
main 
areas 
of 
concerns 
have 
been 
listed 
in 
the 
order 
of 
priority: 
(i) 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching 
and 
learning; 
(ii) 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
student 
learning 
assessment 
system; 
(iii) 
teacher 
development 
(pre-service 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
training); 
(iv) 
strengthening 
of 
management 
and 
governance; 
(v) 
improvement 
in 
the 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources; 
(vi) 
upgrading 
of 
the 
curriculum 
for 
general 
education; 
(vii) 
provision 
of 
new 
equipment 
and 
learning 
materials; 
(viii) 
improvement 
in 
-

Page  23
access 
to 
quality 
education; 
(ix) 
improvement 
of 
the 
availability 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
textbooks 
in 
general 
education; 
and 
(x) 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
higher 
education. 
Based 
on 
the 
draft 
Ten-Year 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy, 
the 
MOE 
prepared 
a 
preliminary 
project 
proposal 
and 
requested 
the 
Bank’s 
assistance 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
some 
of 
its 
components. 
The 
strategy 
covered 
the 
following 
major 
components: 
(i) 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
higher 
education; 
(iii) 
development 
of 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity; 
and 
(iv) 
teacher 
education 
improvement 
(see 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
2002b). 
The 
Government’s 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
is 
also 
consistent 
with 
the 
Government’s 
“State 
Program 
on 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Economic 
Development 
(SPPRED) 
in 
the 
Azerbaijan 
Republic 
for 
2003-2005”, 
which 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
on 
February 
20,2003. 
The 
SPPRED 
shows 
the 
strong 
commitment 
of 
the 
Government 
to 
the 
education 
sector 
for 
poverty 
alleviation, 
and 
identifies 
that 
access 
to 
good 
quality 
education 
is 
one 
factor 
that 
can 
help 
protect 
the 
population 
from 
vulnerability. 
The 
following 
overall 
strategic 
objectives 
of 
the 
SPPRED 
concerning 
the 
education 
sector 
are 
to: 
(i) 
provide 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
good 
quality 
education; 
(ii) 
ensure 
that 
the 
content 
of 
education 
is 
revised 
and 
teaching 
methods 
modernized; 
(iii) 
improve 
the 
motivation 
of 
teachers 
through 
increased 
wages 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
bonus 
system 
based 
on 
performance 
evaluation; 
and 
(iv) 
ensure 
that 
vocational 
education 
provides 
skills 
appropriate 
for 
a 
market 
economy 
(see 
MOED, 
2002, 
p. 
66). 
The 
report 
also 
identified 
several 
major 
strategic 
directions. 
As 
far 
as 
the 
improvement 
of 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
education 
is 
concerned, 
the 
report 
suggested: 
(a) 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
teacher 
training 
to 
improve 
and 
realign 
the 
existing 
curricula 
based 
on 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
emerging 
economy 
and 
the 
political 
and 
social 
environment; 
(b) 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
teaching 
staff 
through 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
basic 
wages 
while 
reducing 
the 
total 
number 
of 
teachers; 
and 
(c) 
improving 
the 
physical 
conditions 
of 
schools 
through 
rehabilitation, 
refurbishment 
and 
provision 
of 
new 
technologies. 
As 
far 
as 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms 
are 
concerned, 
the 
report 
suggested 
reforming 
the 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
system 
through 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
decentralized 
and 
flexible 
finance 
system. 
As 
far 
as 
equity 
and 
access 
is 
concerned, 
the 
report 
also 
suggested 
improving 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
higher 
education 
through 
reform 
of 
the 
student 
financial 
aid 
system 
and 
improving 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
quality 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education 
(grades 
l-l 
1) 
through 
provision 
of 
free 
textbooks 
for 
all 
students. 
The 
estimated 
cost 
of 
the 
reforms 
proposed 
under 
the 
SPPRED 
for 
a 
period 
of 
2003-2005 
will 
be 
about 
US$72 
million. 
On 
October 
4, 
2002, 
a 
Presidential 
Decree 
was 
issued 
concerning 
the 
need 
to 
upgrade 
and 
improve 
a 
selected 
number 
of 
general 
schools 
through 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment, 
and 
to 
construct 
new 
schools 
especially 
in 
urban 
areas 
to 
address 
the 
overcrowding 
issues 
in 
general 
education. 
Since 
then, 
the 
MOE 
prepared 
the 
State 
School 
Infrastructure 
Improvement 
Plan 
(SSIIP) 
based 
on 
a 
national 
survey 
of 
4,5 
13 
general 
schools, 
and 
estimated 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
plan 
would 
be 
around 
US$60 
million 
during 
the 
period 
of 
2003-2007. 
On 
February 
17,2003, 
the 
Government 
approved 
the 
Plan, 
which 
will 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
government 
budget. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
Government’s 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy 
aims 
at 
reforming 
the 
education 
system 
over 
the 
ten-year 
period 
in 
three 
phases. 
The 
activities 
supported 
by 
the 
Program 
complement 
many 
aspects 
of 
the 
reform 
and 
are 
in 
a 
way 
essential 
for 
its 
successful 
implementation. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
Program 
will 
address 
four 
main 
sectoral 
issues: 
(i) 
the 
need 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
the 
need 
to 
enhance 
efficiency 
in 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
use 
of 
resources 
in 
the 
general 
education 
sector; 
(iii) 
the 
need 
to 
reverse 
the 
deterioration 
of 
the 
coverage 
of 
general 
education 
enrollment; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
need 
to 
raise 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE, 
local 
education 
authorities 
and 
school 
principals 
to 
plan, 
manage, 
and 
monitor 
the 
education 
sector 
more 
efficiently, 
effectively 
and 
equitably, 
including 
strengthening 
its 
accountability 
to 
the 
key 
stakeholders. 
-

Page  24
The 
ECA 
Region’s 
education 
strategy 
also 
underscores 
the 
need 
to 
(i) 
realign 
education 
systems 
in 
transition 
economies 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
market 
economies 
and 
open 
societies 
through 
curricula 
reform 
and 
teaching 
methods; 
(ii) 
improve 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
education 
through 
the 
development 
of 
policy 
analysis 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
and 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
specific 
preventive 
interventions 
for 
the 
poor; 
(iii) 
reform 
the 
financing 
of 
education 
through 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
sustainable 
and 
fair 
mechanism, 
which 
will 
protect 
the 
access 
of 
all 
children 
to 
an 
education 
of 
acceptable 
quality; 
(iv) 
improve 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources 
available 
in 
the 
sector 
through 
staff 
rationalization 
and 
policy 
reforms 
such 
as 
curriculum 
reforms 
(e.g., 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
subjects); 
and 
(v) 
restructure 
the 
sector, 
and 
improve 
governance, 
management 
and 
accountability. 
In 
designing 
the 
Program, 
the 
following 
strategic 
choices 
were 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
terms 
of 
focus, 
scope 
and 
capacity 
to 
address 
the 
key 
sector 
issues:

of 
key

reforms 
(e.g., 
curriculum 
reform, 
teacher

the 
provision 
of

for 
school

strengthen 
the 
capacity 
to

and 
monitor 
the 
reform

The 
Program 
will 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
realigning 
curriculum 
objectives 
of 
general 
education 
through 
curriculum 
reform. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Program 
will 
assist 
the 
Government 
to 
prevent 
further 
deterioration 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education 
through 
a 
set 
of 
specific 
interventions 
such 
as: 
(i) 
teacher 
development 
through 
improvement 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
in-service 
and 
pre-service 
teacher 
education; 
(ii) 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
for 
school 
libraries; 
(iii) 
provision 
of 
selective 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials 
and 
equipment 
and 
school 
improvement 
in 
selected 
districts; 
and 
(iv) 
creating 
a 
school-based 
innovative 
grants 
program 
for 
demand-driven 
local 
school 
projects 
to 
upgrade 
schooling 
quality 
in 
selected 
districts. 
The 
strategic 
choice 
of 
supporting 
these 
reforms 
of 
the 
Government 
through 
the 
operation 
is 
based 
on: 
(i) 
the 
evidence 
that 
economic 
returns 
to 
investment 
in 
general 
education 
have 
higher 
value-added 
and 
the 
quality 
improvement 
cumulatively 
lead 
to 
higher 
quality 
of 
students 
entering 
into 
the 
higher 
education 
system; 
(ii) 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Program 
builds 
on 
the 
experiences 
learned 
under 
the 
LIL 
and, 
therefore, 
requires 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
curriculum 
development 
process 
of 
the 
remaining 
grades 
and 
its 
expansion 
throughout 
the 
country; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
need 
to 
deepen 
the 
institutional 
framework 
and 
structures 
required 
to 
implement 
reform 
in 
the 
related 
areas 
of 
teacher 
training 
and 
learning 
assessment. 
The 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
calls 
for 
the 
rapid 
computerization 
of 
general 
schools 
across 
the 
country. 
Although 
this 
is 
a 
laudable 
goal, 
a 
national 
comprehensive 
strategy 
in 
the 
use 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technology 
in 
enhancing 
and 
facilitating 
learning, 
needs 
to 
be 
developed 
before 
the 
introduction 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technology 
classrooms. 
There 
are 
also 
issues 
of 
developing 
subject 
matter 
contents, 
computer-based 
instruction, 
training 
of 
teachers, 
and 
the 
maintenance 
of 
the 
system. 
Under 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program, 
the 
strategic 
choice 
is 
to 
focus 
on 
the 
introduction 
and 
use 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technology 
in 
a 
small 
number 
of 
selected 
schools 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis, 
with 
particular 
focus 
on 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
national 
strategy 
for 
the 
information 
and 
communication 
technology 
in 
general 
education.

Efficiency 
in 
Resource 
Allocation 
and 
Use. 
There 
is 
an 
urgent 
need 
to 
address 
several 
efficiency 
issues 
that 
undermine 
improvements 
in 
quality 
and 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
education. 
These 
indicators 
suggest 
some 
scope 
for 
cost 
savings 
through 
internal 
efficiency 
improvements 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
sector, 
e.g., 
low 
student-teacher 
ratios 
in 
general 
education 
(10: 
1 
compared 
with 
about 
the 
average 
of 
15: 
1 
in 
OECD 
countries). 
There 
is 
a 
clear 
need 
to 
develop 
the 
capacity 
in 
the 
country 
to 
make 
better 
use 
of 
limited 
financial, 
physical 
and 
human 
resources, 
and 
strengthen 
the 
coordination 
between 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
The 
Program 
would 
address 
efficiency 
issues 
in 
general 
education 
through 
the 
following 
interventions: 
Efficiency 
arzdfinance 
reforms. 
The 
Program 
would 
support 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
education 
and 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement 
in 
the 
three 
selected 
districts 
under 
Phase 
1, 
and 
the 
expansion 
of 
these 
reforms 
under 
Phases 
2 
and 
3 
of 
the 
APC. 
Finance 
reforms 
would 
ensure 
both 
fairness 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
centrally 
generated 
funds 
to 
rayons 
and 
schools 
using 
demand-side 
financing 
(e.g., 
a 
capitation-based 
Page  26
formula). 
Rationalization 
reforms 
will 
address 
both 
staff 
and 
physical 
facilities 
in 
the 
three 
districts 
based 
on 
the 
development 
of 
district 
rationalization 
plans. 
Curriculum 
reform. 
The 
Program 
would 
introduce 
a 
national 
curriculum 
framework 
for 
outcome-based 
standards, 
emphasize 
integrated 
subjects, 
and 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
overly 
specialized 
subjects. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
curriculum 
reform 
will 
also 
lead 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
demand 
for 
the 
number 
of 
teachers 
and 
thereby 
greater 
staff 
rationalization 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
Teacher 
education 
and 
training 
reforms. 
The 
Program 
would 
enhance 
not 
only 
the 
quality 
of 
teacher 
education 
and 
training 
institutions 
through 
staff 
and 
institutional 
development, 
but 
it 
will 
also 
improve 
efficiency 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
through 
downsizing 
the 
number 
of 
institutions, 
training 
teachers 
across 
subjects 
instead 
of 
single 
subjects, 
training 
teachers 
for 
multigrade 
teaching, 
reducing 
the 
supply 
of 
new 
teachers, 
and 
exploring 
possibilities 
to 
integrate 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
with 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
institutions. 
Introduction 
of 
a 
new 
human 
resource 
policy. 
The 
Program 
would 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
development 
of 
a 
human 
resource 
policy 
based 
on 
a 
merit-based 
recruitment 
and 
objective 
performance 
evaluation 
that 
could 
offer 
appropriate 
incentives 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
effective 
administrators 
and 
teachers 
in 
the 
system. 
Improved 
management, 
planning, 
and 
monitoring 
capacity. 
The 
Program 
would 
build 
capacity 
at 
the 
MOE 
to 
better 
manage, 
plan 
and 
monitor 
the 
use 
of 
the 
existing 
resources 
in 
a 
more 
efficient 
manner 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
Education 
Management 
Information 
System 
(EMIS), 
a 
new 
system 
of 
student 
assessment, 
and 
development 
of 
planning 
and 
policy 
analysis 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE. 
The 
planned 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
building 
at 
the 
various 
levels 
of 
the 
education 
sector 
would 
also 
enhance 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
education 
managers 
to 
strengthen 
their 
managerial 
decision-making, 
especially 
in 
the 
deployment 
and 
utilization 
of 
resources.

Equity 
in 
Access 
to 
Quality 
General 
Education. 
Presently, 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
meet 
the 
education 
needs 
of 
the 
country 
is 
very 
limited. 
The 
governance 
capability 
of 
the 
MOE 
needs 
to 
be 
built 
and 
strengthened 
to 
ensure 
that 
when 
the 
private 
sector 
provision 
of 
education 
services 
becomes 
widely 
available 
in 
the 
future, 
the 
MOE 
has 
the 
capacity 
to 
monitor 
and 
provide 
quality 
assurance. 
More 
importantly, 
low-income 
districts 
and 
children 
from 
low-income 
households 
must 
have 
guaranteed 
access 
to 
basic 
education. 
The 
present 
public 
education 
system 
is 
the 
only 
provider 
for 
such 
services. 
The 
Program 
will 
address 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
general 
education 
through 
both 
supply 
and 
demand 
side 
interventions. 
On 
the 
supply 
side, 
the 
Program 
will 
finance 
the 
following 
specific 
interventions: 
(i) 
curriculum 
reform 
in 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
teacher 
development; 
(iii) 
the 
provision 
of 
basic 
learning 
materials 
and 
equipment, 
including 
reading 
materials 
for 
school 
libraries 
for 
all 
general 
schools 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
schools 
and 
reduce 
variation 
in 
access 
to 
quality 
schooling, 
especially 
in 
the 
three 
rural 
and 
impoverished 
districts; 
and 
(iv) 
school 
improvement 
through 
selected 
school 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
in 
the 
three 
selected 
districts. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Program 
will 
improve 
data 
collection 
and 
policy 
analysis 
under 
the 
management 
and 
policy 
development 
effort 
so 
that 
equities 
in 
access 
to 
education 
and 
learning 
materials 
and 
learning 
outcomes 
can 
be 
better 
monitored 
and 
analyzed. 
On 
the 
demand 
side, 
attention 
will 
focus 
on 
“poverty

school 
grants” 
to 
address 
specific 
demand

factors, 
as 
determined 
by 
local 
communities 
and

districts, 
affecting 
poor 
students’ 
access

quality 
general 
education.

Management,

Monitoring 
Capacity. 
The 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL) 
under 
implementation 
clearly 
provided 
evidence 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
institutional 
and 
human 
capacity 
to 
manage 
the 
education 
system 
effectively 
at 
various 
levels. 
The 
Program 
does 
not 
attempt 
to 
undertake 
a 
comprehensive 
systemic 
reforrn, 
but 
rather 
to 
build 
capacity 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
the 
Institute 
on 
Education 
Problems, 
and 
the 
local 
departments 
of 
education 
to 
gradually 
implement 
managerial 
and 
administrative 
changes 
through 
training 
in 
education 
planning 
and 
management. 
This 
capacity 
building 
will 
be 
complemented 
through: 
(i) 
a 
strengthened 
education 
management 
information 
system 
(EMIS) 
that 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
Program; 
(ii) 
the 
establishment 
of 
a

establishment 
of

Program 
description 
and 
performance 
triggers 
for 
subsequent 
loans: 
The 
main 
purposes 
of 
the 
proposed 
APC 
are 
to 
increase 
learning 
achievements 
in 
general 
education 
for 
all 
school-age 
children 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
general 
education. 
As 
noted 
above, 
to 
achieve 
this 
purpose, 
the 
APC 
would 
support 
a 
plan 
of 
activities 
and 
interventions 
that 
would 
be 
implemented 
in 
three 
phases 
over 
a 
period 
of 
ten 
years. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
APC 
would 
focus 
on 
general 
education, 
covering 
both 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
Phase 
3, 
there 
would 
have 
been 
the 
following 
achievements: 
(i) 
access 
to 
quality 
general 
education 
would 
have 
been 
increased 
for 
all; 
(ii) 
students 
would 
be 
better 
equipped 
to 
meet 
the 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
needs 
of 
the 
emerging 
market 
economy 
and 
the 
political 
and 
social 
environment; 
and 
(iii) 
there 
would 
be 
more 
capacity 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
to 
use 
resources 
efficiently 
and 
effectively, 
and 
initiate 
and 
implement 
reforms 
in 
other 
levels 
of 
education, 
including 
vocational 
and 
technical 
education, 
and 
higher 
education. 
The 
project 
development 
objective 
(PDO) 
of 
Phase 
1 
is 
to 
strengthen 
capacity 
to 
plan 
and 
manage 
the 
reform 
program 
more 
effectively 
and 
efficiently, 
develop 
a 
suitable 
mechanism 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
including 
assessment 
of 
learning 
outcomes, 
and 
initiate 
the 
highest 
priority 
investments, 
focused 
on 
the 
poor 
in 
the 
three 
selected 
districts. 
The 
specific 
activities 
included 
in 
Phase 
1 
are 
described 
under 
Section 
C 
and 
in 
Annex 
2. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
APC 
would 
focus 
on 
a 
set 
of 
key 
issues 
in 
general 
education, 
namely: 
(i) 
improvement 
of 
quality 
and 
relevance 
in 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
improvement 
of 
efficiency 
in 
resource 
allocation 
and 
utilization 
in 
general 
education; 
(iii) 
improvement 
in 
equity 
and 
access 
to 
general 
education; 
and 
(iv) 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
strengthening. 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APC 
would 
support 
reforrns 
at 
the 
national 
level 
(e.g., 
curriculum 
reform, 
teacher 
training, 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
school 
libraries, 
and 
student 
assessment) 
and 
a 
set 
of 
specific 
interventions 
and 
reforms 
in 
three 
priority 
districts 
(e.g., 
school 
improvement, 
school 
grants, 
information 
technology, 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms). 
These 
specific 
interventions 
would 
be 
expanded 
under 
the 
Second 
and 
Third 
Phases 
of 
the 
Program 
based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
First 
Phase. 
The 
PDO 
of 
Phase 
2 
(2007-2010), 
if 
approved, 
would 
be 
to 
expand 
coverage 
and 
extend 
the 
scope 
of 
interventions 
and 
develop 
ftiher 
management 
skills, 
particularly 
at 
local 
levels, 
based 
on 
evolving 
needs. 
The 
PDO 
of 
Phase 
3 
(2010-20 
13), 
if 
approved, 
would 
be 
to 
achieve 
full 
national 
coverage, 
consolidate 
interventions 
and 
review 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
reform 
program. 
The 
triggers 
for 
moving 
to 
the 
Second 
and 
Third 
Phases 
of 
the 
Program. 
Nine 
triggers, 
summarized 
in 
Table 
2, 
are 
proposed 
for 
proceeding 
to 
the 
Second 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program, 
as 
well 
as 
nine 
Triggers 
for 
proceeding 
to 
the 
Third 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program. 
The 
proposed 
triggers 
will 
be

before 
authorization 
of 
Phase 
2 
and 
3 
of 
the 
Program.

Program 
and 
Project 
Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed 
description 
and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
The 
Program 
comprises 
a 
broad 
spectrum 
of 
activities 
which 
promote 
the 
objectives 
of 
improved 
educational 
quality, 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
education, 
and 
the 
efficient 
use 
of 
available 
resources 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program 
consists 
of 
the 
following 
components, 
each 
of 
which 
includes 
several 
subcomponents 
and/or 
activities: 
(i) 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms; 
(iii) 
equity 
and 
access; 
and 
(iv) 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
development. 
Additionally, 
the 
project 
management 
and 
evaluation 
component 
would 
finance 
project 
management 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
activities. 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APC 
would 
support 
priority 
investments 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
(i.e., 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ismayilli, 
and 
Ujar), 
while 
also 
supporting 
substantial 
reforms 
at 
the 
national 
levels. 
The 
pilot 
districts 
were 
selected 
based 
on 
a 
set 
of 
criteria 
(see 
Annex 
13). 
(See 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed 
description 
of 
program 
components, 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown.) 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APC 
would 
consist 
of 
the 
following 
main 
components: 
Component 
1 
- 
Quality 
and 
Relevance 
of 
General 
Education 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$7.05 
million) 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
through 
the 
following 
specific 
interventions: 
(i) 
curriculum 
reform 
for 
grades 
l-1 
1; 
(ii) 
development 
and 
enhancement 
of 
teacher 
capabilities 
through 
upgrading 
of 
teaching 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
in 
the 
new 
curricula 
and 
the 
use 
of 
new 
teaching 
methodologies 
(e.g., 
interactive 
teaching 
methods); 
and 
(iii) 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
for 
school 
libraries. 
The 
Program 
will 
also 
improve 
educational 
quality 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts 
(in 
conjunction 
with 
Component 
2) 
through 
school 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment. 
Subcomponent 
I: 
Curriculum 
Development 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$I.21 
million). 
This 
subcomponent 
would 
support 
the 
Government’s 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
curriculum 
development 
capacity 
in 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems 
(IEP), 
design 
and 
adopt 
the 
National 
Curriculum 
Framework 
and 
prepare 
and 
implement 
new 
national 
standards 
and 
syllabi 
for 
grades 
l-l 
1 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
emerging 
market 
economy 
and 
the 
social 
and 
political 
environment. 
This 
subcomponent 
would 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
training, 
and 
goods 
(e.g., 
resource 
materials 
and 
equipment 
for 
the 
Department 
of 
Curriculum 
Development 
and 
curriculum 
printing). 
Subcomponent 
2: 
Teacher 
Development 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$2S7 
million). 
The 
Project 
seeks 
to 
establish 
strong 
links 
between 
education 
reforms 
and 
teacher 
professional 
development 
through 
both 
initial 
teacher 
preparation 
and 
in-service 
training. 
This 
also 
requires 
the 
reform 
of 
pre-service 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
education 
programs 
based 
on 
the 
curricular 
reform 
in 
general 
education. 
The 
curricular 
reform 
envisioned 
under 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
requires 
significant 
changes 
in 
teachers’ 
knowledge 
and 
skills. 
The 
quality 
of 
teaching 
will 
depend 
on: 
(i) 
how 
well 
teachers 
are 
prepared 
to 
implement 
the 
new 
curricula 
and 
use 
the 
new 
teaching 
materials 
and 
(ii) 
exposure 
of 
teachers 
to 
alternative 
teaching 
and 
learning 
approaches, 
especially 
those 
focusing 
on 
student-centered 
and 
active 
learning 
methodologies. 
Therefore, 
teacher 
training 
is 
critical 
to 
a 
successful 
implementation 
of 
new 
curricula 
and 
teaching 
methods 
and 
empowerment 
of 
teachers 
who 
will 
enhance 
their 
skills. 
In 
order 
to 
develop 
an 
effective 
teacher 
training 
strategy 
and 
prepare 
innovative 
teacher 
training 
activities 
under 
the 
Program, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
assess: 
(i) 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
current 
teacher 
training 
programs 
and 
classroom 
teaching 
practices 
and 
(ii) 
the 
training 
needs 
of 
teachers 
and 
schools 
based 
on 
the 
demands 
of 
new 
curricula, 
a 
market 
economy, 
and 
an 
open 
society.

This 
subcomponent 
would 
assist 
the 
MOE 
in 
two 
main 
areas: 
(a) 
continued 
development 
of 
in-service 
teacher 
training, 
including 
the 
mass-training 
of 
about 
9,000 
teachers 
(or 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
present 
primary 
education 
teachers); 
and 
(b) 
initial 
reforms 
for 
pre-service 
teacher 
education. 
The 
Program 
seeks 
to 
improve 
the 
standards 
of 
all 
training 
and 
the 
qualifications 
of 
all 
teacher 
education 
staff, 
including 
revitalizing 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“professional 
practitioner” 
in 
teacher 
education 
among 
teachers 
in 
the 
schools, 
and 
its 
acceptance 
by 
the 
community. 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
training, 
and 
goods 
to 
strengthen 
the 
existing 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
(i.e., 
Azerbaijan 
Teachers 
Institutes 
and 
its 
10 
affiliates, 
Baku 
City 
Teacher 
Training 
Institute, 
Genje 
Teacher 
Training 
Institute, 
and 
Nakchevan 
Teacher 
Training 
Institute). 
This 
subcomponent 
would 
also 
finance 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
of 
the 
four 
selected 
teacher 
training 
institutes. 
Subcomponent 
3: 
Textbooks 
and 
Reading 
Materials 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$3.27 
million). 
The 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
textbook 
and 
reading 
materials 
subcomponent 
are 
to 
(i) 
stimulate 
reading 
habits 
of 
grades 
l-l 
1 
students 
and 
provide 
extra-curricular 
and 
co-curricular 
reading 
materials 
(including 
reference 
materials) 
to 
facilitate 
independent 
learning 
opportunities 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
school 
library 
reading 
materials; 
and 
(ii) 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
development 
of 
textbook 
policy 
and 
concept. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Program 
would 
finance 
(i) 
the 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
in 
Azeri 
Latin 
script, 
which 
are 
currently 
available 
in 
the 
market; 
(ii) 
extra-curricular 
and 
co-curricular 
reading 
materials 
which 
need 
to 
be 
converted 
from 
Cyrillic 
to 
Latin 
script; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
new 
reading 
and 
reference 
materials 
for 
school 
libraries. 
All 
general 
schools 
in 
the 
country 
will 
be 
provided 
a 
set 
of 
reading 
materials 
under 
the 
Project. 
The 
second 
objective 
of 
the 
subcomponent 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
development 
of 
textbook 
policy 
and 
concept. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
this 
subcomponent 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
sustainable 
private 
publishing 
industry 
to 
support 
the 
ongoing 
reforms 
and 
dissemination 
of 
knowledge 
to 
the 
whole 
country. 
In 
this 
regard, 
progress 
has 
already 
been 
made 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL 
through 
training 
seminars 
for 
authors, 
publishers, 
and 
printers. 
Additional 
support 
was 
also 
provided 
by 
OSI-Azerbaijan. 
The 
MOE 
established 
a 
Textbook 
Approval 
Board, 
with 
its 
own 
set 
of 
procedures 
for 
the 
evaluation, 
selection, 
approval, 
and 
procurement 
of 
textbooks. 
But 
affordable 
textbooks 
and 
other 
learning 
materials 
of 
good 
quality 
are 
in 
short 
supply 
and 
the 
state 
(central) 
publishing 
and 
distribution 
systems 
have 
essentially 
ceased 
to 
function. 
The 
Project 
will 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
development 
of 
an 
efficient 
and 
effective 
system 
of 
publishing, 
printing, 
and 
distribution 
of 
reading 
materials 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training. 
Resources 
will 
be 
allocated 
to: 
(i) 
improve 
the 
content 
and 
standards 
of 
textbooks 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Textbook 
Department 
and 
the 
Textbook 
Approval 
Board 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
mandates. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
OSI-Azerbaijan 
would 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Project 
in 
the 
area 
of 
textbook 
policy. 
The 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
that 
reflect 
reforms 
in 
national 
standards, 
curriculum, 
and 
teaching 
methods 
is 
essential 
for 
effective 
learning 
in 
the 
classrooms. 
The 
proposed 
Program, 
which 
is 
closely 
linked 
to 
the 
Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy, 
will 
ensure 
that 
all 
students 
in 
general 
education 
(grades 
l-l 
1) 
have 
access 
to 
quality 
textbooks 
and 
reading 
materials 
supportive 
of 
the 
new 
curricula 
through 
institutional 
reform 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials. 
This 
will 
improve 
the 
learning 
outcome 
of 
the 
students 
and, 
consequently, 
contribute 
to 
their 
empowerment. 
However, 
during 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
Government 
would 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
core 
textbooks 
for 
grades 
l-f 
1 
students 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
its 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper. 
Because 
new 
curricula 
will 
not 
be 
available 
by 
2007, 
the 
Government 
would 
finance 
re-print 
of 
the 
existing 
textbooks.

Component 
2 
- 
Efficiency 
and 
Finance 
Reforms 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$S,86 
million) 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APC 
will 
support 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
education, 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts. 
During 
Phases 
2 
and 
3, 
the 
Program 
plans 
to 
extend 
budgeting 
and 
finance 
reforms 
to 
the 
remaining 
districts 
based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
First 
Phase. 
The 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement 
subcomponent 
will 
be 
closely 
interrelated 
with 
the 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
subcomponent 
and, 
therefore, 
there 
will 
have 
to 
be 
a 
clear 
mechanism 
for 
coordination 
between 
these 
two 
subcomponents, 
between 
local 
and 
central 
governments, 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
Subcomponent 
1: 
Financinp 
and 
Budgeting 
Reforms 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$O,45 
million). 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
institute 
reforms 
in 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
(e.g., 
new 
funding 
formula 
and 
resource 
allocation 
mechanism; 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
system 
of 
school 
accountability) 
so 
as 
to 
gain 
efficiencies 
in 
the 
use 
of 
financial, 
human, 
and 
physical 
resources 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
One 
part 
of 
the 
reform 
effort 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
new 
budgeting 
and 
financial 
management 
system, 
which 
will 
focus 
on 
attention 
and 
resources 
on 
achieving 
key 
education 
outcomes, 
to 
replace 
the 
current 
norm-based 
budgeting 
system. 
Under 
the 
new 
system, 
responsibility 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
funds 
to 
specific 
items 
of 
expenditures 
will 
be 
delegated 
to 
district 
administrations 
and 
eventually 
to 
local 
schools. 
During 
Phase 
1, 
development 
work 
and 
field 
testing 
will 
be 
accomplished 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts. 
A 
second 
area 
of 
focus 
for 
the 
financing 
reforms 
will 
be 
personnel 
and 
personnel 
compensation 
policies. 
This 
will 
include 
attention 
to 
possible 
reforms 
for 
retirement, 
policies 
related 
to 
full-time 
equivalent 
teaching 
loads 
and 
multi-grade 
teaching, 
a 
phased 
approach 
to 
increasing 
teacher 
loads 
and 
merit-based 
approaches 
to 
selection, 
retention, 
and 
promotion 
of 
personnel. 
The 
main 
activities 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
Project 
include 
technical 
assistance, 
training 
and 
study 
visits 
for 
key 
policy 
makers 
(including 
MOF 
and 
MOE 
staff 
and 
district 
education 
officials), 
hardware 
and 
software, 
and 
office 
equipment 
and 
materials 
for 
the 
three 
selected 
districts. 
Subcomponent 
2: 
Rationalization 
and 
School 
Improvement 
(Total 
Cost: 
U’S$8.42 
million). 
This 
subcomponent 
addresses 
the 
following 
key 
sectoral 
issues: 
(i) 
an 
inefficient 
schools 
network, 
especially 
in 
rural 
districts; 
(ii) 
outdated 
human 
resources 
policies 
and 
practices 
including 
inappropriate 
distribution 
and 
utilization 
of 
teachers; 
(iii) 
considerable 
deterioration 
and 
inadequacy 
of 
existing 
school 
buildings, 
school 
furniture, 
equipment 
and 
teaching 
aids 
in 
the 
schools; 
and 
(iv) 
ineffective 
design 
and 
educational 
standards 
for 
constructing 
and 
rehabilitating 
school 
facilities. 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
experiment 
an 
approach 
in 
three 
Rayons 
(districts) 
(namely, 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ismayilli, 
and 
Ujar) 
to: 
(a) 
develop 
plans 
and 
rationalize 
the 
schools 
network 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
efficiencies 
in 
school 
management 
and 
operations; 
(b) 
develop 
appropriate 
and 
cost-effective 
standards 
for 
school 
buildings; 
and 
(c) 
rehabilitate 
and 
provide 
furniture, 
basic 
equipment 
and 
teaching 
aids 
to 
selected 
schools. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
this 
experience 
will 
set 
the 
model 
for 
future 
school 
infrastructure 
programs. 
Each 
Rayon 
(district) 
will 
develop 
an 
overall 
network 
rationalization 
plan 
and, 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
MOE, 
adopt 
and 
implement 
this 
plan 
during 
an 
agreed 
period. 
Rationalization 
and 
improvement 
will 
proceed 
on 
three 
levels: 
policy/administrative, 
human 
resources, 
and 
physical 
infrastructure, 
as 
guided 
by 
needs 
assessments 
and 
social 
assessments 
that 
will 
be 
conducted 
in 
each 
district. 
The 
project 
will 
finance 
the 
development 
and 
preparation 
of 
rationalization 
plans 
supported 
by 
foreign 
expertise 
(8 
staff 
months) 
and 
local 
technical 
assistance 
(16 
staff 
months) 
of 
an 
economist, 
a 
social 
assessment 
specialist, 
and 
an 
education 
facilities 
planning 
specialist 
services 
as 
well 
as 
training. 
In 
view 
of 
funding 
limitations, 
the 
formula 
for 
allocating 
the 
available 
resources 
among 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
was 
agreed 
with 
the 
MOE 
at 
appraisal, 
using 
student 
enrolment, 
number 
of 
schools 
and 
size 
(square 
meters) 
of 
the 
existing 
school 
infrastructure 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
school 
rehabilitation 
funds, 
with 
the

respective 
ratios 
of 
30 
percent, 
20 
percent 
and 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
fund 
allocated 
for 
rehabilitation 
in 
the 
three 
Rayons. 
Based 
on 
these 
rationalization 
plans, 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
districts 
could 
be 
rehabilitated 
on 
a 
limited 
scale 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
program. 
Classroom 
furniture, 
basic 
teaching 
equipment 
and 
aids 
will 
be 
provided 
for 
each 
rehabilitated 
school. 
In 
addition, 
this 
subcomponent 
will 
support 
the 
MOE’s 
plans 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
school 
libraries, 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technologies 
in 
a 
selected 
number 
of 
schools 
as 
part 
of 
the 
school 
improvement 
plans 
to 
enhance 
education 
quality 
in 
the 
three 
districts. 
Resource 
limitations 
under 
Phase 
1 
make 
it 
unlikely 
that 
all 
the 
minimum 
norms 
(structure, 
safety, 
sanitation, 
electricity/heating/water, 
adequate 
teaching 
spaces, 
etc.) 
can 
be 
attended 
to. 
Thus, 
the 
MOE, 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Rayons 
and 
the 
State 
Construction 
and 
Architecture 
Commission 
(SCAC) 
should 
identify 
and 
agree 
on 
the 
criteria 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
schools 
to 
be 
rehabilitated 
and 
for 
specifying 
the 
scope 
of 
rehabilitation 
work 
in 
each 
school. 
Asbestos 
material 
(primarily 
roofing 
sheets) 
are 
found 
in 
almost 
all 
existing 
buildings 
and 
pose 
serious 
hazards 
to 
the 
building 
occupants 
and 
to 
the 
environment. 
The 
MOE, 
the 
Rayon 
Authorities, 
and 
the 
SCAC 
would 
ensure 
that 
such 
asbestos 
materials 
are 
removed 
and 
disposed 
of 
safely, 
and 
under 
the 
appropriate 
oversight 
of 
Azerbaijan’s 
environmental 
authorities. 
MOE 
would 
likewise 
ensure 
that 
no 
new 
asbestos 
materials 
are 
used 
in 
the 
rehabilitation/construction 
of 
schools. 
This 
project 
subcomponent 
will 
also 
provide 
resources 
for 
updating/modernizing 
Azerbaijan’s 
national 
school 
building 
standards, 
such 
that 
these 
standards 
adequately 
meet 
and 
support 
Azerbaijan’s 
education 
reform 
objectives 
and 
policies. 
The 
updating 
of 
the 
school 
building 
standards 
would 
be 
conducted 
in 
close 
consultation 
and 
collaboration 
between 
the 
MOE, 
educators, 
teachers, 
facilities 
planners 
and 
other 
relevant 
entities, 
including 
the 
SCAC. 
The 
agreed 
standards 
would 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
appropriate 
authorities 
for 
approval 
and 
adoption 
nationwide. 
The 
approved 
standards 
would 
be 
used 
for 
designing 
and 
building 
prototype 
schools 
during 
Phase 
2 
of 
the 
Program. 
Component

- 
Upgrading 
Schooling 
Quality 
in 
Less 
Advantaged 
Rayons: 
School 
Grant 
Program 
(Total 
Cost: 
W80.87 
million) 
The 
proposed 
School 
Grant 
Program 
(SGP) 
aims 
to 
supplement 
the 
limited 
resources 
of 
specific 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
poor 
are 
not 
discriminated 
from 
benefiting 
from 
quality 
education. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
SGP 
is 
designed 
to 
provide 
supplemental 
financing 
to 
allow 
schools 
to 
improve 
attendance 
and 
enrollments 
of 
the 
poor, 
as 
well 
as 
iimprove 
teaching 
and 
learning 
in 
poor 
schools. 
The 
SGP 
will 
be 
awarded 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis 
based 
on 
proposals 
submitted 
by 
each 
school 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts. 
The 
proposals 
will 
be 
evaluated 
on 
the 
following 
criteria, 
namely: 
(i) 
poverty 
criteria 
and 
(ii) 
the 
proposed 
school-based 
program 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
learning 
in 
the 
school. 
Each 
proposal 
must 
be 
completely 
implemented 
in 
one 
year. 
Eligible 
expenditures 
should 
be 
targeted 
at 
improving 
the 
learning 
environment 
of 
the 
students 
and 
improving 
access 
of 
the 
poorest 
students 
to 
quality 
education 
without 
stigmatizing 
them. 
The 
school 
grant 
funds 
can 
be 
used 
to 
provide 
(i) 
additional 
training 
other 
than 
that 
provided 
by 
the 
regular 
teacher 
in-service 
training, 
including 
participation 
in 
seminars, 
workshops, 
conferences; 
(ii) 
additional 
learning 
and 
teaching 
materials 
for 
the 
classrooms 
and 
library 
that 
are 
not 
standard 
provisions; 
(iii) 
limited 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
physical 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
school 
to 
ensure 
a 
conducive 
learning 
environment, 
including 
furniture 
and 
fixtures 
for 
special 
innovative 
classes 
or 
courses; 
(iv) 
school 
supplies 
to 
students 
and 
classrooms 
for 
the 
innovative 
classes 
or 
course; 
and 
(v) 
transport 
resources 
to 
ensure 
access 
to 
schools 
among 
the 
poor. 
The 
Grant 
Committee, 
composed 
of 
senior 
officials 
of 
the 
MOE, 
IEP, 
education 
specialists 
from 
academia, 
and 
representatives 
from 
key 
stakeholders 
(e.g., 
Teacher 
Union), 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
the 
selection 
criteria, 
awarding 
of 
grants, 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
implementation 
to 
be

financed 
under 
the 
SGP. 
The 
diverse 
membership

can 
provide 
technical 
expertise 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
allow 
dissemination 
of 
the 
new 
knowledge 
learned 
from 
the 
various 
innovations 
in 
education. 
Furthermore, 
representatives 
from 
non-MOE 
institutions 
can 
improve 
the 
transparency 
of 
the 
selection 
process. 
The 
MOE’s 
Department 
of 
General 
Education 
will 
function 
as 
the 
secretariat 
of 
the 
selection 
committee 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
the 
implementation 
of

SGP. 
Component 
4 
- 
Management, 
Planning 
and 
Monitoring 
Capacity 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$2.34 
million) 
This 
component 
would 
focus 
on 
strengthening 
the 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE 
to 
use 
available 
resources 
more 
effectively 
and 
efficiently. 
While 
the 
proposed 
Project 
does 
not 
attempt 
to 
undertake 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
of 
education 
management, 
it 
will 
build 
capacity 
at 
the 
central 
and 
local 
levels 
to 
gradually 
implement 
changes. 
Under 
Phase 
1, 
the 
proposed 
Program 
would 
finance: 
(i) 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
student 
assessment 
system; 
(ii) 
the 
design 
and 
establishment 
of 
an 
effective 
education 
management 
information 
system 
(EMIS) 
at 
the 
MOE 
and 
selected 
districts; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
development 
of 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE 
and 
pilot 
districts. 
This 
will 
be 
done 
through 
several 
interventions 
through 
the 
following 
subcomponents: 
Subcomponent 
I: 
Establishment 
of 
a 
new 
System 
of 
Student 
Assessment 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$.I.lZ 
The 
Program 
will

the 
establishment 
of 
a 
new 
system 
of 
student 
assessment 
in 
general 
million). 
education, 
which 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
in 
developing 
a 
reliable, 
diagnostic 
and 
informative 
assessment 
system 
of 
student 
progress 
during 
their 
years 
of 
schooling. 
Under 
Phase 
1, 
the 
National 
Center 
for 
Student 
Assessment 
(NCSA) 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
MOE 
to 
carry 
out 
both 
a 
school-based 
assessment 
and 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
sample-based 
student 
assessment. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
school-based 
assessment, 
the 
emphasis 
will 
be 
on 
the 
development 
of 
teachers’ 
guides 
for 
classroom 
assessment 
in 
various 
general 
education 
subjects. 
Recommendations 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
for 
teacher 
in-service 
training. 
This 
will 
be 
a 
follow 
on 
to 
the 
work 
begun 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL. 
Sample-based 
student 
assessment 
will 
concentrate 
on 
grades 
4 
and 
9, 
with 
assessment 
in 
two 
subjects 
(e.g., 
mathematics, 
Azeri 
language). 
During 
Phase 
1, 
the 
Project 
will 
support 
the 
NCSA 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
training, 
goods 
and 
works 
to 
carry 
out 
both 
school-based 
and 
national 
sample 
based 
assessments. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
would 
assist 
the 
NCSA 
to 
monitor 
and 
analyze 
the 
achievements 
of 
national 
standards 
through 
participation 
in 
international 
comparative 
studies 
of 
student 
achievement 
such 
as 
OECD-PISA. 
Subcomponent 
2: 
Establishment 
of 
Education 
Management 
Information 
&stem 
(EMIS) 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$O.70 
million). 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
this 
subcomponent 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
establish 
a 
comprehensive 
education 
management 
information 
system 
in 
order 
for 
managers 
to 
monitor 
the 
system 
for 
which 
they 
are 
responsible, 
and 
develop 
policy 
and 
action 
plans 
based 
on 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information. 
Although 
the 
Program 
will 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
EMIS 
in 
the 
MOE 
that 
will 
be 
linked 
with 
the 
district 
education 
offices, 
Phase 
1 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
design, 
test, 
and 
install 
and 
operate 
an 
EMIS 
in 
the 
MOE, 
the 
pilot 
districts 
and 
institutions 
integral 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
education 
reforms 
(e.g., 
IEP). 
To 
support 
this 
work, 
the 
MOE 
would 
establish, 
staff 
and 
resource 
a 
unit 
for 
management 
and 
administration 
of 
the 
EMIS. 
Within 
the 
time 
and 
resources 
of 
Phase 
1, 
and 
given 
due 
consideration 
for 
issues 
associated 
with 
establishment 
of 
the 
unit 
and 
training 
of 
staff, 
only 
three 
(3) 
priority 
sub-systems 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
installed 
under 
Phase 
1. 
The 
subcomponent 
will 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
training, 
goods 
(hardware 
and 
sofmare) 
to 
design, 
test, 
and 
operate 
an 
EMIS 
in 
the 
MOE, 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts, 
and 
institutions 
integral 
to 
the 
implementation.

Subcomponent 
3: 
Munagement 
and 
Planning 
Cupa& 
(Total 
Cost: 
US$OSl 
million). 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
this 
subcomponent 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE 
to 
manage 
and 
plan 
the 
delivery 
of 
education 
services 
more 
effectively 
and 
efficiently, 
and 
increase 
accountability 
to 
its 
key 
stakeholders. 
This 
subcomponent 
is 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
following 
key 
sector 
issues: 
(i) 
approaches 
that 
concentrate 
authority 
and 
responsibilities 
at 
the 
MOE 
and 
not 
in 
the 
districts 
or 
at 
the 
schools; 
(ii) 
systems 
that 
are 
inefficient 
and 
reactive 
rather 
than 
proactive; 
(iii) 
lack 
of 
personnel 
with 
adequate 
training 
and 
expertise 
in 
policy, 
planning 
and 
management; 
(iv) 
inadequate 
in-service 
training 
and 
professional 
development 
programs 
in 
policy, 
planning 
and 
management; 
and 
(v) 
lack 
of 
higher 
qualification 
programs 
in 
education 
policy, 
planning 
and 
management. 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
also 
compliment 
the 
work 
done 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
rayons 
to 
strengthen 
their 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms. 
Under 
this 
subcomponent, 
the 
following 
activities 
will 
be 
supported: 
(i) 
management 
review 
and 
performance 
audits 
of 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
IEP, 
with 
an 
emphasis 
on 
distribution 
of 
responsibilities; 
(ii) 
competency-based 
management 
training 
for 
a 
selected 
group 
of 
education 
managers 
at 
the 
MOE, 
district 
and 
school 
levels; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Policy 
Analysis 
and 
Planning 
Unit 
in 
the 
MOE. 
In 
addition, 
limited 
support 
will 
be 
provided 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Center 
for 
Applied 
Research 
(CAR) 
in 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems 
(to 
be 
established 
under 
the 
restructured 
IEP 
to 
accommodate 
applied 
education 
research). 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
training, 
and 
goods 
(hardware 
and 
software) 
for 
the 
Planning

the 
project. 
Assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
strengthen 
a 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
under 
the 
Office 
of 
the

will 
be 
responsible 
for, 
inter 
alia, 
coordination 
of 
project-related 
implementation 
activities 
of 
the 
MOE 
institutional 
units 
at 
the 
central 
and 
Rayon 
levels, 
implementation 
and 
management 
of 
the

indicators, 
and 
provide 
continuous 
feedback 
to 
the 
Program 
management 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Program. 
In 
addition,

Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The

population 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
proposed 
Program 
because 
of 
improved 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
through 
curriculum 
reform, 
teacher 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
and 
strenghtened 
planning, 
management 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
in 
the 
sector. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
target 
beneficiary 
population 
of 
the 
Program 
includes 
all 
children 
in 
primary 
and 
general 
secondary 
education, 
students 
and 
teaching 
staff 
in 
the 
existing 
teacher 
training 
institutes, 
and 
all 
those 
working 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
Students 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
Program 
because 
of: 
(i) 
improved 
curricula, 
which 
will 
be 
more 
relevant 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
market 
economy; 
(ii) 
enhancement 
in 
their 
learning 
through 
the 
availability 
of 
textbooks, 
reading 
materials 
and 
learning 
materials; 
(iii) 
improved 
teacher 
effectiveness 
as 
a 
result 
of 
training 
and 
improved 
learning 
conditions; 
and 
(iv) 
education 
management 
staff 
who 
are 
more 
skilled 
and 
effective 
in 
utilizing 
scarce 
resources 
and 
making 
decisions. 
Students 
and 
teaching 
staff 
in 
the 
existing 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
and 
all 
those 
working 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
will 
also 
benefit 
from 
the 
improved 
learning 
environment 
in 
both 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
and 
in 
the 
general 
education 
system. 
This 
currently 
represents 
about 
1.6 
million 
students 
in 
grades 
l-11. 
Indirect 
benefits 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
also 
accrue 
from 
improved 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
educational 
services 
as 
a 
result 
of 
strengthened 
capacity 
for 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring. 
Under 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program, 
about 
45,000 
students 
and 
5,000 
teachers 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
would 
also 
be 
the 
main 
beneficiary 
of 
the 
improved 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
through 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement 
efforts 
and

Long 
term 
benefits 
of 
the 
Program 
are 
derived 
from 
the 
projected 
improvement 
in 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
student 
learning 
as 
a 
result 
of 
better 
management 
and 
effective 
leadership, 
and 
implementation 
of 
quality 
programs 
in 
general 
education. 
All 
these

Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
The 
World 
Bank’s 
involvement 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
of 
Azerbaijan 
is 
relatively 
new. 
The 
proposed 
Program 
builds 
on 
the 
experiences 
and 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project-a 
US$5 
million 
Learning 
and 
Innovation 
Credit-that 
piloted 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
teacher 
in-service 
training 
in 
selected 
pilot 
institutions 
and 
schools 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
Credit 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Regional 
Vice 
President 
on 
May 
24, 
1999 
and 
became 
effective 
on 
September 
8, 
1999. 
The 
Credit 
is 
scheduled 
to 
close 
on 
September 
30, 
2003. 
Some 
of 
the 
proposed 
Program 
activities 
will 
be 
implemented 
both 
at 
the 
national 
and 
local 
levels 
(e.g., 
curriculum 
reform, 
pre-service 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
activities, 
textbook 
development 
and 
provision, 
management 
and 
policy 
development), 
while 
others 
will 
be 
targeted 
to 
selected 
districts 
(e.g., 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms, 
school 
improvement 
and 
rationalization 
program, 
school 
grant 
facility; 
and 
school 
improvement 
support).

The 
following 
section 
summarizes 
the 
reasons 
why

alternatives 
were 
rejected 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
approach 
adopted 
in 
the 
Program. 
0 
a 
Choice 
of 
Lending 
Instrument. 
Initially, 
a 
traditional 
Specific 
Investment 
Loan 
(SIL) 
was 
foreseen 
for 
this 
operation. 
However, 
based 
on 
the 
discussions 
with 
the 
Government 
on 
the 
pros 
and 
cons 
of 
the 
different 
lending 
instruments 
available, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Credit 
(APC) 
is 
more 
appropriate 
for 
this 
operation 
based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
ongoing 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL). 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
sectoral 
reforms 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
based 
on 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
of 
1999 
and 
the 
draft 
Ten-Year 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy. 
The 
Government 
has 
asked 
the 
World 
Bank 
for 
help 
in 
implementing 
this 
reform 
program. 
The 
Program 
includes 
many 
issues, 
some 
of 
which 
need 
to 
be 
prioritized 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
additional 
analytical 
work. 
Not 
all 
of 
the 
issues 
could 
be 
addressed 
under 
a 
single 
investment 
project. 
However, 
the 
longer-term 
perspective 
of 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Credit 
(APC) 
would 
provide 
the 
Government 
with 
support 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
system-wide 
reform, 
while 
providing 
the 
flexibility 
to 
adjust 
and 
refine 
interventions 
on 
an 
on-going 
basis. 
The 
APC 
would, 
therefore, 
support 
the 
Government’s 
Education 
Reform.

by 
the 
President 
in 
1999), 
the 
draft 
Ten-Year 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy 
for 
the 
period 
2003-2013 
(prepared 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
as 
part 
of 
project 
preparation 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
Education

Program), 
and 
the 
Government’s 
Letter 
of 
Sector 
Development 
Policy. 
In 
addition, 
an 
adjustment 
lending 
operation 
was 
rejected 
because 
a 
number 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
management 
development 
issues 
in 
the 
MOE’s 
reform 
agenda 
cannot 
be 
addressed 
easily 
through 
policy 
conditionality, 
but 
should 
be 
best 
tackled 
gradually 
through 
sectoral 
investment 
and 
capacity 
building 
such 
as 
a 
management 
and 
policy 
development 
component 
under 
the 
Program. 
Under 
a 
future 
Adjustment 
Credit 
operation 
(e.g., 
PRSC), 
a 
social 
sector 
focused 
adjustment 
credit 
could 
also 
address 
some 
policy 
issues 
(e.g., 
education 
finance 
reforms, 
organizational 
restructuring, 
and 
staff 
rationalization). 
00 
The 
Scope 
of 
Physical 
Infrastructure 
Investment. 
The 
Government 
and 
the 
team 
acknowledge 
the 
need 
for 
improvement 
in 
the 
schools’ 
physical 
conditions 
and 
expansion 
of 
classrooms, 
especially 
in 
large 
cities 
(e.g., 
Baku) 
where 
there 
has 
been 
an 
influx 
of 
population 
during 
the 
past 
decade. 
To 
address 
the 
need 
for 
improvement 
of 
physical 
conditions 
of 
selected 
schools 
and 
expansion 
of 
classrooms, 
the 
Government 
prepared 
a 
State 
School 
Infrastructure 
hnrovement 
Program 
(SSIIP). 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
school 
construction 
and 
rehabilitation 
will 
be 
around 
US$BO 
million 
under 
the 
SSIIP 
for 
the 
period 
of 
2003-2007. 
Given 
limited 
IDA 
resources 
and 
the 
need 
to 
prioritize 
specific 
interventions 
under 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program, 
the 
proposed 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
APC 
would 
support 
school 
improvement 
to 
improve 
the 
learning 
environment 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
school 
rationalization 
and 
improvement 
in 
the 
selected 
districts, 
but 
it 
would 
not 
support 
new 
school 
construction. 
However, 
it 
would 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
new 
school 
standards 
based 
on 
international 
experience 
through 
technical 
assistance.

The 
Scope 
of 
the 
Proposed 
Program. 
Although 
the 
Government 
has 
begun 
considering 
the 
introduction 
of 
reforms 
in 
early 
childhood, 
vocational 
and 
post-secondary 
education, 
it 
has 
been 
decided 
that 
these 
sub-sectors 
will 
not 
be 
addressed 
under 
the 
proposed 
Program. 
While 
the 
needs 
are 
pressing 
at 
all 
levels, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
proposed 
- 
33 
- 
Page  40
Program 
would 
focus 
on 
general 
education 
because 
of 
limited 
IDA 
resources 
and 
the 
need 
for 
critical 
reforms 
at 
the 
general 
education 
level, 
which 
are 
essential 
for 
successful 
reforms 
at 
the 
other 
levels. 
More 
importantly, 
the 
inclusion 
of 
these 
sub-sectors 
in 
the 
proposed 
Program 
would 
add 
complexity 
to 
the 
Program 
and 
the 
weak 
implementation 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE 
at 
various 
levels 
could 
jeopardize 
the 
reform 
process. 
Finally, 
the 
organizations 
and 
institutions 
tasked 
to 
implement 
the 
proposed 
reforms 
will 
have 
to 
be 
strengthened 
before 
a 
comprehensive 
sector-wide 
reform 
strategy 
can 
be 
successfully 
carried 
out. 
Cd) 
Regional 
Coverage. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program 
would 
support 
three 
experimental 
districts 
to 
carry 
out 
efficiency 
and 
financing 
reforms, 
which 
will 
also 
include 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement 
activities 
in 
these 
districts, 
accounting 
for 
a 
significant 
share 
of 
project 
costs. 
Although 
all 
districts 
have 
considerable 
needs, 
these 
three 
districts 
have 
been 
selected 
under 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program 
to 
design 
and 
implement 
a 
series 
of 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms 
so 
that 
they 
could 
be 
replicated 
in 
other 
districts 
in 
the 
Second 
and 
Third 
Phases 
of 
the 
Program 
based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
Phase 
1. 
These 
three 
districts 
all 
have 
lower 
average 
income 
than 
more 
affluent 
areas 
such 
as 
Baku. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
relatively 
poorer 
students 
will 
be 
served 
through 
the 
selection 
of 
these 
districts. 
However, 
the 
Program 
was 
also 
designed 
to 
support 
national 
activities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
curriculum 
development, 
teacher 
training, 
textbook 
provision, 
and 
management 
development.

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
The 
project 
builds 
upon 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL), 
which 
began 
in 
September 
1999. 
The 
Education 
LIL 
provides 
many 
lessons- 
some 
good 
and 
some 
bad-which 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
proposed 
Program. 
In 
addition, 
lessons 
learned 
from 
other 
countries 
implementing 
education 
reforms 
are 
taken 
into 
consideration 
in 
the 
present 
design.

Ownership

Continuity 
and 
commitment 
of 
senior 
Ministry 
and 
PIU 
staff 
during 
project 
life 
are 
key 
to 
project 
success. 
One 
lesson 
learned 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL) 
is 
the 
need 
for 
the 
Ministry 
to 
accept 
responsibility 
for 
the 
reform 
process 
and 
take 
ownership 
of 
the 
project

implementation. 
During 
the 
initial 
implementation 
period, 
the 
MOE 
mistakenly 
believed 
that 
the 
project 
was 
a 
World 
Bank 
project 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
a 
PIU. 
The 
lack 
of 
involvement 
of 
key 
implementing 
units 
in 
the 
initial 
design 
of 
the 
project 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
understanding 
of 
their 
responsibility 
for 
project 
implementation 
led 
to 
weak 
project 
implementation. 
Only 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
implementation 
did 
the 
MOE 
start 
to 
take 
ownership 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Under 
the 
proposed 
Project, 
there 
is 
still 
substantial 
risk 
about 
the 
ownership 
of 
key 
line 
units 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Project 
even 
though 
various 
measures 
(such 
as 
coaches/mentors 
and 
professional 
development 
opportunities) 
for 
the 
line 
Directors 
will 
be 
introduced. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
MOE, 
through 
its 
various 
departments 
and 
agencies, 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
implementing 
the 
individual 
components 
of 
the 
Project, 
while 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
PCU 
would 
be 
limited 
to 
procurement, 
disbursement, 
accounting 
and 
report 
mnctions 
as 
well 
as 
assisting 
the 
MOE 
in 
the 
overall 
managmeent, 
coordination 
and 
monitoring 
of 
project 
implementation 
activities. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
important 
to: 
(i) 
involve 
all 
the 
key 
implementing 
units 
and 
individuals 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
of 
project 
preparation 
to 
ensure 
commitment; 
(ii) 
carry 
out 
substantive 
sector 
dialogue, 
including 
ESW; 
(iii) 
organize 
frequent 
supervision 
missions 
during 
project 
implementation 
to 
identify 
implementation 
issues 
early; 
and 
(iv) 
prepare 
a 
detailed 
implementation 
plan 
prior 
to 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
project, 
so 
that 
all 
the 
key 
stakeholders 
are 
aware 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
project, 
specific 
activities 
and 
timetable. 
Reform 
affects 
all 
stakeholders 
and 
everyone 
must 
own 
the 
processes 
to 
ensure 
success. 
An 
important 
ingredient 
in 
a 
durable 
commitment 
to 
education 
reform 
is 
to 
allow 
participation 
of 
stakeholders 
in 
defining 
the 
proposed 
Program. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
Government’s 
priorities 
and 
other 
stakeholders’ 
interests 
are 
taken 
into 
the 
project 
design 
and 
they 
start 
to 
own 
the 
reform. 
The 
quality, 
impact 
and 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Project 
are 
considerably 
enhanced 
when 
project 
concept 
and 
objectives 
are 
based 
on 
Borrower 
priorities 
and 
stakeholder 
consensus, 
and 
the 
key 
implementing 
units 
are 
directly 
involved 
in 
all 
stages 
of 
project 
design 
and 
implementation. 
A 
particular 
strength 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL) 
was 
that 
it 
reflected 
the 
Borrower’s 
priorities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
teacher 
training. 
The 
Minister 
of 
Education 
and 
senior 
Ministry 
officials 
emphasized 
the 
teaching 
and 
learning 
process 
with 
particular 
focus 
on 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
curricula 
and 
teaching 
methods 
(i.e., 
interactive 
teaching 
methods) 
in 
pilot 
schools 
and 
pilot 
teacher 
training 
institutes. 
Under 
the 
Program, 
efforts 
to 
build 
dialogue 
and 
partnership 
in 
design 
and 
strategic 
choices 
for 
investment 
have 
been 
made 
through 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Government’s 
Ten-Year 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy 
and 
stakeholder 
workshops. 
The 
MOE 
also 
established 
a 
Working 
Group 
to 
prepare 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
Efforts 
to 
discuss 
and 
disseminate 
ideas 
to 
different 
stakeholders 
will 
continue 
during 
project 
implementation. 
00 
Simplicity 
in 
Project 
Design 
and 
Flexibility. 
Education 
reform 
is 
a 
complex 
process. 
Based 
on 
experiences 
and 
knowledge 
learned 
from 
the 
recent 
reforrns 
being 
carried 
out 
in 
England, 
Chile, 
Moldova, 
and 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
projects 
supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
need 
to 
be 
highly 
focused 
and 
limited 
during 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
reform. 
Functioning 
organizations 
and 
institutions 
must 
be 
upgraded 
and 
most 
important, 
their 
capacities 
strengthened 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
various 
processes 
to 
implement 
the 
reforms. 
With 
this 
in 
mind, 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
proposed 
Program 
has 
been 
limited 
and 
emphasis 
will 
be 
given 
to 
ensuring 
the 
organizations 
and 
institutions 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
will 
be 
able 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
mandate 
of 
reforming 
the 
system 
of 
general 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
The 
lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
Education 
LIL 
necessitated 
simplicity 
in 
the 
project 
design 
and 
focus. 
Given 
the 
weak 
implementation 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE, 
simplicity 
and 
clarity 
in 
design 
and 
flexibility 
in 
implementation 
is 
essential 
to 
ensure 
a 
successful 
project. 
Instead 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
systemic 
reform 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
education, 
the 
proposed 
Program 
will 
focus 
on 
general 
education 
and 
teacher 
education. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Project 
would 
expand 
the 
ongoing 
reforms 
in 
curriculum 
development 
to 
all 
grades 
and 
subjects 
and 
initiate 
reforms 
in 
teacher 
education 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
build 
and 
strengthen 
the 
key 
support 
units 
and/or 
functions 
(e.g., 
planning 
and 
policy 
analysis,

student 
assessment, 
education 
management 
information 
systems), 
and 
initiate 
highest 
priority 
investments 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education 
and 
design 
and 
introduce 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms 
in 
the 
three 
selected 
districts. 
The 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE 
and 
its 
associated 
units 
will 
be 
built 
slowly 
but 
consistently 
over 
time 
throughout 
the 
project 
implementation 
period. 
The 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE 
and 
local 
levels 
will 
be 
strengthened 
through 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
programs 
supported 
under 
the 
proposed 
Program. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
country’s 
education 
system 
will 
have 
the 
necessary 
foundation 
to 
implement 
the 
contemplated 
reforms 
in 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
system.

Building 
Project 
Management 
Capacity 
at 
the 
Earliest 
Time. 
Implementation 
of 
a 
World 
Bank-assisted 
project 
tends 
to 
be 
perceived 
as 
extremely 
complex 
because 
of 
the 
requirements 
and 
procedures 
to 
meet 
the 
Borrower’s 
fiduciary 
responsibilities. 
The 
Education 
LIL 
was 
the 
first 
Bank-assisted 
education 
project 
in 
the 
country. 
In 
the 
initial 
years, 
there 
was 
a 
high 
turnover 
of 
the 
PIU 
staff 
under 
the 
LIL 
that 
undermined 
the 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
project 
management 
capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
LIL 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. 
Project 
team 
leadership 
and 
procurement 
were 
major 
areas 
of 
concerns 
caused 
by 
the 
inexperience 
of 
the 
Borrower 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
as 
an 
institution. 
Despite 
this 
high 
turnover 
rate, 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL 
reaffirms 
the 
need 
to 
pay 
particular 
attention 
to 
issues 
of 
governance 
and 
the 
need 
to 
invest 
in 
training 
both 
PIU 
and 
MOE 
staff 
in 
Bank 
procedures. 
Additional 
training 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
project 
management 
and 
procurement 
to 
strengthen 
further 
the 
implementation 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE. 
One 
project 
management 
lesson 
learned 
under 
the 
LIL 
is 
to 
have 
an 
experienced 
internationally 
recruited 
project 
implementation 
and 
procurement 
adviser 
who 
can 
directly 
assist 
the 
Project 
Implementation 
Unit. 
In 
addition, 
this 
adviser 
can 
impart 
modem 
project 
management 
skills 
to 
the 
PIU 
and 
MOE. 
A 
project 
implementation 
specialist 
and 
a 
procurement 
adviser 
will 
be 
employed 
for 
at 
least 
a 
year 
to 
assist 
the 
PCU 
and 
MOE 
implement 
the 
Program. 
Another 
critical 
project 
management 
area 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
addressed 
is 
the 
management 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
especially 
consultant 
services 
employed 
by 
the 
Project. 
The 
Borrower 
tends 
to 
perceive 
foreign 
experts 
to 
be 
relatively 
expensive 
and 
have 
little 
value 
added. 
This 
perception 
is 
caused 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
knowledge 
and 
experience 
in 
dealing 
with 
technical 
assistance. 
Based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
present 
Project, 
the 
MOE 
has 
already 
started 
to 
better 
utilize 
this 
valuable 
human 
resource. 
Additional 
training 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
the 
selection 
and 
supervision 
of 
consultants 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
knowledge 
brought 
by 
these 
foreign 
experts 
can 
be 
made 
useful 
and 
the 
country 
can 
build 
its 
knowledge 
capacity. 
(d) 
Institutional 
Arrangements 
in 
Implementing 
a 
Project. 
A 
lesson 
learned 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL 
showed 
that 
capacity 
building 
within 
the 
MOE 
is 
served 
best 
by 
trying 
to 
integrate 
the 
project 
management 
into 
the 
overall 
operations 
of 
the 
Ministry. 
There 
are 
risks 
in 
this 
arrangement 
that 
can 
possibly 
slow 
implementation, 
require 
more 
oversight 
and 
project 
management, 
but 
the 
pay-off 
in 
terms 
of 
ownership, 
impact 
and 
sustainability 
appears 
to 
be 
high. 
The 
weak 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE 
made 
it 
difficult 
to 
separate 
the 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
PIU 
established 
under 
the 
LIL, 
from 
those 
of 
the 
MOE 
and 
its 
associated 
units. 
There 
was 
a 
time 
when 
the 
PIU 
was 
perceived, 
rightly 
or 
wrongly, 
to 
be 
implementing 
the 
education 
reform 
program 
(i.e., 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
teacher 
education) 
because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
involvement 
of 
key 
implementing 
units 
(e.g., 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems, 
Pilot 
Teacher 
Training 
Institutes). 
In 
addition, 
the 
lack 
of 
clearly 
defined 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
and 
inadequate 
incentives 
have 
made 
it 
virtually 
impossible 
to 
internalize 
responsibility 
for 
project 
implementation 
of 
the 
various 
components 
within 
the 
MOE 
and 
its 
associated 
units.

Page  43
Under 
the 
proposed 
Program, 
the 
existing 
PIU 
staff 
will 
be 
incorporated 
into 
a 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
under 
the 
Deputy 
Minister 
of 
Education. 
The 
PCU’s 
principal 
functions 
will 
be 
to 
facilitate 
the 
flow 
of 
Credit 
and 
Project 
resources 
to 
the 
component 
implementing 
entities, 
conduct 
and 
manage 
the 
fiduciary 
aspects 
(procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
processes), 
and 
monitor 
and 
report 
on 
implementation 
progress. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
ECA 
recommended 
guidelines 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
PIUS. 
The 
MOE 
and 
its 
associated 
units 
(e.g., 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems, 
Teacher 
Training 
Institutes) 
will 
implement 
the 
proposed 
project 
activities, 
which 
are 
detailed 
in 
the 
draft 
detailed 
Project 
Implementation 
Plan. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
draft 
Project 
Implementation 
Plan 
would 
be 
revised 
and 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
prior 
to 
the 
Board 
date. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
education 
reforms 
and 
requested 
the 
Bank’s 
assistance 
to 
support 
the 
Government’s 
education 
reform 
efforts. 
In 
1998, 
the 
President 
issued 
a 
Decree 
to 
set 
up 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Commission, 
which 
prepared 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
in 
1999. 
The 
Decree 
also 
specifically 
referred 
to 
the 
World 
Bank 
as 
the 
Government’s 
leading 
partner 
in 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
educational 
reforms. 
Under 
the 
Education 
LIL, 
the 
MOE 
has 
been 
highly 
committed 
to 
the 
Project 
and 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
Project. 
The 
MOE 
has 
consistently 
made 
significant 
efforts 
to 
build 
capacity 
for 
project 
management 
and 
implementation, 
despite 
management 
and 
implementation 
issues 
during 
the 
early 
period 
of 
the 
Project. 
Poor 
performing 
project 
directors 
have 
been 
replaced 
and 
better-qualified 
procurement 
staff 
have 
been 
recruited 
by 
the 
MOE 
to 
ensure 
successful 
implementation. 
There 
have 
been 
no 
delays 
in 
counterpart 
funding. 
The 
Minister 
of 
Education 
and 
senior 
Ministry 
officials 
have 
shown 
a 
very 
strong 
commitment 
and 
support 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Sector 
Reform 
Program. 
Similarly, 
other 
key 
Government 
officials 
(e.g., 
the 
President’s 
Education 
and 
Economic 
Advisors, 
the 
Minister 
of 
Economic 
Development, 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Education 
Department 
in 
the 
Cabinet 
of 
Ministers, 
the 
Deputy 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
and 
the 
Chair 
of 
the 
Parliament’s 
Education 
Commission) 
have 
shown 
a 
high 
level 
of 
interest 
and 
support 
for 
the 
proposed 
Program. 
A 
Working 
Group, 
formed 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education 
in 
December 
200 
1, 
prepared 
the 
draft 
Ten-Year 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy 
as 
well 
as 
the 
draft 
Project 
Implementation 
Plan. 
The 
draft 
provides 
main 
directions 
for 
the 
reform 
and 
development 
of 
the 
education 
sector 
for 
the 
next 
ten 
years. 
The 
proposed 
Program 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
present 
draft. 
Furthermore, 
the 
design 
of 
the 
Program 
is 
based 
on 
the 
priorities 
identified 
by 
the 
Participatory 
Stakeholder 
Workshop, 
held 
February 
19-20, 
2002; 
and 
the 
Project 
LogFrame 
Workshop, 
held 
January 
13-14, 
2003, 
participated 
in 
by 
various 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
(draft) 
Project 
Implementation 
Plan 
has 
been 
prepared 
by 
the 
Working 
Group, 
supported 
by 
local 
and 
international 
consultants 
under 
the 
direct 
supervision 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education. 
The 
Plan 
has 
been 
discussed 
during 
the 
Project 
LogFrame 
Workshop, 
held 
January 
13.14,2003, 
participated 
in 
by 
key 
MOE 
officials 
and 
component 
coordinators. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
World 
Bank, 
which 
brings 
the 
experience 
of 
supporting 
education 
reforms 
in 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
will 
continue 
to 
have 
the 
main 
role 
for 
the 
education 
sector 
in 
Azerbaijan 
since 
no 
other 
donor 
is 
available 
to 
provide 
either 
the 
technical 
and 
financial 
resources 
to 
support 
sector-wide 
reforms. 
The 
Asian 
Development 
Bank 
(ADB) 
is 
the 
other 
main 
alternative 
donor 
who 
could 
assume 
such 
a 
role. 
ADB 
is 
not 
active 
to 
date 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
but 
the 
Early 
Childhood 
Development 
Project 
has 
been 
-

- 
Page  44
included 
in 
the 
Country 
Program 
as 
a 
2003 
project 
preparatory 
technical 
assistance 
(TA) 
and 
2005 
Loan. 
The 
other 
active 
multilateral 
donors 
are 
the 
Islamic 
Development 
Bank 
(IDB) 
and 
the 
European 
Union, 
but 
their 
activities 
have 
focused 
mainly 
on 
school 
construction 
and 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
of 
selected 
schools 
in 
selected 
districts 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Pilot 
Reconstruction 
Program. 
Several 
active 
bilateral 
donors 
(e.g., 
GTZ 
and 
Japanese 
Government) 
also 
provide 
support 
for 
the 
education 
sector 
mainly 
for 
school 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
in 
selected 
districts. 
Although 
the 
IDB 
plans 
to 
provide 
some 
support 
for 
school 
construction 
and 
rehabilitation 
in 
the 
Baku 
area, 
it 
was 
not 
clear 
when 
the 
project 
would 
be 
implemented. 
The 
others 
(UNICEF 
and 
OSI), 
who 
have 
serious 
budget 
constraints, 
limiting 
the 
scale 
of 
their 
operations, 
are 
not 
well 
suited 
under 
their 
mandates 
to 
a 
broad 
scale 
systemic 
involvement 
in 
the 
sector. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
the 
Bank 
also 
coordinated 
activities 
with 
the 
available 
few 
donors 
to 
support 
the 
education 
sector 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Bank 
coordinated 
with 
OS1 
and 
UNICEF 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
joint 
identification 
mission 
in 
February 
2002. 
Both 
OS1 
and 
UNICEF 
representatives 
participated 
in 
the 
Participatory 
Stakeholder 
Workshop, 
organized 
during 
the 
identification 
mission. 
The 
Program 
will 
also 
take 
advantage 
of 
more 
effective 
use 
of 
resources 
by 
having 
the 
different 
donors 
work 
in 
partnership 
(e.g., 
ADB) 
if 
they 
become 
active 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
discussions 
were 
held 
with 
other 
donors/partners 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
other 
donor 
activities, 
in 
particular, 
the 
work 
started 
by 
the 
OS1 
in 
textbook 
policies 
and 
teacher 
training 
programs 
(e.g., 
Reading 
Writing 
for 
Critical 
Thinking), 
and 
by 
UNICEF 
in 
pilot 
teacher 
education 
program 
and 
preschool 
education 
program; 
and 
the 
IDB 
in 
school 
construction 
and 
rehabilitation 
in 
the 
Baku 
area.

(specify) 
The 
rationale 
for 
public 
sector 
intervention 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
arises 
from 
three 
forms 
of 
market 
failure. 
First, 
education 
is 
a 
merit 
good. 
All 
young 
people 
must 
acquire 
basic 
skills 
in 
education 
in 
order 
to 
become 
productive 
workers 
and 
citizens 
as 
adults. 
Young 
children 
and 
their 
parents 
cannot 
be 
expected, 
in 
all 
cases, 
to 
chose 
the 
amount 
and 
quality 
of 
education 
that 
is 
best 
for 
the 
children. 
Therefore, 
the 
state 
has 
a 
responsibility 
for 
mandating 
that 
all 
citizens 
obtain 
a 
minimum 
level 
of 
education. 
Second, 
the 
credit 
market 
for 
education 
is 
incomplete. 
Investments 
in 
education 
cannot 
be 
collateralized 
because 
the 
person 
(the 
debtor) 
and 
the 
education 
cannot 
be 
separated 
from 
one 
another. 
Therefore, 
lenders 
cannot 
ensure 
the 
recovery 
of 
loans. 
State 
intervention 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
education 
is 
the 
most 
efficient 
mechanism 
for 
making 
certain 
that 
sufficient 
amounts 
are 
invested. 
Third, 
the 
benefits 
from 
education 
accrue 
to 
the 
community 
as 
well 
as 
the 
individual 
student. 
If 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
to 
education 
were 
determined 
by 
rational 
individual 
choice, 
these 
external 
benefits 
would 
not 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
defining 
the 
optimal 
level 
and 
allocation 
of 
investments 
in 
the 
sector. 
Under-spending 
on 
education 
would 
occur 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
governments. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
Program 
is 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
education 
reform 
program 
by 
further 
elaborating 
and 
testing 
alternative 
reform 
initiatives. 
The 
components 
included 
in 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program 
were 
selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
their 
perceived 
importance 
to 
the 
larger 
objective 
of 
ensuring 
that 
Azeri 
children 
are 
provided 
with 
an 
education 
that 
equips 
them 
to 
contribute 
effectively 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
economy, 
to 
participate 
fully 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
political 
system 
and 
to 
live 
as 
full 
and 
responsible 
human 
beings. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
Program 
has 
been 
organized 
around 
four 
major 
objectives: 
(a) 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education; 
(b) 
increasing 
the

efficiency 
of 
the 
education 
process; 
(c) 
increasing 
equity 
in 
access 
to 
general 
education; 
and 
(d) 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
public 
sector 
institutions 
to 
formulate 
education 
policy 
and 
to 
manage 
the 
provision 
of 
education 
services. 
The 
Program 
will 
finance 
five 
components 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program: 
The 
first 
component 
of 
this 
Program 
seeks 
to 
increase 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
It 
confronts 
the 
need 
to 
(a) 
reform 
the 
contents, 
sequencing 
and 
pacing 
of 
curricular 
contents; 
(b) 
modify 
instructional 
methods 
in 
order 
to 
more 
effectively 
develop 
cognitive 
skills; 
and 
(c) 
supply 
reading 
materials 
for 
school 
libraries 
that 
stimulate 
reading 
habits 
and 
encourage 
independent 
study 
opportunities. 
This 
component 
responds 
to 
the 
need 
for 
government 
to 
anticipate 
the 
skills 
required 
for 
citizens 
to 
function 
adequately 
in 
the 
economic, 
political 
and 
social 
life 
of 
the 
country. 
The 
budget 
for 
reform 
of 
the 
curriculum 
is 
approximately 
US$1.21 
million. 
If 
the 
products 
of 
the 
reforms 
were 
to 
remain 
in 
place 
for 
only 
a 
decade, 
they 
would 
cost 
less 
than 
US$O.O7 
per 
student 
year 
of 
education. 
The 
incremental 
benefits 
of 
reforms 
that 
ensure 
the 
development 
of 
higher 
order 
cognitive 
skills 
and 
the 
mastery 
of 
a 
more 
relevant 
body 
of 
knowledge 
are 
clearly 
many 
times 
more 
valuable. 
The 
first 
component 
of 
the 
Program 
also 
supports 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
and 
initial 
reforms 
in 
pre-service 
teacher 
education. 
These 
training 
activities 
aim 
at 
ensuring 
that 
teachers 
have 
mastered 
a 
body 
of 
related 
curriculum 
content 
that 
will 
ensure 
that 
they 
can 
be 
employed 
fully, 
even 
by 
small 
schools; 
have 
acquired 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
teaching 
strategies 
and 
methods, 
and 
have 
developed 
skills 
in 
adapting 
content 
and 
methods 
to 
the 
learning 
needs 
of 
particular 
students. 
The 
Program 
will 
support 
the 
Government 
in 
devising 
and 
implementing 
a 
strategy 
for 
improving 
the 
training 
of 
teachers. 
It 
will 
also 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
training 
materials 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
quality 
assurance 
program 
for 
teacher 
education. 
This 
subcomponent 
is 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US$2.57 
million. 
The 
subcomponent 
would 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
use 
teachers 
more 
intensively 
by 
preparing 
them 
for 
effective 
multi-subject 
teaching 
or 
teaching 
of 
a 
second 
or 
third 
subject. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
subcomponent 
would 
be 
recovered 
in 
ten 
years 
if 
it 
were 
to 
lead 
to 
a 
2.5 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
number 
of 
teachers 
employed. 
Analyses 
of 
detailed 
data 
for 
Ismayilli 
district 
suggest 
that 
fully 
implementing 
multi-subject 
teaching 
and 
training 
teachers 
in 
two 
or 
more 
subjects 
would 
bring 
down 
the 
number 
of 
teachers 
required 
by 
more 
than 
300 
persons 
or 
about 
17 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
teachers 
employed. 
A 
third 
subcomponent 
of 
the 
quality 
improvement 
component 
would 
provide 
US$3.27 
million 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
basic 
reading 
materials 
in 
Latin 
Script 
Azeri 
Language 
for 
all 
school 
libraries 
to 
stimulate 
reading 
habits, 
support 
independent 
learning 
opportunities, 
and 
support 
extra- 
and 
co-curricular 
programs. 
The 
second 
component 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
intended 
to 
improve 
the 
financing 
and 
management 
of 
schools. 
The 
first 
subcomponent 
will 
introduce 
a 
budgeting 
system 
in 
which 
funds 
are 
provided 
to 
schools 
based 
on 
the 
number 
of 
students 
enrolled 
in 
each 
school. 
Additional 
funds 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
the 
district 
education 
departments 
to 
finance 
system-wide 
functions, 
including 
policy 
analysis, 
research 
and 
administration. 
The 
new 
budgeting 
system 
will 
permit 
school-level 
management 
of 
resources 
by 
allowing 
schools 
to 
allocate 
funds 
to 
priority 
expenditures 
and 
to 
carry 
over 
funds 
from 
one 
year 
to 
the 
next. 
The 
implementation 
of 
school 
level 
management 
of 
resources 
will 
be 
accompanied 
by 
the 
development 
of 
improved 
accountability 
for 
both 
funds 
and 
school 
performance. 
These 
activities 
will 
ensure 
both 
more 
effective 
management 
of 
resources 
devoted 
to 
recurrent 
expenditures 
and 
greater 
responsiveness 
to 
local 
needs 
and 
preferences. 
The 
cost 
of 
implementing 
these 
reforms 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
US$O.45 
million 
or 
approximately 
US$3,100 
per 
school. 
These 
costs 
include 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
systems 
of 
accounting 
and 
performance 
management 
and 
training 
in 
their 
use. 
The 
second 
subcomponent 
of 
the 
Efficiency 
and 
Finance 
Component 
will 
address 
inefficiencies 
rooted 
in 
past 
capital 
expenditures. 
It 
will 
provide 
funds 
for 
the 
consolidation 
and 
renovation 
of 
schools 
and 
the 
rationalization 
of 
staffing. 
These 
funds 
will 
be 
allocated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
economic 
criteria: 
investments 
should 
reduce 
the 
present 
value 
of 
the 
total 
costs 
-

Page  46
of 
providing 
education 
to 
a 
group 
of 
students 
over 
a 
planning 
horizon 
of 
15 
years. 
In 
order 
to 
minimize 
the 
cost 
of 
technical 
studies, 
a 
three-stage 
procedure 
has 
been 
devised 
in 
which 
school 
directors 
will 
submit 
formatted 
reports 
on 
the 
condition, 
adequacy 
and 
prospective 
enrollment 
for 
each 
school. 
These 
data 
will 
be 
used 
to 
identify 
schools 
for 
detailed 
assessment 
by 
engineers, 
architects 
and 
planners. 
Detailed 
plans 
for 
the 
repair, 
renovation 
and 
expansion 
of 
schools 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
schools 
that 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
most 
promising 
candidates 
for 
funding. 
This 
approach 
will 
ensure 
transparency 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
allocation 
of 
investment 
resources. 
The 
estimated 
cost 
of 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement 
activities 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
around 
US$S.42 
million. 
The 
third 
component 
will 
improve 
access 
to 
education 
among 
the 
economically 
disadvantaged 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
school 
grants 
to 
schools, 
especially 
for 
poor 
students 
for 
whom 
the 
private 
costs 
of 
school 
attendance 
are 
unaffordable. 
The 
Program 
will 
finance 
school 
grants 
in 
three 
districts 
to 
upgrade 
schooling 
quality 
based 
on 
school-based 
projects 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts, 
and 
will 
monitor 
their 
costs 
and 
effects 
to 
allow 
the 
refinement 
of 
criteria 
for 
the 
distribution 
and 
administration 
of 
grants. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
school 
grant 
program 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
around 
US$O.87 
million. 
The 
fourth 
component 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
support 
improvements 
in 
the 
governance 
and 
management 
of 
the 
sector. 
It 
will 
finance 
(a) 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
Education 
Management 
Information 
System; 
(b) 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
student 
assessment 
and 
evaluation 
program; 
(c) 
the 
development 
of 
capacity 
in 
policy 
analysis 
and 
management 
in 
the 
national 
and 
regional 
government 
institutions. 
These 
three 
activities 
are 
expected 
to 
cost 
about 
US$2.33 
million. 
They 
will 
facilitate 
the 
introduction 
of 
modern 
methods 
of 
policy 
analysis 
and 
program 
management 
into 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
fifth 
component 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
support 
the 
management 
of 
the 
Program, 
including 
procurement, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
and 
financial 
management. 
The 
component 
is 
expected 
to 
cost 
US$ 
1.87 
million. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The 
activities 
being 
financed 
under 
this 
Program 
are 
intended 
to 
bring 
the 
commitment 
of 
resources 
to 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan 
in 
line 
with 
international 
best 
practice, 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
learning. 
The 
transition 
to 
a 
more 
efficient 
expenditure 
path 
will 
require 
investments 
in 
the 
design 
of 
activities, 
the 
training 
of 
staff 
and 
the 
production 
of 
materials. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
Credit 
is 
to 
finance 
these 
expenditures. 
The 
criteria 
being 
used 
to 
design 
interventions 
and 
to 
select 
investments 
ensure 
that 
the 
expenditures 
reduce 
the 
present 
value 
of 
future 
costs. 
The 
projected 
growth 
of 
the 
Azeri 
economy 
and 
of 
public 
revenues 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
substantial 
increases 
in 
the 
absolute 
level 
of 
spending 
for 
education. 
The 
increase 
in 
national 
output 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
accompanied 
by 
corresponding 
increases 
in 
wages 
and 
salaries. 
Because 
teachers’ 
salaries 
have 
been 
severely 
compressed 
during 
the 
post-Soviet 
period, 
they 
are 
expected 
to 
rise 
more 
rapidly 
than 
the 
general 
wage 
level. 
However, 
prudent 
financial 
management 
dictates 
that 
the 
allocation 
of 
real 
resources 
to 
education 
should 
not 
be 
expected 
to 
increase 
as 
rapidly 
as 
national 
output. 
The 
phasing 
of 
this 
Program 
allows 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
to 
adjust 
its 
spending 
plans 
to 
emerging 
economic 
realities. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
Although 
Azerbaijan’s 
public 
spending 
on 
education 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
OECD 
average 
(in 
terms 
of 
the 
share 
of 
GDP), 
this 
Program 
is 
designed 
to 
increase 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures 
on 
education 
and 
not 
to 
increase 
real 
resource 
use 
by 
the 
sector. 
It 
facilitates 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
more 
effective 
and 
efficient 
methods 
of 
instruction, 
raises 
educational 
standards, 
particularly 
for 
skills, 
and 
improves 
the 
allocation 
of 
inputs 
within 
schools.

The 
projected 
double-digit 
growth 
of 
the 
economy 
over 
the 
next 
twenty 
years 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
corresponding 
increases 
in 
expenditures 
for 
education. 
However, 
as 
noted 
earlier, 
most 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
education 
budget 
will 
have 
to 
be 
allocated 
to 
salaries 
and 
wages 
in 
order 
to 
restore 
the 
incomes 
of 
staff 
to 
competitive 
levels. 
The 
increase 
in 
funding 
will 
also 
permit 
modest 
improvements 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
teaching 
materials 
and 
more 
responsible 
maintenance 
of 
buildings, 
equipment 
and 
furniture. 
The 
Program 
does 
not 
expect 
to 
generate 
additional 
expenditures 
because 
the 
investment 
will 
be 
targeted 
at 
the 
general 
education 
level 
only. 
Fiscal 
sustainability 
arises 
as 
an 
issue 
for 
only 
two 
components: 
(i) 
Quality 
and 
Relevance 
of 
General 
Education; 
and 
(ii) 
Management, 
Planning, 
and 
Monitoring 
Capacity. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
ERP 
will 
finance 
the 
development, 
print 
and 
distribution 
of 
reading 
materials 
(including 
reference 
materials) 
to 
support 
the 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
for 
all 
school 
libraries. 
The 
main 
purposes 
of 
this 
subcomponent 
are 
to 
stimulate 
reading 
habits, 
encourage 
independent 
thinking 
and 
research 
skills, 
and 
provide 
support 
for 
extra-curricular 
and 
co-curricular 
subjects 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials. 
The 
Government 
will 
continue 
its 
current 
textbook 
policy 
of 
free 
of 
charge 
books 
to 
students 
in 
grades 
l-4, 
and 
plans 
to 
extend 
this 
policy 
to 
students 
through 
grade 
11, 
during 
the 
period 
of 
2003-2005. 
The 
estimated 
costs 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
for 
all 
students 
will 
be 
about 
US$20 
million, 
which 
will 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
Government. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
ERP 
will 
support 
the 
Government’s 
efforts 
for 
the 
development 
of 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
at 
the 
central 
and 
local 
levels. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
ERP 
would 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
several 
new 
units 
(i.e., 
Policy 
Analysis 
Unit 
and 
Planning 
(PAPU), 
the 
National 
Center 
for 
Student 
Assessment 
(NCSA), 
and 
Education 
Management 
Information 
Systems 
Unit 
(EMISU) 
or 
the 
employment 
of 
a 
group 
of 
technical 
staff 
for 
the 
newly 
established 
units. 
The 
incremental 
recurrent 
costs 
of 
fully 
functioning 
PAPU, 
NCSA, 
EMISU 
are 
estimated 
to 
average 
about 
US$200,000 
per 
year 
(or 
less 
than 
0.1 
percent 
of 
the 
recurrent 
expenditures 
of 
the 
MOE 
in 
2002). 
This 
figure 
includes 
staff, 
maintenance, 
and 
administration 
for 
all 
national 
assessment 
in 
grades 
4 
and 
9. 
The 
PAPU, 
NCSA 
and 
EMISU 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
fully 
functioning 
after 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
ERP. 
The 
Department 
of 
Curriculum 
Development 
will 
also 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems, 
which 
will 
be 
re-organized 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
management 
review 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
ERP. 
The 
financing 
of 
this 
new 
unit 
will 
not 
increase 
recurrent 
expenditures 
since 
new 
staff 
positions 
will 
not 
be 
required. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
there 
will 
be 
further 
cost 
savings 
through 
the 
reduction 
in 
the 
total 
number 
of 
IEP 
staff 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
organizational 
review 
and 
performance 
audit 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
Phase 
1. 
The 
efficiency 
and 
financing 
component 
has 
two 
main 
subcomponents. 
The 
first 
is 
to 
increase 
efficiency 
and 
accountability 
in 
resource 
allocation 
and 
use 
at 
local 
levels 
through 
reforrns 
in 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
mechanisms. 
The 
objectives 
of 
the 
second 
subcomponent 
are 
to 
(i) 
rationalize 
both 
physical 
facilities 
and 
teaching 
staff 
where 
it 
is 
feasible; 
and 
(ii) 
improve 
conditions 
of 
a 
selected 
number 
of 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
through 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
based 
on 
a 
district 
rationalization 
plan. 
The 
net 
fiscal 
effects 
of 
rationalization 
and 
are 
not 
yet 
clear, 
but 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
some 
cost 
savings 
will 
be 
achieved 
in 
the 
long 
run. 
In 
particular, 
school 
improvement 
and 
refurbishment 
will 
reduce 
the 
accumulated 
deferred 
deficit 
as 
well 
as 
maintenance 
costs 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
schools. 
The 
fiscal 
implications 
of 
the 
proposed 
investment 
and 
the 
recurrent 
expenditures 
will 
be 
closely 
scrutinized 
to 
ensure 
sustainability 
of 
the 
proposed

3. 
Technical: 
The 
Efficiency 
and 
Finance 
Reforms 
Component. 
In 
terms 
of 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms, 
there 
have 
been 
considerable 
discussions 
between 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
MOF, 
with 
assistance 
of 
an 
international 
education 
economist 
financed 
under 
the 
PHRD 
Grant. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
project 
would 
support 
the 
design, 
implementation 
and 
evaluation 
of 
a 
new 
budgeting 
mechanism 
(with 
particular 
focus 
on 
a 
capitation-based 
formula) 
in 
the 
three 
districts, 
before 
extending 
the 
system 
geographically. 
With 
respect 
to 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement, 
the 
Bank 
has 
limited 
experience 
with 
school 
rehabilitation 
in 
Azerbaijan 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL 
and 
the 
Pilot 
Reconstruction 
Project. 
The 
reforms 
associated 
with 
this 
component 
are 
generally 
within 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE 
and 
local 
education 
authorities. 
The 
Bank 
would 
support 
the 
preparation 
of 
standards 
for 
school 
buildings 
and 
furniture, 
which 
will 
promote 
not 
only 
some 
flexibility 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
design, 
construction, 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
school 
buildings, 
but 
also 
standards 
for 
education, 
safety, 
and 
health 
since 
most 
schools 
appear 
to 
lack 
such 
standards. 
The 
reforms 
associated 
with 
rationalization 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
based 
on 
the 
preparation 
of 
district 
rationalization 
plans 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project, 
assisted 
by 
both 
national 
and 
international 
consultants. 
With 
respect 
to 
rationalization, 
available 
data 
indicate 
that 
Azerbaijan 
has 
one 
of 
the 
lowest 
student-teacher 
ratios 
in 
the 
world 
(10.1 
to 
1) 
in 
general 
education, 
covering 
primary 
and 
secondary 
general 
education. 
For 
example, 
if 
Azerbaijan 
were 
to 
achieve 
the 
average 
staffing 
ratio 
of 
the 
OECD 
countries 
(17.7 
to 
1 
for 
primary 
schools; 
15.0 
to 
1 
for 
lower 
secondary 
schools; 
and 
13.9 
for 
upper 
secondary 
schools) 
for 
each 
of 
the 
three 
levels 
of 
education, 
it 
would 
employ 
36 
percent 
fewer 
teachers. 
Yet 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
data 
in 
the 
Ismayilli 
district 
revealed 
that 
the 
exceptionally 
intensive 
staffing 
of 
general 
schools 
in 
Azerbaijan 
is 
not 
the 
result 
of 
overhiring 
teachers, 
but 
rather 
is 
the 
result 
of 
having 
large 
numbers 
of 
relatively 
small 
schools 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
teach 
a 
complex 
curriculum 
using 
teachers 
who 
have 
specialized 
training 
in 
the 
subject 
being 
taught. 
The 
existence 
of 
large 
numbers 
of 
very 
small 
schools 
reflects 
not 
only 
the 
dispersion 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
in 
villages 
but 
also 
the 
geography 
of 
rural 
Azerbaijan 
and 
the 
present 
level 
of 
development 
of 
roads 
and 
public 
transportation. 
Consolidating 
small 
rural 
schools 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
average 
class 
size 
and 
improve 
the 
utilization 
of 
teaching 
staff 
and 
teaching 
facilities 
is 
a 
practical 
option 
for 
only 
a 
small 
number 
of 
schools. 
The 
high 
cost 
of 
student 
transportation 
renders 
consolidation 
uneconomic 
for 
most 
rural 
schools. 
There 
are 
also 
a 
number 
of 
very 
large 
schools 
which 
are 
maintained 
in 
full 
operation, 
notwithstanding 
very 
low 
actual 
enrolments. 
In 
addition, 
the 
poor 
state 
of 
roads 
in 
much 
of 
the 
countryside 
makes 
busing 
impractical 
in 
many 
rural 
areas 
during 
the 
winter 
months. 
Moreover, 
the 
relative 
costs 
of 
teachers 
and 
buses 
imply 
that 
more 
intensive 
employment 
of 
teachers 
will 
be 
less 
costly 
than 
busing 
students 
in 
many 
instances. 
Based 
on 
this 
review, 
the 
most 
promising 
option 
for 
improving 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
expenditures 
on 
education 
in 
rural 
areas 
would 
be 
to 
implement 
a 
serious 
program 
of 
multigrade 
teaching 
in 
which 
students 
of 
different 
grade 
levels 
would 
be 
taught 
the 
same 
subject 
content 
simultaneously. 
In 
this 
regard, 
Component 
1 
would 
attach 
importance 
to 
the 
development 
of 
appropriate 
curricula, 
pedagogical 
materials 
and 
teachers 
for 
small 
rural 
schools. 
Further 
technical 
analysis 
will 
guide 
the 
identification 
of 
possible 
alternatives 
for 
rationalization 
of 
teaching 
staff 
and 
education 
facilities 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
district 
rationalization 
plans. 
The 
Mimagement, 
Planning, 
and 
Monitoring 
Capacity 
Component. 
At 
present, 
the 
MOE 
has 
no 
technical 
capacity 
to 
carry 
out 
national 
student 
assessments 
even 
though 
a 
small 
assessment 
unit 
was 
established 
in 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems. 
Under 
Phase 
1, 
the 
strategy 
is 
to 
build 
some 
- 
42 
- 
Page  49
institutional 
capacity 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
National 
Center 
for 
Student 
Assessment, 
directly 
reporting 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
State 
Student 
Admission 
Commission 
can 
provide 
some 
technical 
support 
to 
the 
MOE 
to 
build 
assessment 
capacity 
in 
the 
Center 
to 
carry 
out 
national-sample 
based 
assessments 
in 
grades 
4 
and 
9 
during 
Phase 
1. 
At 
present, 
the 
MOE 
has 
no 
EMIS 
capacity 
at 
the 
national, 
local 
or 
school 
levels. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
EMIS 
subcomponent 
is 
appropriate 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
MOE. 
While 
the 
Borrower 
considered 
a 
nationwide 
EMIS 
under 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
APL, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
strategy 
would 
be 
to 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
some 
institutional 
and 
technical 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
pilot 
districts 
(i.e., 
Departments 
of 
Education), 
and 
then 
add 
new 
applications 
and 
extend 
the 
system 
gradually 
to 
other 
districts 
to 
establish 
an 
integrated 
EMIS 
in 
the 
Second 
and 
Third 
Phases. 
The 
investment 
costs 
are 
reasonable, 
and 
likely 
to 
decrease 
after 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
EMIS 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE. 
4. 
Institutional: 
A 
surnrnary 
of 
the 
results 
of 
the 
institutional 
assessment 
is 
provided 
in 
Annex 
14. 
The 
institutional 
assessment 
process 
provided 
several 
key 
results 
for 
the 
MOE, 
that 
have 
implications 
for 
the 
overall 
implementation 
of 
the 
Program, 
as 
follows: 
The 
Soviet-era 
education 
system 
in 
Azerbaijan 
was 
highly 
centralized 
and 
prohibited 
the 
establishment 
of 
schooling 
that 
was 
more 
attuned 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
Azerbaijan 
society; 
much 
of 
the 
centralized 
management 
and 
administration 
remains; 
While 
examples 
of 
various 
reform 
initiatives 
are 
evident 
(e.g., 
the 
use 
of 
representative 
school 
councils 
and 
the 
trial 
of 
school 
self-assessment), 
the 
overall 
structure 
of 
education 
management 
has 
not 
been 
subjected 
to 
reform 
and 
the 
several 
school-based 
reform 
initiatives 
are 
not 
systematic 
or 
broadly 
encompassing 
of 
reformed 
management 
functions. 
The 
current 
organizational 
structure 
of 
the 
MOE 
lacks 
some 
core 
units 
(e.g., 
Statistics, 
Information 
Technology, 
Planning 
and 
Policy 
Analysis, 
Human 
Resource 
Planning, 
Student 
Assessment) 
and 
resources 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
core 
functions 
more 
effectively 
and 
efficiently; 
and 
Most 
MOE 
staff 
have 
not 
been 
trained 
in 
education 
management, 
leadership, 
and 
planning 
techniques, 
and 
lack 
incentives 
due 
to 
low 
salaries 
and 
limited 
professional 
development 
opportunities. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
MOF 
is 
designated 
as 
the 
official 
representative 
of 
the 
Borrower. 
The 
MOE 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
Executive 
Agency 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
GOA. 
The 
MOE 
will 
implement 
project 
activities 
through 
its 
line 
units/departments. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
led 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education, 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
all 
strategic 
and 
policy 
related 
decisions. 
A 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
will 
provide 
support 
in 
areas 
of 
procurement, 
financial 
management, 
and 
project 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
The 
management 
responsibilities 
for 
each 
component 
and 
subcomponent 
will 
be 
assigned 
to 
MOE 
managers 
of 
the 
relevant 
department 
or 
unit 
within 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Procurement 
A4unagement. 
The 
existing 
Project 
Implementation 
Unit 
of 
the 
Education 
LIL 
will 
become 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
of 
the 
ERP, 
and 
will 
take 
on 
the 
fiduciary 
responsibilities 
of 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
during 
project 
implementation. 
Under 
the 
Education 
LIL, 
the 
PIU 
developed 
limited 
procurement 
management 
capacity 
and 
experience 
and 
some 
familiarity 
with 
-43- 
Page  50
Bank 
procurement 
guidelines, 
procedures 
and 
documentation. 
The 
PIU 
gained 
some 
experience 
in 
conducting 
ICB 
and 
shopping 
procedures 
for 
goods, 
but 
limited 
experience 
in 
selection 
and 
management 
of 
large 
technical 
assistance 
and 
civil 
works 
contracts. 
Because 
of 
staff 
turnover 
during 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the 
LIL, 
the 
PIUS 
procurement 
capacity 
needs 
considerable 
improvement. 
Furthermore, 
staff 
of 
component 
implementing 
units 
need 
guidance 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
TORs 
and 
identifying/specifying 
details 
of 
their 
procurement 
needs, 
and 
familiarization 
with 
Bank-financed 
procurement. 
The 
MOE’s 
own 
internal 
procurement 
unit 
has 
no 
familiarity 
with 
Bank 
procurement 
or 
technical 
expertise 
to 
provide 
this 
assistance 
to 
project 
implementing 
entities 
and, 
thus, 
will 
not 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
project. 
The 
PCU 
is 
expected 
to 
coordinate 
and 
provide 
assistance 
in 
bidding, 
selection 
of 
consultants, 
contracting 
and 
payment 
procedures 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank 
Guidelines. 
Line 
units 
within 
MOE 
will 
prepare 
technical 
specifications, 
terms 
of 
reference 
and 
evaluate 
technical 
aspects 
of 
proposals 
within 
their 
areas 
of 
responsibility. 
The 
PCU 
will 
arrange 
for 
the 
necessary 
no 
objections 
from 
the 
Bank. 
In 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
procurement 
management 
capacity 
of 
the 
PCU, 
an 
international 
procurement 
consultant 
will 
be 
hired 
for 
a 
period 
of 
six 
months 
to 
guide 
the 
procurement 
work 
and 
train 
PCU 
and 
component 
implementation 
staff 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Program. 
In 
addition, 
the 
MOE 
will 
arrange 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
procurement 
support 
and 
training 
with 
the 
State 
Procurement 
Agency 
(SPA) 
which 
has 
expressed 
its 
readiness 
to 
provide 
procurement 
assistance 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
detailed 
procurement 
plan 
would 
be 
prepared 
and 
agreed 
with 
all 
implementing 
units 
and 
updated 
every 
six 
months. 
The 
procurement 
capacity 
assessment 
is 
included 
in 
Annex 
6a 
of 
this 
PAD. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
A 
financial 
management 
assessment 
of 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Project 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
project 
preparation 
and 
updated 
at 
appraisal. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
assessment 
was 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
Project 
has 
in 
place 
an 
adequate 
financial 
management 
system 
that 
can 
provide, 
with 
reasonable 
assurance, 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
on 
the 
status 
of 
the 
project 
as 
required 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Such 
arrangements 
include 
adequacy 
of 
staff, 
the 
implementing 
entity’s 
accounting 
and 
financial 
reporting 
system? 
auditing 
arrangements 
and 
internal 
controls 
and 
taking 
various 
training 
workshops 
in 
financial 
management 
and 
procurement. 
The 
existing 
Project 
Implementation 
Unit 
will 
become 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU). 
The 
PCU 
that 
will 
implement 
the 
proposed 
Project 
has 
developed 
capacity 
and 
experience 
in 
managing 
the 
ongoing 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL), 
and 
its 
key 
staff 
have 
taken 
various 
training 
workshops 
in 
financial 
management 
and 
procurement. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
managing 
contracting 
and 
expenditures 
under 
the 
proposed 
Project, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
project 
activities, 
external 
auditing 
arrangements 
for 
the 
project, 
Credit 
disbursements, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
overall 
financial 
management. 
The 
existing 
Peachtree 
accounting 
software 
used 
for 
the 
ongoing 
LIL 
lacks 
the 
capacity 
to 
report 
in 
multiple 
currencies 
and 
languages. 
It 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
a 
software 
product 
that 
supports 
multiple 
currencies 
and 
languages 
for 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
The 
draft 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
Report 
(CFAA) 
of 
January 
8, 
2003, 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
public 
financial 
management 
issues 
that 
require 
strengthening, 
and 
which 
were 
addressed 
in 
the 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit-2 
approved 
in 
March 
2002. 
The 
SAC-2 
is 
facilitating 
policy 
dialogue 
in 
improving 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
public 
financial 
management 
including: 
(i) 
establishing 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Accounts, 
the 
Country’s 
supreme 
audit 
institution; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
banking 
sector; 
and 
(iii) 
implementing 
a 
modem 
Treasury 
Information 
Management 
System 
(TIMS), 
together 
with 
the 
IMF, 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
improve 
public 
sector 
accounting, 
internal 
controls 
and 
reporting. 
These 
activities 
are 
being 
financed 
under 
the 
ongoing 
Institutional 
Building 
Technical 
Assistance-II 
Credit. 
As 
promised 
in 
the 
I-PRSP, 
the 
Government 
has 
started 
to 
improve 
the 
management 
of 
the 
budget 
process, 
the 
most 
significant 
elements 
of 
which 
include: 
the 
publication 
of 
a 
new 
Budget 
Systems 
Law; 
the 
development 
of 
a 
Medium-Term 
Expenditure 
Framework 
for 
2003-2005 
-

- 
Page  51
and 
the 
ongoing 
development 
of 
a 
Public 
Investment 
Program. 
In 
2002, 
a 
Country 
Portfolio 
Performance 
Review 
(CPPR) 
was 
carried 
out 
on 
all 
projects 
under 
implementation 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
The 
report, 
which 
identified 
some 
common 
financial 
management 
issues, 
is 
currently 
being 
discussed 
with 
the 
Government. 
The 
detailed 
financial 
management 
assessment 
is 
included 
in 
Annex 
6b 
of 
this

and 
the 
significant

emerging 
from 
this

of 
the

in 
the 
three 
pilot

(i.e., 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ismayilli, 
and 
Ujar), 
where 
there 
is 
a 
total 
of 
150 
general 
schools. 
The 
majority 
of 
these 
schools 
were 
built 
using 
asbestos 
roofing 
material 
which 
have 
become 
deteriorated, 
exacerbated 
by 
long 
foregone 
maintenance 
and 
building 
repairs. 
These 
deteriorating 
asbestos 
materials 
present 
a 
health 
hazard 
to 
the 
occupants 
and 
an 
environmental 
risk. 
The 
individual 
schools 
to 
be 
rehabilitated 
will 
not 
have 
been 
identified 
apricrri, 
but 
they 
will 
be 
selected 
for 
rehabilitation 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
district 
rationalization 
plans 
to 
be 
prepared 
under 
the 
Project. 
However, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
refurbishment 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
schools, 
the 
Government 
has 
prepared 
an 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(EMP), 
which 
is 
included 
in 
the 
PIP. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
See 
details

5.4 
How 
have 
stakeholders 
been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental 
impacts 
and 
proposed 
environment 
management 
plan? 
Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that 
were 
used 
and 
which 
groups 
were 
consulted? 
The 
MOE 
prepared 
the 
draft 
EMP 
in 
consultation 
with 
key 
stakeholders. 
After 
advertising 
the 
availability 
of 
the 
draft 
EMP 
for 
school 
rehabilitation 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
under 
the 
proposed 
Project, 
the 
MOE 
posted 
the 
draft 
EMP 
in 
the 
central 
MOE 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
Departments 
of 
Education 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts. 
Following 
the 
disclosure 
of 
the 
draft 
EMP, 
the 
MOE 
organized 
consultative 
meetings 
in 
Baku 
and 
in 
the 
three 
districts, 
involving 
key 
stakeholders 
(e.g., 
school 
directors, 
teachers, 
parents, 
and 
NGOs). 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
The 
Bank 
will 
finance 
only 
those 
schools 
satisfactorily 
cleared 
under 
the 
EMP. 
During 
school 
rehabilitation, 
compliance 
monitoring 
to 
ensure 
implementation 
of 
the 
recommended 
mitigation 
measures 
will 
be 
the 
primary 
responsibility 
of 
the 
supervision 
architects 
(hired 
by 
the 
MOE/PCU), 
with 
oversight 
responsibility 
by 
the 
Departments 
of 
Education 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts 
and 
the 
relevant 
environmental 
authorities.

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and 
specify 
the 
project’s 
social 
development 
outcomes. 
The 
deterioration 
of 
the 
physical 
infrastructure, 
the 
low 
salaries 
of 
teachers 
which 
forces 
many 
to 
look 
for 
alternative 
income, 
the 
non-affordability 
of 
education 
for 
the 
poor 
due 
to 
direct 
cost, 
both 
formal 
and 
informal 
as 
well 
as 
opportunity 
cost, 
have 
created 
serious 
problems 
of 
access 
to 
education 
for 
a 
certain 
group 
of 
population, 
mainly 
the 
poor. 
In 
addition, 
inequalities 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
-450 
Page  52
available 
to 
different 
population 
groups 
exacerbated 
the 
situation. 
Decrease 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
education, 
which 
is 
more 
pronounced 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
poor 
urban 
communities, 
is 
due 
to 
a 
number 
of 
reasons, 
including: 
non-availability 
of 
teaching 
materials; 
textbooks 
cost 
which 
is 
unaffordable 
for 
many 
poor 
families; 
schools 
that 
are 
not 
conducive 
to 
learning 
(too 
cold 
during 
the 
winter 
months, 
causing 
up 
to 
25 
percent 
absentees, 
especially 
among 
those 
who 
have 
to 
walk 
to 
school 
or 
lack 
proper 
clothing; 
sporadic 
availability 
of 
electricity, 
mostly 
in 
rural 
areas, 
small 
towns, 
and 
even 
big 
urban 
areas, 
causing 
difficulties 
in 
early 
mornings 
or 
in 
the 
second 
shifts; 
overcrowded 
schools 
in 
urban 
areas, 
mainly 
Baku); 
decrease 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching 
force 
due 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
proper 
in-service 
training, 
leaving 
the 
teaching 
force 
for 
more 
lucrative 
professions, 
most 
qualified 
teachers 
refusing 
to 
go 
outside 
Baku 
or 
big 
towns; 
lack 
of 
accountability 
of 
what 
is 
going 
on 
in 
schools 
in 
terms 
of 
learning 
(no 
standard 
assessment 
of 
learning 
throughout 
the 
school 
year 
nor 
any 
standard 
teachers’ 
evaluation 
based 
on 
a 
set 
of 
transparent 
criteria); 
curriculum 
which 
is 
highly 
centralized, 
down 
to 
the 
setting 
of 
the 
syllabus, 
with 
set 
topics 
and 
hours 
for 
each 
subject, 
not 
allowing 
for 
any 
creativity, 
is 
disconnected 
to 
the 
schools 
and 
the 
need 
of 
teachers 
and 
students 
(i.e., 
ask 
for 
type 
of 
experimentation 
for 
which 
the 
school 
lacks 
the 
proper 
instrument, 
textbooks 
that 
are 
written 
in 
a 
language 
not 
comprehensible 
for 
the 
grade 
they 
are 
intended 
for) 
and; 
finally, 
does 
not 
reflect 
the 
emerging 
needs 
of 
the 
society. 
All 
of 
these 
contributed 
to 
the 
deterioration 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
also 
has 
exacerbated 
the 
inequalities 
of 
access 
to 
the 
quality 
education 
where 
the 
better 
off 
have 
the 
means 
to 
compensate 
for 
some 
of 
these 
shortcomings 
through 
different 
means. 
For 
example, 
better 
off 
schools, 
mainly 
those 
in 
central 
Baku 
and 
some 
other 
urban 
areas, 
have 
more 
access 
to 
electricity, 
can 
buy 
some 
of 
the 
teaching 
materials 
and 
students 
can 
use 
tutors 
to 
compensate 
for 
some 
of 
the 
school 
shortcomings. 
The 
above 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
are 
in 
line 
with 
some 
of 
the 
available 
data 
on 
enrollment 
by 
poverty 
group. 
Even 
though 
the 
data 
are 
based 
on 
enrollment, 
one 
can 
deduct 
that 
attendance 
is 
even 
lower 
than 
official 
figures. 
In 
Azerbaijan 
general 
education 
(grades 
l-l 
1) 
is 
compulsory 
and 
free 
of 
charge. 
Available 
enrollment 
data 
vary 
by 
data 
sources. 
Officially, 
dropout 
rates 
during 
the 
compulsory 
cycle 
are 
low 
(about 
l-2 
percent) 
but 
these 
official 
figures 
are 
based 
on 
enrollments 
rather 
than 
actual 
attendance. 
However, 
there 
are 
large 
disparities 
in 
enrollment 
rates 
among 
older 
age 
students 
and 
those 
at 
tertiary 
level 
by 
poverty 
groups, 
with 
only 
9 
percent 
of 
poor 
college 
age 
population 
(ages 
17-24) 
enrolled, 
compared 
with 
15 
percent 
of 
non-poor 
population. 
Qualitative 
data 
also 
suggest 
that 
there 
are 
concerns 
about 
low 
attendance 
rates 
and 
poor 
learning 
outcomes 
in 
general 
education 
among 
the 
low 
income 
groups. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
for 
the 
education 
sector 
indicate 
that 
poverty 
and 
increasing 
direct 
costs 
of 
education, 
some 
of 
which 
are 
informal 
payments, 
have 
reduced 
school 
attendance. 
Main 
reasons 
for 
low 
attendance 
among 
these 
groups 
are 
(i) 
low 
income, 
which, 
in 
many 
cases, 
forces 
young 
students, 
mainly 
boys, 
to 
work 
to 
help 
their 
parents; 
(ii) 
the 
direct 
cost 
of 
education 
(formal 
and 
informal); 
and 
(iii) 
change 
of 
residence 
among 
some 
IDP 
families. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
indicate 
that 
the 
direct 
costs 
of 
education, 
some 
of 
which 
are 
informal 
payments, 
have 
increased 
substantially. 
According 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
assessment, 
informal 
payments 
exist 
at 
both 
the 
supply 
and 
the 
demand 
side. 
At 
the 
supply 
side, 
in 
some 
cases, 
it 
consists 
of 
buying 
jobs, 
paying 
to 
have 
more 
hours 
of 
teaching 
which 
then 
translates 
to 
more 
income. 
At 
the 
demand 
side, 
it 
exists 
in 
all 
levels 
of 
the 
education 
system, 
from 
primary 
to 
university 
education, 
ranging 
from 
paying 
to 
get 
into 
better 
schools 
or 
better 
classes 
with 
the 
best 
teachers 
within 
schools; 
to 
paying 
for 
the 
basic 
needs, 
grades, 
absenteeism, 
tutoring, 
journals 
and 
tickets 
sold 
by 
teachers. 
Financing 
of 
schools 
is 
highly 
centralized; 
however, 
due 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
a 
nationwide 
banking 
system, 
the 
directors 
physically 
distribute 
the 
salaries 
of 
the 
teachers 
to 
them. 
In 
some 
cases, 
it 
is 
reported 
that 
this 
creates 
some 
control 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
school 
director 
over 
the 
salaries 
of 
teachers. 
One 
of 
the 
institutional 
characteristics 
perpetuating 
this 
practice 
is 
the 
discretionary 
power 
of 
the 
directors 
and 
district 
authorities 
in 
hiring 
of 
teachers 
and 
paying 
their 
salaries. 
However, 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
indicate 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
informal 
payments 
happens 
in 
urban 
areas 
and 
among 
the 
better 
-

off 
families. 
According 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
assessment, 
private 
tutoring 
is 
also 
mainly 
an 
urban 
phenomenon 
among 
better 
off 
families, 
concentrated 
in 
upper 
secondary 
grades 
for 
university 
preparation, 
costing 
families 
approximately 
US$lOO 
a 
month. 
There 
are 
no 
formal 
fees 
for 
school 
attendance 
in 
general 
education, 
but 
many 
families 
pay 
a 
fee. 
It 
is 
also 
reported 
that 
gifts 
and 
school 
maintenance 
fees 
are 
more 
widespread. 
The 
direct 
cost 
of 
education 
can 
often 
become 
unaffordable 
for 
the 
poor 
and 
low-income 
families 
with 
two 
or 
three 
school 
age 
children. 
Parental 
participation 
in 
schools 
is 
mainly 
in 
the 
form 
of 
assisting 
the 
schools 
with 
the 
minimum 
needs, 
such 
as 
collecting 
money 
through 
the 
teachers/parents 
association 
to 
repair 
schools 
or 
buy 
some 
of 
the 
materials. 
Parents, 
however, 
do 
not 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
decision-making 
in 
schools. 
In 
general, 
parents, 
teachers 
and 
students 
feel 
excluded 
from 
input 
into 
the 
education 
process, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
content 
and 
decision-making 
at 
the 
school 
level, 
which 
they 
consider 
as 
managed 
in 
a 
non-transparent 
way. 
For 
instance, 
teachers 
do 
not 
have 
much 
say 
on 
the 
content 
of 
textbooks 
and 
teachers 
and 
parents 
are 
not 
always 
fully 
aware 
of 
what 
the 
money 
collected 
at 
the 
school 
level 
is 
spent 
on. 
This 
is 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
66 
percent 
of 
the 
parents 
participate 
in 
the 
school’s 
general 
collection. 
VVhile 
social 
and 
poverty-related 
issues 
of 
access 
and 
equity 
are 
central 
to 
education 
reform 
and 
must 
shape 
long-term 
objectives, 
they 
can 
only 
be 
achieved 
in 
a 
sustainable 
manner 
if 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
education 
is 
improved 
through 
efforts 
such 
as 
developing 
new 
curriculum, 
teachers 
training, 
and 
improving 
the 
policy 
and 
management 
capacity 
of 
the 
Ministry 
with 
a 
better 
research 
capacity 
to 
monitor 
and 
plan, 
and 
a 
better 
management 
information 
system 
to 
record, 
analyze 
and 
plan. 
Increase 
of 
general 
quality 
of 
teachers 
and 
teaching 
environment 
will 
help 
everyone. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
some 
targeted 
intervention 
for 
the 
poorest 
who 
cannot 
afford 
to 
continue 
based 
on 
the 
reasons 
mentioned 
above. 
Equity 
consideration 
and 
poverty 
impact 
of 
the 
Program. 
Household 
surveys 
show 
that 
Azerbaijan 
still 
enjoys 
almost 
universal 
enrollment 
rates 
in 
basic 
education, 
but 
sharp 
declines 
in 
preschools, 
upper 
secondary 
education 
(grades 
10-l 
1) 
and 
vocational 
education. 
In 
higher 
education, 
the 
enrollment 
rate 
of 
the 
college 
age 
population 
increased 
slightly 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
private 
sector. 
Yet, 
access 
to 
higher 
education 
has 
become 
a 
growing 
concern 
for 
the 
poor 
during 
the 
transition 
for 
two 
main 
reasons. 
First, 
poor 
children 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
attend 
higher 
education 
institutions 
than 
well-to-do-children 
since 
they 
could 
not 
afford 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
increased 
direct 
cost 
of 
higher 
education. 
Second, 
poor 
children 
are 
also 
less 
likely 
to 
attend 
higher 
education 
than 
well-to-do 
children 
because 
of 
the 
deterioration 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education, 
which 
have 
reduced 
chances 
of 
poor 
children 
to 
be 
successful 
on 
the 
centrally 
organized 
university 
entrance 
examinations. 
Since 
many 
poor 
schools 
tend 
to 
be 
located 
in 
rural 
areas, 
poor 
children 
in 
rural 
areas 
have 
little 
access 
to 
good 
quality 
general 
education. 
The 
proposed 
program 
will 
improve 
access 
to 
general 
education 
among 
the 
economically 
disadvantaged 
through 
two 
main 
interventions. 
First, 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education 
in 
selected 
poor 
districts 
will 
disproportionately 
advantage 
poor 
students. 
Improved 
quality 
and 
relevance 
in 
general 
education 
can 
not 
only 
contribute 
to 
the 
education 
sector 
which 
is 
more 
responsive 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
emerging 
economy 
and 
the 
society, 
but 
also 
can 
translate 
to 
less 
need 
for 
tutoring 
and 
less 
need 
for 
direct 
payments 
(e.g., 
textbooks), 
as 
well 
as 
informal 
payments, 
and 
an 
education 
which 
is 
responsive 
to 
the 
emerging 
needs 
of 
the 
society. 
Second, 
additional 
resources 
(i.e., 
school 
grants) 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
poor 
schools 
and 
districts 
in 
the 
three 
districts, 
which 
will 
improve 
the 
learning 
environment 
of 
the 
poor. 
These 
districts 
were 
selected 
because 
they 
all 
have 
lower 
average 
income 
than 
more 
affluent 
districts 
such 
as 
Baku. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
relatively 
poorer 
students 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
School 
Grant 
Program. 
For 
example, 
the 
School 
Grant 
Program 
aims 
to 
address 
the 
problems 
of 
access 
and 
inequities 
by 
financing 
school-based 
education 
programs 
that 
would 
upgrade 
schooling 
quality. 
Additionally, 
the 
program 
will 
emphasize 
the 
development 
of 
policy 
analysis 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE

lacks 
such 
an 
analytical 
capacity. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
Project 
relied 
heavily 
on 
two 
studies, 
both 
highly 
participatory: 
a 
social 
assessment 
in 
which 
local 
level 
stakeholders 
(teachers, 
school 
directors, 
local 
community 
leaders, 
students, 
their 
families, 
and 
local 
NGOs) 
were 
consulted 
on 
the 
issues 
concerning 
education 
and 
about 
their 
needs 
and 
priorities; 
and 
a 
study 
of 
informal 
payments 
in 
education, 
which 
was 
based 
on 
a 
nationally 
representative 
sample. 
Both 
studies 
consulted 
parents 
and 
other 
members 
of 
the 
society 
on 
the 
cost 
of 
education 
and 
the 
inequities 
that 
such 
cost 
can 
cause. 
In 
addition, 
two 
two-day 
Participatory 
Stakeholder 
Workshops 
were 
organized 
on 
February 
19-20,2002 
and 
on 
January 
13-14, 
2003 
to 
discuss 
the 
Government’s 
Education 
Reform 
Strategy, 
priorities 
for 
the 
next 
Education 
Project, 
and 
the 
draft 
design 
of 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
The 
Project 
also 
plans 
substantial 
consultation 
with, 
and 
participation, 
of 
local 
communities 
for 
the 
school 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Efficiency 
and 
Finance 
component. 
Using 
regional 
meetings 
and 
annual 
workshops 
and 
publicity 
brochures 
throughout 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Program, 
the 
MOE 
will 
inform 
the 
key 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
overall 
objectives 
and 
activities 
of 
the 
Program 
and 
gather 
feedback 
from 
the 
project’s 
key 
stakeholders 
on 
the 
project 
implementation. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
The 
MOE 
used 
the 
participatory 
approach 
to 
involve 
key 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
project 
throughout 
the 
preparatory 
phase 
of 
the 
Program. 
Initially, 
the 
MOE 
efforts 
focused 
on 
its 
own 
officials 
at 
the 
central 
and 
local 
levels. 
There 
have 
also 
been 
discussions 
with 
all 
key 
ministries 
(such 
as 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economic 
Development, 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Sports 
and 
Youth). 
In 
addition, 
the 
MOE 
organized 
two 
workshops 
(February 
2002; 
and 
January 
2003), 
involving 
all 
the 
key 
officials 
and 
stakeholders, 
who 
were 
invited 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
identification 
of 
the 
Project, 
and 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
draft 
Project 
Implementation 
Plan. 
The 
MOE 
organized 
a 
meeting 
to 
invite 
all 
the 
key 
donors/partners 
to 
support 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Reform 
Program. 
To 
date, 
there 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
any 
significant 
commitment 
from 
any 
donor/partner 
to 
the 
education 
sector 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
proposed 
Program. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
MOE 
discussed 
with 
UNICEF 
and 
the 
OSI-Azerbaijan 
the 
possibility 
of 
their 
support 
for 
the 
proposed 
Program. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
OSI-Azerbaijan 
would 
finance 
limited 
activities 
related 
to: 
(i) 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
school 
improvement 
plans; 
(ii) 
support 
of 
the 
School 
Grant 
Program 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
schools 
to 
write 
and 
implement 
grant 
proposals; 
and 
(iii) 
textbook 
policy 
and 
standards. 
Similarly, 
UNICEF 
indicated 
some 
interest 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
some 
project-specific 
activities, 
but 
these 
activities 
and 
the 
scope 
of 
UNICEF’s 
support 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
finalized. 
In 
addition, 
the 
education 
team 
consulted 
with 
the 
U.S. 
State 
Department’s 
Office 
of 
Education 
and 
Cultural 
Affairs 
for 
possible 
collaboration 
since 
they 
also 
finance 
two 
small-scale 
education 
programs 
(i.e., 
civic 
education; 
and 
institutional 
development 
of 
a 
private 
university 
with 
particular 
focus 
on 
strategic 
planning 
and 
management 
information 
systems). 
But 
to 
date, 
there 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
specific 
agreements. 
It 
was 
also 
agreed 
that 
the 
MOE 
would 
establish 
a 
Project 
Steering 
Council, 
which 
will 
also 
include 
representatives 
from 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance 
and 
Economic 
Development 
as 
well 
as 
from 
public 
associations, 
parents 
and 
civil 
society 
at 
large.

achieves 
its 
social

outcomes? 
The 
Program’s 
management 
and

component, 
and

social 
development 
outcomes 
of 
the 
Program, 
and 
will 
provide

How 
will 
the

monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
Program’s 
management 
and 
evaluation, 
and 
the 
Ministry’s 
ongoing

will 
monitor 
social 
development 
outcomes 
of 
the 
Program, 
including 
participation 
of 
girls, 
children 
from 
low-income 
and 
IDP 
families, 
and

Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
Political. 
In 
1998, 
the 
GOA 
initiated 
the 
education 
reform 
program 
process 
and 
requested 
the 
Bank’s 
assistance 
to 
support 
the 
Government’s 
education 
reform 
efforts 
(see 
Section 
D.4 
for 
indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership). 
Since 
then, 
IDA 
has 
been 
supporting 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
efforts 
through 
the 
ongoing 
Education 
LIL, 
which 
has 
substantially 
assisted 
the 
MOE 
in 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
Bank-assisted 
project. 
At 
present, 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
strong 
commitment 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
the 
Government. 
The 
proposed 
Program 
is 
also 
consistent 
with 
the 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Economic 
Development 
(SPPRED), 
which 
has 
been 
recently 
published, 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
country’s 
projected 
economic 
growth 
is 
accompanied 
by 
significant 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
SPPRED 
shows 
the 
strong 
commitment 
of 
the 
Government 
to 
education 
reform, 
which 
is 
considered 
as 
one 
of 
the 
main 
factors 
contributing 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
risks 
related 
to 
the 
political 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Project 
are 
therefore 
minimal. 
Institutional. 
There 
is 
a 
strong 
commitment 
to 
the 
project 
development 
objectives 
in 
the 
MOE 
at 
the 
central 
and 
local 
levels. 
The 
more 
important 
sustainability 
issue 
at 
the 
MOE 
level 
is 
the 
challenge 
to 
mainstream 
project 
activities 
into 
the 
MOE’s 
core 
activities 
and 
increase 
the 
sense 
of 
project 
ownership 
of 
key 
units 
and 
departments 
in 
the 
MOE. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Program 
will 
experiment 
with 
different 
ways 
of 
increasing 
the 
sense 
of 
project 
ownership. 
First, 
the 
proposed 
implementation 
arrangements 
will 
aim 
to 
integrate 
the 
Project’s 
activities 
into 
the 
mainstream 
activities 
of 
the 
MOE. 
The 
close 
parallels 
between 
the 
Bank’s 
assessment 
of 
priority 
reform 
areas 
and 
the 
MOE’s 
are 
also 
encouraging. 
Second, 
the 
Program 
will 
also 
rely 
on 
the 
existing 
MOE 
units 
to 
implement 
project 
activities 
by 
strengthening 
their 
implementation 
capacity. 
The 
establishment 
of 
new 
units 
are 
supported 
only 
when 
the 
MOE 
does 
not 
have 
such 
units. 
Financial. 
At 
present, 
the 
economic 
environment 
for 
education 
reform 
in 
Azerbaijan 
is 
not 
good. 
However, 
prospects 
for 
substantial 
economic 
expansion 
over 
the 
next 
two 
decades 
are 
bright. 
The 
commercial 
development 
of 
the 
nation’s 
oil 
reserves 
is 
likely 
to 
increase 
gross 
national 
production 
by 
US$20 
billion 
to 
US$25 
billion 
over 
the 
next 
fifteen 
years. 
The 
parallel 
adoption 
of 
sound 
economic 
policies 
could 
result 
in 
a 
growth 
in 
incomes 
of 
12 
to 
15 
percent 
a 
year, 
leading 
to 
a 
five 
to 
eight-fold 
increase 
in 
total 
output 
over 
the 
next 
fifteen 
years. 
However, 
such 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
growth 
would 
require 
not 
only 
excellent 
economic 
management, 
but 
also 
very 
favorable 
international 
economic 
conditions, 
including 
high 
and 
stable 
oil 
prices. 
A 
three-fold 
increase 
in 
output 
per 
capita 
appears 
more 
likely, 
implying 
that 
by 
2018, 
Azerbaijan 
would 
have 
reached 
the 
level 
of 
prosperity 
currently 
prevailing 
in 
such 
countries 
as 
Turkey, 
Brazil, 
Latvia 
and 
Thailand. 
Despite 
such 
prospects 
for 
substantial 
economic 
expansion, 
those 
revenues 
will 
not 
have 
a 
large 
impact 
on 
the 
budget 
for 
5-8 
years, 
and 
there 
are 
issues 
of 
fiscal 
sustainability 
before 
then. 
Nevertheless, 
as 
Section 
E. 
1 
shows, 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
Program 
on 
the 
Government’s 
recurrent 
costs 
for 
education 
is 
very 
small 
(e.g., 
less 
than 
0.1 
percent 
of 
the 
MOE’s 
recurrent 
expenditures 
in 
2002). 
An 
economic 
and 
fiscal 
analysis 
study 
will 
also 
examine 
the 
Project 
interventions 
and 
proposed 
systemic 
reforms 
in 
the 
fiscal 
context 
during 
the 
course 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Civil 
service 
salaries 
(including 
Ministry 
officials) 
are 
generally 
very 
low 
and 
have 
often 
been 
seen 
as 
one 
of 
the 
contributing 
factors 
for 
the 
lack 
of 
incentives 
for 
key 
staff 
in 
line 
units 
to 
effectively 
implement 
the 
Education 
LIL 
during 
the 
past 
three 
years. 
Unless 
the 
civil 
service 
salary 
structure 
is 
reformed, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
there 
continues 
to 
be 
lack 
of 
incentives 
and 
the 
sense 
of 
ownership 
of 
the

for

key 
staff 
in

units, 
despite 
the 
introduction 
of 
some 
risk 
mitigation 
measures 
to 
address 
this 
risk.

Project 
The 
Program 
comprises 
a 
broad 
spectrum 
of 
activities 
which 
promote 
the 
objectives 
of 
improved 
quality, 
equity 
and 
access, 
and 
relevance 
of 
education 
and 
efficient 
and 
effective 
use 
of 
available 
resources 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
focus 
of 
the 
proposed 
Program 
would 
be 
on 
general 
education, 
and 
comprise 
the 
following 
components: 
(i) 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms; 
(iii) 
equity 
and 
access; 
(iv) 
management, 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity; 
and 
(v) 
project 
coordination 
and 
monitoring. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program 
would 
focus 
at 
the 
national 
level 
and 
in 
three 
selected 
districts 
of 
the 
country 
(i.e., 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ismayilli, 
and 
Ujar), 
which 
were 
selected 
based 
on 
a 
set 
of 
criteria 
(see 
Annex 
11). 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APC 
would 
consist 
of 
the 
following 
main

These 
subcomponents 
are 
described 
below: 
Subcomponent

This 
subcomponent 
is 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
following 
key 
sectoral 
issues:

A 
defensible 
and 
rigorous 
approach 
to 
development 
and 
renewal 
of 
curricula 
in 
compulsory 
general 
education 
is 
needed; 
l 
The 
need 
to 
ensure 
that 
curricula 
are 
appropriate 
for 
contemporary, 
democratic 
society 
and 
a 
market 
economy 
will 
be 
realized; 
* 
Meaning 
and 
relevance 
will 
be 
increased 
in 
the 
teaching/learning 
process 
through 
the 
fostering 
of 
active 
and 
interactive 
teaching 
methods 
and 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
an 
integrated 
approach 
to 
science 
and 
social 
science 
curricula; 
and 
* 
The 
IEP 
will 
be 
strengthened, 
and 
its 
capacity 
for 
curricula 
reform 
and 
development 
improved 
by 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
the 
training 
of 
key 
personnel. 
Under 
the 
Education 
LIL, 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems 
(IEP) 
was 
formed 
through 
the 
merger 
of 
the 
Pedagogy 
Research 
Institute 
and 
the 
Scientific 
Method 
Center. 
The 
IEP 
was 
planned 
to 
be 
the 
main 
MOE 
institution 
to 
reform 
and 
develop 
curricula, 
with 
an 
initial 
emphasis 
on 
compulsory 
general 
education. 
A 
review 
of 
conditions 
and 
operations 
at 
the 
IEP 
in 
mid-2002 
indicated 
that 
additional 
strengthening 
and 
capacity 
building 
was 
needed; 
that 
the 
model 
and 
procedures 
for 
curricula 
reform 
and 
development 
needed 
to 
be 
strengthened 
and 
made 
more 
comprehensive 
and 
usable; 
and 
that 
the 
organizational 
changes 
needed 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
IEP 
for 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
development. 
It 
is 
planned 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
program 
that 
substantial 
support 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
strengthen 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
curriculum 
Development 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
training 
and 
goods 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Department 
of 
Curriculum 
Development 
to 
be 
established 
within 
the 
re-structured 
IEP 
(or 
the 
MOE). 
Further 
curricula 
reform 
and 
development 
will 
be 
undertaken 
for 
general 
education 
in 
grades 
l-l 
1. 
The 
model 
and 
MOPP 
established 
for 
the 
IEP 
will 
be 
utilized. 
A 
key 
area 
of 
development 
for 
grades 
5-l 
1 
will 
be 
an 
integrated 
curricula 
for 
science 
and 
social 
science. 
Extensive 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
will 
be 
devoted 
to 
this 
area. 
The 
GOA 
plans 
to 
develop 
national 
education 
standards 
as 
part 
of 
its 
reformed 
general 
education 
curricula. 
Under 
this 
subcomponent, 
an 
approach 
to 
development 
and 
use 
of 
such 
standards 
will 
be 
developed 
and 
made 
part 
of 
the 
IEP 
model 
and 
MOPP 
for 
curricula 
reform 
and 
development. 
Model 
guidelines, 
most 
likely 
from 
OECD 
countries, 
will 
be 
used 
as 
guidelines 
in 
this 
process. 
In 
addition, 
support 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
under 
the 
subcomponent 
to 
train 
up 
to 
9,000 
teachers 
in 
grade 
1, 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
curricula 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
2007. 
Institutional 
Arrangements. 
This 
subcomponent, 
which 
was 
prepared 
by 
a 
working 
group, 
supported 
by 
a 
group 
of 
both 
national 
and 
international 
consultants, 
will 
be 
coordinated 
by 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
General 
Education 
in 
the 
MOE 
until 
the 
Curriculum 
Development 
Department 
Unit 
is 
established. 
The 
Head 
of 
the 
Curriculum 
Development 
Unit 
will 
take 
over 
the 
coordination/implementation 
responsibility 
for 
this 
subcomponent 
when 
the 
Unit 
is 
established, 
staffed 
and 
firnctional. 
Subcomponent 
2: 
Teacher 
Development 
(US$2.57 
million). 
The 
Project 
seeks 
to 
establish 
strong 
links 
between 
education 
reforms 
and 
teacher 
development 
through 
both 
initial 
teacher 
preparation 
and 
in-service 
training. 
This 
also 
requires 
the 
reform 
of 
pre-service 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
education 
programs 
based 
on 
the 
curricular 
reform 
in 
general 
education. 
The 
curricular 
reform 
envisioned 
under 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
requires 
significant 
changes 
in 
teachers’ 
knowledge 
and 
skills. 
The 
quality 
of 
teaching 
will 
depend 
on: 
(i) 
how 
well 
teachers 
are 
prepared 
to 
implement 
the 
new 
curricula 
and 
use 
the 
new 
teaching 
materials, 
and 
(ii) 
exposure 
of 
teachers 
to 
alternative 
teaching 
and 
learning 
approaches, 
especially 
those 
focusing 
on 
student-centered 
and 
active 
learning 
methodologies. 
Therefore, 
teacher 
training 
is 
critical 
to 
a 
successful 
implementation 
of 
new 
curricula 
and 
teaching 
methods 
and 
-

empowerment 
of 
teachers 
who 
will 
enhance 
their 
skills. 
In 
order 
to 
develop 
an 
effective 
teacher 
training 
strategy 
and 
prepare 
innovative 
teacher 
training 
activities 
under 
the 
Program, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
assess: 
(i) 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
current 
teacher 
training 
programs 
and 
classroom 
teaching 
practices; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
training 
needs 
of 
teachers 
and 
schools 
based 
on 
the 
demands 
of 
new 
curricula, 
a 
market 
economy, 
and 
an 
open 
society. 
The 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
teacher 
development 
subcomponent 
are: 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
(i) 
identifying 
teacher 
education 
policies, 
planning 
objectives 
and 
strategies 
to 
build 
a 
unified 
national 
system 
of 
teacher 
education 
based 
on 
concepts 
and 
methods 
reflecting 
the 
continually 
changing 
needs 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
society, 
and 
of 
the 
school 
curriculum; 
(ii) 
improving 
the 
standards 
of 
all 
training 
and 
the 
qualifications 
of 
all 
teacher 
education 
staff, 
including 
revitalizing 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“professional 
practitioner” 
in 
teacher 
education 
among 
teachers 
in 
the 
schools, 
and 
its 
acceptance 
by 
the 
community; 
(iii) 
revising 
the 
programs 
of 
initial 
preparation 
and 
continuing 
professional 
development 
with 
much 
greater 
emphasis 
on 
practical 
teaching 
methodology, 
student-centered 
learning 
and 
collaboration 
with 
the 
schools; 
and 
(iv) 
improving 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials 
and 
equipment 
available 
in 
teacher 
education 
institutions, 
In 
addition, 
the 
Program 
will 
also 
shift 
from 
a 
supply- 
to 
a 
demand-driven 
system, 
supported 
by 
a 
system 
of 
incentives, 
such 
as 
credits 
for 
successful 
completion 
of 
in-service 
training 
and 
a 
better 
reward 
and 
promotion 
structure 
for 
teachers 
who 
improve 
their 
qualifications. 
The 
Government 
prepared 
a 
draft 
teacher 
education 
component 
for 
the 
development 
and 
improvement 
of 
pre-service 
education 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
with 
assistance 
from 
international 
and 
local 
consultants 
financed 
under 
the 
PHRD 
Grant, 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
US$15 
million 
over 
the 
next 
ten 
years. 
Given 
the 
lack 
of 
resources 
available 
for 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APL, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
this 
component 
would 
be 
limited 
to 
“in-service 
teacher 
training” 
that 
focuses 
on 
“the 
new 
curricula” 
and 
“teaching 
methods” 
across 
the 
country, 
and 
that 
targeted 
teacher 
training 
activities 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
pilot 
districts 
to 
re-train 
single-subject 
teachers 
or 
train 
teachers 
in 
multi-subject 
teaching. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
MOE 
would 
prepare 
a 
set 
of 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials 
for 
teachers, 
directors 
and 
inspectors 
by 
2006, 
and 
a 
large 
scale 
teacher 
training 
program 
could 
start 
in 
the 
2007-2008 
academic 
year. 
Under 
Phase 
1, 
there 
will 
be 
limited 
focus 
on 
the 
development 
and 
improvement 
of 
pre-service 
teacher 
education, 
focusing 
mainly 
on 
(i) 
review 
of 
pre-service 
education 
(e.g., 
curriculum, 
staff, 
admission 
policies, 
management 
and 
finance, 
and 
so 
forth) 
and 
the 
development 
of 
teacher 
education 
strategy; 
(ii) 
revision 
of 
the 
primary 
teacher 
education 
curricula; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
course 
on 
the 
Foundation 
of 
Education. 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
in 
three 
main 
areas: 
(a) 
continued 
development 
of 
in-service 
teacher 
training, 
including 
the 
mass-training 
of 
about 
9,000 
teachers 
(or 
25 
percent 
of 
primary 
grade 
teachers); 
and 
(b) 
initial 
reforms 
for 
pre-service 
teacher 
education. 
Under 
Phase 
1, 
this 
subcomponent 
is 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
following 
key 
sectoral 
issues: 
(i) 
curricula 
of 
the 
teacher 
education/training 
institutions 
and 
their 
relationship 
to 
the 
general 
school 
curricula, 
which 
are 
frequently 
unclear; 
(ii) 
lack 
of 
formal 
on-going 
relationship 
with 
schools, 
including 
lack 
of 
use 
of 
schools 
for 
in-service 
training; 
(iii) 
narrowly 
specialized 
teacher 
education 
programs, 
especially 
for 
upper 
grades; 
(iv) 
possible 
duplication 
of 
function 
between 
some 
teacher 
education 
institutions; 
(v) 
inadequate 
funds 
for 
facilities, 
equipment, 
books 
and 
other 
essential 
teaching 
materials; 
and 
(vi) 
lack 
of 
exposure 
of 
staff 
in 
teacher 
education 
institutions 
to 
modern 
teaching 
methods 
and 
teacher 
training 
delivery 
methods.

Subcomponent 
3: 
Textbooks 
and 
Reading 
Materials 
(uS$3.27 
million). 
The 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
textbook 
and 
reading 
materials 
subcomponent 
are 
to 
stimulate 
reading 
habits 
of 
grades 
1-l 
1 
students 
and 
provide 
extra-curricular 
and 
co-curricular 
reading 
materials 
(including 
reference 
materials) 
to 
facilitate 
independent 
learning 
opportunities. 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
Program 
would 
finance 
(i) 
the 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
in 
Latin 
script 
Azeri 
language, 
which 
are 
currently 
available 
in 
the 
market; 
(ii) 
extra-curricular 
and 
co-reading 
materials 
which 
are 
available 
in 
Cyrillic 
but 
need 
to 
be 
converted 
to 
Latin 
script; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
development 
of 
new 
reading 
materials. 
All 
general 
schools 
in 
the 
country 
will 
be 
provided 
a 
set 
of 
reading 
materials 
under 
the 
Project. 
The 
second 
objective 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
development 
of 
textbook 
policy 
and 
standards. 
It 
is 
also 
expected 
that 
this 
subcomponent 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
sustainable 
private 
publishing 
industry 
to 
support 
the 
ongoing 
reforms 
and 
dissemination 
of 
knowledge 
to 
the 
whole 
country. 
In 
this 
regard, 
progress 
has 
already 
been 
made 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL 
through 
training 
seminars 
for 
authors, 
publishers, 
and 
printers, 
conducted 
with 
additional 
support 
from 
OSI-Azerbaijan. 
The 
MOE 
established 
a 
Textbook 
Approval 
Board, 
with 
its 
own 
set 
of 
procedures 
for 
the 
evaluation, 
selection, 
approval, 
and 
procurement 
of 
textbooks. 
But 
affordable 
textbooks 
and 
other 
learning 
materials 
of 
good 
quality 
are 
in 
short 
supply 
and 
the 
state 
(central) 
publishing 
and 
distribution 
systems 
have 
essentially 
ceased 
to 
function. 
The 
Program 
will 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
development 
of 
an 
efficient 
and 
effective 
system 
of 
publishing, 
printing, 
and 
distribution 
of 
reading 
materials. 
Resources 
will 
be 
allocated 
to: 
(i) 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Textbook 
Department 
and 
the 
Textbook 
Approval 
Board 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
mandate, 
and 
(ii) 
improve 
the 
system 
of 
textbook 
concept 
(e.g., 
design 
and 
content 
of 
textbooks 
in 
line 
with 
the 
existing 
curricula) 
that 
will 
lead 
to 
innovative 
textbooks 
to 
enhance 
quality 
teaching 
and 
learning 
in 
the 
classrooms. 
The 
main 
inputs 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
this 
subcomponent 
include 
reading 
materials 
for 
all 
general 
school 
libraries 
and 
technical 
assistance 
for 
the 
development 
of 
textbook 
policy 
and 
standards 
in 
the 
MOE. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
some 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
OSI-Azerbaijan. 
The 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
that 
reflect 
reforms 
in 
national 
standards, 
curriculum, 
and 
teaching 
methods 
is 
essential 
for 
effective 
learning 
in 
the 
classrooms. 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
not 
finance 
the 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
based 
on 
the 
new 
curricula, 
since 
the 
new 
syllabi 
will 
be 
available 
in 
2006. 
However, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
Government 
will 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
core 
textbooks 
for 
grades 
l-1 
1 
students 
based 
on 
the 
existing 
textbooks 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
its 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(namely, 
the 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Economic 
Development) 
between 
2003 
and 
2005, 
which 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
President 
on 
February 
20, 
2003.

The 
proposed 
Program 
will 
support 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
education 
and

and 
school 
improvement 
in 
selected 
districts 
under 
Phase

and 
the 
expansion 
of 
these

in 
Phases 
2 
and 
3 
of 
the 
proposed 
APL. 
Subcomponent 
1: 
Finance 
and 
Budge&w 
Reforms 
(US$O.45 
million). 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
institute 
reforms 
in 
budgeting 
and 
financing 
so 
as 
to 
gain 
efficiencies 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources. 
Development 
work 
and 
field 
testing 
will 
be 
accomplished 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts. 
The 
specific 
objectives 
of 
the 
subcomponent 
are: 
l 
Develop 
a 
conceptual 
framework 
demonstrating 
the 
linkage 
of 
information 
on 
education 
system 
outputs/outcomes 
with 
the 
anticipated 
reforrns 
in 
financing 
and 
budgeting; 
l 
Assist 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
changes 
to 
district 
and 
school 
management 
and 
operations 
to 
establish 
a 
more 
positive 
environment 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
anticipated 
reforms 
in 
financing 
and 
budgeting; 
0 
Assist 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
a 
community-based 
component 
to 
school 
operations 
to 
establish 
a 
more 
positive 
environment 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
anticipated 
reforms 
in 
financing 
and 
budgeting; 
l 
Establish 
for 
consideration 
by 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
MOF 
the 
changes 
needed 
in 
budgeting 
and 
financing 
to 
achieve 
flexibility, 
efficiency 
and 
local 
accountability; 
0 
Develop 
a 
simple 
accounting 
and 
auditing 
system 
for 
schools, 
including 
training 
for 
implementation 
and 
use; 
* 
Develop 
a 
formula-based 
budgeting 
system 
linked 
to 
the 
standard 
accounting 
system, 
including 
training 
for 
system 
implementation 
and 
use; 
and 
a 
Field-test, 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts, 
the 
newly 
established 
accounting, 
auditing 
and 
budgeting 
systems; 
based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
field 
test, 
make 
revisions 
to 
the 
systems 
for 
a 
second 
year 
of 
operation. 
Education 
reforms 
being 
pursued 
by 
the 
MOE 
are 
extensive 
and 
broad-based. 
A 
significant 
number 
of 
areas 
of 
reform 
are 
included 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP. 
This 
environment 
will 
reflect 
positively 
on 
the 
reforms 
anticipated 
in 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
because 
an 
overall 
goal 
of 
the 
reforms 
is 
to 
foster 
an 
output/outcome 
orientation 
to 
the 
education 
process. 
To 
link 
the 
larger 
reforms 
to 
the 
planned 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms, 
a 
conceptual 
framework 
will 
be 
developed. 
The 
framework 
will 
show 
linkages 
(primarily 
inputs) 
from 
the 
following 
areas 
of 
work 
under 
Phase 
1: 
development 
of 
national 
education 
standards, 
reform 
of 
curricula 
subjects 
in 
grades 
l-l 
1, 
and 
student 
assessment 
and 
examinations. 
The 
framework 
will 
focus 
on 
outputs 
to 
be 
achieved 
by 
these 
areas 
of 
work, 
rather 
than 
on 
the 
details 
of 
the 
time 
schedules 
for 
completion 
of 
the 
work. 
Other 
areas 
of 
reform 
will 
impact 
on 
the 
management 
of 
education 
at 
the 
district 
level 
and 
school 
operations, 
including: 
development 
of 
school 
rationalization 
and 
improvement 
plans 
in 
each 
of 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts, 
establishment 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
School 
Grant 
Program 
(SGP), 
design, 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Education 
Management 
Information 
System 
(EMIS) 
and 
establishment 
of 
a 
policy, 
planning 
and 
coordination 
unit 
in 
the 
MOE. 
In 
each 
of 
these 
instances, 
personnel 
(MOE, 
MOF, 
international 
and 
national 
consultants) 
working 
on 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms 
will 
establish 
proactive 
relationships 
to 
share 
information, 
and 
will 
use 
the 
information 
obtained 
from 
the 
work 
in 
these 
other 
areas 
of 
reform 
to 
impact 
their 
plans 
for 
improved 
management 
at 
the 
district 
level 
and 
improved

Specific 
technical 
work 
needs 
to 
be 
accomplished 
to 
support 
the 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms. 
Three 
major 
activities 
(and 
subordinate 
activities) 
are: 
(i) 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
basic 
accounting 
system 
for 
schools, 
including 
provision 
for 
the 
development 
of 
standards 
and 
implementation 
of 
external 
audits; 
(ii) 
derivation 
of 
the 
formula 
to 
be 
used 
in 
budgeting 
and 
financial 
allocation; 
and 
(iii) 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
continuous 
improvement 
program 
for 
all 
schools, 
making 
use 
of 
school 
improvement 
plans. 
These 
major 
activities 
will 
be 
under 
the 
direction 
of 
international 
consultants, 
with 
assistance 
from 
national 
consultants 
and 
MOE/MOF 
working 
groups 
for 
each 
activity. 
There 
will 
be 
a 
substantial 
training 
program 
at 
the 
district 
and 
school 
level 
for 
these 
activities. 
In 
late 
2005, 
a 
plan 
will 
be 
developed 
to 
field 
test 
the 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
in 
2006. 
The 
plan 
will 
specify: 
(i) 
specific 
systems 
and 
procedures 
to 
be 
field 
tested; 
(ii) 
personnel 
responsible 
for 
implementation 
and 
supervision; 
(iii) 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
activities 
to 
be 
undertaken; 
(iv) 
information 
and 
data 
to 
be 
collected 
and 
analyzed; 
and 
(v) 
safeguards 
to 
be 
enacted. 
The 
plan 
will 
be 
developed 
by 
the 
MOE 
and 
MOF, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
international 
consultants, 
and 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
MOE, 
MOF 
and 
the 
World 
Bank. 
In 
early 
2007, 
data 
from 
the 
field 
test 
will 
be 
fully 
analyzed 
and 
revisions 
made 
to 
the 
systems 
and 
procedures. 
Implementation 
Arrangements. 
The 
Head 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Economics 
and 
Finance 
of 
the 
MOE 
will 
coordinate 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
subcomponent 
in 
close 
consultation 
with 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Social 
Sector 
Finance 
of 
the 
MOE. 
They 
will 
organize 
a 
technical 
working 
group 
to 
work 
in 
conjunction 
with 
international 
and 
national 
consultants, 
to 
develop 
and 
recommend 
specific 
changes 
in 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
systems 
and 
procedures. 
The 
group 
will 
have 
representation 
from 
the 
MOE 
and 
MOF 
and 
Departments 
of 
Education 
and 
Departments 
of 
Finance 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts. 
The 
work 
will 
proceed 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
protocol 
developed 
between 
the 
MOE 
and 
MOF. 
This 
group 
will 
identify 
the 
major 
policy 
and 
procedural 
changes 
that 
need 
to 
be 
made 
to 
develop 
a 
formula-based 
approach 
to 
budgeting 
and 
financial 
allocation 
that 
foster 
flexibility, 
efficiency 
and 
local 
autonomy 
and 
accountability. 
The 
changes 
should 
be 
clearly 
linked 
to 
other 
reforms 
and 
to 
the 
community-based 
changes 
that 
are 
being 
developed 
and 
implemented. 
Subcomponent 
2: 
Rationalization 
and 
School 
Improvement 
(uS$8.42 
million). 
Over 
the 
past 
decade, 
several 
major 
factors 
have 
affected 
the 
existing 
schools 
network 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
rationalized 
so 
that 
schools 
operations 
can 
become 
more 
efficient 
and 
effective. 
These 
factors 
are: 
(a) 
changes 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
compulsory 
general 
education 
to 
11 
years; 
(b) 
population 
migration 
patterns 
that 
are 
generally 
from 
the 
rural 
to 
the 
urban 
areas, 
and 
including 
an 
out-migration 
from 
Azerbaijan; 
(c) 
human 
resource 
policies 
developed 
under 
a 
different 
system 
and 
not 
adjusted 
to 
the 
current 
system 
or 
to 
the 
current 
enrollments; 
(d) 
teacher 
movement 
within 
the 
general 
education 
system, 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
policies 
or 
recognized 
incentives, 
so 
as 
to 
create 
an 
overall 
inefficient 
supply 
and 
demand 
situation 
and 
to 
perpetuate 
imbalances 
in 
the 
rural 
areas; 
and 
(e) 
a 
lack 
of 
resources 
for 
school 
construction, 
maintenance, 
rehabilitation, 
furnishing 
and 
equipping, 
such 
that 
school 
infrastructure 
has 
suffered 
from 
and 
deteriorated 
due 
to 
long 
foregone 
maintenance 
and 
repairs. 
The 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement 
subcomponent 
will 
be 
closely 
interrelated 
with 
the 
finance 
and 
budgeting 
subcomponent 
and, 
therefore, 
there 
should 
be 
clear 
mechanisms 
of 
coordination 
between 
subcomponents 
1 
and 
2. 
These 
two 
subcomponents 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
three 
Rayons 
(districts, 
namely, 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ismayilli, 
and 
Ujar) 
which 
were 
selected 
in 
accordance 
with 
agreed 
criteria. 
Subcomponent 
2 
addresses 
the 
following 
key 
sectoral 
issues: 
(i) 
an 
inefficient 
and 
ineffective 
schools 
network, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas; 
(ii) 
inappropriate 
human 
resources 
policies 
and 
practices 
including 
inappropriate 
distribution 
and 
utilization 
of 
teachers; 
(iii) 
considerable 
deterioration 
and 
-71- 
Page  78
inadequacy 
of 
existing 
school 
buildings, 
school 
furniture, 
equipment 
and 
teaching 
aids 
in 
the 
schools; 
and 
(iv) 
inefficient 
design 
and 
educational 
standards 
for 
constructing 
and 
rehabilitating 
school 
facilities. 
The 
specific 
objectives 
of 
this 
subcomponent 
are 
to 
assist 
the 
MOE 
experiment 
an 
approach 
in 
the 
three 
districts, 
to: 
(a) 
develop 
plans 
and 
rationalize 
the 
schools 
network 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
efficiencies 
in 
school 
management 
and 
operations; 
(b) 
develop 
appropriate 
and 
cost-effective 
standards 
for 
schools; 
and 
(c) 
rehabilitate 
and 
provide 
furniture, 
basic 
equipment 
and 
teaching 
aids 
to 
selected 
schools. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
experience 
gained 
under 
Phase 
1 
would 
set 
the 
model 
for 
future 
school 
infrastructure 
programs. 
Rationalization 
of 
schools 
network. 
Prior 
to 
the 
start 
of 
any 
investment 
in 
school 
rehabilitation 
or 
equipment, 
each 
Rayon 
will 
develop 
an 
overall 
network 
rationalization 
plan. 
Based 
on 
the 
current 
situation, 
the 
Rayons 
would 
project 
medium-term 
(10 
years) 
needs 
and 
develop 
standard 
options 
for 
rationalization 
for 
individual 
schools 
and 
groups 
of 
schools 
within 
each 
district, 
in 
the 
areas 
of: 
(a) 
policy/administration; 
(b) 
human 
resources; 
and 
(c) 
improvement 
(rehabilitation) 
of 
physical 
infrastructure. 
Options 
for 
rationalization 
of 
the 
network 
will 
consider 
both 
individual 
schools 
and 
groups 
of 
schools. 
In 
consultation 
with 
the 
MOE, 
the 
Rayons 
will 
adopt 
and 
implement 
this 
plan 
during 
an 
agreed 
period. 
Rationalization 
and 
improvement 
will 
be 
guided 
by 
needs 
(physical) 
assessments, 
economic 
assessments, 
and 
social 
assessments 
that 
will 
be 
conducted 
in 
each 
district. 
The 
project 
will 
finance 
the 
development 
and 
preparation 
of 
network 
rationalization 
plans 
supported 
by 
foreign 
expertise 
(8 
staff 
months) 
and 
local 
technical 
assistance 
(16 
staff 
months) 
of 
an 
economist, 
social 
assessment 
specialist, 
and 
education 
facilities 
planning 
specialist 
services 
as 
well 
as 
training. 
This 
subcomponent 
activity 
includes 
the 
following 
tasks: 
0 
Design 
and 
conduct 
schooling 
and 
schools 
network 
needs 
assessments, 
social 
assessment, 
and 
physical 
inventory/assessments 
of 
the 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
selected 
districts. 
To 
provide 
a 
solid 
base 
of 
factual 
information 
and 
data, 
needs 
assessments 
and 
social 
assessments 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
completed 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts. 
The 
assessments 
will 
focus 
on 
current 
conditions 
and 
medium-term 
(10 
years) 
projections 
for 
student 
enrollments, 
employment 
of 
personnel 
in 
the 
districts 
and 
at 
the 
schools; 
economic 
conditions 
and 
extraordinary 
impacts 
(if 
any) 
developed 
under 
the 
sector 
reform 
strategies 
of 
the 
MOE; 
l 
Develop 
overall 
protocol 
for 
rationalization

Funds 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
schools 
under 
Phase 
1 
and 
the 
IDA 
Credit 
are 
limited 
and 
insufficient 
to 
cover 
all 
of 
the 
most 
critical 
improvement 
needs 
to 
even 
meet 
the 
minimum 
existing 
norms 
(inter 
alia, 
structural 
integrity 
of 
the 
buildings, 
safety, 
sanitation, 
electricity/heating/water, 
adequate 
teaching 
spaces, 
etc.). 
Thus, 
a 
formula 
for 
allocating 
the 
available 
Credit 
resources 
among 
the 
three 
Rayons 
was 
agreed 
with 
the 
MOE 
at 
appraisal. 
The 
formula 
uses 
student 
enrollment, 
number 
of 
schools 
and 
size 
(square 
meters) 
of 
the 
existing 
school 
infrastructure 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
school 
rehabilitation 
funds, 
with 
the 
respective 
ratios 
of 
30 
percent, 
20 
percent 
and 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
fund 
available 
resources. 
Based 
on 
the 
agreed 
and 
approved 
network 
rationalization 
plans, 
the 
MOE, 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Rayons 
and 
the 
State 
Construction 
and 
Architecture 
Commission 
(SCAC), 
will 
identify 
and 
agree 
on 
procedures 
and 
criteria 
for 
selecting 
the 
schools 
to 
be 
rehabilitated 
under 
Phase 
1, 
and 
define 
the 
most 
urgent 
rehabilitation 
work 
to 
be 
done 
in 
these 
selected 
schools. 
The 
process 
includes 
the 
following 
steps 
as 
appropriate: 
Complete 
detailed 
construction 
engineering 
surveys 
of 
selected 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
districts. 
The 
engineering 
survey 
will 
consider 
and 
use 
the 
data 
collected 
and 
developed 
for 
the 
schools 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
presidential 
decree 
of 
October 
2002. 
The 
surveys 
must 
be 
in 
sufficient 
depth 
and 
specificity 
to: 
(a) 
calculate 
the 
costs 
of 
rehabilitation; 
(b) 
contribute 
information 
to 
economic 
and 
fiscal 
analyses; 
and 
(c) 
serve 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
developing 
technical 
drawings 
and 
specifications 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
rehabilitation 
works; 
Using 
the 
rationalization 
options 
as 
the 
basis, 
agree 
on 
criteria 
for 
selecting 
the 
schools 
to 
be 
rehabilitated 
under 
the 
project. 
Among 
the 
criteria 
used 
for 
selecting 
the 
schools 
to 
be 
rehabilitated 
are: 
l 
inclusion 
of 
the 
schools 
in 
a 
school 
grouping 
for 
rationalization 
purposes, 
with 
the 
assumption 
being 
that 
the 
positive 
effects 
of 
grouping 
can 
not 
be 
achieved 
without 
the 
physical 
rehabilitation 
of 
all 
schools 
in 
the 
group; 
l 
proportionality 
of 
the 
schools 
across 
the 
three 
districts; 
l 
distribution 
of 
the 
schools 
or 
the 
school 
groupings 
within 
the 
communities 
of 
a 
pilot 
district; 
l 
severity 
of 
the 
conditions 
at 
the 
schools 
or 
the 
school 
groupings 
that 
will 
be 
improved 
by 
implementation 
of 
the 
rehabilitation; 
e 
number 
of 
students 
served 
by 
the 
school 
to 
be 
rehabilitated; 
and 
I, 
estimated 
cost 
of 
rehabilitation. 
In 
accordance 
with 
agreed 
criteria, 
select 
the 
highest 
priority 
schools 
for 
rehabilitation 
in 
each 
district; 
Within 
the 
resource 
envelope 
allocated 
to 
the 
district, 
the 
district 
would 
determine 
the 
highest 
priority 
rehabilitation 
interventions 
in 
the 
selected 
schools; 
Develop 
technical 
specifications, 
technical 
drawings 
and 
bidding 
documents 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
selected 
schools. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
school 
rehabilitation/construction 
norms, 
it 
is 
noted 
that 
construction 
material 
made 
of 
asbestos 
(primarily 
roofing 
sheets) 
can 
be 
found 
in 
almost 
all 
existing 
buildings, 
and 
that 
these 
asbestos 
materials 
are 
badly 
deteriorated 
and 
disintegrating. 
Asbestos 
materials 
pose 
serious 
health 
hazards 
to 
the 
building 
occupants 
continually 
exposed 
to 
them 
and 
pollute 
the 
environment. 
The 
MOE 
and 
the 
Rayon 
Authorities, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
SCAC 
would 
ensure 
that 
such 
asbestos 
material 
are 
removed 
in 
the 
rehabilitated 
schools 
and 
disposed 
of 
safely 
with 
the 
appropriate 
oversight 
of 
Azerbaijan’s 
environmental 
authorities. 
MOE 
would 
likewise 
ensure 
that 
no 
new 
asbestos 
material 
will 
be 
used 
in 
the 
rehabilitation/construction 
of 
schools; 
PCU 
to 
determine 
bidding 
packages 
for 
rehabilitating 
the 
schools, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
- 
73 
- 
Page  80
identified 
priorities; 
Develop 
technical 
specifications, 
and 
bidding 
documents 
for 
procurement 
of 
school 
furniture, 
basic 
equipment 
and 
teaching 
aids; 
Align 
the 
procurement 
of 
furniture, 
equipment 
and 
teaching 
aids 
with 
the 
school 
rehabilitation 
schedules; 
and 
Develop 
new 
school 
standards 
for 
general 
schools 
(e.g., 
primary 
and 
secondary 
schools) 
based 
on 
international 
experience. 
Standard 
classroom 
furniture 
(student 
desks 
and 
chairs; 
teacher 
desks 
and 
chairs; 
blackboard 
and 
bookcases), 
basic 
teaching 
equipment 
and 
aids 
will 
be 
provided 
for 
each 
rehabilitated 
school. 
The 
quantity 
of 
standard 
classroom 
furniture 
provided 
to 
each 
of 
the 
selected 
schools 
should 
only 
be 
sufficient 
to 
accommodate 
the 
actual 
highest 
number 
of 
students 
in 
OYte 
shift. 
The 
importance 
of 
this 
point 
is 
emphasized 
given 
the 
existence 
of 
large 
schools 
that 
are 
underutilized 
in 
terms 
of 
space 
(i.e., 
the 
actual 
school 
enrolment 
is 
much 
less 
than 
the 
number 
of 
students 
that 
the 
school 
can 
actually 
accommodate 
at 
a 
given 
time). 
Economies 
of 
scale 
also 
point 
out 
the 
advisability 
of 
standardizing 
the 
design 
of 
school 
furniture 
and 
the 
PCU 
undertaking 
procurement 
of 
these 
items 
centrally 
and 
in 
bulk. 
This 
project 
subcomponent 
provides 
the 
opportunity 
for 
updating/modernizing 
Azerbaijan’s 
national 
school 
building 
standards, 
such 
that 
these 
standards 
adequately 
meet 
and 
support 
Azerbaijan’s 
education 
reform 
objectives 
and 
policies. 
It 
also 
provides 
the 
opportunity 
for 
the 
MOE 
to 
have 
an 
influence 
over 
the 
reformulation 
and 
modernization 
of 
the 
existing 
school 
building 
and 
construction 
standards 
developed 
during 
the 
Soviet 
regime 
and 
which, 
today, 
are 
inefficient 
and 
largely 
inappropriate 
for 
Azerbaijan’s 
new 
curriculum 
and 
educational 
requirements. 
The 
updating 
of 
the 
national 
school 
building 
standards 
would 
be 
a 
collaborative 
and 
consultative 
effort 
between 
the 
MOE, 
educators, 
teachers, 
facilities 
planners 
and 
other 
relevant 
entities, 
including 
the 
SCAC. 
The 
school 
planning 
and 
construction 
standards 
will 
reflect 
educational/qualitative 
factors 
(e.g., 
class 
size, 
teacher-student 
ratios, 
type 
of 
subject/activity 
conducted, 
ratios 
between 
academic/non-academic 
and 
circulation 
spaces, 
etc.) 
and 
technical 
factors 
(e.g., 
structural, 
seismic, 
heat 
and 
mechanical 
systems, 
water 
and 
sanitation, 
health 
and 
environmental 
safety, 
etc.). 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
new 
school 
design 
and 
building 
norms 
would 
be 
completed 
and 
submitted 
to 
the 
appropriate 
authorities 
for 
approval 
and 
adoption 
nationwide 
before 
the 
end 
of 
Phase 
1. 
The 
approved 
design 
standards 
would 
be 
used 
for 
building 
some 
prototype 
schools 
during 
Phase 
2 
of 
the 
Program. 
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
new 
standards 
would 
be 
supported 
by 
both 
foreign 
and 
national 
architectural/engineering 
expertise. 
The 
project 
will 
finance 
the 
services 
of 
a 
consultant 
architect/education 
facilities 
planner 
to 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
develop 
the 
school 
standards.

In 
a 
knowledge-based 
economy, 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
quality 
and 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
labor 
force 
of 
a 
country. 
As 
indicated 
above, 
there 
are 
a 
very 
few 
schools 
equipped 
with 
information 
technology 
classrooms 
in 
the 
general 
education 
system 
of 
Azerbaijan. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
MOE 
plans 
to 
introduce 
information 
technology 
in 
the 
general 
education 
curriculum 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
computer 
literacy 
and 
training 
of 
general 
education 
graduates. 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
support 
the 
introduction 
of 
ICT 
classrooms 
in 
about 
15 
general 
schools 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts 
to 
provide 
computer 
literacy 
instruction 
and 
use 
ICT 
as 
a 
learning 
tool 
in 
the 
general 
education 
curriculum 
in 
order 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
model 
for 
other 
schools, 
which 
can 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
next 
phases. 
(It 
was 
also 
agreed 
that 
this 
component 
will 
support 
the 
provision 
of 
training 
and 
software 
for 
the 
20 
additional 
schools, 
which 
were 
provided 
some 
ICT 
equipment 
under 
the

the 
development 
of 
a 
policy 
paper 
and 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the

it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
provision 
of 
ICT 
classrooms 
will 
be 
expanded 
in 
the 
Second 
and 
Third 
Phases 
of 
the 
Program

the 
procurement 
of 
hardware, 
software,

for 
the 
provision 
of 
ICT

The 
list 
of 
schools 
will 
be 
selected 
according 
to 
the 
criteria 
agreed 
with 
IDA 
based 
on

The 
specific 
objectives 
of 
this

are 
to: 
I) 
Review 
and

Provide 
teachers 
(a 
total 
of 
70 
teachers 
in 
35 
schools) 
with 
training

and 
install 
them 
in 
the 
computer 
laboratories 
in 
15 
general 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts. 
(Also 
procure 
the 
software 
and 
install 
them 
in 
the 
computer 
laboratories 
in 
the 
20 
pilot 
schools 
financed 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL); 
a 
Carry 
out 
an 
independent 
evaluation 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
ICT 
subcomponent; 
and 
* 
Develop 
and 
establish 
medium-term 
policy 
on 
ICT. 
Informatics 
was 
introduced 
into 
the 
curricula 
of 
the 
general 
schools 
in 
around 
1985. 
In 
the 
past 
17 
years, 
the 
curricula 
has 
been 
reviewed 
and 
revised, 
with 
the 
last 
revision 
being 
in 
2000. 
Also 
in 
the 
U-year 
period, 
computers 
and 
software 
have 
been 
introduced 
in 
some 
general 
schools 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
has 
been 
provided 
in 
the 
area 
of 
informatics. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
approximately 
less 
than 
one 
percent 
of 
the 
general 
schools 
have 
computers 
and 
software 
that 
can 
be 
used 
in 
the 
inforrnatics 
program. 
As 
a 
result, 
instruction 
in 
informatics 
remains 
inadequate 
and 
insufficient 
to 
prepare 
students 
for 
a 
modern, 
democratic 
society 
and 
an 
open 
market 
economy. 
Also, 
use 
of 
the 
ICT 
has 
not 
been 
introduced 
for 
other 
subjects. 
The 
Project 
would 
support 
the 
provision 
of 
hardware 
and 
software 
for 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
schools 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis 
and 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
ICT 
component 
to 
ensure 
that 
Azerbaijan 
enhances 
computers 
skills 
and 
learning 
by 
using 
information 
technology 
as 
a 
learning 
tool 
in 
the 
general 
education 
curriculum. 
Based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
the 
Project, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
Government 
(or 
a 
follow 
up 
project) 
may 
extend 
the 
provision 
of 
information 
technology 
in 
general 
education. 
The 
list 
of 
schools 
will 
be 
selected 
based 
on 
the 
criteria 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank 
during 
project 
preparation. 
The 
Director 
of 
the 
Baku 
Computer 
College 
will

coordination/implementation 
of 
the 
pilot

(details 
are 
provided

In 
addition, 
the 
MOE 
will 
need 
to 
consider 
at 
least 
the 
following 
major 
factors 
when 
determining 
the 
packages 
for 
the 
bidding: 
(a) 
capacity 
to 
manage 
the 
rehabilitation 
contracts; 
(b) 
availability 
of 
prospective 
bidders; 
(c) 
political 
and

factors 
of

schedule; 
and 
(d) 
plans 
for 
students

during 
the 
rehabilitation 
process. 
The 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(EMP) 
to 
be 
enacted 
during 
rehabilitation 
is 
provided 
in 
the

Surveys 
will 
be 
conducted 
at 
the 
150 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
with

Rationalization 
is 
conceptualized 
in 
the 
broadest 
terms 
possible 
for 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
and 
will 
encompass 
at 
least: 
(a) 
policy 
and 
administration 
factors, 
including 
structural 
considerations 
for 
attendance 
patterns 
and 
movement 
of 
students; 
(b) 
human 
resources 
factors, 
including 
assignment 
practices, 
ratios, 
basis 
for 
compensation, 
duties 
performed 
and 
similar 
considerations; 
and 
(c) 
school 
rehabilitation 
to 
acceptable 
standards. 
Because 
these 
are 
complex 
considerations, 
and 
because 
there 
are 
political, 
social 
and 
educational 
risks 
involved 
in 
the 
process 
of 
rationalization 
and 
school 
improvement, 
very 
close 
interaction 
and 
collaboration 
between 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
Rayon 
authorities 
need 
to 
be 
established 
and 
maintained. 
A 
Coordinator 
for 
the 
Rationalization 
and 
School 
Rehabilitation 
component 
has 
been 
designated 
and 
will 
be 
assisted 
by 
an 
architect 
from 
the 
MOE. 
Each 
of 
the 
three 
Rayons 
have 
already 
formed 
their 
respective 
Working/Implementation 
Groups 
for 
this 
component 
headed 
by 
the 
District 
Education 
Administrator. 
Since 
the 
rationalization 
activities 
are 
new 
to 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
Rayons, 
the 
project 
will 
finance 
an 
aggregate 
eight 
(8) 
staff 
months 
of 
the 
services 
of 
international 
experts 
(economist, 
social 
assessment 
specialist, 
and 
education 
facilities 
planner/architect) 
and 
12 
staff 
months 
of 
services 
of 
local 
specialists 
in 
the 
same/related 
fields. 
The 
consultants 
would 
help 
develop 
a 
protocol 
for 
the 
rationalization 
activities, 
as 
well 
as 
assist 
the 
MOE 
in 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
network 
rationalization 
proposals. 
The 
protocol 
will 
identify 
the 
overall 
processes 
to 
be 
implemented, 
the 
guidelines 
to 
be 
used 
to 
determine 
priorities 
for 
the 
results 
of 
developing 
the 
various 
options, 
and 
the 
safeguards 
for 
students, 
parents, 
socially 
vulnerable 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
(including 
IDP 
families 
living 
in 
parts 
of 
the 
seven 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
districts). 
The 
protocol 
will 
be 
subjected 
to 
internal 
and 
external 
stakeholders’ 
reviews.

Upgrading 
Schooling 
in 
Less 
Advantaged 
Rayons: 
School 
Grant 
Program 
(SGP) 
Azerbaijan 
has 
recently 
experienced 
positive 
economic 
growth. 
Most 
of 
the 
growth 
has 
been 
in 
the 
oil 
sector 
and 
the 
benefits 
are 
still 
to 
trickle 
down 
to 
a 
broader 
segment 
of 
the 
population. 
Preliminary 
results 
from 
the 
recent 
Poverty 
Assessment 
have 
indicated 
that 
access 
to 
basic 
services 
has 
deteriorated 
and, 
in 
particular, 
rural 
areas 
have 
inadequate 
access 
to 
these 
services, 
including 
inadequate 
infrastructures. 
Although 
general 
education 
schools 
are 
widely 
available 
throughout 
the 
country, 
a 
disturbing 
trend 
of 
a 
widening 
differentials 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
services 
has 
started 
to 
appear 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
basic 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials, 
deteriorating 
physical 
conditions 
of 
schools, 
and 
poor 
teacher 
qualifications. 
Rural 
schools 
and 
schools 
in 
relatively 
poor 
districts 
seldom 
have 
resources 
to 
supplement 
the 
limited 
Government 
budget. 
Improving 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
process 
and 
maintaining 
the 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
quality 
education 
will 
be 
a 
continuing 
challenge. 
The 
proposed 
School 
Grant 
Program 
(SGP) 
aims 
to 
supplement 
the 
limited 
resources 
of 
specific 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
poor 
are 
not 
discriminated 
from 
benefiting 
from 
quality 
education. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
SGP 
intends 
to 
provide 
supplemental 
financing 
to 
schools 
in 
the 
three 
selected 
districts 
to 
upgrade 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching 
and 
learning. 
These 
three 
districts 
all 
have 
lower 
average 
income 
than 
more 
affluent 
areas 
such 
as 
Baku. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
relatively 
poorer 
students 
will 
be 
reached 
through 
the 
Grant 
Program 
according 
to 
the 
schools’ 
own 
assessment 
and 
selected 
district 
department’s 
perception 
of 
priority 
needs. 
Each 
school 
grant 
cannot 
be 
more 
than 
US$5,000 
or 
equivalent, 
and 
will 
have 
to 
be 
complemented 
with 
the 
beneficiary 
school 
and 
community 
resources. 
Selection 
Procedures. 
The 
SGP 
will 
be 
awarded 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis 
based 
on 
proposals 
submitted 
by 
the 
schools 
(in 
close 
consultation 
with 
the 
Parent-Teacher 
Association) 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts. 
-

Page  83
Each 
proposal 
must 
be 
completely 
implemented 
in 
one 
year. 
The 
selection 
procedures 
are 
as 
follows: 
Prior 
to 
the 
beginning 
of 
each 
school 
year, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
call 
for 
submission 
of 
proposals 
from 
the 
schools 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
call 
for 
the 
submission 
of 
proposals 
will 
be 
conducted 
3 
times 
prior 
to 
the 
completion 
of 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
Program. 
Each 
school 
is 
entitled 
to 
submit 
one 
proposal 
per 
year 
provided 
the 
eligibility 
criteria 
are 
satisfied. 
Proposals 
will 
be 
submitted 
and 
evaluated 
at 
the 
district 
level 
and 
ranked 
before 
these 
are 
submitted 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
for 
final 
review 
and 
selection. 
Once 
a 
proposal 
is 
selected 
and 
awarded, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
forward 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
approved 
proposal 
to 
the 
PCU 
and 
credit 
proceeds 
can 
then 
be 
allocated 
to 
finance

The 
grant 
must 
address 
specific 
education-related 
obstacles 
to 
an 
improved 
learning 
environment. 
The 
learning 
environment 
can 
be 
either 
inside 
or 
outside 
the 
classrooms 
but 
within 
the 
school. 
The 
grant 
must 
demonstrate 
a 
clear 
rationale 
that 
indicates 
an 
improved 
learning 
environment 
either 
in 
the 
school 
or 
classroom 
based 
on 
world-wide 
experience 
of 
similar 
activities 
or 
programs. 
The 
grant 
must 
indicate 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
student 
beneficiaries 
as 
a

related 
to 
improve 
learning. 
The 
higher 
the 
number 
of 
student-beneficiaries 
indicated 
in 
the 
proposal, 
the 
higher 
the 
priority 
of 
award. 
The 
spirit 
of 
the 
Grant 
is 
to

schools 
from 
low 
income 
families, 
not 
those 
from 
elite 
and 
relatively 
affluent 
families. 
The 
proposal 
should 
involve 
the 
consultation 
and 
participation 
with 
key 
stakeholders 
(e.g., 
parents, 
teachers, 
community) 
and 
that 
the 
participatory 
process 
should 
be 
described

US$2.34 
million 
Management, 
Planning, 
and 
Monitoring 
Capacity 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
subcomponent 
is 
to 
strengthen 
planning, 
management, 
monitoring 
capacity 
at 
the 
central 
MOE, 
local 
education 
authorities 
and 
school 
levels. 
While 
the 
proposed 
Project 
does 
not 
attempt 
to 
undertake 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
of 
education 
management, 
it 
will 
build 
capacity 
at 
the 
central 
and 
local 
levels 
to 
gradually 
implement 
changes. 
Under 
Phase 
1, 
the 
proposed 
Program 
would 
finance 
(i) 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
student 
assessment 
system; 
(ii) 
the 
design 
and 
establishment 
of 
an 
effective 
education 
management 
information 
system 
(EMIS) 
at 
the 
MOE 
and 
selected 
districts; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
development 
of 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE 
and 
pilot 
districts. 
This 
will 
be 
done 
through 
several 
major 
interventions 
through 
the 
following 
subcomponents: 
Subcomponent 
1: 
Establishment 
of 
a 
New 
Svstem 
of 
Student 
Assessment: 
fuS$L12 
million). 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
in 
two 
main 
areas, 
both 
to 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
a 
newly 
established 
National 
Center 
for 
Student 
Assessment 
(NCSA): 
(a) 
sample-based 
student 
assessment 
and 
student 
examinations; 
and 
(b) 
school-based 
student 
assessment 
system. 
This 
subcomponent 
is 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
following 
key 
sector 
issues: 
(i) 
current 
roles 
of 
teachers 
as 
conveyers 
of 
information 
without 
defined 
responsibilities 
or 
for 
diagnostic 
and 
prescriptive 
use 
of 
student 
assessment 
for 
improving 
teaching 
and 
learning; 
(ii) 
assessment, 
tests 
and 
examinations 
not 
clearly 
based 
on 
curricula; 
curricula 
and 
assessment 
lack 
clear 
standards; 
(iii) 
personnel 
lack 
experience 
to 
develop 
sample-based 
assessments 
and 
quality 
examinations; 
(iv) 
inadequate 
policy 
at 
the 
MOE 
for 
student 
assessment 
and 
examinations; 
and 
(v) 
weak 
administrative 
structure 
to 
plan 
and 
conduct 
national 
assessments 
and 
examinations. 
The 
specific 
objectives 
of 
the 
subcomponent 
are: 
Sample-based 
* 
student 
assessment 
and 
student 
exarninations 
Revised 
policy 
statement 
developed 
and 
adapted 
for 
student 
assessment 
and 
examination 
in 
the 
MOE; 
NCSA 
established 
within 
the 
MOE 
and 
functioning 
for 
sample-based 
student 
assessment 
and 
student 
examinations 
(and 
school-based 
student 
assessment); 
Five 
staff 
appointed 
by 
the 
MOE 
to 
work 
in 
the 
NCSA 
and 
all 
staff 
receive 
training; 
NCSA 
develops 
and 
administers 
national 
sample-based 
student 
assessment 
for 
two 
subjects 
in 
grade 
4 
and 
9; 
NCSA 
disseminate 
the 
results 
of 
the 
assessment 
at 
the 
national, 
district 
and 
school 
levels 
and 
draw 
policy 
lessons; 
and 
NCSA 
develops 
and 
conducts 
trial 
administration 
for 
national 
examination 
of 
grade 
11

NCSA 
implements 
new 
system 
for 
school-based 
student 
assessment, 
as 
developed 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL; 
and 
NCSA 
develops 
3 
teachers’ 
guides 
for 
use 
in 
the 
school-based 
student 
assessment 
system. 
The 
activities 
planned 
under 
the 
ERP 
for 
student 
assessment 
are 
as 
follows: 
Sample-based 
student 
assessment 
and 
student 
examinations. 
Under 
the 
education 
sector 
reforms 
and 
strategy 
promulgated 
in 
mid-1999, 
the 
GOA 
has 
committed 
to 
extensive 
reforms 
of 
compulsory 
general 
education, 
grades 
l-11. 
The 
EIW 
contributes 
to 
these 
efforts 
by 
providing 
assistance 
and 
inputs 
in 
all 
major 
areas 
of 
general 
education: 
national 
standards 
and 
curricula 
reforms, 
teacher 
education 
and 
training, 
textbooks 
and 
library 
materials, 
ICT, 
budgeting 
and 
financing 
reforms, 
schools 
network 
rationalization 
and 
improvement, 
and 
management. 
Complementary, 
especially 
with 
regard 
to 
national 
standards, 
curricula 
reforms, 
and 
teacher 
education 
and 
training, 
will 
be 
reforms 
and 
development 
in 
student 
assessment 
and 
student 
examinations. 
The 
MOE 
is 
committed 
to 
student-centered 
schools, 
to 
the 
continued 
improvement 
of 
the 
teaching/learning 
environments 
in 
the 
schools, 
and 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
a 
general 
education 
that 
is 
of 
significant 
importance 
in 
contemporary, 
democratic 
society. 
Many 
factors 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
MOE’s 
capability 
of 
realizing 
these 
commitments 
perhaps 
foremost 
of 
which 
will 
be 
an 
assessment 
and 
examination 
approach 
(system) 
that 
can 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
MOE 
using 
the 
availability 
of 
information 
and 
data 
for 
continued 
feedback 
and 
improvement 
of 
education 
and 
the 
education 
system. 
To 
guide 
the 
overall 
reforms 
and 
development 
in 
student 
assessment, 
a 
revised 
policy 
statement 
will 
be 
developed 
that 
will 
be 
included 
in 
school-based 
and 
center-based 
assessment. 
The 
policy 
statement 
will 
address 
linkages 
to 
national 
standards, 
curricula 
reforms, 
textbook 
development 
and 
teacher 
education 
and 
training. 
Critically, 
it 
will 
also 
address 
how 
the 
management 
of 
the 
MOE 
will 
be 
able 
to 
make 
assessment 
and 
examination 
information 
and 
data 
to 
address 
the 
learning/teaching 
issues 
and 
continually 
develop 
the 
assessment 
capacity 
within 
the 
MOE 
to 
improve 
education. 
The 
policy 
statement 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
internal 
and 
external 
stakeholder 
reviews. 
To 
implement 
the 
revised 
student 
assessment 
and 
examination 
policy, 
the 
NCSA 
will 
be 
established 
within 
the 
MOE. 
The 
PIP 
contains 
the 
staffing, 
equipment 
and 
other 
information 
for 
the 
NCSA. 
As 
assisted 
by 
international 
and 
national 
consultants, 
development 
of 
the 
NCSA 
will 
include 
the: 
(a) 
development 
of 
a 
mission 
statement; 
(b) 
elaboration 
of 
organizational 
structure; 
(c) 
development

a 
facility; 
(f) 
training 
for 
initial

and 
(g) 
initial 
work 
plan. 
The 
initial 
three 
year 
work 
plan 
for 
the 
NCSA 
will 
include 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
national 
a 
sample-based 
student 
assessment 
for 
grades 
4 
and 
9. 
Key 
activities 
include: 
(a) 
determination 
of 
the 
appropriate 
curricula 
framework 
for 
assessment 
development; 
(b) 
human 
resources, 
in 
addition 
to

and 
trial 
administration 
of 
a 
grade 
11 
examination. 
Most 
activities 
that 
need 
to 
be 
accomplished 
are 
comparable 
to 
those 
stated 
above, 
with 
additional 
attention 
given 
to 
developing 
an 
overall 
specification 
for 
the 
examination, 
taking 
full 
account 
of 
the 
curricula 
reforms 
and 
attention 
to 
logistics.

This 
subcomponent 
will 
also 
finance 
Azerbaijan’s 
participation 
in 
the 
OECD 
Prograrnrne 
for 
International 
Student 
Assessment 
(PISA), 
including 
technical 
assistance, 
training 
and 
goods 
(i.e.,

the 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
of 
15year 
old 
students 
in 
participating 
OECD 
and 
non-member 
countries. 
It 
assesses 
how 
far 
students 
near 
the 
end 
of 
compulsory 
education 
have 
acquired 
some 
of 
the 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
that 
are 
essential 
for 
full 
participation 
in 
society, 
and 
provides 
internationally

Arrangements. 
The 
Director 
of 
the 
newly 
established 
NCSA 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
this 
subcomponent 
and 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
small 
group 
of 
professional 
staff, 
including 
an 
international 
consultant 
as 
a 
mentor. 
Until 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Center, 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
General 
Education 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Center. 
Subcomponent 
2: 
Establishment 
of 
Education 
Mananement 
Information 
System 
(EMIS) 
(us$O. 
70 
million). 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
design, 
test, 
install 
and

districts 
(i.e., 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ismayilli, 
Ujar, 
Baku 
City 
(10 
rayons) 
and

and 
institutions 
integral

This 
subcomponent 
is 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
following 
key 
sector 
issues: 
“Manual 
databases” 
in 
the 
MOE 
have 
the 
following 
deficiencies 
with 
regard 
to 
efficient 
operations 
and 
management: 
labor-intensive, 
slow 
for 
data 
aggregation 
and 
difficult 
for 
data 
analysis, 
time 
consuming, 
made 
without 
any 
practical 
possibility 
to 
check 
data 
validity, 
and 
only 
able 
to 
provide 
limited 
information; 
There 
is 
no 
centralized 
policy 
with 
regard 
to 
information 
(data) 
gathered 
(and 
reported) 
for 
the 
databases; 
Equipment 
for 
handling 
information 
and 
data 
is 
very 
limited, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
technical 
support 
for 
its 
maintenance; 
At 
the 
MOE 
(and 
in 
the 
districts) 
there 
is 
no 
expertise 
or 
experience 
for 
EMIS 
implementation 
and 
management; 
and 
no 
responsible 
department 
or 
unit; 
There 
is 
a 
real 
demand 
and 
interest 
for 
EMIS 
at 
the 
MOE, 
districts 
and 
related 
institutions; 
the 
reform 
strategy 
of 
the 
MOE 
stresses 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
an 
EMIS; 
and 
No 
current 
or 
anticipated 
project 
or 
international 
donor 
is 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
an 
EMIS 
within 
the 
MOE. 
Since 
the 
MOE 
has 
no 
designated 
unit 
for 
EMIS, 
two 
(2) 
initial 
development 
tasks 
will 
be 
critical, 
namely: 
(a) 
the 
establishment 
by 
the 
MOE 
of 
an 
EMIS 
Unit 
(EMISU), 
and 
(b) 
the 
establishment 
and 
adoption 
of 
an 
EMIS 
policy. 
Due 
to 
the 
development 
design 
for 
the 
EMIS 
under 
the 
ERP, 
at 
least 
four 
personnel 
with 
adequate 
other 
resources 
should 
be 
initially 
assigned 
to 
the 
EMISU. 
The 
policy 
statement, 
developed 
and 
adapted, 
is 
needed 
to 
lend 
credibility 
to 
its 
efforts. 
Since 
the 
EMIS 
will 
be 
designed 
initially 
to 
augment 
and 
replace 
“manual 
databases” 
the 
policy 
statement 
will 
need 
to 
address 
how 
this 
is 
to 
be 
done, 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
processes 
and 
timelines, 
and 
it 
needs 
to 
demonstrate, 
since 
development 
during 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP 
does 
not 
provide 
for 
installation 
and 
training 
at 
the 
school 
level, 
how 
the 
manual 
systems 
of 
the 
schools 
will 
interface 
with 
the 
EMIS 
subsystems 
at 
the 
district 
and 
MOE 
levels. 
Also, 
since 
the 
design 
of 
the 
EMIS 
allows 
for 
installation 
and 
access 
from 
other 
agencies, 
i.e., 
IEP, 
the 
access 
hierarchy 
for 
the 
overall 
EMIS 
needs 
to 
be 
addressed 
at 
the 
policy 
level. 
The 
operative 
document 
for 
further 
design, 
development, 
testing, 
installation 
and 
operations 
of 
the 
EMIS 
is 
the 
EMIS 
Master 
Plan. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
the 
sub-sector 
study 
will 
be 
modified, 
updated 
and 
used 
as 
the 
EMIS 
Master 
Plan. 
This 
would 
be 
accomplished 
by 
the 
EMISU 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
international 
and 
national 
consultants. 
A 
key 
feature 
of 
the 
sub-sector 
study, 
and 
as 
a 
follow-on 
the 
EMIS 
Master 
Plan, 
is 
the 
establishment 
and 
utilization 
of 
the 
EMIS 
Steering 
Committee 
(SC). 
At 
the 
time 
of 
work 
on 
the 
EMIS 
Master 
Plan, 
the 
SC 
will 
be 
constituted 
by 
the 
MOE. 
Once 
in 
place, 
the 
SC 
will 
have 
major 
responsibilities 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Master 
Plan. 
The 
major 
tasks 
of 
the 
SC 
are 
the: 
(a) 
assessment 
of 
the 
progress 
of 
design 
and 
development 
of 
the 
EMIS; 
(b) 
establishment 
of 
recommendations 
for 
on-going 
and 
additional 
EMIS 
design 
and 
development; 
(c) 
evaluation 
of 
any 
recommendations 
to 
higher 
levels 
in 
the 
MOE 
for 
decisions; 
and 
(d) 
representation 
of 
the 
MOE 
to 
various 
regional 
and 
national 
authorities 
developing 
systems 
comparable 
to 
the 
EMIS. 
Equipment 
and 
software 
(for 
database 
development 
and 
use) 
is 
critical 
for 
testing, 
installation 
and 
operations 
of 
the 
EMIS 
and 
its 
subsystems. 
It 
will 
also 
be 
important 
to 
have 
the 
equipment 
installed 
so 
that 
personnel 
can 
receive 
timely 
training. 
Due 
to 
the 
time 
required, 
early 
in 
the 
development 
period 
for 
the 
EMIS, 
technical 
specifications 
and 
bidding 
documents 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
the 
equipment 
and 
software 
(and 
the 
services 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
wired 
network). 
The 
equipment 
and 
software 
will 
be 
procured 
and 
installed 
in 
accordance 
with 
World 
Bank 
guidelines 
and 
procedures.

By 
design 
the 
first 
subsystem 
of 
the 
EMIS 
will 
be 
school 
mapping 
(SM). 
SM 
has 
been 
operationally 
defined 
as: 
“a 
national 
school 
survey 
(and 
the 
resultant 
database) 
designed 
to 
collect 
(and 
make) 
available 
(basic) 
information 
about 
school 
functioning, 
students, 
staff 
(teachers 
and 
non-teaching 
staff), 
textbooks, 
equipment, 
furniture, 
building 
(conditions) 
and 
to 
provide 
a 
procedure 
to 
implement 
a 
regular 
(annual) 
updating 
of 
the 
data.” 
As 
part 
of 
establishing 
the 
SM 
subsystem, 
a 
specific 
school 
codification 
approach 
will 
be 
established. 
The 
current 
system 
for 
districts 
and 
schools 
will 
be 
modified 
and 
used. 
As 
noted 
above, 
this 
will 
take 
close 
policy 
coordination 
because 
care 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
a 
system-wide 
adoption 
of 
the 
new 
approach, 
without 
creating 
an 
unusable 
situation 
for 
current 
and 
past 
information, 
data, 
reports 
and 
documents. 
Also 
key 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
SM 
subsystem 
will 
be 
the 
design, 
distribution 
and 
handling 
of 
the 
questionnaires 
for 
the 
school 
mapping 
survey. 
Critical 
steps 
in 
this 
process 
will 
be 
the 
logistics 
of 
distribution, 
full 
verification 
of 
all 
information 
and 
the 
correction 
of 
any 
errors 
(at 
the 
district 
and/or 
school 
levels). 
The 
essential 
activities 
for 
design, 
development, 
testing, 
installation 
and 
operations 
of 
the 
SM 
subsystem, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
international 
and 
national 
consultants, 
will 
be: 
(a) 
program 
analysis; 
(b) 
program 
design; 
(c) 
development 
of 
program 
for 
data-handling; 
(d) 
data-handling; 
(e) 
development 
of 
program 
for 
the 
data 
querying 
system; 
(f) 
program 
diffusion 
to 
MOE; 
(g) 
program 
diffusion 
to 
IEP; 
(h) 
program 
diffusion 
to 
all 
districts; 
and 
(i) 
program 
and 
data 
base 
maintenance. 
Following 
selection 
by 
the 
MOE 
and 
EMISU, 
the 
second 
and 
third 
subsystems 
will 
be 
designed, 
developed, 
tested, 
installed 
and 
operated 
by 
implementing 
these 
same 
activities. 
A 
comprehensive 
training 
program 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
support 
the 
development 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
EMIS 
at 
the 
MOE, 
related 
institutions 
and 
districts. 
Such 
a 
program 
is 
presented 
and 
described 
in 
the 
PIP. 
The 
MOE 
will 
be 
assisted, 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ESRP, 
to 
activate 
and 
implement 
the 
plan. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
design, 
installation 
and 
operations 
of 
the 
EMIS 
system 
and 
equipment 
maintenance 
needs 
and 
requirements 
will 
be 
monitored 
and 
assessed. 
Based 
on 
the 
monitoring 
and 
assessment 
results, 
the 
needs 
and 
requirements 
will 
be 
met 
by: 
(a) 
additional 
training 
for 
appropriate 
personnel; 
(b) 
assignment 
of 
additional 
personnel 
to 
the 
MOE, 
related 
institutions 
and 
districts; 
and/or 
(c) 
procurement 
of 
maintenance 
services 
on 
the 
contract. 
This 
component 
will 
finance 
the 
provision 
of: 
(i) 
goods 
(e.g., 
equipment, 
software); 
and 
(ii) 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
EMIS 
at 
the 
national 
and 
selected 
districts, 
and 
in 
its 
use 
in 
policy 
analysis 
and 
planning. 
Monitoring 
System 
and 
School 
Reports. 
Management 
personnel, 
as 
envisaged 
by 
the 
MOE’s 
sector 
reform. 
strategy 
and 
as 
planned 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP, 
must 
become 
proficient 
at 
using 
information 
and 
data 
to 
engage 
in 
proactive 
and 
active 
management. 
The 
EMIS, 
as 
described 
in 
the 
subcomponent 
(ii) 
above, 
will 
be 
a 
major 
tool 
in 
this 
regard. 
In 
addition, 
the 
MOE 
will 
be 
assisted 
to 
revise 
and 
update 
its 
monitoring 
system 
and 
basic 
school 
reports. 
A 
survey 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
conducted 
to 
review 
and 
gather 
information 
on 
current 
monitoring 
activities. 
Basic 
school 
reports 
completed 
at 
the 
school 
and 
district 
levels 
will 
also 
be 
collected 
and 
reviewed. 
The 
monitoring 
and 
report 
information 
will 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
reforms 
being 
conducted 
in 
EMIS, 
assessment 
and 
financing 
and 
budgeting. 
Based 
on 
these 
reviews 
and 
comparisons, 
a 
revised 
monitoring 
system 
will 
be 
developed, 
including 
considerations 
for 
self-assessment, 
reporting, 
reviews, 
external 
monitors 
and 
performance 
management. 
A 
MOPP 
will 
be 
developed 
to 
accompany 
the 
new 
monitoring 
system. 
As 
an 
accountability 
measure, 
the 
new 
monitoring 
system 
will 
be 
cross-walked 
into 
existing 
practices 
and 
planned 
functions 
under 
the 
reforms. 
The 
new 
system 
will 
be 
field-tested 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
districts. 
As 
complementary 
to 
the 
new 
monitoring 
system 
and 
the 
development 
and 
installation 
of 
the 
EMIS, 
selected 
schools 
reports 
will 
be 
reviewed. 
In 
these 
instances, 
the 
revisions 
will 
have 
computer-compatible

formats 
and 
procedures 
for 
developing 
the 
reports 
will 
also 
be 
written. 
The 
new 
reports 
will 
be 
field-tested 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts. 
Implementation 
Arrangements. 
The 
Director 
of 
the 
newly 
established 
Education 
Management 
Information 
System 
Unit 
within 
the 
MOE 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
coordination 
and 
implementation 
of 
this 
subcomponent 
and 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
one 
national 
and 
one 
international 
consultant 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
Project. 
Until 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Unit, 
the 
Director 
of 
the 
Baku 
Computer 
College 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
preparation 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
component. 
Subcomponent 
3: 
Management 
and 
Planning 
Capacitv 
(US$O.51 
million). 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
assist 
the 
MOE 
to 
improve 
its 
management 
and 
policy 
analysis 
capacity. 
This 
subcomponent 
is 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
following 
key 
sector 
issues: 
(i) 
approaches 
that 
concentrate 
authority 
and 
responsibilities 
at 
the 
MOE 
and 
not 
in 
the 
districts 
or 
at 
the 
schools; 
(ii) 
management/organizational 
structure 
of 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
IEP 
are 
ineffective; 
(iii) 
lack 
of 
personnel 
with 
adequate 
training 
and 
expertise 
in 
policy, 
planning 
and 
management; 
and 
(iv) 
lack 
of 
planning 
and 
policy 
analysis 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOE. 
The 
specific 
objectives 
of 
the 
subcomponent 
are: 
Design 
and 
conduct 
survey 
of 
managers 
in 
key 
areas, 
e.g. 
planning, 
performance 
management, 
performance 
appraisal, 
financial 
administration; 
Develop 
skills 
and 
competency 
profiles 
for 
selected 
managers 
at 
MOE, 
pilot 
district 
and 
school 
(within 
pilot 
districts) 
levels; 
Select, 
procure, 
translate, 
re-print 
and 
distribute 
professional 
materials 
for 
the 
management 
skills 
development 
programs; 
Develop 
competency-based 
management 
skills 
development 
program 
for 
selected 
managers; 
Schedule, 
implement 
and 
monitor 
competency-based 
management 
skills 
development 
program 
for 
selected 
managers; 
Determine 
an 
appropriate 
future 
role 
for 
monitoring 
in 
the 
MOE; 
develop 
a 
system 
and 
field-test 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts; 
Review 
basic 
schools 
reports 
(at 
the 
district 
and 
school 
levels); 
develop 
a 
rationale 
for 
revision; 
review 
the 
reports 
and 
field-tests 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts; 
Design 
and 
conduct 
an 
organizational/management 
review 
(for 
a 
sample 
of 
MOE 
departments 
and

Competency 
based 
management 
skills 
development 
program. 
Training 
and 
professional 
development 
of 
managers 
at 
the 
MOE, 
district 
and 
school 
levels 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
priority 
under 
the 
ERP. 
The 
sub-sector 
study 
provides 
background 
and 
detail 
of 
the 
present 
situation 
and 
provides 
recommendations 
and 
plans 
associated 
with 
the 
reforms. 
Under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP 
a 
competency-based 
management 
skills 
development 
program 
will 
be 
designed, 
developed 
and 
implemented. 
To 
complement 
work 
in 
the 
other 
subcomponents, 
the 
program 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
areas 
of 
planning, 
performance 
management, 
performance 
appraisal 
and 
financial 
administration. 
Program 
development 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Head, 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Personnel 
Administration 
in 
the 
MOE. 
The 
program 
will 
target 
component 
coordinators 
and 
a 
group 
of 
about 
20 
managers 
selected 
from 
MOE 
departments. 
In 
addition, 
a 
series 
of 
management 
development 
programs 
will 
be 
organized 
for 
rayon 
education 
officials 
(about 
160 
officials) 
to 
strengthen 
education 
management 
and 
planning 
capacity 
at 
the 
rayon 
level 
and 
to 
expose 
rayon 
officials 
to 
new 
management 
and 
planning 
techniques 
and 
education 
reforms 
supported 
under 
the 
Project. 
A 
survey 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
administered 
to 
identify 
skills 
of 
the 
participants 
and 
training 
needs. 
A 
skills 
profile 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
each 
participant 
and 
also 
a 
competency 
profile 
for 
the 
participant’s 
positions. 
The 
competency 
profiles 
will 
reflect 
the 
current 
situation 
and 
projections 
based 
on 
the 
reforms 
planned. 
The 
competency 
profile 
will 
be 
submitted 
for 
an 
internal 
and 
external 
stakeholders’ 
review. 
A 
three-component 
training 
program 
will 
be 
developed: 
didactic 
(consisting 
of 
seminars 
and 
workshop 
training 
sessions); 
distance 
education 
video-based 
and 
on-the-job, 
mentoring. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
development 
of 
training 
programs, 
at 
least 
five 
printed 
documents 
(not 
limited 
to 
books) 
will 
be 
identified 
and 
selected 
as 
professional 
references. 
The 
materials 
will 
be 
procured, 
translated, 
re-printed 
and 
distributed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
program. 
A 
schedule 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
program, 
compatible 
with 
the 
professional 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
participants. 
The 
MOE 
will 
provide 
a 
credential 
for 
successful 
completion 
of 
the 
program. 
In 
support 
of 
these 
activities, 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Personnel 
Administration 
will 
organize 
and 
conduct 
a 
training 
needs 
assessment 
of 
school 
managers 
and 
Department 
of 
Education 
personnel 
(in 
the 
districts) 
and 
selected 
personnel 
in 
the 
MOE. 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
needs 
assessment, 
a 
management 
support 
training 
program 
will 
be 
developed 
and 
implemented. 
Policy 
Analysis 
and 
Planning 
Unit 
(PAPU). 
Under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP, 
the 
MOE 
will 
establish 
and 
resource 
a 
Policy 
Analysis 
and 
Planning 
Unit 
(PAPU). 
In 
the 
long-term, 
the 
PAPU 
will 
provide 
the 
MOE 
with 
enhanced 
capacity 
for 
planning 
and 
policy 
analysis. 
In 
the 
short- 
and 
medium-terms, 
the 
major 
function 
will 
be 
to 
support

plan 
that 
focuses 
on 
the 
key 
elements 
of 
the

Economic 
Analysis 
The 
education 
system 
of 
Azerbaijan 
faces 
two 
major 
challenges: 
First 
it 
must 
adapt 
to 
the 
severe 
financial 
constraints 
that 
have 
appeared 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Union. 
The 
aggressive 
development 
of 
the 
country’s 
petroleum 
reserves 
promises 
to 
accelerate 
economic 
growth 
and 
substantially 
relax 
financial 
constraints, 
but 
even 
if 
crude 
oil 
prices 
remain 
high 
and 
the 
economy 
is 
managed 
well, 
Azerbaijan 
will 
remain 
a 
middle-income 
country 
for 
at 
least 
another 
generation. 
Effective 
management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
and 
education 
spending 
in 
particular, 
will 
be 
essential 
if 
the 
country 
is 
to 
achieve 
rapid 
economic 
and 
social 
progress. 
Second, 
Azerbaijan’s 
education 
system 
must 
adjust 
to 
the 
requirements 
of 
an 
open, 
market 
economy 
and 
a 
pluralistic 
political 
system. 
This 
implies 
reform 
of 
not 
only 
curriculum 
content 
and 
teaching 
methods, 
but 
also 
governance 
and 
management 
of 
education. 
The 
education 
system 
must 
equip 
its 
graduates 
to 
fill 
leadership 
roles 
in 
many 
spheres 
including 
science, 
technology, 
public 
administration, 
private-sector 
management, 
entrepreneurship 
and 
community 
leadership. 
Meeting 
these 
expectations 
will 
require 
placing 
far 
greater 
stress 
than 
in 
the 
past 
on 
the 
mastery 
of 
skills 
and 
competencies 
in 
communications, 
critical 
thinking, 
and 
heuristic 
problem 
solving. 
The 
organization 
and 
leadership 
of 
education 
will 
have 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
need 
for 
a 
system 
that 
shapes 
its 
services 
to 
meet 
the 
specific 
needs 
of 
individual 
clients 
and 
takes 
responsibility 
for 
achieving 
high 
performance 
standards. 
The 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
- 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Credit 
- 
is 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
education 
reform 
program 
by 
further 
elaborating 
and 
testing 
alternative 
reform 
initiatives. 
The 
components 
included 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Project 
were 
selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
their 
perceived 
importance 
to 
the 
larger 
objective 
of 
ensuring 
the 
development 
of 
an 
education 
system 
that 
will 
provide 
Azeri 
children 
with 
an 
education 
that 
equips 
them 
to 
contribute 
effectively 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
economy, 
to 
participate 
fully 
in 
development 
of 
the 
political 
system 
and 
to 
live 
as 
full 
and 
responsible 
human 
beings. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
Program 
has 
been 
organized 
around 
four 
major 
objectives: 
(a) 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education; 
(b) 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
and 
fairness 
of 
the 
education 
process; 
(c) 
increasing 
the 
fairness 
of 
the 
education 
process; 
and 
(d) 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
public 
sector 
institutions 
to 
formulate 
education 
policy 
and 
to 
manage 
the 
provision 
of 
education 
services. 
Izole 
of 
the 
Public 
Sector. 
The 
rationale 
for 
public 
sector 
intervention 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
arises 
from 
three 
forms 
of 
market 
failure. 
First, 
education 
is 
a 
merit 
good. 
All 
young 
people 
must 
acquire 
basic 
skills 
if 
they 
are 
to 
become 
productive 
workers 
and 
citizens 
as 
adults. 
Young 
children 
and 
their 
parents 
cannot 
be 
expected 
in 
all 
cases 
to 
chose 
the 
amount 
and 
quality 
of 
education 
that 
is 
best. 
Therefore 
the 
state 
has 
a 
responsibility 
to 
mandate 
that 
all 
citizens 
acquire 
a 
minimum 
level 
of 
education. 
Second, 
the 
credit 
market 
for 
education 
is 
incomplete. 
Investments 
in 
education 
cannot 
be 
collateralized 
because 
the 
person 
(the 
debtor) 
and 
the 
education 
cannot 
be 
separated 
from 
one 
another. 
Therefore 
lenders 
cannot 
ensure 
the 
recovery 
of 
loans 
for 
education. 
Moreover, 
the 
value 
of 
an 
investment 
in 
education 
depends 
significantly 
on 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
individual-as 
both 
student 
and 
worker. 
State 
intervention 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
education 
is 
the 
most 
efficient 
mechanism 
for 
making 
certain 
that 
sufficient 
amounts 
are 
invested. 
Third, 
the 
benefits 
from 
education 
accrue 
to 
the 
community 
as 
well 
as 
the 
individual 
student. 
If 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
to 
education 
were 
determined 
by 
rationale 
individual 
choice, 
these 
external 
benefits 
would 
not 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
defining 
the 
optimal 
level 
and 
-

allocation 
of 
investments 
in 
the 
sector. 
Underspending 
on 
education 
would 
occur 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
governments 
Main 
Assumptions: 
The 
activities 
being 
financed 
under 
this 
Program 
are 
intended 
to 
bring 
the 
commitment 
of 
resources 
to 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan 
into 
line 
with 
international 
best 
practice 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
learning. 
The 
transition 
to 
a 
more 
efficient 
expenditure 
path 
will 
require 
investments 
in 
the 
design 
of 
activities, 
the 
training 
of 
staff 
and 
the 
production 
of 
materials. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
credit 
is 
to 
finance 
these 
expenditures. 
The 
criteria 
being 
used 
to 
design 
interventions 
and 
to 
select 
investments 
ensure 
that 
the 
expenditures 
reduce 
the 
present 
value 
of 
future 
costs. 
The 
projected 
growth 
of 
the 
Azeri 
economy 
and 
of 
public 
revenues 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
substantial 
increases 
in 
the 
absolute 
level 
of 
spending 
for 
education. 
The 
increase 
in 
national 
output 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
accompanied 
by 
corresponding 
increases 
in 
wages 
and 
salaries. 
Because 
teachers’ 
salaries 
have 
been 
severely 
compressed 
during 
the 
post-Soviet 
period, 
they 
are 
expected 
to 
rise 
more 
rapidly 
than 
the 
general 
wage 
level. 
However, 
prudent 
financial 
management 
dictates 
that 
the 
allocation 
of 
real 
resources 
to 
education 
should 
not 
be 
expected 
to 
increase 
as 
rapidly 
as 
national 
output. 
The 
phasing 
of 
this 
Program 
allows 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
to 
adjust 
its 
spending 
plans 
to 
emerging 
economic 
realities. 
The 
Program 
is 
designed 
to 
increase 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures 
on 
education 
and 
not 
to 
increase 
real 
resource 
use 
by 
the 
sector. 
It 
facilitates 
the 
introduction 
of 
more 
effective 
and 
efficient 
methods 
of 
instruction, 
raises 
educational 
standards, 
particularly 
for 
skills 
and 
improves 
the 
allocation 
of 
inputs 
within 
schools. 
It 
is 
also 
expected 
that 
improved 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education 
graduates 
will 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
more 
effective 
vocational 
and 
tertiary 
education. 
The 
projected 
double-digit 
growth 
of 
the 
economy 
over 
the 
next 
twenty 
years 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
corresponding 
increases 
in 
expenditures 
for 
education. 
However, 
as 
noted 
earlier, 
most 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
education 
budget 
will 
have 
to 
be 
allocated 
to 
salaries 
and 
wages 
in 
order 
to 
restore 
the 
incomes 
of 
staff 
to 
competitive 
levels. 
The 
increase 
in 
funding 
will 
also 
permit 
modest 
improvements 
in 
the 
provisions 
of 
teaching 
materials 
and 
more 
responsible 
maintenance 
of 
buildings, 
equipment 
and 
furniture. 
Cost-effectiveness 
indicators: 
The 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Project 
will 
finance 
five 
components 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program: 
The 
first 
component 
of 
the 
Project 
will 
seek 
to 
increase 
the 
quality 
of 
education. 
It 
will 
confront 
the 
need 
to 
(a) 
reform 
the 
contents, 
sequencing 
and 
pacing 
of 
the 
curriculum; 
(b) 
modify 
instructional 
methods 
in 
order 
to 
more 
effectively 
develop 
cognitive 
skills 
through 
the 
development 
and 
reforms 
of 
teacher 
development; 
and 
(c) 
provide 
reading 
materials 
(especially 
in 
Latin 
script 
Azeri 
Language) 
to 
school 
libraries 
that 
stimulate 
reading 
habits, 
encourage 
independent 
learning 
opportunities, 
and 
support 
extra 
and 
co-curricula. 
This 
component 
responds 
to 
the 
need 
for 
government 
to 
anticipate 
the 
skills 
required 
for 
citizens 
to 
function 
adequately 
in 
the 
economic, 
political 
and 
social 
life 
of 
the 
country. 
The 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
educaiton 
is 
also 
essential 
for 
the 
development 
of 
vocational 
and 
tertiary 
education 
since 
general 
education 
provides 
the 
foundation 
for 
both 
vocational 
and 
tertiary 
education. 
The 
budget 
for 
reform 
of 
the 
curriculum 
is 
US$1.21 
million. 
If 
the 
products 
of 
the 
reforms 
were 
to 
remain 
in 
place 
for 
only 
a 
decade, 
they 
would 
cost 
less 
than 
US$O.O7 
per 
student 
year 
of 
education. 
The 
incremental 
benefits 
of 
reforms 
that 
ensure 
the 
development 
of 
higher 
order 
cognitive 
skills 
and 
the 
mastery 
of 
a 
more 
relevant 
body 
of 
knowledge 
are 
clearly 
many 
times 
more 
valuable.

Page  97
The 
first 
component 
of 
the 
program 
will 
also 
support 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
and 
the 
initial 
reform 
of 
pre-service 
teacher 
educatin 
with 
particulr 
focus 
on 
the 
development 
of 
a 
teacher 
education 
strategy 
and 
the 
development 
of 
teacher 
education 
curricula 
for 
primary 
grades. 
These 
training 
activities 
aim 
at 
ensuring 
that 
teachers 
have 
mastered 
a 
body 
of 
related 
curriculum 
content 
that 
will 
ensure 
that 
they 
can 
be 
employed 
fully, 
even 
by 
small 
schools; 
have 
acquired 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
teaching 
strategies 
and 
methods; 
and 
have 
developed 
skills 
in 
adapting 
content 
and 
instructional 
methods 
to 
the 
learning 
needs 
of 
particular 
students. 
The 
Project 
will 
support 
the 
government 
in 
devising 
and 
implementing 
a 
strategy 
for 
improving 
the 
training 
of 
teachers. 
It 
will 
also 
fmance 
the 
provision 
of 
training 
materials 
and 
equipment 
for 
selected 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
institutes. 
This 
subcomponent 
is 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US$2.57 
million 
or 
about 
US$13 
per 
teacher 
employed 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
subcomponent 
would 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
use 
teachers 
more 
intensively 
by 
preparing 
them 
for 
new 
curricula 
and 
teaching 
methods 
and 
for 
effective 
multigrade 
teaching 
or 
teaching 
of 
a 
second 
or 
third 
subject. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
subcomponent 
would 
recovered 
in 
ten 
years 
if 
it 
were 
to 
lead 
to 
a 
2.5 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
number 
of 
teachers 
employed. 
Detailed 
analyses 
of 
data 
for 
Ismailly 
rayon 
suggest 
that 
fully 
implementing 
multigrade 
teaching 
and 
training 
teachers 
in 
two 
or 
more 
subjects 
would 
bring 
down 
the 
number 
of 
teacher 
required 
by 
more 
than 
300 
persons 
or 
about 
seventeen 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
teachers 
employed. 
Therefore, 
the 
economic 
rationale 
for 
improving 
teacher 
training 
is 
very 
strong. 
’ 
A 
third 
subcomponent 
of 
the 
quality 
improvement 
component 
will 
provide 
US$3.27 
million 
in 
order 
to 
stimulate 
reading 
habits, 
encourage 
independent 
learning 
opportunities, 
and 
support 
extra 
and 
co-curricula 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
reading 
materials 
to 
school 
libraries 
in 
Latin 
Script 
Azeri 
Langugage. 
(It 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
Government 
would 
finance 
the 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
ot 
ensure 
that 
all 
sutdents 
are 
provided 
a 
complet 
set 
of 
textbooks 
free 
of 
charge 
during 
the 
period 
of 
2003-2005 
under 
the 
governmet 
budget 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
PRSP. 
The 
estimated 
cost 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
textbooks 
for 
all 
grade 
l-l 
1 
students 
will 
be 
about 
US$20 
million 
during 
the 
next 
three 
years). 
The 
Project 
will 
fund 
a 
textbook 
rental 
scheme 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
the 
maximum 
use 
of 
books. 
This 
component 
addresses 
both 
the 
inefficiencies 
that 
arise 
as 
a 
result 
of 
many 
children 
not 
having 
access 
to 
reading 
materials 
and 
the 
inequities 
that 
result 
from 
the 
problem 
of 
a 
scarcity 
of 
reading 
materials 
especially 
in 
Latin 
script 
Azeri 
Language 
being 
concentrated 
among 
the 
rural 
poor. 
The 
second 
component 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
improve 
the 
financing 
and 
management 
of 
schools. 
The 
first 
subcomponent 
will 
introduce 
a 
budgeting 
system 
in 
which 
funds 
are 
provided 
to 
schools 
based 
on 
the 
number 
of 
students 
enrolled 
in 
each 
school. 
Additional 
funds 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
rayon 
education 
departments 
to 
finance 
system-wide 
functions, 
including 
policy 
analysis, 
research 
and 
administration. 
The 
new 
budgeting 
system 
will 
permit 
school-level 
management 
of 
resources 
by 
allowing 
schools 
to 
allocate 
funds 
to 
priority 
expenditures 
and 
to 
carry-over 
funds 
from 
one 
year 
to 
the 
next. 
The 
implementation 
of 
school 
level 
management 
of 
resources 
will 
be 
accompanied 
by 
the 
development 
of 
improved 
accountability 
for 
both 
funds 
and 
school 
performance. 
These 
activities 
will 
ensure 
both 
more 
effective 
management 
of 
resources 
devoted 
to 
recurrent 
expenditures 
and 
greater 
responsiveness 
to 
local 
needs 
and 
preferences. 
The 
cost 
of 
implementing 
these 
reforms 
in 
the 
three 
pilot 
rayons 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
US$O.5 
million 
or 
approximately 
US$3,100 
per 
school. 
These 
costs 
include 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
new 
funding 
formula, 
new 
systems 
of 
accounting 
and 
performance 
management, 
and 
training 
in 
their 
use. 
The 
component 
would 
be 
economically 
justified 
if 
it 
resulted 
in 
an 
increase 
in 
efficiency 
of 
only 
0.4 
percent 
of 
total 
operating 
costs. 
The 
second 
subcomponent 
will 
address 
inefficiencies 
rooted 
in 
past 
staff 
and 
capital 
expenditures. 
It 
will 
provide 
funds 
for 
the 
consolidation 
and 
renovation 
of 
schools 
and 
the 
rationalization 
of 
staffing. 
These 
funds 
will 
be 
allocated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
economic 
criteria: 
investments 
should 
reduce 
the 
present 
value 
of 
the 
total 
costs 
of 
providing 
education 
to 
a 
group 
of 
students 
over 
a 
Page  98
planning 
horizon 
of 
15 
years. 
At 
present, 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
cost 
savings 
through 
staff 
and 
phyiscal 
facility 
rationalizations. 
The 
MOE 
and 
Rayon 
education 
officials 
will 
prepare 
district 
rationalization 
plans 
to 
show 
possible 
rationalizations 
in 
the 
three 
districts 
and 
their 
respective 
costs 
and 
benefits. 
In 
order 
to 
minimize 
the 
cost 
of 
technical 
studies, 
a 
three-stage 
procedure 
has 
been 
devised 
in 
which 
school 
directors 
will 
submit 
formatted 
reports 
on 
the 
condition, 
adequacy 
and 
prospective 
enrollment 
for 
each 
school. 
These 
data 
will 
be 
used 
to 
identify 
schools 
for 
detailed 
assessment 
by 
engineers, 
architects 
and 
planners. 
Detailed 
plans 
for 
the 
repair, 
renovation 
and 
expansion 
of 
schools 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
schools 
that 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
most 
promising 
candidates 
for 
funding. 
This 
approach 
will 
ensure 
transparency 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
allocation 
of 
investment 
resources. 
The 
third 
component 
will 
improve 
access 
to 
quality 
schooling 
among 
the 
economically 
disadvantaged. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
SPG 
will 
be 
about 
US$O.9 
million, 
some 
of 
which 
will 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
OSI-Azerbaijan 
throgh 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
SPG. 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
the 
SRP 
is 
to 
upgrade 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching 
and 
learning 
in 
the 
three 
selected 
districts 
(i.e., 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ismailli, 
and 
Ujar). 
These 
distircts 
all 
have 
lower 
average 
income 
thatn 
more 
affulent 
areas 
such 
as 
Baku. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
epxected 
that 
relatively 
pooer 
students 
will 
be 
served 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
SPG 
according 
to 
schools’ 
own 
assessment 
and 
perception 
of 
priority 
needs 
in 
the 
three 
less 
advantagous 
rayons. 
The 
fourth 
component 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
support 
improvements 
in 
the 
governance 
and 
management 
of 
the 
sector. 
It 
will 
finance 
(a) 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
Education 
Management 
Information 
System; 
(b) 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
student 
assessment 
and 
evaluation 
program; 
(c) 
the 
development 
of 
capacity 
in 
policy 
analysis 
and 
management 
in 
national 
and 
regional 
government 
institutions. 
These 
three 
activities 
are 
expected 
to 
cost 
about 
US$2.34 
million. 
They 
will 
facilitate 
the 
introduction 
of 
modern 
methods 
of 
policy 
analysis, 
program 
management, 
monitoring 
and 
evlauation 
into 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
f&h 
component 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
support 
the 
management 
of 
the 
Program, 
including 
procurement, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
and 
financial 
management. 
The 
component 
is 
expected 
to 
cost 
US$1.87 
million

Procurement 
Plan. 
A 
Procurement 
Plan 
(Table 
Al) 
has 
been 
prepared 
and 
will 
form 
the 
basis 
for 
procurement 
under 
the 
Project. 
The 
Plan, 
which 
is 
part 
of 
the 
Project 
Operational 
Manual 
(POM), 
will 
be 
updated 
every 
six 
months 
to 
reflect 
changes 
in 
procurement 
process, 
which 
could 
significantly 
affect 
the 
timely 
and 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
revisions/updates 
in 
the 
Procurement 
Plan 
would 
be 
agreed 
with 
IDA 
prior 
to 
its 
implementation. 
Procurement 
action 
will 
commence 
on 
some 
procurement 
contracts 
before 
effectiveness, 
but 
no 
expenditures 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
financed 
retroactively. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
there 
will 
be 
about 
2 
10 
IDA-financed 
contracts 
as 
shown 
in 
the 
table 
below. 
The 
value 
of 
non-IDA 
financed 
procurement 
is 
about 
US$O.45 
million 
equivalent.

Procurement 
under 
the 
Project 
includes 
the 
acquisition 
and 
delivery 
of 
works, 
goods 
and 
services 
contracts. 
The 
methods 
of 
procurement 
are 
described 
in 
the 
succeeding 
paragraphs. 
Works. 
Works 
contract 
consist 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
selected 
schools 
in 
three 
Selected 
Pilot 
Rayons, 
as 
well 
as 
minor 
rehabilitation 
and 
refurbishment 
of 
the 
National 
Assessment 
and 
Examinations 
Center 
and 
Teacher 
Training 
Institutes 
(aggregate 
US$7.10 
million 
equivalent 
including 
contingencies). 
Due 
to 
resource 
constraints, 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
works 
in 
the 
Selected 
Rayons 
which 
will 
be 
financed 
under 
Phase 
1, 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
most 
urgently 
needed 
repairs 
and 
will 
not 
include 
major 
rehabilitation, 
extensions 
or 
new 
construction. 
To 
the 
extent 
it 
is 
feasible, 
works 
contracts 
would 
be 
grouped 
into 
packages 
that 
would 
permit 
wider 
competition 
among 
a 
broad 
spectrum 
of 
works 
contractors, 
achieve 
economy 
of 
scale, 
and 
improve 
procurement 
effectiveness. 
The 
schools 
in 
one 
Rayon 
(Ali 
Bayramli) 
are 
relatively 
large 
(ranging 
from 
1,000 
to 
4,800 
square 
meters 
of 
building 
area), 
are 
all 
located 
(except 
for 
one 
small 
school 
for 
60 
students) 
within 
the 
urban 
capital, 
and 
thus, 
can 
be 
packaged 
into 
a 
contract 
or 
contracts 
attractive 
enough 
for 
foreign 
bidders. 
The 
schools 
in 
the 
other 
two 
Rayons 
(Ucar 
and 
Ismayilli) 
are 
disperse, 
smaller 
and 
can 
be 
grouped, 
to 
a 
limited 
extent, 
into 
large 
packages 
suitable 
for 
International 
Competitive 
Bidding. 
Works 
for 
the 
Assessment 
Center 
and 
Teacher 
Training 
Institutes

decentralized 
nature 
of 
the 
interventions, 
would 
be 
best 
served 
through 
the 
recruitment 
of 
individual 
consultants 
(both 
foreign 
and 
Azerbaijan 
nationals) 
to 
assist 
the 
Component 
Implementing 
Units 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU). 
Such 
individual 
specialists 
include 
fixed-term 
positions 
(non-public 
sector 
national 
staff) 
of 
up 
to 
2 
years 
duration, 
as 
well 
as 
specific 
skills 
in 
areas 
of 
expertise 
which 
would 
be 
needed 
for 
short 
periods 
of 
time 
at 
scattered 
intervals, 
and 
which 
would 
be 
impractical 
to 
package 
with 
the 
assignments 
for 
consulting 
firms 
described 
above. 
Services 
of 
individual 
consultants 
for 
tasks 
that 
meet 
the 
requirements 
set 
forth 
in 
paragraph 
5.1 
of 
the 
Consultant 
Guidelines 
shall 
be 
procured 
under 
contracts 
awarded 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
paragraphs 
5.1 
through 
5.4 
of 
the 
Consultant 
Guidelines. 
It 
is 
deemed 
critical 
in 
achieving 
the 
project’s 
educational 
objectives, 
that, 
individual 
specialists 
(e.g. 
school 
teachers, 
academician, 
curriculum 
and 
textbook 
writers) 
providing 
assistance 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
curriculum, 
student 
assessment, 
textbooks 
and 
teacher 
training 
programs 
be 
able 
to 
reflect 
the 
practical 
experience 
in 
Azerbaijan’s 
classrooms, 
and 
should 
be 
knowledgeable 
about 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
country, 
region, 
and 
the 
community 
at 
large. 
Azerbaijan 
has 
very 
few 
such 
local 
experts 
outside 
of 
the 
public 
sector. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
foreign 
experts 
do 
not 
have 
the 
intimate 
knowledge 
of 
the 
local 
environment 
and 
culture 
which 
is 
fundamental 
to 
developing 
an 
appropriate 
national 
curriculum, 
textbooks 
and 
training 
programs. 
Thus, 
a 
waiver 
of 
the 
application 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
eligibility 
policy 
on 
the 
hiring 
of 
these 
civil 
servant 
is 
sought, 
to 
allow 
the 
hiring 
of 
these 
public 
servants 
and 
financing 
of 
their 
fees 
and 
remuneration 
out 
of 
Credit 
funds. 
These 
individual 
public 
servants 
would 
be 
selected 
competitively 
under 
TORs 
agreed 
by 
IDA, 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
paragraphs 
5.1 
through 
5.4 
of 
the 
Consultant 
Guidelines. 
The 
competition 
for 
the 
positions 
would 
be 
advertised 
in 
a 
national 
paper 
of 
wide 
circulation. 
About 
50 
public 
servants 
(teachers, 
educators, 
academician, 
curriculum 
and 
textbook 
writers 
developers) 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
hired 
under 
individual 
contracts 
of 
up 
to 
2 
years 
duration, 
and 
at 
fee 
rates 
ranging 
from 
US$l50 
to 
US$250 
per 
month. 
The 
aggregate 
value 
of 
individual 
consultant 
contracts 
is 
US$2.91 
million 
equivalent. 
It 
was 
also 
agreed 
that

may

to

The

The

Project 
- 
APL

is 
the 
second 
IDA-financed 
investment 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
The 
Project

the 
first 
project 
(Education

AZ). 
will 
become 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
of 
the 
proposed 
project, 
and, 
under 
the 
general 
supervision 
of 
the 
Deputy 
Minister 
of 
Education, 
it 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
coordinating 
the 
work 
of 
implementation 
units, 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management. 
All 
procurement 
of 
works, 
goods 
and 
services 
will 
be 
undertaken 
centrally 
by 
PCU, 
but 
individual 
contracts 
will 
be 
signed 
by 
the 
respective 
implementing 
units 
and 
MOE 
departments, 
unless 
the 
PCU 
has 
been 
given 
written 
authority 
to 
place 
contracts 
on 
their 
behalf. 
The 
PCU 
is 
directly 
responsible 
for

ensuring 
compliance 
with 
IDA 
requirements 
of 
procurement 
procedures,

reports 
and

It 
will 
maintain 
procurement 
records/files,

monitor 
the 
performance 
of 
suppliers, 
monitor 
deliveries 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
and 
prepare 
and 
furnish 
procurement 
progress 
reports 
to 
the 
concerned 
institutions 
including 
IDA. 
The 
PIU 
had 
acquired 
some 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
under 
the 
LIL, 
and 
have 
staff 
(Director, 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
staff), 
who 
have 
been 
with 
the 
unit 
since 
2001. 
However, 
the 
existing 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
capacity 
will 
be 
unable 
to 
cope 
with 
the 
wider 
and 
more 
complex 
needs 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
will 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
Additional 
staff 
will 
need 
to 
be 
recruited 
to 
support 
the 
Project 
Director. 
The 
PCU 
would 
consist 
of 
a 
Project 
Director, 
a 
Deputy 
Director, 
Procurement 
Officer; 
Architect/Procurement

two 
Financial 
Officers; 
Monitoring

It 
is 
planned 
that 
key 
PCU

will 
attend 
training 
on

the 
MOE 
will 
make

(SPA) 
which 
has 
expressed 
its

DESCRIPTION 
OF 
PROCUREMENT 
STATUS: 
Procurement 
Environment. 
The 
draft 
CPAR 
issued 
on 
May 
12, 
2002 
describes 
the 
procurement 
environment 
in 
Azerbaijan 
in 
detail. 
In 
summary, 
procurement 
reform 
has 
been 
a 
priority 
in 
Azerbaijan 
during 
the 
last 
three 
years, 
and 
significant 
progress 
has 
been 
made. 
A 
comprehensive 
assessment 
of 
the 
public 
procurement 
system 
included 
all 
relevant 
aspects 
of 
procurement 
operations 
including 
the 
legislative 
framework, 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
regulatory 
institutions, 
strength 
of 
the 
enforcement 
regime, 
the 
capacity 
of 
its 
institutional 
and 
human 
resources, 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
corruption. 
The 
assessment 
was 
made 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
State 
Procurement 
Agency. 
The 
key 
findings 
are 
the 
following: 
(a) 
Azerbaijan 
recently 
adopted 
a 
new 
Public 
Procurement 
Law 
(PPL) 
which 
clarified 
and 
consolidated 
contradictory 
pieces 
of 
legislation. 
The 
PPL 
is 
based 
extensively 
on 
the 
UNCITRAL 
model, 
has 
been 
discussed 
with 
the 
Bank 
and 
found 
to 
be 
largely 
satisfactory. 
In 
terms 
of 
substance 
and 
degree 
of 
development, 
the 
PPL 
is 
one 
of 
the 
better 
such 
laws 
in 
the 
region; 
(b) 
the 
State 
Procurement 
Agency 
is 
the 
regulatory 
agency 
and 
has 
been 
in 
operation 
since 
1998. 
It 
has 
responsibility 
for 
general 
supervision 
and 
monitoring, 
and 
in 
addition 
constitutes 
the 
second 
and 
potentially 
most 
effective 
tier 
for 
review. 
However, 
to 
carry 
out 
these 
tasks, 
the 
SPA 
does 
not 
yet 
have 
in 
place 
an 
appropriate 
review 
department 
separate 
from 
its 
functional 
department 
or 
a 
transparent 
and 
formalized 
review 
procedure; 
(c) 
with 
the 
PPL 
in 
place 
and 
a 
competent 
regulatory 
agency 
to 
oversee 
its 
implementation, 
the 
main 
weakness 
of 
the 
procurement 
system 
appears 
to 
be 
one 
of 
capacity 
and 
resources. 
Procurement 
based 
on 
market 
economy 
principles 
is 
a 
relatively 
new 
concept 
and 
there 
are 
few 
trained 
procurement 
officers; 
(d) 
experience 
in 
procurement 
is 
limited. 
Experience 
outside 
the 
capital 
and 
surrounding 
areas 
is 
much 
less 
developed. 
Very 
few 
local 
authorities 
have 
experience 
in 
tendering 
procedures 
under 
the 
new 
PPL. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
continues 
to 
exercise 
a 
certain 
control 
over 
procurement, 
namely, 
ex 
post 
approval, 
which 
creates 
significant 
uncertainty 
for 
bidders; 
(e) 
in 
the 
construction 
sector, 
many 
of 
the 
“private” 
sector 
firms 
are 
former 
in-house 
government 
construction 
departments, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
feeling 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
that 
such 
companies 
are 
favored 
by 
procuring 
entities. 
Based 
on 
this 
analysis, 
the 
environment 
for 
conducting 
public 
procurement 
in 
Azerbaijan 
is 
assessed 
as 
a 
medium- 
to 
high-risk. 
In 
relation 
to 
procurement 
under 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Project, 
several 
aspects 
need 
attention 
and 
adoption 
of 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
procurement 
difficulties: 
(i) 
while 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
government 
policy 
on 
taxation 
and 
customs 
duties 
for 
IDA-financed 
projects, 
the 
processes 
are 
not 
always 
known 
to 
tax 
and 
customs 
officers, 
and 
there 
are 
no 
clear 
and 
transparent 
procedural 
arrangements 
in 
place 
on 
how 
to 
apply 
the 
policy; 
(ii) 
there 
are 
problems 
with 
the 
technicalities 
of 
bid 
securities, 
and 
local 
banks 
are 
not 
familiar 
with 
issuing 
bid 
securities 
that 
meet 
IDA 
standards; 
While 
the 
current 
PCU 
Director 
and 
Procurement 
Officer 
have 
had 
hands-on 
experience 
with 
IDA 
procurement 
guidelines, 
procedures 
and 
documentation, 
the 
procurement 
capability 
of 
the 
unit 
and 
of 
its 
key 
staff 
need 
considerable 
strengthening, 
given 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
given 
the 
planned 
investments 
in 
textbooks, 
works 
and 
IT, 
areas 
in 
which, 
the 
PCU 
has 
very 
limited 
capacity 
and 
expertise 
to 
procure. 
Thus, 
the 
project’s 
procurement 
implementation 
capacity 
has 
been 
rated 
as 
“High” 
risk” 
for 
public 
procurement. 
A 
Procurement 
Action 
Plan 
has 
been 
prepared 
and 
will 
be 
further 
discussed 
and 
agreed 
with 
the 
Borrower 
during 
negotiations.

Assessment 
The 
existing 
Project 
Implementation 
Unit 
(PIU) 
that 
is 
implementing 
the 
ongoing 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL) 
will 
become 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
for 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Project 
(APL). 
A 
financial 
management 
assessment 
for 
the 
proposed 
project 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
project 
preparation 
and 
updated 
at 
appraisal. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
assessment 
was 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
Project 
has 
in 
place 
adequate 
financial 
management 
system 
that 
can 
provide, 
with 
reasonable 
assurance, 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
on 
the 
status 
of 
the 
project 
as 
required 
by 
the 
Bank. 
It 
is 
concluded 
that 
the 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
are 
satisfactory 
and 
comply 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
OPlBP 
10.02 
requirements.

are 
however, 
a

process 
as 
indicated

Summary 
of 
Project 
Description 
The 
purposes 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
(APL) 
are 
to 
maximize 
learning 
achievements 
for 
all 
students 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
market 
economy 
and 
improve 
efficiency 
of 
general 
education. 
The 
first 
Phase 
of 
the 
Program 
would 
comprise 
of 
the 
following 
components: 
(i) 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
general 
education; 
(ii) 
efficiency 
and 
finance 
reforms; 
(iii) 
enhanced 
equity 
and 
access; 
(iv) 
management, 
planning, 
and 
monitoring 
capacity 
development; 
and 
(v) 
project 
management 
and 
evaluation. 
The 
proposed 
Phase 
I 
would 
support 
reforms 
in 
the 
national 
level 
and 
a 
set 
of 
specific 
interventions 
and 
reforms 
in 
three 
selected 
districts 
for 
an 
estimated 
project 
costs 
of 
US$21.5 
million. 
The 
IDA 
Credit 
of 
US$18.0 
million 
for 
the 
Phase 
I 
would 
be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
Republic 
of 
Azerbaijan 
(the 
Borrower) 
under 
the 
governing 
terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
the 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement.

Country 
Financial 
Management 
Issues 
The 
Country 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
Report 
dated 
January 
2003 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
public 
financial 
management 
issues 
that 
require 
strengthening: 
including 
public 
sector 
budgeting, 
public 
sector 
internal 
and 
external 
auditing, 
and 
private 
sector 
accounting 
and 
auditing. 
The 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit, 
approved 
in 
March 
2002, 
will 
facilitate 
policy 
dialogue 
in 
improving 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
public 
financial 
management, 
reducing 
conflicts 
of 
interest 
and 
corruption 
in 
the 
business 
environment, 
and 
strengthening 
the 
banking 
sector. 
Strengthening 
of 
banking 
sector 
supervision, 
raised 
capital 
adequacy, 
improved 
prudential 
norms, 
and 
licensing 
rules 
for 
credit 
cooperatives. 
Introduction 
of 
LAS-based 
national 
accounting 
standards 
for 
commercial 
banks 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
IMF 
and 
IDA 
Financial 
Sector 
TA 
Project. 
The 
Institution 
Building 
Technical 
Assistance 
II 
(IBTA-II) 
Credit 
will 
finance 
activities 
leading 
to 
strengthening 
public 
financial 
accountability 
in 
the 
Country, 
including 
establishing 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Accounts, 
the 
Country’s 
supreme 
audit 
institution. 
The 
Bank 
carried 
out 
a 
Country 
Portfolio 
Performance 
Review 
(CPPR) 
of 
all 
projects 
in 
the 
portfolio 
in 
January 
2002, 
and 
identified 
common 
financial 
management 
issues 
affecting 
implementation 
of 
Bank-financed 
projects 
in 
the 
country 
(counterpart 
funding 
arrears, 
taxation 
and 
customs 
duties). 
Most 
of 
the 
actions 
agreed 
upon 
to 
remedy 
identified 
weaknesses 
have 
been 
implemented, 
including 
establishing 
of 
a 
Working 
Group 
to 
review 
and 
make 
recommendations 
on 
issues 
affecting 
implementation 
of 
Bank-financed 
projects.

Risk 
Analysis 
Risk 
analysis 
from 
a 
financial 
management 
perspective 
is 
summarized 
below. 
The 
significant 
strengths 
that 
provide 
a 
basis 
of 
reliance 
on 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
system 
include: 
(i) 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
incumbent 
chief 
accountant 
in 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursements 
of 
Bank 
financed 
projects; 
(ii) 
the 
overall 
experience 
of 
the 
PCU 
in 
implementing 
Bank 
projects; 
and 
(iii) 
prior 
years 
audits 
of 
the 
Project 
that 
raised 
no 
significant 
issues. 
An 
additional 
accountant 
will 
be 
recruited 
to 
take 
over 
the 
cash 
management 
and 
accounting 
data 
entry 
functions 
currently 
being 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Office 
Manager. 
This 
will 
ensure 
proper 
segregation 
of 
duties, 
and 
thus 
strengthen 
internal 
controls.

Financial 
Management 
System 
Assessment 
Project 
Management 
and 
Implementation 
Arrangements. 
Financial 
management 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
project 
preparation 
and 
updated 
at 
appraisal. 
The 
assessment 
included 
review 
of 
financial 
management 
and 
internal 
control 
systems, 
auditing 
arrangements, 
existence 
of 
written 
standards 
and 
procedures 
relating 
to 
responsibilities 
and 
levels 
of 
authority, 
and 
overall 
capacity 
of 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
within 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education. 
The 
PCU 
has 
the 
capacity 
and 
experience 
to 
manage 
and 
coordinate 
financial 
management, 
reporting, 
disbursements 
and 
auditing 
arrangements 
for 
the 
proposed 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
(APL). 
Project 
Accounting 
System. 
The 
existing 
Peachtree 
accounting 
software 
lacks 
capacity 
to 
account 
and 
report 
in 
multiple 
currencies. 
At 
present, 
the 
Project 
Management 
Reports 
(PMRs) 
are 
produced 
in 
Excel 
spreadsheets 
that 
are 
not 
integrated 
to 
the 
accounting 
software, 
with 
high 
probability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
errors. 
Consultants 
have 
started 
the 
design 
and 
installation 
process 
of 
an 
accounting 
software 
capable 
of 
supporting 
multiple 
currencies. 
The 
installed 
software 
would 
produce 
Financial 
Management 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
for 
quarterly 
reporting 
to 
the 
World 
Bank, 
in 
addition 
to 
producing 
financial 
reports 
to 
local 
authorities. 
The 
PCU 
chief 
accountant 
would 
maintain 
books 
of 
accounts 
for 
the 
Project, 
prepare 
and 
disseminate 
financial 
statements 
and 
FMRs, 
and 
ensure 
timely 
audit 
of 
the 
financial 
statements. 
The 
principles 
for 
project 
accounting 
would 
include, 
but 
not 
be 
limited 
to:

Books 
of 
accounts 
and 
financial 
reporting 
would 
be 
based 
on 
accrual 
accounting. 
Project 
accounting 
would 
cover 
all 
sources 
and 
uses 
of 
funds, 
each 
financier 
identified 
separately 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
accounts 
and 
financial 
statements. 
The 
IDA 
financing 
should 
be 
summarized 
under 
the 
disbursement 
categories 
in 
the 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement, 
and 
project 
expenditures 
summarized 
by 
components 
and 
sub-components 
consistent 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Project 
Appraisal 
Document 
(PAD). 
A 
Chart 
of 
Accounts 
would 
be 
designed 
to 
capture 
sources 
and 
uses 
of 
funds, 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
in 
sufficient 
detail 
to 
satisfy 
reporting 
requirements 
of 
both 
the 
Bank 
and 
local 
reporting 
requirements. 
Project 
Financial 
Statements 
and 
FMRs 
would 
be 
fully 
based 
on 
the 
project 
books 
of 
accounts 
and 
substantially 
generated 
using 
the 
accounting 
software. 
Information 
on 
key 
performance 
indicators 
and 
procurement 
monitoring 
would 
be 
maintained 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
system. 
Internal 
Controls. 
Accounting 
and 
operations 
procedures 
and 
guidelines 
describing 
accounting 
and 
administrative 
controls, 
authorization 
and 
segregation 
of 
duties, 
reconciliation 
of 
accounts 
and 
presentation 
of 
financial 
statements, 
and 
other 
controls 
are 
documented 
in 
a 
Financial 
Management 
Manual 
that 
had 
been 
prepared 
for 
the 
ongoing 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(LIL). 
The 
Manual 
will 
be 
updated 
to 
include 
any 
additional 
procedures, 
for 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
In 
order 
to 
provide 
proper 
segregation 
of 
duties, 
an 
additional 
accountant 
will 
be 
recruited 
to 
take 
over 
some 
of 
the 
basic 
accounting 
duties 
and 
treasury 
functions 
that 
are 
currently 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
office 
manager. 
Staffing. 
The 
PCU, 
which 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
project 
coordination 
and 
monitoring, 
would 
consist 
of 
the 
director, 
deputy 
director, 
project 
accountant, 
procurement 
officer, 
architect, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
specialist, 
office 
manager 
and 
interpreters/translators. 
The 
project 
accountant 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
all 
aspects 
of 
financial 
management, 
disbursement 
and 
auditing 
arrangements, 
including: 
maintaining 
books 
of 
accounts, 
financial 
reporting, 
managing 
the 
Special 
Account 
(IDA 
funds), 
the 
Project 
Account 
(Counterpart 
funds), 
and 
ensuring 
that 
independent 
auditors 
for 
the 
Project 
are 
engaged 
on 
time. 
The 
accountant 
reports 
directly 
to 
the 
PCU 
director. 
The 
PCU 
will 
recruit 
a 
second 
accountant 
with 
sufficient 
accounting 
qualifications 
and 
experience 
for 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
Flow 
of 
Funds. 
The 
IDA 
Credit 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
through 
the 
Special 
Account 
to 
be 
maintained 
at 
the 
International 
Bank 
of 
Azerbaijan, 
where 
all 
Bank/IDA 
financed 
Special 
Accounts 
are 
maintained. 
The 
current 
procedures 
for 
signing 
of 
the 
withdrawal 
applications 
by 
the 
Deputy 
Minister 
of 
the 
MOE 
would 
be 
maintained, 
with 
the 
MOF 
maintaining 
the 
control 
function. 
A 
separate 
Project 
Account 
for 
Government 
counterpart 
funds 
will 
also 
be 
maintained 
in 
local 
currency 
(Manat) 
at 
the 
International 
Bank 
of 
Azerbaijan. 
The 
Government 
would 
transfer 
its 
counterpart 
contribution 
to 
the 
project 
account 
when 
funds 
are 
needed 
to 
make 
payments 
for 
eligible 
project 
expenditures. 
The 
MOF 
authorizes 
payments 
from 
the 
Project 
Account. 
Both 
accounts 
would 
be 
reconciled 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
Internal 
Audit. 
The 
Main 
Department 
of 
Public 
Finance 
Control 
(MDPFC) 
in 
the 
MOF 
provides 
the 
internal 
audit 
function. 
The 
country 
internal 
audit 
function 
was 
identified 
as 
weak 
by 
the 
recent 
CFAA. 
Strengthening 
of 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Accounts 
and 
enacting 
amendments 
to 
Law 
and 
Charter 
on 
Chamber 
of 
Accounts 
establishing 
the 
Chamber 
as 
the 
supreme 
audit 
institution 
of 
the 
Republic 
is 
addressed 
in 
SAC-II 
Credit, 
and 
financed 
through 
IBTA-II 
Credit.

External 
Audit. 
The 
existing 
auditing 
arrangements 
are 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
similar 
audit 
arrangements 
would 
be 
adopted 
for 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
Independent 
private 
auditors 
would 
conduct 
the 
audit 
under 
Terms 
of 
Reference 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
The 
contract 
of 
the 
audit 
would 
be 
awarded 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
Project 
implementation, 
and 
thereafter 
extended 
from 
year-to-year 
with 
the 
same 
auditor, 
subject 
to 
satisfactory 
performance. 
The 
“Guidelines 
for 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers” 
would 
apply 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
auditors. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
audit 
would 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
Credit. 
Annual 
audited 
project 
financial 
statement 
would 
be 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year. 
Reporting 
and 
Monitoring. 
The 
PCU 
will 
maintain 
Project 
accounts 
and 
prepare 
quarterly 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
and 
Project 
Financial 
Statements. 
The 
quarterly 
FMRs 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
45 
days 
after 
end 
of 
each 
quarter 
will 
include 
only 
the 
information 
necessary 
for 
the 
financial 
monitoring 
of 
the 
Project, 
and 
would 
comprise 
of: 
- 
Project 
Sources 
and 
Uses 
of 
Funds 
Statement 
- 
Uses 
of

Procurement 
Monitoring 
Report 
(contracts 
for 
goods, 
works 
and 
consultants 
services 
not 
subject 
to 
prior 
review) 
The 
format 
of 
the 
FM?& 
agreed 
upon 
at 
Negotiations 
Impact 
of 
Procurement 
Arrangements. 
The 
recent 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR) 
reviewed 
the 
current 
two-stage 
control 
by 
the 
Treasury 
following 
budget 
allocation 
on: 
(i) 
contract-by-contract 
control 
under 
which 
the 
prices 
bid 
are 
compared 
to 
some 
“average 
market 
price” 
and 
rejected 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
successful 
bid 
price 
exceeds 
the 
hypothetical 
market 
price, 
and 
(ii) 
a 
further 
total 
budget 
control 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
value 
of 
all 
contracts 
entered 
into 
in 
any 
one 
budgetary 
year 
does 
not 
exceed 
the 
budget 
allocation 
for 
that 
year. 
The 
CPAR 
recommended 
that 
the 
first 
of 
these 
two 
controls 
should 
be 
abandoned 
as 
it 
leads 
to 
widespread 
inefficiencies 
and 
corruption. 
3. 
Disbursement 
Arrangements 
The 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
would 
be 
implemented 
in 
Three 
Phases 
over 
a 
period 
of 
10 
years. 
The 
IDA 
Credit 
of 
US$18.0 
million 
for 
the 
First 
Phase 
(Education 
Sector 
Development 
Project) 
would 
start 
in 
September 
2003. 
The 
Credit 
would 
be 
disbursed 
under 
traditional 
disbursement 
methods 
(Special 
Account, 
SOEs, 
direct 
payments 
and 
special 
commitments). 
The 
expected 
closing 
date 
is 
March 
31,200s.

(iv) 
training

operating 
costs. 
The 
required 
supporting 
documentation 
would 
be 
retained 
by 
the 
PCU 
for 
at 
least 
one 
year 
after 
receipt 
by 
IDA 
of 
the 
audit 
report 
for 
the 
year 
in 
which 
the 
last 
disbursement 
was 
made. 
This 
documentation 
would 
be 
made 
available 
for 
review 
by 
the 
auditors 
and 
by 
visiting 
Bank 
staff 
upon 
request. 
Special 
account: 
To 
facilitate 
timely 
project 
implementation, 
the 
PCU 
would 
establish, 
maintain 
and 
operate 
a 
Special 
Account 
in 
US 
dollars 
in 
a 
commercial 
bank 
under 
conditions 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
the 
Special 
Account 
for 
the 
proposed 
Project 
would 
be 
maintained 
at 
the 
International 
Bank 
of 
Azerbaijan, 
the 
bank 
currently 
holding 
the 
accounts 
for 
the 
ongoing 
project. 
During 
the 
early 
stage 
of 
the 
project, 
the 
initial 
allocation 
of 
the 
Special 
Account 
would 
be 
limited 
to 
US$250,000. 
When

of 
all 
outstanding 
special 
commitments

Credit 
have 
reached 
the 
level 
of 
SDR7.0 
million, 
the 
initial 
allocation 
may 
be 
increased

of 
US$SOO,OOO 
by 
submitting

About 
Azerbaijan 
Education 
Sector 
Policy 
This 
letter 
describes 
the 
Azerbaijan 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Policy 
and 
gives 
an 
account 
of 
the 
present 
status 
of 
the 
education 
system 
in 
the 
Republic 
of 
Azerbaijan 
within 
the 
context 
of 
society 
and 
governance. 
It 
also 
determines 
a 
number 
of 
urgent 
priorities 
and 
reform 
strategies 
focused 
on 
development 
of 
general 
compulsory 
secondary 
education 
(grades 
l-1 
1). 
Azerbaijan 
Education 
System 
The 
Republic 
of 
Azerbaijan 
(Azerbaijan) 
has 
inherited 
a 
developed 
education 
system 
from 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union 
(FSU). 
Current 
statistics 
for 
all 
levels 
of 
education 
show 
Azerbaijan 
as 
comparable 
to 
the 
middle-income 
countries, 
and 
ahead 
of 
a 
number 
of 
FSU 
countries 
in 
the 
field 
of 
education. 
Today, 
Azerbaijan 
is 
developing 
the 
necessary 
reform 
program 
for 
its 
education 
sector 
to 
satisfy 
the 
requirements 
of 
an 
independent 
state 
and 
market 
economy, 
while 
attempting 
to 
preserve 
the 
positive 
achievements 
of 
the 
former 
education 
system. 
The 
present 
education 
system 
of 
Azerbaijan 
includes 
general 
education 
programs 
and 
vocational 
and 
professional 
programs. 
The 
general 
education 
system 
consists 
of 
pre-school 
education 
(ages 
3-6) 
and 
general 
secondary 
education 
(grades 
l-11). 
The 
vocational 
and 
professional 
education 
system 
includes: 
(i) 
vocational 
schools 
and 
lyceums; 
(ii) 
technicums; 
and 
(iii) 
institutions 
of 
higher 
education. 
In 
2002, 
the 
distribution 
of 
students 
was 
as 
follows: 
120,000 
pupils 
in 
pre-school 
education 
institutions, 
1,640,OOO 
students 
in 
general 
schools 
(grades 
l-1 
1), 
22,900 
students 
in 
vocational 
schools 
and 
lyceums, 
42,600 
students 
in 
technicums, 
and 
119,700 
students 
in 
higher 
education 
institutions. 
At 
present, 
the 
general 
education 
system 
consists 
of 
1,794 
pre-school 
facilities, 
4,532 
general 
schools, 
including 
43 
1 
primary 
(grades 
l-4), 
926 
basic 
(grades 
l-9), 
3,156 
secondary 
(grades 
l-1 
l), 
and 
19 
private 
schools. 
There 
are 
a 
total 
of 
235,000 
teachers 
in 
these 
schools. 
In 
2002, 
AZM 
1082.3 
billion 
(US$ 
221.1 
million) 
were 
allocated 
to 
the 
education 
sector 
from 
the 
state 
budget, 
which 
represented 
an 
increase 
of 
AZM 
134 
billion 
(USS 
27.4 
million), 
or 
12.4 
percent 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
previous 
year 
allocation. 
Over 
the 
last 
several 
years, 
great 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
keep 
the 
amount 
of 
funds 
allocated 
to 
the 
education 
sector 
at 
the 
same 
level. 
Real 
salaries 
of 
teachers 
have 
been 
declining 
since 
1992, 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
several 
recent 
increases, 
teachers’ 
salaries 
still 
have 
not 
reached 
the 
desired 
level. 
One 
of 
the 
major 
features 
of 
teachers’ 
salaries 
is 
the 
reduction 
in 
average 
salary 
per 
teacher 
as 
a 
result 
of 
raising 
the 
number 
of 
teachers. 
The 
incomes 
of 
most 
teachers 
are 
affected 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
deliver 
several 
teaching 
loads 
and 
their 
workloads 
change 
periodically. 
It 
should 
be 
mentioned 
that 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
decrease 
in 
real 
salaries 
and 
decline 
in 
birth 
rate 
during 
1992-98, 
the 
number 
of 
employees 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
accounted 
for 
50 
percent 
of 
employees 
of 
all 
budgetary 
sectors 
and 
10 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
workforce 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
main 
factor 
influencing 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
teachers 
is 
small 
class 
size, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
problems 
of 
the 
school 
network. 
One 
of 
the 
important 
factors 
influencing 
this 
figure 
is 
that 
the 
minimum 
levels 
of 
the 
yearly 
and 
weekly 
teacher 
workloads 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
defined, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
fact 
that 
teachers 
workload 
has 
been 
set 
at 
the 
level 
of 
12 
hours 
per 
week, 
which 
is 
extremely 
low. 
Legal 
and 
Political 
Framework 
Clause 
42 
of 
the 
Constitution 
of 
independent 
Azerbaijan 
adopted 
in 
1995 
states 
the 
following 
about 
the 
right 
to 
education: 
“Each 
citizen 
has 
the 
right 
to 
education.” 
The 
Education 
Law 
adopted 
in 
1992, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
normative 
documents 
and 
regulations 
developed 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
(MOE), 
determined 
the 
legal 
and 
political 
framework 
of 
general 
compulsory 
secondary 
education. 
A 
new 
Education 
- 
126- 
Page  133
Law 
is 
under 
preparation 
now, 
because 
during 
the 
last 
10 
years, 
and 
political 
life 
of 
Azerbaijan 
as 
it 
has 
undergone 
transition. 
great 
changes 
have 
occurred 
in 
the 
social 
For 
this 
particular 
reason 
the 
education 
reforms 
implemented 
during 
the 
last 
five 
years 
and 
envisaged 
for 
the 
future 
are 
comprehensive 
measures 
and 
cover 
the 
education 
system 
structure, 
teaching 
and 
learning 
content, 
teacher 
education, 
teacher 
training, 
education 
research, 
education 
infrastructure, 
education 
financing 
and 
other 
spheres. 
Presidential 
decrees 
dedicated 
to 
education 
reforms 
are 
of 
great 
significance 
in 
the 
above-mentioned 
areas. 
For 
instance, 
in 
June 
1999, 
the 
Azerbaijan 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
was 
approved 
by 
Presidential 
decree. 
In 
June 
2000, 
in 
another 
Presidential 
decree, 
a 
number 
of 
important 
measures 
were 
envisaged 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
modernization 
of 
the 
education 
system 
and 
these 
measures 
have 
provided 
for 
development 
of 
a 
new 
model 
of 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
and 
teacher 
training, 
along 
with 
other 
issues. 
The 
State 
School 
Infrastructure 
Improvement 
Program 
(SSIIP) 
was 
approved 
by 
a 
Presidential 
decree 
on 
February 
17,2003. 
According 
to 
the 
Program, 
the 
Government 
plans 
to 
allocate 
about 
269 
billion 
manats 
during 
2003-2007 
for 
construction 
of 
149 
new 
schools, 
rehabilitation 
of 
408 
schools, 
and 
expansion 
of 
175 
schools 
(construction 
of 
1,328 
new 
classrooms). 
The 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Economic 
Development 
(SPPRED) 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
President 
on 
February 
20, 
2003. 
According 
to 
this 
Program, 
along 
with

also 
will 
be 
provided 
gradually 
with 
free 
textbooks 
over 
the 
next 
three 
years. 
In 
addition, 
about 
700 
students 
studying 
in 
Turkish 
universities 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
fellowships 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
US$50 
a

per 
student. 
Policy 
Development 
and 
Education 
Sector 
Reforms 
In 
1998, 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Commission 
was 
established 
by 
Presidential 
decree. 
By 
early 
1999, 
the 
Commission 
prepared 
an 
education 
strategy 
document. 
After 
it 
was 
agreed 
by 
relevant 
Government 
structures 
and 
reviewed 
by 
international 
consultants, 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
was 
approved 
by 
a 
decree 
of 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Azerbaijan 
in 
June 
1999. 
The 
reform 
strategy 
determined 
urgent 
(1999), 
short-term 
(2000-2003) 
and 
medium-term 
(2004 
and 
the 
following 
period) 
arrangements. 
The 
priorities 
of 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
strategy 
are 
as 
follows: 
(i) 
improvement 
of 
general 
education 
quality, 
especially 
the 
introduction 
of 
innovations 
in 
curriculum 
and 
teaching/learning; 
(ii) 
mastering 
of 
modem 
learning 
methods 
by 
teachers, 
improvement 
of 
teacher 
training 
systems; 
(iii) 
improvement 
of 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources; 
(iv) 
provision 
of 
equity 
and 
access 
to 
education; 
(v) 
expansion 
of 
decentralization 
measures 
and 
strengthening 
of 
accountability 
in 
planning 
and 
management 
systems; 
and 
(vi) 
rationalization 
of 
the 
school 
network. 
Development 
policy 
associated 
with 
these 
reform 
priorities 
is 
as 
follows: 
a 
Quality 
and 
Relevance 
Azerbaijan 
is 
committed 
to 
a 
sector 
policy 
that 
includes 
an 
outcomes-oriented 
system 
of 
general 
education 
that 
focuses 
on 
the 
skills, 
attitudes 
and 
values 
needed 
for 
a 
contemporary, 
democratic, 
market-oriented 
society. 
During 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
policy, 
curricula 
reform 
will 
be 
a 
priority 
area 
of 
development 
with 
the 
outcome 
being 
a 
national 
curriculum 
framework, 
national 
education 
standards 
and 
reformed 
curricula 
for 
grades 
l-1 
1. 
To 
accomplish 
these 
reforms 
the 
productive 
work 
initiated 
under 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
(Learning 
and 
Innovation 
Credit) 
will 
be 
continued. 
A 
Curriculum 
Development 
Center 
will 
be 
established 
at 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems. 
A 
number 
of 
training 
courses 
will 
be 
conducted 
to 
develop 
skills 
of 
curriculum 
developers. 
The 
MOE 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
high 
quality 
textbooks. 
Provision 
of 
free 
textbooks 
will 
be 
phased 
in 
over 
a 
period 
of 
three 
years. 
New 
generation 
textbooks 
will 
be 
published 
according 
to 
the 
requirements, 
quality 
and 
physical 
specifications 
determined 
by 
the 
MOE 
with 
emphasis 
on 
a 
private-sector 
development 
strategy. 
Strategies 
to 
more 
fully 
develop 
a 
complete 
set 
of 
materials 
and 
provide 
general 
schools 
with 
such 
materials 
will 
be

pursued. 
The 
current 
school 
libraries, 
which 
have 
very 
few 
reading 
materials 
and 
are 
ineffectively 
operated, 
will 
be 
upgraded 
as 
part 
of 
the 
planned 
school 
rehabilitation 
program. 
The 
MOE 
will 
focus 
on 
teacher 
professional 
development, 
including 
in-service 
training 
and 
pre-service 
education 
under 
the

reforms 
in 
general 
education. 
The 
productive 
work 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
teacher 
training 
initiated 
under 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
will 
be 
carried 
forward. 
In 
order 
to 
expand 
the 
use 
of 
contemporary 
teaching/learning 
methods, 
the 
implementation 
of 
effective 
training 
programs 
in 
active 
and

methods 
will 
be 
continued. 
An 
extensive 
staff 
development 
program 
will 
be 
prepared 
at 
the 
teacher 
training 
institutions, 
and 
facilities 
will 
be 
upgraded 
and 
provided 
with 
furniture 
and 
equipment. 
All 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
programs 
will 
be 
revised 
to 
provide 
introduction 
of 
contemporary 
approaches 
to 
the 
teacher 
professional

Efficiency 
and 
Financing 
The 
budget 
and 
treasury 
system 
has 
been 
established 
in 
Azerbaijan 
with 
the 
support 
of 
international 
experts, 
and 
international 
standards 
in 
the 
use 
of 
funds 
have 
been 
introduced. 
However, 
the 
present 
structure 
of 
the 
school 
network, 
combined 
with 
the 
existing 
process 
for 
formulating 
education 
expenditures, 
causes 
inefficient 
use 
of 
funds. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
view 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
school 
network 
rationalization 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
Reforms 
in 
budgeting 
of 
education 
institutions, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
range 
of 
activities 
to 
improve 
efficient 
use 
of 
financial 
resources 
will 
be 
implemented. 
The 
purpose 
is 
to 
adjust 
the 
mechanism 
of 
generation 
of 
expenditures 
with 
the 
quality 
of 
education, 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
the 
results 
of 
the 
schooling 
process 
and 
to 
improve 
school 
infrastructure. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
this 
policy 
will 
be 
based 
on 
a 
new 
approach 
to 
budgeting 
in 
the 
education 
system, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
adjustments 
that 
will 
be 
introduced 
to 
stimulate 
devolution 
of 
responsibilities 
to 
local 
authorities. 
School 
network 
rationalization 
will 
be 
implemented 
based 
on 
survey 
data 
and 
analysis. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
policy 
of 
effective 
assignment 
of 
teaching 
personnel 
in 
the 
education 
system 
will 
be 
determined, 
as 
well 
as 
various 
options 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
administrative 
and 
human 
resources 
will 
be 
developed 
and 
meanwhile 
the 
appropriate 
protection 
of 
vulnerable 
people 
will 
be 
considered. 
According 
to 
the 
decree 
of 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Azerbaijan 
signed 
in 
February 
2003, 
a 
comprehensive 
program 
of 
school 
construction 
and 
rehabilitation 
will 
be 
implemented. 
However, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
additional 
support 
for 
school 
rehabilitation. 
a 
Equity 
and 
Access 
Preliminary 
results 
of 
the 
recent 
poverty 
surveys 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
access 
to 
basic 
services 
has 
deteriorated 
and, 
in 
particular, 
residents 
of 
rural 
areas 
have 
inadequate 
access 
to 
these 
services, 
including 
inadequate 
infrastructure. 
Although 
general 
education 
schools 
are 
widely 
available 
throughout 
the 
country, 
the 
quality 
of 
general 
education 
services 
is 
affected 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
basic 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials, 
obsolescence 
of 
physical 
infrastructure 
and 
equipment 
and 
inadequate 
working 
conditions 
of 
teaching 
staff. 
Therefore, 
especially 
the 
existing 
difference 
between 
the 
levels 
of 
knowledge 
of 
urban 
and 
rural 
school 
graduates 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
serious 
concern. 
As 
noted 
above, 
the 
GOA 
and 
the 
MOE 
are 
committed 
to 
further 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
policies 
that 
address 
these 
issues. 
e 
Planning 
and 
Management 
Systematic 
reform 
of 
the 
organizational 
structure 
of 
the 
central 
MOE 
and 
the 
local 
education 
units 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
implemented. 
Under 
the 
strategy 
of 
reform 
of 
the 
general 
education 
system, 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems 
(IEP) 
will 
invite 
international 
experts 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
performance 
audit 
for 
the 
central 
MOE 
and 
the 
IEP 
to 
improve 
organizational 
structure, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
provide 
more 
effective 
use 
of 
the 
staff. 
The 
existing 
management 
capacity 
will 
be 
further 
strengthened 
through 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
an 
Education 
Management 
Information 
System 
(EMIS).

assessment 
and 
examinations 
and 
for 
policy 
analysis 
and 
planning 
will 
be 
established. 
The 
focus 
of 
the 
student 
assessment 
unit 
will 
be 
on 
national, 
sample-based 
student 
assessment 
and 
on 
further 
improvement 
of 
the 
system 
of 
school-based 
student 
assessment. 
The 
policy 
analysis 
and 
planning 
unit 
will 
support 
the 
arrangements 
focusing 
on 
the 
improvement 
of 
education 
quality. 
In 
1999, 
the 
Agreement 
for 
the 
Learning 
and 
Innovation 
Credit 
was 
concluded 
between 
the 
International 
Development 
Association 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
Azerbaijan 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project. 
The 
Project 
amounts 
to 
US$5.5 
million 
and 
the 
share 
of 
the 
GOA 
in 
this 
Project 
is 
US$ 
500,000. 
A 
number 
of 
important 
measures 
have 
been 
implemented 
under 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Project 
and 
are 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
(i) 
the 
Institute 
for 
Education 
Problems 
has 
been 
established; 
(ii) 
the 
Azerbaijan 
Teachers 
Institute, 
integrating 
pre-service 
teacher 
education, 
teacher 
training 
and 
re-training, 
has 
been 
functioning 
since 
2000 
with 
its 
headquarters 
in 
Baku 
and 
12 
regional 
affiliates; 
(iii) 
beginning 
with 
the 
2001-2002 
school 
year, 
20 
pilot 
schools 
in 
5 
regions 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Azerbaijan 
have 
been 
implementing 
new 
curricula 
in 
selected 
subjects 
in 
grades 
l-2 
and 
5-6 
while 
the 
teachers 
have 
been 
effectively 
implementing 
active 
and 
interactive 
teaching/learning 
methods; 
(iv) 
during 
2000-2002, 
about 
1,000 
teachers 
and 
110 
methodologists 
successfully 
passed 
the 
training 
courses 
in 
active 
and 
interactive 
learning 
methods; 
(v) 
new 
textbooks 
on 
Literature, 
History, 
Russian 
language 
and 
Russian 
literature 
for 
grades 
5 
and 
6 
have 
been 
developed 
and 
are 
being 
printed 
now; 
(vi) 
school-based 
student 
assessment 
approaches 
have 
been 
improved; 
and 
(vii) 
detailed 
information 
about 
education 
reforms 
and 
modem 
aspects 
of 
education 
development 
are 
available 
in 
the 
country 
as 
a 
result 
of 
various 
training 
courses 
and 
study 
tours 
abroad. 
The 
experience, 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
gained 
under 
the 
Learning 
and 
Innovation 
Loan 
have 
created 
a 
good 
prerequisite 
for 
further 
expansion 
of 
the 
education 
sector 
reforms. 
In 
this 
regard, 
in 
early 
2002, 
the 
GOA 
determined 
strategic 
priorities 
of 
education 
sector 
reform 
for 
the 
next 
ten 
years. 
The 
Government 
has 
applied 
to 
the 
World 
Bank 
to 
receive 
assistance 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Credit 
in 
order 
to 
implement 
the 
urgent 
measures 
envisaged, 
starting 
with 
the 
first 
phase 
(2003-2007). 
It 
is 
planned 
to 
further 
expand 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
during 
the 
second 
(2007-2010) 
and 
the 
third 
(2010-2013) 
phases.

Annex 
13: 
Selection 
Criteria 
for 
the 
Pilot 
Districts 
AZERBAIJAN: 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Project 
Azerbaijan 
is 
composed 
of 
65 
districts 
including 
6 
districts 
of 
Nakhchivan 
Autonomous 
Republic 
and 
11 
cities. 
Nine 
(9) 
districts 
and 
2 
cities 
are 
under 
occupation 
and 
one 
district 
is 
partially 
occupied, 
and 
therefore, 
these 
territories 
are 
not 
accessible 
for 
central 
Government 
and 
can 
not 
be 
included 
into 
projects 
funded 
by 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Priority 
of 
the 
Governrnent 
was 
that: 
(i) 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
proposed 
APC 
covers 
both 
mountainous 
and 
plains 
districts 
as 
well 
as 
rural 
and 
urban 
districts, 
and 
(ii) 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
from 
the 
point 
of 
poverty 
districts 
are 
covered 
by 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
the 
APL. 
Due 
to 
lack 
of 
poverty 
prevalence 
data 
disaggregated 
at 
district 
level, 
some 
available 
proxy 
indicators 
were 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
poverty 
level 
in 
districts 
of 
Azerbaijan. 
These 
indicators 
included 
“Average 
salary 
(AZM/mo)“; 
“Fee 
for 
services 
per 
capita 
(AZM)“; 
“Contractual 
Construction 
per 
capita 
(AZM)“; 
and 
“Number 
of 
cars 
per 
hundred 
families”. 
Considering 
the 
proposed 
reforms 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
education 
improvement 
and 
efficiency 
and 
finance, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
following 
criteria 
would 
also 
be 
used 
to 
select 
pilot 
districts 
in 
the 
First 
Phase 
of 
APL: 
number 
of 
schools; 
number 
of 
school 
students; 
average 
school 
size; 
students/teachers 
ratio; 
percentage 
of 
students 
attending 
2nd 
and 
3rd 
shifts; 
and 
higher 
education 
admission 
rates 
(as 
a 
proxy 
for 
general 
education 
quality). 
In 
addition, 
experience 
of 
social 
reforms 
in 
different 
sectors 
in 
Azerbaijan 
indicates 
that 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
predictors 
of 
successful 
project 
implementation 
is 
the 
readiness 
and 
willingness 
of 
local 
sector 
authorities 
in 
the 
districts 
to 
undergo 
changes, 
and 
the 
level 
of 
support 
for 
reforms 
by 
local 
executive 
power. 
Therefore, 
commitment 
to 
reforms 
or 
“reform-mindedness” 
of 
local 
education 
administration 
and 
local 
executives 
were 
also 
considered 
in 
the 
selection 
process. 
Ismayilli 
(Rural

Student 
per 
teacher 
ratio 
in 
this 
district 
is 
one 
of 
the 
lowest 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
provides 
space 
for 
efficiency 
improvement 
and 
rationalization 
measures 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
the 
pilot 
phase.

close 
to 
the

This 
provides 
some 
opportunities

is 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
results 
of 
this 
process. 
Overall 
Results 
of 
Assessment 
The 
institutional 
assessment 
process 
provided 
several 
key 
results 
for 
the 
MOE, 
that 
have 
implications 
for 
the 
overall 
implementation 
of 
the 
ERP, 
as 
follows: 
The 
Soviet-era 
education 
system 
in 
Azerbaijan 
was 
highly 
centralized 
and 
prohibited 
the 
establishment 
of 
schooling 
that 
was 
more 
attuned 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
Azerbaijan 
society; 
much 
of 
the 
centralized 
management 
and 
administration 
remains; 
While 
examples 
of 
various 
reform 
initiatives 
are 
evident 
(e.g. 
the 
use 
of 
representative 
school 
councils 
and 
the 
trial 
of 
school 
self-assessment), 
the 
overall 
structure 
of 
education 
management 
has 
not 
been 
subjected 
to 
reform 
and 
the 
several 
school-based 
reform 
initiatives 
are 
not 
systematic 
or 
broadly 
encompassing 
of 
reformed 
management 
functions; 
The 
MOE 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
series 
of 
departments, 
divisions 
and 
specialized 
units, 
each 
with 
their 
own 
strategies 
and 
plans; 
there 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
synergy; 
As 
an 
organization 
the 
MOE 
attempts 
to 
reform 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
organization, 
rather 
than 
the 
results 
of 
the 
organization. 
The 
main 
development 
objective 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOE 
to 
plan 
and 
manage 
the 
reform 
project, 
and 
to 
initiate 
priority 
investments. 
In 
recognition 
of 
this 
objective 
and 
the 
conditions 
stated 
above, 
the 
MOE 
has 
agreed 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
PCU. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
leadership, 
management 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
MOE’s 
reform 
program. 
As 
such, 
the 
PCU 
will 
have 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
implementation 
of 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP. 
The 
TOR 
for 
the 
PCU 
is 
provided 
in 
Annex 
2 
of 
the 
PIP. 
New 
Organizational 
Structures 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
newly 
established 
PCU, 
as 
described 
above, 
three 
(3) 
new 
organizational 
entities 
will 
be 
established 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP: 
(i) 
National 
Center 
for 
Student 
Assessment 
(NCSA); 
(ii) 
Education 
Management 
information 
System 
Unit 
(EMISU), 
and 
(iii) 
Planning 
and 
Policy 
Analysis 
Unit 
(PPAU). 
Circumstances, 
and 
institutional 
assessment 
results 
as 
related 
to 
each, 
are 
summarized 
and 
presented 
below.

Student 
Assessment. 
The 
main 
approach 
to 
student 
assessment 
is 
a 
school-based 
system 
that 
remains 
teacher-centered. 
It 
is 
quite 
complex, 
but 
a 
highly 
subjective 
system 
mainly 
because 
of: 
(i) 
absence 
of 
national 
learning 
assessment 
standards, 
(ii) 
lack 
of 
training 
of 
teachers 
in 
contemporary 
assessment 
techniques, 
and 
(iii) 
absence 
of 
qualitative 
assessment 
information 
and 
materials 
in 
textbooks 
and 
other 
materials. 
In 
general 
students 
are 
assessed 
on 
a 
5-point 
scale/system, 
with 
recent 
attempts 
to 
move 
to 
a 
9-point 
scale/system. 
The 
main 
examination 
is 
an 
1 
lth 
grade 
school 
leaving 
examination, 
developed 
by 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
schools. 
No 
sample-based 
national 
assessments 
are 
conducted. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
NCSA 
in 
the 
MOE 
will 
address 
the 
issues 
stated 
above 
by 
implementing 
an 
improved 
system 
of 
school-based 
assessment 
that 
will 
include 
materials 
developed 
by 
international 
and 
national 
consultants 
and 
a 
national 
training 
program 
for 
teachers. 
In 
addition 
the 
NCSA 
will 
undertake 
the 
development 
and 
administration 
of 
sample-based 
student 
assessments 
at 
grades 
4 
and 
9 
and 
the 
development 
of 
an 
improved 
1 
lth 
grade 
school 
leaving 
examination. 
A 
major 
effort 
will 
be 
implemented 
to 
develop 
national 
learning 
assessment 
standards, 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
national 
education 
standards 
developed 
in 
curriculum 
reform. 
The 
newly 
appointed 
staff 
of 
the 
NCSA 
will 
participate 
in 
an 
in-country 
training 
program 
in: 
developing 
standards, 
writing 
items, 
constructing 
assessment 
instruments 
and 
marking 
schemes, 
item 
analysis 
and 
reporting 
of 
assessment 
and 
examination 
results. 
(ii) 
Education 
Management 
Information 
System. 
The 
MOE 
has 
no 
department 
or 
unit 
for 
EMIS 
and 
there 
is 
no 
organized 
expertise 
or 
experience 
for 
system 
management 
and 
administration. 
Each 
department, 
unit 
or 
office 
sets 
its 
own 
approach 
to 
usage. 
Similarly 
at 
the 
rayon-level, 
there 
is 
no 
organized 
expertise 
or 
experience 
for 
EMIS 
management, 
administration 
or 
usage. 
At 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
rayons 
there 
are 
numerous 
manual 
databases. 
Utilization 
of 
the 
manual 
databases 
is: 
(i) 
labor 
intensive, 
(ii) 
a 
slow 
process 
by 
which 
to 
aggregate 
data, 
with 
related 
difficulties 
in 
analysis, 
(iii) 
time 
consuming, 
(iv) 
prone 
to 
lack 
of 
possibilities 
to 
check 
the 
validity 
of 
data, 
and 
(v) 
leading 
to 
only 
limited 
amounts 
of 
data 
being 
available 
to 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
administrative 
units. 
Obviously, 
with 
the 
limitations 
of 
the 
manual 
databases, 
there 
is 
no 
centralized 
policy 
for 
gathering 
or 
handling 
data, 
that 
could 
be 
applied 
to 
an 
EMIS. 
There 
is 
a 
real 
demand 
and 
interest 
at 
the 
MOE 
and 
rayons 
for 
the 
development 
and 
use 
of 
an 
EMIS. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
EMIS 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP 
will 
address 
the 
issues 
stated 
above. 
Until 
such 
time 
as 
the 
EMISU 
is 
fully 
functional, 
and 
the 
staff 
has 
received 
key 
initial 
training, 
the 
sub-component 
will 
be 
coordinated 
by 
the 
Director, 
Baku 
Computer 
College. 
Due 
to 
the 
total 
educational 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
MOE, 
this 
type 
of 
coordination 
can 
be 
arranged 
and 
implemented 
effectively. 
The 
extensive 
training 
program 
for 
the 
personnel 
of 
the 
EMISU 
is 
provided 
in 
Annex 
21 
of 
this 
PIP. 
(iii) 
Planning 
and 
Policy 
Analysis. 
Due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
overall 
reform 
and 
restructuring 
in 
the 
central 
MOE 
(as 
noted 
above), 
planning 
and 
policy 
analysis 
is 
carried 
out 
in 
a 
centralized 
manner 
by 
the 
senior 
management 
of 
the 
MOE. 
These 
personnel 
are 
not 
supported 
by 
a 
department 
or 
unit 
that 
is 
staffed 
by 
a 
core 
cadre 
of 
personnel 
with 
special 
skills 
or 
training. 
This 
situation 
is 
further 
exacerbated 
by 
a 
lack 
of 
an 
EMIS 
and 
higher 
qualifications 
programs 
for 
educational 
personnel 
at 
institutions 
of 
higher 
education. 
The 
establishment 
of, 
and 
support 
by 
international 
technical 
assistance 
under 
the 
ERP, 
a 
Planning 
and 
Policy 
Analysis 
Unit 
(PPAU) 
within 
the 
PCU 
will 
address 
these 
issues.

Curriculum 
Reform. 
The 
IEP 
was 
designated 
to 
be 
the 
lead 
curriculum 
reform 
and 
development 
entity 
for 
the 
MOE. 
Leadership 
and 
ownership 
of 
the 
curriculum 
development 
process 
has 
not 
been 
realized. 
There 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
a 
clear 
organizational 
structure 
to 
direct 
curricula 
reform; 
insufficient 
number 
of 
trained 
curricula 
development 
specialists; 
and 
an 
ill-defined 
approach 
to 
development. 
Each 
of 
these 
key 
issues 
will 
be 
addressed 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP. 
Textbooks 
and 
Libraries. 
The 
Textbook 
Approval 
Board 
(TAB) 
and 
the 
Textbook 
Department 
are 
functioning 
to 
lead 
the 
development 
and 
provision 
of 
textbooks. 
The 
GOA 
is 
developing, 
and 
the 
MOE 
will 
implement, 
a 
revised 
textbook 
policy. 
Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
so 
the 
TAB 
and 
the 
Textbook 
Department 
can 
be 
more 
effectively 
functional 
within 
this 
environment. 
Teacher 
Training. 
Key 
personnel 
in 
teacher 
training 
have 
been 
involved 
in 
recent 
reforms. 
A 
core 
program 
has 
been 
developed 
for 
training 
teachers 
in 
contemporary 
teaching/learning 
methods. 
This 
program 
will 
be 
strengthened 
and 
institutionalized 
under 
the 
ERI? 
The 
capacity 
of 
the 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
(TTIs), 
especially 
the 
Azerbaijan 
Teachers 
Institute, 
and 
its 
regional 
affiliates, 
will 
be 
improved 
by 
the 
provision 
of 
basic 
furnishings, 
equipment 
and 
resource 
materials 
under 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
ERP. 
Teacher 
Education. 
As 
with 
the 
central 
MOE, 
no 
substantial 
reforms 
have 
been 
undertaken 
at 
the 
institutions 
(technicurns 
and 
universities) 
that 
provide 
pre-service 
teacher 
education 
programs. 
The 
programs, 
especially 
beyond 
grades 
l-4 
of 
primary 
education, 
are 
extremely 
narrowly 
defined, 
and 
subject-based. 
There 
has 
been 
a 
significant 
lack 
of 
opportunities 
for 
staff 
development 
for 
faculty 
members. 
Most 
institutions 
lack 
equipment 
and 
resource 
materials. 
These 
issues 
will 
be 
addressed 
under 
the 
ERP 
by 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
for 
program 
reform 
and 
staff 
development. 
Information 
and 
Communication 
Technologies 
(ICT). 
The 
MOE 
has 
no 
active 
ICT 
program. 
There 
is 
an 
informatics 
curriculum 
that 
is 
part 
of 
the 
mathematics 
program. 
It 
is 
taught 
primarily 
in 
a 
classroom 
setting 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
computer 
equipment 
(except 
in 
a 
few 
schools 
in 
urban 
rayons 
and 
the 
pilot 
schools 
equipped 
under 
the 
Education 
LIL). 
There 
is 
no 
ICT 
policy 
in 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
related 
Center 
for 
Instructional 
Technology 
at 
the 
IEP 
is 
generally 
non-functional. 
A 
strategy 
for 
development 
in 
ICT 
will 
be 
developed 
based 
on 
the 
consultant’s 
work 
that 
is 
to 
conclude 
on 
or 
about 
15 
March 
2003. 
Budgeting, 
Financing 
and 
Rationalization 
of 
Schools 
Network. 
The 
MOE 
relies 
on 
an 
outdated 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
system. 
The 
Economics 
Department 
and 
the 
rayon 
Departments 
of 
Education 
lack 
the 
authority 
and 
expertise 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
more 
effective, 
efficient 
and 
equitable 
systems. 
Via 
protocol 
(Annex 
25 
to 
the 
PIP), 
the 
MOE 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
are 
committed 
to 
working 
toward 
financing 
and 
budgeting 
reforms 
that 
can 
be 
tested 
in 
three 
(3) 
pilot 
rayons. 
Similarly, 
the 
network 
of 
schools 
leads 
to 
additional 
inefficiencies 
in 
the 
system. 
There 
is 
a 
general 
lack 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
and 
procedures 
to 
proceed 
with 
rationalization 
of 
the 
schools 
network. 
Accordingly, 
international 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
utilized 
to 
organize 
and 
guide 
the 
process 
in 
the 
three 
(3) 
pilot 
rayons. 
The 
TOR 
for 
these 
services 
is 
provided 
in 
Annex 
22 
to 
the 
PIP. 
Based 
on 
rationalization 
plans, 
schools 
will 
be 
selected 
and 
rehabilitated. 
This 
process 
will 
be 
managed

Education 
in 
Post-socialist 
era 
in 
Azerbaiian: 
Social 
Assessment 
At 
independence, 
Azerbaijan’s 
relatively 
well-developed 
education 
system 
enjoyed 
high 
enrollment 
rates 
at 
all 
levels. 
Currently, 
Azerbaijan 
is 
trying 
to 
retain 
the 
positive 
achievements 
of 
the 
Soviet 
era 
education 
system 
while 
transitioning 
to 
a 
market 
economy 
and 
a 
democratic 
government. 
In 
pursuing 
these 
difficult 
to 
reconcile 
goals, 
the 
Azerbaijan 
education 
system 
has 
become 
susceptible 
to 
many 
common 
ailments. 
Major 
problems 
identified 
and 
addressed 
by 
this 
study 
include 
weak 
accountability, 
deterioration 
of 
educational 
quality, 
and 
growing 
inequalities 
in 
access 
to 
quality 
schooling. 
[This 
section 
is 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
carried 
out 
as 
part 
of 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Education 
Sector 
Development 
Project 
(see 
Shahriari, 
et 
al.,

Obiectives 
of 
Study 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
is 
to 
understand 
the 
experiences 
and 
the 
different 
perspectives 
of 
people 
closely 
involved 
in 
the 
education 
system 
-students 
and 
teachers, 
parents 
and 
school 
directors.

Research 
Design 
and 
Fieldwork 
This 
study 
began 
with 
a 
review 
of 
background 
literature 
on 
Azerbaijan, 
and 
interviews 
with 
key 
inforrnants, 
such 
as 
officials 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
pedagogical 
experts, 
representatives 
of 
NGOs 
working 
in 
education, 
and 
local 
officials. 
This 
preliminary 
work 
informed 
the 
study’s 
design. 
The 
study 
consists 
of 
two 
core 
components: 
Page  151
0 
a 
Ouantitative: 
A 
survey 
of 
roughly 
1,200 
parents 
of 
school-age 
children 
or 
university 
students 
was 
undertaken 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
nationally 
representative 
household 
sample 
of 
2,3 
14 
drawn 
from 
a 
data 
base 
provided 
by 
the 
State 
Statistical 
Agency. 
Each 
parent 
was 
asked 
a 
set 
of 
questions 
concerning 
each 
school-aged 
child 
in 
the 
family. 
The 
sample 
has 
been 
weighted 
by 
urban 
residence. 
[The 
response 
rate 
in 
Baku 
was 
lower 
than 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
country 
and 
the 
data 
was 
weighted 
accordingly. 
However, 
analysis 
shows 
that 
the 
Baku 
sample 
includes 
a 
disproportionately 
low 
share 
of 
wealthy 
families 
when 
compared 
to 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
country. 
This 
may 
reflect 
a 
sample 
selection 
bias.] 
(b) 
Qualitative: 
Interviews 
and 
focus 
groups 
were 
conducted 
with 
stakeholders 
and 
informants, 
including: 
teachers, 
principals, 
parents, 
students, 
donors, 
local 
business 
people, 
representatives 
of 
teacher 
organizations, 
and 
education 
officials 
in 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Education 
and 
Finance. 
A 
total 
of 
2 
10 
interviews 
and 
25 
focus 
group 
sessions 
were 
conducted 
across 
8 
sites: 
Baku, 
Ali 
Bayramli, 
Ganja, 
Agstafa, 
Northern 
Azerbaijan 
Geychay, 
Lankaran, 
and 
Nakhchivan. 
These 
sites 
included 
both 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas 
and 
a 
diversity 
of 
geographical 
locations 
and 
socio-economic 
backgrounds. 
Because 
they 
were 
not 
covered 
in 
the 
quantitative 
section, 
the 
qualitative 
interviews 
and 
focus 
groups 
that 
elicited 
input 
from 
students 
and 
teachers 
were 
particularly 
useful. 
Fieldwork 
for 
both 
the 
qualitative 
interviews 
and 
household 
survey 
was 
carried 
out 
by 
a 
team 
of 
university 
lecturers, 
graduate 
students 
and 
led 
by 
two 
Azerbaijani 
social 
scientists. 
The 
team 
was 
trained 
in 
the 
classroom 
and 
during 
fieldwork 
in 
the 
pilot 
phase 
in 
Baku. 
Main 
Findings 
0 
a 
Institutional 
Incentive 
Structures: 
The 
most 
serious 
structural 
problem 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
objective 
accountability 
mechanisms. 
The 
Azerbaijani 
education 
system 
empowers 
many 
administrators 
with 
significant 
unchecked 
authority 
at 
the 
local 
and 
central 
levels. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
personnel, 
school 
directors 
and 
heads 
of 
district 
education 
offices 
have 
tremendous 
discretion 
over 
hiring, 
promotion, 
and 
assigning 
work 
hours. 
In 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
well-intentioned 
director, 
such 
discretion 
could 
be 
used 
to 
promote 
better 
education. 
However, 
with 
so 
little 
transparency, 
there 
is 
room 
for 
the 
misuse 
of 
authority. 
Similarly, 
the 
budgetary 
and 
expenditure 
implementation 
system 
allows 
for 
a 
certain 
level 
of 
unaccountable 
discretion. 
The 
answer 
in 
these 
cases 
is 
not 
an 
increase 
in 
central 
control 
since 
there 
is 
no 
evidence 
that 
central 
authorities 
are 
any 
more 
accountable 
than 
local 
authorities. 
Instead, 
community 
level 
mechanisms 
of 
accountability, 
such 
as 
parents’ 
committees, 
should 
be 
promoted 
to 
ensure 
appropriate 
use 
of 
educational 
resources. 
(b) 
Available 
data 
suggest 
that 
general 
education 
graduates 
do 
not 
meet 
adequately 
the 
Oualitw 
skill 
and 
knowledge 
demands 
of 
the 
market 
economy. 
Moreover 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
has 
been 
deteriorating 
according 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
parents 
and 
teachers. 
The 
following 
are 
some 
the 
reasons 
mentioned 
for 
such 
decline 
in 
quality: 
0 
i 
Lack 
of 
accountability. 
The 
quality 
of 
the 
education 
system 
suffers 
primarily 
from 
a 
lack 
of 
accountability. 
There 
are 
few 
mechanisms 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
curriculum, 
textbooks, 
or 
teacher 
training 
have 
achieved 
their 
goals. 
There 
is 
no 
system 
of 
national 
assessment, 
which 
severely 
limits 
accountability 
in 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
areas, 
including 
personnel 
and 
expenditure. 
The 
accountability 
problem 
feeds 
into 
the 
problems 
outlined 
under 
institutional 
incentive 
structure, 
by 
enabling 
individuals 
to 
abuse 
power 
or 
shirk 
responsibilities.

Curriculum 
development 
process. 
Governance 
over 
curriculum 
is 
highly 
centralized, 
despite 
the 
introduction 
of 
pilot 
curricula 
in 
a 
number 
of 
schools 
during 
the 
past 
decade.

certain 
level 
of 
country-wide 
centralization 
over 
curriculum 
has 
important 
advantages. 
The 
centrally 
approved 
school 
curricula 
was 
developed 
without 
sufficient 
inputs 
through 
a 
consultative 
and 
participation 
process 
(involving 
teachers, 
parents, 
business 
community 
and 
so 
forth), 
and 
does 
not 
enable 
local 
level 
innovation. 
Additionally, 
the 
curriculum 
does 
not 
evolve 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
modem 
innovations. 
For 
example, 
the 
existing 
curricula 
continues 
to 
rely 
on 
rote 
memorization.

Teacher 
development. 
Teacher 
development 
(both 
pre-service 
and 
in-service) 
is 
another 
factor 
effecting 
the 
deterioration 
of 
educational 
quality. 
Pre-service 
teacher 
education 
institutions 
still 
use 
an 
outdated 
curricula/pedagogy 
which 
is 
unresponsive 
to

Also, 
there 
is 
a 
shortage 
of 
teachers 
in 
certain 
subjects 
(e.g.,

computers/information

especially 
in 
rural

Qualified 
teachers 
in 
these 
subjects 
are 
under-represented 
in 
rural

This 
impacts 
both 
the

in 
these

In-service

Access 
to 
textbook 
is 
a 
problem 
for 
many 
students 
in 
grades 
5-l 
1 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas. 
While 
the 
Government 
provides 
textbooks 
for 
grades 
l-4, 
students 
in 
grades 
5-l 
1 
are 
required 
to 
purchase 
textbooks. 
About 
30-40 
percent 
of 
students 
do 
not 
have 
textbooks 
in 
grades 
5-l 
1. 
It 
is 
also 
reported 
that 
textbook 
quality 
may 
need 
to 
be 
improved. 
Interviews 
with 
teachers 
reveal 
the 
following 
problems 
with 
textbooks, 
including: 
(1) 
language 
that 
is 
inappropriate 
for 
the

Poor 
learning 
environment. 
The 
physical 
condition 
of 
schools 
has 
deteriorated 
in 
recent 
years 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
maintenance, 
and 
interruptions 
in 
electricity 
and 
water 
supply. 
Subsequently, 
the 
classroom 
environment 
is 
not 
conducive 
for 
learning. 
For 
example, 
20 
percent 
of 
families 
report 
having 
no 
heat 
at 
all 
in 
their 
children’s 
schools. 
Due 
to 
the 
poor 
learning 
environment, 
qualitative 
reports 
suggest 
that 
teachers 
and 
students 
are 
demoralized 
and 
have 
little 
incentives 
to 
remain 
in 
schools. 
Moreover, 
in 
urban 
areas 
(e.g., 
Baku) 
there 
are 
not 
enough 
classrooms 
to 
support 
the 
current 
number 
of 
students. 
To 
cope 
with 
this 
lack 
of 
classroom 
space, 
75 
percent 
of 
urban 
schools 
use 
either 
two 
or 
three 
shifts 
per 
day. 
This 
severely 
impacts 
the 
amount 
of 
instruction 
time 
each 
child 
receives.

Stakeholder 
Perceptions. 
According 
to 
the 
survey 
data, 
most 
parents 
continue 
to 
value 
education 
and 
have 
a 
positive 
perception 
of 
teachers. 
However, 
parents 
worry 
that 
the 
education 
system 
does 
a 
poor 
job 
of 
preparing 
students 
for 
the 
workplace. 
Among 
urban 
families, 
the 
majority 
of 
parents 
believe 
that 
informal 
payments 
are 
more 
important 
than 
education 
in 
obtaining 
jobs. 
Active 
parental 
participation 
in 
education 
is 
relatively 
low. 
While 
66 
percent 
of 
parents 
report 
contributing 
to 
general 
collections, 
less 
than 
30 
percent 
report 
any 
involvement 
in 
parents’ 
committees. 
Just 
10 
percent 
report 
doing

At 
the

a 
much 
greater 
share

Equity 
and 
Access. 
The 
study 
identifies 
key 
areas 
of 
inequality 
in 
access 
to 
education 
between 
rich 
and 
poor 
and 
between 
urban 
and 
rural 
residents. 
Children 
in 
wealthier 
and 
urban 
families 
have 
access 
to 
significantly 
better 
educational 
opportunities 
than 
their 
poorer 
and 
more 
rural 
counterparts. 
Their 
schools 
are 
better 
equipped 
and 
they 
have 
better 
access 
to 
more 
qualified 
teachers. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
they 
have 
more 
access 
to 
private 
tutoring 
which 
always 
get 
translated 
to 
higher 
chances 
of 
entering 
higher 
educational 
institutes. 
Informal 
payments 
affect 
equity 
in 
some 
unexpected 
ways. 
Informal 
payments, 
which 
are 
often 
used 
to 
buy 
grades, 
are 
more 
prevalent 
among 
wealthy 
and 
urban 
schools. 
Poor 
and 
rural 
parents 
simply 
do 
not 
have 
the 
resources 
for 
such 
payments. 
Access 
to 
textbooks 
represents 
a 
particularly 
vexing 
problem. 
Roughly 
60 
percent 
of 
children 
in 
upper 
grades 
(grades 
5-l 
1) 
do 
not 
have 
all 
of 
the 
textbooks 
they 
need. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
problem 
in 
lower 
grades 
even 
though 
textbooks 
are 
officially 
provided 
by 
the 
school 
for 
free. 
According 
to 
the 
result 
of 
the 
household 
survey, 
over 
a 
third 
of 
parents 
of 
younger 
children 
in 
grades 
l-4 
pay 
for 
textbooks. 
Between 
20 
and 
30 
percent 
of 
such 
families 
report 
not

in 
the 
types 
of

that 
better 
help 
us 
to 
distinguish 
the 
source 
and 
impact 
of 
informal 
payments 
within 
education. 
First 
is 
the 
distinction 
between 
quality 
promoting 
and 
quality 
undermining 
payments. 
Payments 
for 
tutoring,

into 
a 
better 
school, 
getting 
more 
attention 
as 
well 
as 
general 
collection 
payments 
for 
school 
repair 
are 
quality 
promoting. 
Quality 
undermining 
payments 
are 
the 
most 
pernicious. 
Policy 
measures 
proposed 
to 
reduce 
quality 
undermining 
informal 
payments 
include 
increased 
official 
public 
commitment 
to 
the 
elimination 
of 
such 
payments, 
decreased 
unilateral 
discretion 
by 
education 
officials, 
and 
increased 
use 
of 
objective 
measures 
for 
educational 
performance 
(i.e. 
standardized 
tests).

Recommendations. 
The 
education 
system 
of 
Azerbaijan 
lacks 
effective 
accountability 
mechanisms 
and 
is 
too 
centralized 
when 
setting 
curriculum 
and 
textbook 
content. 
Also, 
there 
is 
not 
a 
reliable 
and 
objective 
means 
for 
determining 
whether 
an 
educational 
policy 
is 
working. 
The 
creation 
of 
such 
feedback 
mechanisms 
are 
essential. 
Formulation 
of 
curriculum, 
textbooks, 
teacher 
training, 
and 
educational 
policy 
need 
greater 
stakeholders 
participation. 
Increased 
curriculum 
flexibility 
in 
conjunction 
with 
new 
mechanisms 
for 
parental 
involvement 
could 
also 
improve 
accountability. 
National 
curriculum 
should 
retain 
key 
centralized 
components, 
but 
with 
more 
flexibility, 
it 
could 
respond

Staff 
selection

should

This 
would 
encourage 
administrators

of 
their

to 
develop

Curricula 
should 
be 
realigned 
with 
social 
and 
economic 
conditions. 
This 
move 
would 
be 
strongly 
supported 
by 
many 
stakeholders, 
and 
requires 
close 
and 
ongoing 
consultation 
with 
them. 
If 
curricula 
are 
to 
be 
more 
responsive 
to 
student 
needs, 
decision-making 
must 
be 
brought 
closer 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
school; 
curricula 
should 
also 
be 
more 
flexible 
to 
allow 
students 
to 
develop 
their 
own 
interests 
and 
abilities. 
University 
entrance 
examinations 
should 
be 
consistent 
with 
general 
education 
curricula 
to 
ensure 
that 
university-bound 
students 
receive 
the 
appropriate 
preparation 
for 
university 
entrance. 
More 
coordination, 
better 
preparation 
and, 
given 
student 
and 
parental 
worries, 
demonstrable 
evidence 
that 
secondary 
school 
preparation 
was 
sufficient 
for 
preparing 
for 
entrance 
exams 
-- 
would 
reduce 
the 
need 
for 
private 
tutoring 
(a 
source 
of 
inequity 
and 
a 
barrier 
to 
access). 
Schools 
should 
inaugurate 
some 
form 
of 
school 
counseling 
for 
students 
about 
post-graduation 
options. 
Textbook 
production 
would 
benefit 
from 
the 
increased 
participation 
of 
teachers, 
who 
have 
day 
to 
day 
experience 
in 
using 
them. 
Textbook 
production 
should 
be 
closely 
linked 
to 
curriculum 
reform, 
so 
that 
textbooks 
for 
each 
class 
build 
upon 
the 
knowledge 
that 
students 
are 
expected 
to 
have 
from 
their 
previous

involved 
in 
demanding 
second 
jobs

to 
abuse 
their 
authority, 
teaching 
salaries 
must 
be 
raised. 
Moreover, 
salary 
schedules 
and 
merit

should 
provide 
incentives 
for 
teachers 
to 
improve 
their 
skills, 
to 
demonstrate 
initiative, 
and 
put 
energy 
into 
their 
work. 
In-service 
teacher 
training 
should 
be 
provided, 
not 
only 
to 
raise 
skill 
levels, 
but 
provide 
an 
additional 
incentive

pre-service

training 
should 
be 
developed 
through 
close 
collaboration 
with 
teachers

other 
educators, 
so 
that 
it 
reflects 
their 
needs

strategy. 
The

used

payments, 
and 
reducing 
the 
direct

other 
non-transparent 
contributions 
(e.g., 
parental 
contribution

In 
addition, 
education 
policies 
should 
also 
address 
the 
existence 
of 
other 
direct 
payments

payments 
for

them

The 
principal 
goal 
of 
policies 
dealing 
with 
such 
payments 
should 
not 
be 
to 
eliminate 
them

to 
(a) 
increase

General

from 
a 
severe 
lack

Most 
parents 
interviewed 
have 
little 
more 
than 
a 
general 
idea

Increasing 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
is 
likely 
to 
encourage 
more 
parents 
to 
contribute. 
Efforts 
to 
increase 
transparency 
should 
not 
include 
additional 
central 
regulations. 
Evidence 
suggests 
that 
increased 
central

Many

- 
such

those

extra

- 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
a 
permanent 
part 
of 
the

system 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
not 
worthwhile 
and 
likely 
harmful 
to 
try 
and 
limit 
such 
activities. 
Instead, 
efforts 
must 
be 
focused 
on 
increasing 
the 
overall 
quality 
of 
education 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
Such 
an 
effort 
involves 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
measures 
included 
in 
the 
broader 
program 
of

The 
reforms 
most 
applicable 
to 
questions 
of 
payments 
include 
an 
increase 
in 
teacher 
earnings. 
Such 
a 
measure 
would 
likely 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
those 
teachers 
who 
do 
not 
want 
to 
accept 
payments, 
to 
do 
so.
