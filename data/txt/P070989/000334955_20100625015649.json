"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Education Sector\n            Development Project (ESDP) for Azerbaijan were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned include: the choice\n            of Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument was\n            appropriate given the Government's long-term vision and\n            comprehensive reform agenda reflected in the Ten-Year\n            Education Reform Strategy. The APL provided an overall\n            framework for the achievement of the program's\n            development objectives over time and ensuring continuity and\n            sustainability of sector policies. Given the complexity and\n            range of needed reforms, carrying out systematic sector\n            assessments during project preparation is essential and\n            contributes to better project design. Throughout\n            implementation, the Minister of Education (MoES) carried out\n            studies in the following key areas: national standards and\n            curriculum reform; teacher education; education economics\n            and finance; education management; education research and\n            policy; Education Management Information System (EMIS) and\n            school mapping; information technology; instructional\n            technology; monitoring, evaluation and assessment; and\n            textbook development. Integrating project management into\n            the overall operation of the line Ministry triggers greater\n            ownership and responsibility for the reform process. ESDP\n            was designed as such that while the project coordination\n            unit (PCU) was responsible for procurement, financial\n            management, and project monitoring and evaluation, it was\n            the heads of the relevant departments/units of the Ministry\n            who were directly responsible for the implementation of\n            project activities associated within their mandate. The\n            implementation of comprehensive finance reforms involving\n            changes in the structure and management of the system\n            requires political support as well as strong leadership of\n            the respective line Ministry in order to stimulate the\n            needed inter-ministerial collaboration and sufficient\n            support for the change at all levels of the Government."}, "docdt": "2010-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
