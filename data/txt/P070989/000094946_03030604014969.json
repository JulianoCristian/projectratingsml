Decay can rarely be\n            determined prior to tearing out or dismantling an existing\n            construction. Repairs of buildings should be executed during\n            the summer academic recess to minimize disruption of\n            schooling. Discovery of serious structural and mechanical\n            problems during either the survey or construction phase\n            poses serious ethical, legal and financial challenges. Leaky\n            roofs if not promptly repaired will result in damage to\n            structural components of buildings. The most common problem\n            is decay of the timber trusses that support the roof. In\n            order to arrest deterioration of buildings, essential\n            repairs to elements such as roofs and foundations should be\n            carried out. Maintain storm water drainage systems, replace\n            broken window glasses, loose stair treads and floorboards to\n            prevent deterioration of a building. Improve building\n            insulation, caulking gaps between masonry walls and floor\n            frames; install thermostatic controls on radiators and\n            convectors and upgrading lighting systems will reduce cost\n            of operation. Azerbaijan needs to consolidate small schools\n            to form more economical units wherever practical.\n            Consolidation of schools will require the construction of\n            additional classroom capacity at the receiving school."}, "docdt": "2003-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
