Education Sector Development Project
Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) and
Disclosure and Consultation Process
Introduction.
1.    The First Phase of the proposed Education Sector Reform Program proposes to finance
the renovation of a selected number of schools in the three pilot districts (i.e., Ali Bayramli City,
Ismayilli and Ujar districts). In the three districts, there are a total of 154 schools (i.e., 15
schools in Ali Bayramli, 45 schools in Ujar and 94 schools in Ismailli). The Project would
finance rehabilitation and refurbishment of a selected number of schools based on the district
rationalization plans.  This note outlines strategies and summarizes the disclosure and
consultation process for mitigating the environmental risks associated with school renovations
under the Project. Annex 1 also presents the draft Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP), which
has been disclosed and discussed with various stakeholders.
2.    Programs to repair and modernize existing structures pose a number of serious
challenges. First, the extent of decay can rarely be determined prior to tearing out or dismantling
existing construction. As a consequence, the cost of repairs and the time and materials required
to complete work cannot be reliably estimated in advance. Second, architectural and mechanical
plans: are rarely implemented faithfully and as-built drawings are rarely provided. The design of
works therefore must be based on detailed field studies. Third, repairs of buildings ought to be
executed if possible during the summer academic recess in order to minimize disruption of
schooling. Scheduling of construction is further complicated by the likelihood of encountering
unforeseen problems. Finally, discovery of serious structural and mechanical problems during
either the survey or construction phase poses very serious ethical, legal and financial challenges.
Professional engineers and architects cannot ethically fail to deal with problems that pose a
serious threat to the health or lives of students. Moreover, both the Bank and the Government are
obliged by public opinion and by law to correct life-threatening problems of which they are
aware.
3.    School renovation projects generally attack four kinds of problems. First, they rectify
safety hazards created by the decay or misuse of structures. Second, they arrest the deterioration
of buildings by repairing essential elements such as roofs and foundations. Third, they re-
optimize the design of major elements to reflect new technologies and changes in input prices.
And 'fourth, renovation projects increase the capacity of facilities to meet educational needs.
4.    (i)    Addressing Safety and Health Problems. Some school buildings that have been
neglected for a long period of time often suffer from problems that threaten the life or health of
occupants. The most common of these problems are the result of leaky roofs or poor drainage
around foundations. Leaky roofs if not promptly repaired will result in damage to structural
components of buildings. The most common problem is decay of the timber trusses that support
the roof. Rotting of these structurally essential components can result in the collapse of the roof
onto the building's occupants. The decay of roof trusses can also lead to the weight of the roof
being exerted laterally on supporting walls and lead to the collapse of the entire building.

Inadequate drainage of storm water from the foundations of a building can undercut support for
exterior walls and lead to the collapse of load bearing walls. If surveys of the condition of
buildings reveal such structural problems, architects and engineers are ethically bound to ensure
that repairs are made.
5.    Neglect of routine maintenance can also lead to the deterioration of important interior
components of buildings. The most common problems are worn, broken or missing stair treads,
loose or missing stair rails and broken floorboards. These building defects pose especially
serious threats to the lives of occupants in the event of an emergency such as a fire, but also can
endanger the lives of individual students. As in the case of serious structural defects, faulty
interior components must be repair if discovered by professional engineers or architects.
6.    (ii)   Halting the Deterioration of a Building. Failure to maintain roofs and storm
water drainage systems, to replace broken window glass, to repair loose stair treads and
floorboards or to paint exterior wood trims will accelerate the deterioration of a building. The
proposed Project would address these issues on a set timetable. The longer maintenance is
deferred, the more rapidly buildings will deteriorate. Like in other transitional economies,
shortages of funds have led to the neglect of routine maintenance and minor repairs for more
than a decade. Many structures are now approaching a state beyond which the building must be
replaced.  While these problems do not threaten human life and may not yet seriously
compromise a building's serviceability, they do pose an economic risk. Renovation may be a
cost-effective alternative to future replacement of a structure.
7.    (iii)  Re-optimization of Building Design. The cost of occupying buildings has risen
dramatically in most former Soviet republics as a result of the liberalization of energy prices.
The cost of energy has increased by more than two orders of magnitude in many instances. The
cost of heating and lighting buildings has gone from being a negligible part of the education
budget to as much as a third of total expenditure in some countries. Improving building
insulation, caulking gaps between masonry walls and window and door frames, installing
thermostatic controls on radiators and convectors, installing double pained windows and
upgrading lighting systems have become highly cost-effective as a result. Renovation of a
building may reduce its cost of operation by enough to repay investments in as few as two or
three years in many instances. Where very large windows were installed, thermal losses may no
longer justify the savings in lighting costs. Therefore window replacement may increase comfort
and reduce costs at the same time.
8.    The addition of computer facilities and science laboratories may necessitate the
upgrading of electrical or plumbing services. Where upgrading is required, modernization or
replacement of other old systems may be cost-effective. Designers of school renovations aimed
at enabling new educational technologies should be aware of the possibility that small additional
expenditures may produce substantial benefits, either as reduced operating costs or enhanced
services.
9.    (iv)   Expanding Capacity. Azerbaijan needs to consolidate small schools to form
more economical units wherever practical. Consolidation of schools will require the construction
of additional classroom capacity at the receiving school. In most cases, merging two schools
will not result in cost savings unless the capacity of individual classrooms is increased
substantially; adding additional classrooms would simply replicate the original diseconomies of
scale. Therefore, constructing new school buildings, or substantially remodeling existing
2



buildings, will be necessary. The design principles for expanding the capacity of schools that are
to accommodate the enrollment of neighboring schools should also ensure that additional
construction is designed to efficiently meet the school's projected requirements for computer and
laboratory space.
10.   A Strategy for Renovation of Schools. Improving school buildings could absorb far
more resources than Azerbaijan can hope to mobilize from domestic and international sources
combined. Therefore, setting priorities will be achieved through the preparation of district
rationalization plans. As noted earlier, renovation programs are plagued by uncertainty about the
precise needs of any building; only as work progresses can the full scale of problems be
determined.
11.   The MOE plans a two-stage procedure in order not only to minimize potential risks
associated with school renovation, but also to maximize the return on expenditures. The first
stage would seek to define needs. A survey of the present condition of school buildings will be
conducted in order to determine the scale and character of needs.  The survey will rely on a
well-documented protocol for describing the condition of the school and its anticipated needs.
The protocol will be prepared in such a way that well-educated laypersons, such as a school
director, will be able to carry out the instructions. The survey will encompass not only the
current condition of the school, but also its anticipated use. The survey should inquire about the
condition of the major building element (roof, foundations, load bearing walls), interior
components (floors, staircases, windows), mechanical systems (lighting, heating, water supply,
sanitation), and capacities (classroom numbers and sizes, catering facilities, health clinics,
playing fields). In addition, the survey will inquire about the projected enrollment of the school,
the prospects for merger with neighboring schools, and the availability of land for expansion of
the school.
12.   The school survey will be analyzed by the rayon education department in order to obtain
a rough sense for the scale of needs and the options for prioritizing them. The purpose of such an
analysis would be to guide further, detailed studies and not to inform investment decisions. The
analysis of the survey will be followed by professional assessments of the needs of those schools
that appear to be facing the most serious problems. It is expected that the assessments will
provide the basis for setting investment priorities and should precede the development of detailed
engineering designs and bidding documents. The rayon education departments and the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) will then package bidding documents and oversee the
implementation of works.
The Environmental Mitigation Plan
13.   The Government of Azerbaijan places serious emphasis on environment protection and
landscape preservation. Therefore, as part of the preparatory work the MOE prepared the draft
EMP (see Annex 1) to reflect environmental risks associated with school rehabilitation under the
Project. The draft EMP was developed by the experts of the MOE in close consultation with the
Ministry of Ecology (which is responsible for environmental protection) and local authorities.
14.   The MOE carried out a disclosure and consultation process to discuss the draft EMP with
local officials and key stakeholders in the three districts. The disclosure and consultative process
included the following steps: (i) the publication of the advertisement of the EMP in local papers
3



(see copies of the advertisement); and (ii) consultative meetings with representatives of local
officials, media, school directors, teachers, parents and students.
Disclosure Process
15.    As of February 18, 2003, the Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) was prepared by the
MOE; and distributed the EMP among the participating constituents. In addition, the EMP is
publicly available in the MOE, as well as in the Departments of Education in the three districts.
Local departments of education also organized meetings to discuss the draft EMP. The
availability of the EMP was also advertised in a national paper "Xalq qazeti" on February 19,
2003.
16.    In each pilot district education authorities will publish advertisements in local media with
information regarding the availability of the EMP in district education departments and invitation
for all interested to get access to this document. This will be issued on 25th February 2003 in
"Yeni Soz" newspaper of Ujar district, on 27'h February 2003 in "Girdiman" newspaper of
Ismailli district and on 21st February 2003 in "Ishiq" newspaper of Ali-Bayramli town.
17.    Advertisement. On February 19, 2003, the availability of the EMP was published in the
national daily newspaper "Xalq qazeti".
"Ministry of Education is pleased to inform about ongoing negotiations with World Bank and Ministry of
Finance of Republic of Azerbayan to obtain credit in support of Education Sector Reforms Program. This Program
will continue for 10 years and will target improvement of efficiency, quality and equity of education. There will be
three phases in the program and first phase will include piloting of reforms approaches in 3 districts: city of Ali-
Bayratmli, Ujar and Ismayilli districts. In the first phase certain activities for reconstruction and rehabilitation of
schools in pilot districts are planned.
With regards to these reconstruction/rehabilitation activities and in order to avoid possible hazard to
environment, Environmental Management Plan has been developed within Ministry of Education. This plan is
available for public review.
The Environmental Management Plan is available at the following address. 49 Kl/atai avenue, Project
Implementation Unit for Education Reform, Ministry of Education, Baku. "
Above mentioned announcement and EMP in English and Azeri languages were also placed at
the Internet WebPages on the following address: www.min.edu.az.
The Consultation Process
18.    The Bank team discussed the school rehabilitation work with various stakeholders during
project preparation missions in October and January. A national stakeholder meeting on January
13-13~, 2003, participated by the Bank team, also discussed the draft implementation plan for the
Project, including the school rehabilitation work in the three selected districts based on the
preparation of the district rationalization plans. During this meeting, the governmental priorities
for school rehabilitation under the Program were discussed with the team and the selection
criteria agreed in principle.
4



19.   The MOE prepared the draft EMP in consultation with stakeholders. The public
discussions of the EMP are still ongoing and will continue through project preparation and
implementation. Presently, most of the public discussions of the EMP are targeted at the three
selected districts, through the public disclosure actions taken by the MOE in the pilot districts
(see Annexes 1-3). More detailed discussions of the EMP will be carried out among the key
stakeholders affected in the targeted schools by the MOE and the winning contractor during the
rehabilitation work. There will be on-site discussions of the EMP with the school beneficiaries
and other key stakeholders in each of the targeted schools prior to the actual rehabilitation of the
schools, including during the design stage. Since each school will have specific rehabilitation
requirements, it is expected that the emphasis of the discussions with the stakeholders will be
tailored to the specific aspects of the EMP that deal directly on the technical requirements of that
particular school. The IDA project team will monitor the MOE actions in this regard during the
regular supervision to ensure that these public disseminations and discussions have taken place
in each of the targeted school.
20.   In addition, the MOE organized meetings in each pilot district to discuss the draft EMP
with local officials and community representatives. In these consultative meetings, the
participants were informed about plans for school rehabilitation and possible associated
environmental risks and proposed measures to contain these effects. Local community leaders
and environment protection experts had chance to share their ideas and concerns regarding
proposed plans and provide their feedback. In general, public reactions were positive and plans
were accepted and satisfactory for alleviating for all possible adverse effects of school
renovation and reconstruction. On average, about 50 people in each district participated in the
consultative meetings to discuss the draft EMP. (The list of participants and the minutes are
presented in Annexes 2-4).
21.   In addition to the above disclosure, the EMP will be part of the Standard Bidding
Document (SBD) for the civil work procurement to ensure that the bidders are obliged to adhere
to the agreed EMP and the winning contractors are legally accountable to follow the agreed
procedures.

c)    Institutional Strengthening.
1. Equipment Purchases.
Monitoring activities are mainly carried in a visual basis during rehabilitation period. Therefore
no new equipment is to be purchased under this Project for environment impact monitoring
purposes. After handing over the education facilities to the beneficiaries, the monitoring
activities will be conducted by relevant authorities using their own equipment and capacities.
2. Training.
Training programs will be designed for PIU staff, design consultants and constructors designated
for carrying environmental mitigation and monitoring activities. The PIU architect, who will be
responsible for assuring compliance with the environmental regulations of the Republic of
Azerbaijan, shall be responsible for organization of such training activities. Other PIU staff
involved into monitoring activities shall be responsible for attending training programs and
periodical workshops.  Training program  shall cover the current environment protection
legislation and related regulations, mitigation measures and sampling and analysis collection
techniques. Training will be conducted at renovation sites and will last about one day.
Representatives of the contractor will also be invited to participate in the training sessions. The
first training session will be organized at the beginning of the renovation. No additional training
cost is expected.
3. Consultant Services.
No consultant services are intended to be used for environmental institutional strengthening
under this project.
D)    Schedule.
Environmental impact mitigation and monitoring activities will be conducted in parallel with the
renovation activities. Dust, noise, transportation of materials, disposal of waste materials from
school renovation sites and habitat protection will be monitored throughout the renovation
period. Restoration of lands damaged by excavation will be continued after the completion of
school renovation. After accomplishment of construction and handing over education facilities to
the beneficiaries, the monitoring activities shall be carried by the relevant authorities.
E)    Institutional Arrangements.
Data Collection: The PrU (of the Ministry of Education) and local departments of education will
monitor the implementation of the EMP, and collect the required data.
Data Analysis: Monitoring Reports will be filed in the PTU office.. The results of the analysis
will be used to improve the compliance with the mitigation measures and to modify the
mitigation plan, if needed.



Reporting: Monitoring Reports shall submitted to the PIU Director with one week after the
completion of the monitoring visit. All deviations requiring urgent actions shall be reported
immediately. The format of monitoring report should be developed by construction expert of PIU
and approved by program coordination board.
Decision: Any decision concerning amendments to the EMP will be made by the PIU, in
consultation with the Bank and local authorities.
