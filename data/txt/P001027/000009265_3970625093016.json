The project did not\n            achieve its main objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was modest, sustainability is likely under the\n            next highway project, and the performance of the Bank was\n            satisfactory while the Borrower's was unsatisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, the\n            reversal from successful project implementation under the\n            First Highway Project to very poor implementation under the\n            Second Highway Project was due to a change in project\n            organization and leadership. Second, consultants should keep\n            the Bank aware of serious problems with a project instead of\n            hiding them. Third, the Bank had a tremendous impact on\n            reversing the trend of the project and greatly improving\n            productivity. Fourth, measures should be implemented to\n            avoid a repetition of the problems encountered under this\n            project. Fifth, actions should be taken to deal with the\n            continuing problems of establishing a resurfacing unit and\n            improving the poor quality of patching. Finally, the\n            Government should work to eliminate its difficulties with\n            meeting local and foreign exchange contributions to project costs."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
