Power Distribution\n            Project consists of parts of the 1983-88 investment programs\n            of the beneficiaries.  Its purpose is to expand and\n            modernize power distribution systems in five less developed\n            States of the Northeast and the Northwest, and in the\n            low-income metropolitan areas of Rio de Janeiro and Sao\n            Paulo.  The project will further strengthen the organization\n            of the beneficiaries and improve their technical and\n            financial performance. Specifically, the investment programs\n            provide for the purchase and installation of\n            sub-transmission lines, substations and associated\n            transformers; distribution lines and transformers; low\n            voltage secondary circuits; consumer connections; and\n            general service and related auxiliary equipment.  In\n            addition, two of the beneficiaries, CERON and ELETRONORTE,\n            have included in their programs the rehabilitation of\n            thermal generating plants. About two million new consumers\n            may be connected by 1988, owing to the investment."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
