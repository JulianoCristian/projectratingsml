Its purpose is to expand and modernize\n            power distribution systems in five less developed States of\n            the Northeast and the Northwest, and in the low-income\n            metropolitan areas of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The\n            project will further strengthen the organization of the\n            beneficiaries and improve their technical and financial\n            performance. Specifically, the investment programs provide\n            for the purchase and installation of sub-transmission lines,\n            substations and associated transformers; distribution lines\n            and transformers; low voltage secondary circuits; consumer\n            connections; and general service and related auxiliary\n            equipment. In addition, two of the beneficiaries, CERON and\n            ELETRONORTE, have included in their programs the\n            rehabilitation of thermal generating plants. About two\n            million new consumers may be connected by 1988, owing to the investment."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
