to: (a) enhance\n            natural gas utilization as a substitute for other sources of\n            energy with higher economic and environmental costs; (b)\n            reduce the distribution costs of petroleum products by\n            substituting pipelines for road and water transport; (c)\n            reduce petroleum product losses through processing\n            optimization; and (d) reduce environmental costs and safety\n            risks in petroleum product transport and refining.  In\n            supporting these aims the project includes two components.\n            The transport component consists of: (i) a pipeline and\n            related facilities to deliver natural gas to Sao Paulo; (ii)\n            three pipelines to deliver liquified products more\n            economically to distribution centers; (iii) engineering\n            design, environmental impact studies, and training in\n            pipeline operations and transportation planning.  The\n            processing component consists of: (i) a Hydrotreatment Plant\n            at the Cubatao refinery; (ii) automation studies focusing on\n            optimization of process and centralized control for loading,\n            storage and offsite facilities; (iii) an industrial safety\n            and environmental program."}, "docdt": "1991-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
