Key lessons learned are: a) when preparing the\n            schedule for the execution of a project, the time for\n            congressional approval, if required, should be considered;\n            b) to avoid execution delays due to procurement processing,\n            during appraisal a complete analysis should be made of the\n            internal procedures and procurement practices of the\n            borrower, especially when it is a large corporation with\n            well established practices and procedures, in order to\n            coordinated them with Bank's procurement guidelines; c)\n            as energy sector reforms take usually longer than expected,\n            the Bank should be ready to extend closing dates beyond the\n            usual terms if the benefits of the continued dialogue with\n            the authorities override the administrative costs of keeping\n            the loan open; and d) the increasing availability of\n            project-related information in the Bank's Internet\n            pages is highly improving the interface between the Bank and\n            its clients."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
