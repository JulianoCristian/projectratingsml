Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Since the last mission in December 2014, the ASARECA Secretariat, with guidance from the Board of Directors (BoD), continued to take measures that
 change the organizational structure and redefine its role in the regional AR4D efforts. The mission reviewed the BoD’s decisions and its implementation
 by the Secretariat during the reporting period. It was necessary to look at the governance system as a whole since there have been intense interactions
 among the concerned parties to deal with the evolving challenges that ASARCA is confronted.

 The Board of Directors (BoD): The proactive role the BoD at a time when ASARECA needs guidance and strong support is much encouraging.
 Moreover, the contribution of the reinforced Executive Committee (ExCo) of the BoD in articulating the critical issues and counseling the Board on short-
 medium and long-term solutions and actions is praiseworthy. To assist the BoD and the ExCo deliberations, the Secretariat commissioned a
 consultancy study to review the situation and recommend solution and actions. The consultant produced a report, “Restructuring of the Secretariat and
 Repositioning of ASARECA”, referred here as “Consultancy Report”, which has been instrumental the deliberations of the Board and ExCo.

 During the reporting period two BoD meetings (the 20th in February 2015 and the 21st in June 2015) and two ExCo meetings (in March and April 2015)
 were held. The focus of these meetings was primarily to deal with the problem of shortage of fund, which has led to reduced investment in proejcts and
 programs, and a disproportionate overhead cost in the organization relative to project/program investment. Cognizant of this situation, the BoD decided
 on right sizing the organization and rationalizing use of financial resources as early as mid-2014. Simultaneously, intense resource mobilization drive
 was carried out through the Secretariat, although responses from both traditional and non-traditional sources of funding were not as expected.

 ASARECA’s problem was compounded when one of the staff members affected by the right sizing exercise complained of wrongful dismissal, and
 alleged corruption and mismanagement of resources in the organization. This allegation came to the attention of wide range of stakeholders,
 particularly to new and existing DPs. As a result, some DPs that supported ASARECA in the past reacted by suspending their support, and prospective
 DPs that were ready to collaborate and support ASARECA took their resources somewhere else, thus exacerbating the resource shortage.

 Concerned by the worsening financial situation the BoD, among others, took the following measures:
 1.        instructed the ExCo to develop an action plan that would address the challenges facing the Secretariat expeditiously;
 2.        Reviewed the Consultant Report that recommended alternative restructuring and repositioning options in the short and medium-term, and
           actions for the long-term;
 3.        Decided on right sizing and restructuring measures;
 4.        Reviewed and approved the 2014 audit report;
 5.        Removed the Executive Director and appointed the Deputy Executive Director as Interim Executive Secretary;
 6.        Reduced the staff number in the Secretariat from 63 to 37 at the end of May 2015 (regional staff reduced from 20 to 8);
 7.        Directed the Secretariat to operate on a reduced budget;
 8.        Decided on transitional organizational structure that has four Thematic areas;
 9.        Directed the Secretariat to undertake a visioning and long-term strategic planning exercise that can come up with new business model,
           appropriate organizational structure and an accompanying governance system, and
 10.       Decided to terminate the contract of all staff by December 2015, and recruit again on the basis of revised organizational structure and new
           term of reference on a competitive basis where existing staff can also compete.
 Despite these promissing efforts, the mission foresees a more challenging period ahead for the BoD and a sustained engagement to guide the
 organization so as it can endure the challenges as necessary. With this in view, the BoD is advised to consider the following recommendations.
 11.       The BoD has guided the Secretariat on resource rationalization, staffing, transitional organizational structure, and on long term strategic vision
           development. However, clear directives as to how these policy decisions will be implemented in the months to come will be helpful. Given the
           short time available before the end of the year, by which time all staff will be terminated, it is advisable to clearly define the implementation
           mechanism (by whom), the timeline (when), as well as allocate the financial resources needed to carry out the tasks. The mission assumes
           the planned ExCo meeting during the first week of September 2015 will clarify these and other related issues.
 12.       ASARECA Secretariat is a critical arm of the BoD. It is expected to run the organization in an open and transparent manner with full
           accountability. It is a source of information for the BoD and has a responsibility to advise the Board on matters submitted for its deliberations.
           Unless on matters directly pertaining to himself/herself, participation of the CEO in all the BoD meetings is both necessary and beneficial. This
           will help the CEO to fully understand the Board’s decisions and the context under which it is made, as well as to implement the decision as
           intended. Although the BoD may have reasons that the mission is unaware of, the recent practice of excluding the CEO of the organization
           from its meetings could have negative consequences on the organization (approval of the 2014 audit report in the absence of the CEO, or
           relevant staff of the Secretariat is one such example). Therefore, reexamining this practice is necessary for the good of the organization and
           wiser deliberations of the BoD.
 13.        The Governance Manual of the Association states that the Executive Director of ASARECA is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) responsible

            for day-to-day activity of the organization. The recent decision of the BoD that requires the Secretariat to submit budget expenditures more
            than $5000 to the Chairman of the Board makes the chairman a CEO, a role which is not mandated by the constitution. This is another recent
            development that the BoD may want to reexamine, at least from the point of view of efficiency.
 14.        The actions taken by the BoD to reduce costs in the Secretariat’s operations is commendable. The BoD has also noted possible areas for
            further cost reductions in the governance system, namely, costs associated with the General Assembly and BoD examining issues like
            composition, participation, frequency, meeting venues, etc. The Board may want to refer to its powers, which the mission think are quite broad,
            including revising the constitution and the governance manual, and carry out a review of governance related cost centers and see where
            savings can be made.
 15.        ASARECA is one of the oldest SRO’s. A lot has changed in Africa, and in the sub-region, since its creation. The African Union and its
            Regional Economic Commissions (RECs) are taking the lead in the economic and social development. SROs are now aligning themselves
            with these new institutions for both legitimacy and support. CCARDESA is aligned to SADC and CORAF to ECOWAS organically. It is the
            RECs who are now expected to provide strategic policy guidance to ensure the regional AR4D agenda is consistent with the REC mandate for
            agriculture and food security. This means, the RECs are assuming full ownership of the SROs. The way the RECs establish ownership is
            through a supreme body it creates, which is made up of member state ministers (agriculture, technology, etc., as nominated by member
            states) making the link between the SRO and member states organic at the highest level. The current ASARECA governance system has
            been effective, but the mission feels it is time to reexamine the system beyond cost reduction, looking at the changes taking place around
            institutional arrangements in the region and the sub-region. The mission recommends that the study that will be undertaken shortly to define
            the road map for repositioning ASARECA includes a review of the governance system with the view to make it cost effective, responsive and
            sustainable.
 The resource mobilization efforts of the Secretariat to address the prevailing funding gap was encouraging. A total of 14 Concept Notes (CNs) have
 been accepted for funding following the full-fledged implementation of the resource mobilization strategy in 2014. The cumulative total so far mobilized
 from these efforts is $4.16 million, out of which $1.93 million was mobilized during the reporting period (January to June 2015). The cost sharing
 arrangement from the total mobilized resource to cover staff time, office and overhead costs is about 23 percent or $894,000. This is the step in the right
 direction, which should be applied in future efforts as well. However, given the potential disbursement delays of the MDTF and in some cases
 suspension of project funding (SIDA, USDA), mobilizing resources from a wide range of development community has to continue with increased
 commitment and determination. As part of this exercise, the Secretariat has to step up its effort by closely following up the 33 CNs and proposals
 awaiting response from the partner institutions and also by continuing to prepare CNs to further compete for resources.

 Implementation Progress of the three MDTF financed projects has generally been on track, despite the multiple restructuring and realignment measures
 taken at the Secretariat and disbursement delays. The three MDTF financed projects are being implemented in all the ASARECA member countries
 except DRC. The ongoing projects include: (i) Sustainable management of agricultural water productivity for improved food and nutrition security in ECA
 is being implemented in 6 countries (Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar Sudan and Uganda) with an allocation of $1.0 million for 2015; (ii)
 Enhancing wheat productivity and value chains in Rwanda and Burundi (at an estimated budget allocation of $224,200), and (iii) Integrated
 management of Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease in E. Africa with a participation of 7 countries (Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, S. Sudan
 and Uganda) with a budget allocation of $942,500. The mission also noted with satisfaction the encouraging involvement of the less participating NARIs.

 In addition to the MDTF financed projects, the Secretariat has been busy implementing 7 different projects with different funding sources. The allocated
 budget for these projects being implemented in multiple countries (some outside the ASARECA member countries) is close to $1.2 million
