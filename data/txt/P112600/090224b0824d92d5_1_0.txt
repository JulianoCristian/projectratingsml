                         Implementation Status Overview
                         ASARECA's five year Operational Plan (OP-1, 2008-2013) as supported by the ASARECA Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) came to an overall successful conclusion on December
                         31, 2013. The World Bank finds that ASARECA consistently pursued a program of activities in keeping with the agreed OP and that overall implementation progress of OP-I and
                         effectiveness of the MDTF financed activities in meeting its development objectives has been satisfactory. ASARECA's cumulative five year M&E data and an independent end of
                         project evaluation report indicate that ASARECA met all and in some cases exceeded the MDTF's set key performance indicator targets. ASARECA with its network of National

                         projects will result in significant impact, if the technologies are sufficiently scaled up, customized and adopted. In addition, ASARECA’s profile and presence as a core AR&D think-
                         tank in the East and Central Africa region has increased significantly during implementation of the MDTF. This has allowed ASARECA to play an increasingly pivotal role in facilitating

                         the regional dialogue on agriculture policy harmonization and advocating for appropriate policy adoption by the region’s national governments and economic community, the Common
                         Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). ASARECA has developed its second five year OP II (2014-2018) through a highly participative and consultative process and is
                         well placed and ready to begin its implementation. Based on previously recorded results and the findings from this mission, the Bank notes that the MDTF's development objective
                         has been successfully achieved.

                         Key specific achievements over the five year period include:

                         (i) 409 Technologies, Innovations and Management Practices (TIMPs) were generated. This represents an 8% achievement above the target total OP-I target of 378.
                         (ii) 498 demand-driven TIMPs were made available for uptake and adoption. This represents a 12% achievement above the OP-I target of 444.
                         (iii) 422,176 households (ASARECA considers a household to comprise 6 members) accessed the TIMPs generated through ASARECA support. This represents a 59% achievement
                         above the OP-I target of 265,964.
                         (iv) over 2.53 million individuals (55% male; 45% female) have so far directly benefited from the over 90 projects implemented during the entire OP-I period. The benefits include:
                         access to TIMPs, access to inputs and markets, demonstrations, among others.
                         (v) 4,658 hectares of land was brought under improved TIMPs. Out of these, over 20% was dedicated to seed multiplication, especially for sorghum, cowpeas, green gram, QPM,
                         OFSP, as well as on-station and on-farm establishments and rehabilitation of forage seeds.
                         (vi) 2,436MT of seed was produced from these dedicated lands. Over 30% of these seeds were sold through commercial seed traders, and the rest distributed to farmers for further
                         multiplication.
                         (vii) over 100 different policies, laws, regulations and procedures were analyzed – representing a 28% achievement above the target of 78.
                         (viii) 46 agriculture policies, laws, regulations and procedures (out of the target of 54) have been presented for legislation, decree and/or endorsement by responsible policy organs.
                         This represents a 77.8% achievement against the overall target;
                         (viv) 18 enabling environment policies, regulations and administrative procedures have been approved. This represents a 64% achievement against the overall OP target of 28. Given
                         the lengthy process required for policy approval, this achievement is quite encouraging.
                         (vv) over 80,318 stakeholders (44,375 Male & 35,943 Female) benefited from capacity strengthening initiatives. This represents a 90% achievement of the OP-I target of 89,375.
                         (vvi) US$ 12.5M was generated by targeted stakeholders through the sale of products and services produced from ASARECA MDTF supported projects.

                         Overall the MDTF has been an effective funding mechanism to channel donor support for ASARECA's OP and has played a significant role in strengthening ASARECA as a sub -
                         regional research and development organization. In addition, it has been an effective instrument for reducing the administrative burden on ASARECA, through the elimination of
                         separate supervisions, and financial and activity reporting to multiple donors. As a result, ASARECA today is an institution with a well-managed Secretariat staffed with 62 highly
                         qualified professionals of which 24 are technical staff with an appropriate skills mix. It has developed and operationalized performance-driven, gender-sensitive governance and
                         management structures and systems. It has a well-functioning Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System which has enabled efficient collection of data and tracking of progress in the
                         region and which will serve it well during implementation of the second phase of the ASARECA Strategic Plan. Moving forward, ASARECA has set the stage to re-brand itself as a

                         ‘one stop’ knowledge hub for the sub-region to transform and commercialize agriculture along selected priority agricultural value chains, market linkages and innovation incubation
                         processes with a focus on private sector participation, gender and youth inclusion and climate change.

                         ASARECA's OP II (2014-2018) was launched in January 2014. Both donors and ASARECA have expressed satisfaction with the MDTF as a mechanism for channeling additional
                         support to support implementation of OP II. The Bank, at the request of donors and ASARECA agreed to extend the MDTF (initially also set to close on December 31, 2013), to 2018
                         to support implementation of OP II. Additional funding, (EUR 10m and $1.35m) in support of OP II has already been pledged by the EC and USAID respectively. It is anticipated that
                         more funds will become available at different intervals over the course of the five year OP II period. OP II together with annual work plans, will continue to be the basis for which
                         coordinated support is being provided by donors under the extended MDTF (2014-2018). ASARECA’s top priority under OP II still remains transforming agriculture into a viable
                         market-oriented venture by focusing on access to markets for smallholder farmers, the majority of whom are women, and providing them with appropriate information on marketing
                         forces and requirements such as quality, quantity and price. This, it is anticipated, shall succeed in drawing more youth to agriculture. Moreover, lessons learned from OPI have been
