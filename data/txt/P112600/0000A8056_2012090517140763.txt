                         continues to record good progress in thegeneration of demand driven technologies and innovations. It has made significant progress in providing quality technical andfinancial
                         management support to implementing NARS, which has contributed positively to the successful development and launch of newresearch initiatives that are focusing on up-scaling
                         and uptake of technologies. ASARECA continues to pay particular attention tothe development of solutions to alleviate the impact of climatic variability. As a result, the selection and
                         breeding ofproductive, drought resistant genotypes of staple and high value crops is underway. Management trials and improved culturalpractices are underway to reduce the impact

                         of reduced and erratic rainfall. ASARECA continues to analyze, review, and recommendpolicy options for ensuring an enabling environment for agricultural sector performance. It
                         has also moved forward with furtherimprovement of its M&E and information management systems, and governance and management structures. Donors have committedadditional
                         funds that ASARECA will use to support the validation, upscaling and dissemination of new agricultural technologies.While there is still scope for improvement in some areas, the
                         Bank team concluded that overall implementation progress of ASARECA'sOP is satisfactory and the institution is on the right course to meet the OP development objectives.

                         Specific achievementsrecorded to date include:

                         (a) a steady increase in the generation and dissemination of demand driven agricultural technologies .215 new technologies out of the overall OP target of 337 have been generated,
                         297 technologies out of the OP target of 434 weremade available for uptake, and over a 100,000 stakeholders out of a target of 250,000 have accessed a variety of new
                         technologies,innovations and management practices.

                         (b) a total of 54 different policies, laws, regulations and procedures out of a target 67have been analyzed, 33 out of the 54 have been presented for legislation or decree and 13 have
                         been approved. ASARECA's focus is onmoving increasingly towards the identification of more strategic interventions that are needed to ensure effective scaling-up andout, and
                         uptake of the new technologies as recommended during previous review and support missions.

                         (c) In 2012, a total of653.51 acres of land was dedicated to seed multiplication, and a total of 54.81 tons of quality seeds were produced and distributedto farmers.

                         (d) the selection of 18 new projects focusing exclusively on validation and uptake has been completed. The projectswill be presented for Board approval at the end of June and
                         implementation during the remainder of the OP.

                         (e) ASARECA continuesto support capacity building activities as part of the plan to strengthen the NARs, with particular focus on the genderrequirements, and is committed to
                         ensuring its efforts will be a continuous process.

                         (f) ASARECA has identified avenues forproviding training needs in corporate governance, finance, audit, performance assessment, and other areas as needed, to its Boardof
                         Directors (BoD) to increase BoD effectiveness and will be implementing them over the course of the remaining year.

                         (g) The M&Eunit has made impressive progress in institutionalizing the M&E System, including the establishment of systems and structures,policies, best practices and protocols for
                         monitoring and evaluation. It has provided extensive technical support to a wide numberof implementing agencies with particular emphasis on capacity strengthening to enhance the
                         ability of ASARECA and partners tomonitor and evaluate the key areas of intervention. It is now focused on documenting and disseminating information on the outcomesand impact
                         of ASARECA supported interventions to beneficiaries. Processes developed for conducting End-of-Project and outcomeevaluations including the development of a quality assurance
                         and validation process, will help to accurately capture the impact ofthe support provided to the sub region.
