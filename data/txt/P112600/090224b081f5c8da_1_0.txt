                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To support a program of integrated agricultural research for development (IAR4D) as described in ASARECA's Operational Plan. This will contribute to more effective
                         use of resources devoted to agricultural research among the member countries and wider access to the results of research in the regional agricultural systems of
                         Eastern and Central Africa.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) is winding down on implementation of its Operational Plan 1 (OPI). During the past
                         six months, ASARECA, together with its network of National Agricultural Research Institutes (NARIs) and implementing partners from both the public and private sector, continued to

                         agricultural technology, with key focus on those aiming to mitigate the the effects of climate change. Overall progress towards achieving the intermediate outcomes of OPI is
                         satisfactorily on track. Most of the MDTF indicator targets for demand driven technologies and innovations generated, stakeholders accessing the technologies and innovations, and
                         demand driven gender responsive technologies made available to uptake pathway have been either met or exceeded. Accordingly, targets set for the number of stakeholders

                         accessing the technologies and innovations, number of demand driven technologies and innovations generated, and number of demand driven gender responsive technologies made
                         available for uptake have been met by 86, 99 and 100 percent respectively. ASARECA has continued to perform its role as a CAADP Pillar IV institution for the sub-region. It has
                         also strengthened its fiduciary capacity, enhanced capacity building measures for its sub-grantees, and increased support to and closer follow-up of the sub-grantees. As a result,
                         critical financial management issues at the sub-grantee level have been resolved. Based on current progress and achievements to date, it is expected that the MDTF objectives will
                         be met.

                         Moving forward, ASARECA has prepared an OPII document to implement the second half of its strategic plan. The document has been the subject of a very rigorous review and
                         extensive and exhaustive consultation process with its stakeholders and development partners. ASARECA is currently finalizing incorporation of the inputs and comments from the
                         process. Consequently, ASARECA and its implementing partners are well positioned to effectively conclude the OPI activities and move on to implementation of the OPII by January
                         2014. Efforts to mobilize resources to implement OPII are ongoing.
