Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Since the last mission in June 2014, the ASARECA Secretariat has been undertaking important measures that would potentially change its
 organizational structure and redirect its role in the regional AR4D efforts. The Secretariat implemented an encouraging restructuring and right sizing
 exercise that led to the realignment of activities and reconfiguration of teams for a better and effective delivery of its regional commitments. This
 exercise led to the elimination of 6 regional and 15 national positions. The first round of the right sizing exercise together with the ongoing cost
 containment plan (COP), the Secretariat saved a total of $2.0 million, including $1.2 million from right sizing and 0.8 million from COP. The amount
 saved has been incorporated into the 2015 and 2016 workplan and budget.
 Moreover, 2014 has been a year of transition for ASARECA from MTOPI to MTOPII. This is the first year of MTOPII where projects and programs are
 supposed to be developed and implemented. However, it took nearly eight months for ASARECA to complete this exercise and implement project
 activities that help meet its objectives and deliver key outputs. The year started with calls for concept notes and proposals for funding under the
 Competitive Grant System (CGS). The Secretariat issued a total nine calls for concept notes (CNs) under the Competitive Granting System (CGS) for
 new projects.
 The calls were based on the current thematic approach, which is also serving as cost center under the new reorganization of the Secretariat. About 145
 concept notes were submitted by potential sub-grantees. The calls generated nine promising CNs for further full proposal development. However, lack
 of resource and guidance from the Board of Directors (BoD) forced the Secretariat to focus only on three priority projects under the MDTF. Thus, in
 addition to one project under EAPGREN funding, the three projects launched in 2014 under the MDTF include: (i) Sustainable Agriculture Water
 Productivity Enhancement for Improved Food Security and Nutrition with a total budget outlay of $2.0 million; (ii) Maize Lethal Necrocis Disease Project
 with an allocation of $2.0 million; and (iii) Wheat Project with a total allocation of $124,545. A total of 10 ASARECA member countiries are involved in
 the implementation of these projects and the efforts to include less participating NARS and the focus on up scaling of the available have been a step in
 the right direction.
 Implementation of the three projects initiated and launched in 2014 is at initial stage. The fact that all the projects were launched rather recently,
 implementation on the ground is yet to commence soon. As per the design of the projects, the duration of two of the projects is 2 years (9/2014-9/2016),
 and the third one just one year (2015); leading to an obvious need to have clear and well communicated milestones and firm management to get all
 activities accomplished as planned. During implementation the leading team can dialogue with the key players to explore sustainability of the project
 after ASARECA funding is completed.
 The Knowledge and Information Hub (KI-H): ASARECA’s OP II (2014-2018) identified the Enhancement of availability of information and knowledge on
 agricultural technologies and innovations as one of the strategic areas of intervention. During the 19th ASARECA Board of Directors (BoD) it was
 recommended that the Knowledge and Information (KI)-Hub be established. The KI-Hub is guided by the ASARECA KI-Hub strategy whose outputs are
 organized around establishing a learning and innovation centre for AR4D that will generate TIMPS, establishing a Think Tank, Creating a platform for
 information exchange and a technology and information clearing house. The following units were brought together to form the KI-Hub, Partnership and
 Capacity Development (PCD), Knowledge Management and Up scaling(KMUS), Communications and Public Relations (CPR) and Information and
 Communications Technology (ICT).
 The KI-Hub aims to facilitate equitable access to information and knowledge by different actors in the agriculture/agriculture related sectors in the region
 including but not limited to farmers, NGOs, RECs, governments, private sector, policy makers and academia. The hub will essentially be a ‘go to’ place
 to share, learn and for use in policy formulation and decision making. Further, the increasing levels of literacy, advances in technology and enhanced
 use of ICT in the region provide an enabling environment to expand knowledge and information sharing and learning especially for the youth and
 women. Among other things, the hub
 1.         Mainstream new scientific concepts in technology innovation, management practices and policies in the region.
 2.         Serve to facilitate learning and increase the capabilities of ASARECAs stakeholders.
 3.         Serve as a sub-regional focal point for data and information generated by ASARECA and other AR4D organizations both in Eastern and
            Central Africa sub-region and beyond.
 The greatest challenge lies in implementation of the KI-Hub both materially and actual delivery of outputs. Currently the sharing of information and
 knowledge by people and organizations within agricultural systems (National Agricultural Research Systems (NARs), International Development
 Organizations, private sector) is sub-optimal and this may jeopardize the transformation goal. There is also duplication of efforts, inefficiencies and
 limited outcomes.
 During the reporting period and following the right sizing exercise, a whistle-blower raised allegations of fraud and corruption against some staff
 members of ASARECA. The allegations were shared with the BoD, DPs and the WB Task Teams. As per the required due diligence in such matters,
 the task team in consultation with the Practice Manager informed INT (the World Bank Group Institutional Integrity Unit) to look at the allegation and
 advise on the actions to be considered. Now the case is with INT and the planned audit of the accounts of the Secretariat is underway. Based on the
 findings of the audit and the advice from the INT, the BoD and the DPs will be informed on possible course of actions on the subject allegations.

               4.        COMESA Biosafety Policy: ASARECA supported COMESA to develop a draft policy on Biotechnology and Biosafety. The Policy
                         which addresses issues on planting, commercial trade and emergency aid involving genetically modified organisms was approved
                         for implementation by the 32nd COMESA Council of Ministers on 24th February 2014 in Kinshasa, DR Congo. This followed the
                         recommendations of the 5th Joint COMESA meeting of the Ministers of Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources, 16-20
                         September 2013 in Addis Ababa. A planning meeting to develop the roadmap for implementation of the regulations was held 13-
                         14 March 2014 in Nairobi.
               5.        COMESA seed regulations: ASARECA provided technical support in the development of the COMESA seed regulations. These
                         regulations are based on the harmonized seeds regulations, procedures and standards facilitated by ASARECA in 2002. The
                         32ndCOMESA Council of Ministers approved the regulations in February 2014 in Kinshasa, DR Congo. This follows the
                         recommendations of the 5th joint COMESA meeting of the ministers of agriculture, environment and natural resources 16-20
                         September 2013 in Addis Ababa. The decision of the Ministers was to adopt the COMESA Seed Trade Harmonization
                         Regulations and for Member states to support their domestication. A COMESA Stakeholder Implementation Roadmap for Seed
                         Harmonization (COM-SIRSH) was developed and validated in a workshop organized by ACTESA/COMESA 7-11 on April 2014 in
                         Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

               Over 7,000 smallholder farmers accessed new markets. Most of the markets were within 2-km radius of their residence. However, there are
               plans to expand this to other markets that are within a minimum of 5-km radius. These markets are larger (with over 5,000 people trading).
               This is anticipated to provide better platforms for exchange of goods.
