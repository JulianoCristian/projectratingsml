                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To support a program of integrated agricultural research for development (IAR4D) as described in ASARECA's Operational Plan. This will contribute to more effective
                         use of resources devoted to agricultural research among the member countries and wider access to the results of research in the regional agricultural systems of
                         Eastern and Central Africa.
