Some lessons learned\n            included: immediate and active presence and attention to the\n            post-disaster needs are essential in meeting the recovery\n            needs of the country, and establishing a good dialogue with\n            the counterpart. The Bank's rapid response in the\n            immediate aftermath of the disaster enabled it to provide\n            assistance to the country in its recovery efforts and in the\n            preparation of the emergency project targeting key sectors.\n            Furthermore, it ensured a joint commitment to the\n            project's objectives and resolution of issues during\n            implementation. The Bank should work closely with the\n            Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and key ministries to target\n            needs and respond with appropriate assistance. The project\n            illustrates that line ministries, such as education and\n            health, have little construction experience and greatly\n            benefit from the Bank's technical assistance for\n            designing and implementing reconstruction/rehabilitation\n            programs. Emergency procurement is useful in the context of\n            immediate recovery needs. The length of time before\n            switching from flexible to regular procurement methods will\n            depend on the magnitude of the disaster, the damages\n            incurred, and the pace of implementation on the ground. The\n            HIERP successfully demonstrates this example, as procurement\n            processes were reverted to standard procedures by the end of\n            2006, adapting to the situation in the country. A flexible\n            design that allows accommodating the changing needs of\n            disaster management enables better tracking and\n            understanding of the breadth of the operation. Because of\n            the short preparation time and the nature of emergency\n            operations, Emergency Recovery Loans (ERLs) are riskier than\n            standard Bank operations. This is particularly true\n            concerning expediency and controls over procurement\n            processes, and it is important to consider measures that\n            mitigate risk. One of them is having a procurement\n            consultant on staff closely following the project throughout\n            its lifetime. This implies having a relatively large\n            supervision budget, where a good percentage may be used to\n            pay for a procurement specialist."}, "docdt": "2009-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
