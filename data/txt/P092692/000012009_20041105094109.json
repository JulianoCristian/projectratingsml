A comprehensive damage assessment prepared by the\n            Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), in\n            collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission\n            for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), puts the total\n            damages at US$900 million, more than twice the\n            country's GDP. Health and education infrastructure was\n            particularly impacted, with the second biggest hospital, and\n            most schools on the island rendered unusable. The project\n            will provide the additional funds, available to support the\n            overall recovery program, through the financing of critical\n            imports, the rehabilitation of schools and education\n            infrastructure, and recovery activities in the health\n            sector. The focus of this project will therefore be to\n            rehabilitate infrastructure in these areas.
