   aims at achieving greater domestic efficiency and\n            international competitiveness as the means to generate\n            growth and employment. It is also an important part of the\n            package of external financing in the period 1986-88 linked\n            to implementation of Mexico's economic reform. The\n            initial phase of the trade liberalization, supported by the\n            first Trade Policy Loan (TPL I), was successfully\n            implemented in 1986. The second phase, supported by the\n            proposed loan, focuses on further elimination of\n            discretionary, nontariff barriers (NTBs) to imports\n            including quantitative restrictions and official reference\n            prices, along with the continued reduction of the level and\n            dispersion of the tariff structure according to a\n            pre-announced calendar. The loan aims to finance part of the\n            imports not subject to NTBs."}, "docdt": "1987-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
