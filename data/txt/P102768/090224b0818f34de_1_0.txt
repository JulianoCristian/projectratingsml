                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project helps to provide members of the rural cooperative credit system (CCS), including marginal and small farmers (the poorest groups in rural India), with
                         significantly enhanced access to formal finance (credit, savings, etc.), by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the participating states (PS) are transformed into
                         efficient and commercially sustainable institutions.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is an update to the ISR submitted in October, 2012. The recent update on project achievements and remaining challenges comes against project implementation that has
                         been completely stalled due to a lack of counterpart funding to support remaining project activities. The assessment of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and the rating for
                         Implementation Progress(IP) are both downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory from Moderately Satisfactory. The rating for the PDOs is lowered to Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                         Significant progress has been made in achieving benchmark reform activities, which have critical implications for governance, sustainability, and transparency of the credit
                         cooperative institutions. However, the reform agenda was to be accompanied by needed recapitalization and completion of the IT component in order to ensure the gains made
                         under the project are sustained. At the same time, the IP has been lowered because project implementation has completely halted due to a lack of additional budget resources. This
                         is because the Project, which covers five Bank-funded states, is tied to the Government's national level package to support the country's rural Credit Cooperative Structure (CCS)

                         institutions. To fund the remaining program nationwide has far-reaching budgetary consequences at a time when fiscal imbalances are of increasing concern to the Government.
                         Because of resource constraints facing the Project, it will not be possible to fully implement the IT and Financial Restructuring Support (FRS) components under the Project.

                         However, it is important to still highlight the progress that has been made to date under the Project. In Bank-funded states, good progress has been made in terms of overall credit
                         growth, outreach to small and marginal farmers, recovery rates for State Cooperative Banks (SCBs), and the conduct of elections for cooperative boards. Progress is mixed on
                         recovery rates for District Credit Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) and Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), and DCCB profitability. Overall, profitability performance at SCBs has
                         been one indicator that has been mixed and weaker than the other indicators, but was expected to improve significantly after the inflows of capitalization comes from the central
                         government. There has also been significant progress across all states in terms of results indicators and project benchmark activities. (Benchmark activities are a series of wide-
                         ranging legal and institutional reforms which form the basis of all support by the Government). The main implementation challenges in each of the 5 Bank-funded states revolve
                         around the IT component and completion of all remaining benchmark activities that are linked to recapitalization under the Financial Restructuring Support (FRS) component. One
                         state (Gujarat) completed all benchmark activities, and two others (UP and West Bengal) have only one remaining activity before they will have completed the full set of legal and
                         governance reforms set out by the Government, and which has been a condition of recapitalization. Closing the loop on all remaining benchmark activities has been an important
                         achievement, which has been transformational in pushing the CCS institutions on a path towards improved governance, sustainability, and becoming more client-oriented.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The team’s view has always been that full project implementation can be attained, and would be important to maximize the progress and achievments of the Project to date.
                         However, given the resource constraints due to lack of counterpart funding, the remaining planned activities supported by the Project will remain partially fulfilled. While the situation
                         is unfortunate, it should not detract from the transformational nature of the reforms undertaken by the participating states, and the key milestones which have been achieved covering
                         a wide range of legal and institutional reforms, and fundamental changes in the capacity and potential for the CCS institutions covered by the Project.
