                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project helps to provide members of the rural cooperative credit system (CCS), including marginal and small farmers (the poorest groups in rural India), with
                         significantly enhanced access to formal finance (credit, savings, etc.), by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the participating states (PS) are transformed into
                         efficient and commercially sustainable institutions.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is an update to the ISR submitted in January 2013. Although significant progress has been made in achieving ambitious and sweeping reforms over the past five years, the
                         Project has been at a critical juncture since the extension of closing date in June 2012, from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The Project implementation has been stalled due to a
                         lack of counterpart funding to support remaining project activities around recapitalization assistance and IT components. This is because the Project, which covers five Bank-funded

                         far-reaching budgetary consequences at a time when fiscal imbalances are of increasing concern to the Government of India (GoI). Many options have been explored to fully
                         implement the Project. However, because of the funding resource constraints facing the Project, the GoI requested a cancellation of an undisbursed amount in March 2013.

                         A cancellation in the amount of US$163.7 million from IBRD Loan and SDR11.0 million (approx. US$16.4 million) from IDA Credit has taken place, given that the Government of India
                         has decided not to carry out certain remaining activities of the project, in view of concerns on fiscal imbalances and the impediment to allocate the necessary budgetary resources.
                         However, and despite activities that will be not completed, the Project was a transformative catalyst for change.

                         In many ways, the Project has been a transformative catalyst for changes in the rural credit cooperative system, leading to wide-ranging and sweeping reforms around governance,
                         sustainability, and transparency. All of these reforms have established the foundations for improved information, governance and member services at the cooperatives. Equally
                         important are the changes around new-found autonomy of many CCS institutions, where decentralized decision-making are reflected in newly empowered boards at Primary
                         Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and District Credit Cooperative Banks (DCCB) levels.

                         The Ratings for Implementation progress and progress towards the Development Outcome are upgraded from Moderately Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory. This rating
                         change is justified because Bank management and the government proactively made the critical decision to promptly cancel the Project Loan and Credit when further implementation
                         progress was no longer possible and given the good implementation progress made during the great majority of the project period, and strong results under the PDO.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In response to the GoI's request, the Project cancels an undisbursed amount of US$163.7 million from IBRD Loan and SDR11.0 million (approx. US$16.4 million) from IDA Credit
                         after the consideration of expenses that are yet to be reimbursed. Although the remaining planned activities supported by the Project will remain partially fulfilled, it should not detract
                         from the transformational nature of the reforms undertaken by the participating states, and the key milestones which have been achieved covering a wide range of legal and
                         institutional reforms, and fundamental changes in the capacity and potential for the CCS institutions covered by the Project.
