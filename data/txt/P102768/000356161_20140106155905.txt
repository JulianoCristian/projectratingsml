﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.     Country and sector background. The project was prepared at a time when India recorded
unprecedented economic growth, yet ending poverty remained a central challenge. India's economic
growth had averaged above eight percent a year since 2003 with inflation rate at 3-4 percent, but about
270 million Indians still lived on less than a dollar a day, particularly in rural areas. The Government of
India (Gol) viewed a well-functioning financial sector as a primary pillar of sustaining growth and
alleviating rural poverty, and had introduced a range of financial sector reforms since the early 1990s.
2.     While financial sector reforms improved financial services for the middle-class, rural areas still
had limited access to formal finance. The Bank's Economic Sector Work (ESW) in 2004 indicated that
rural households - particularly small and marginal farmers - often had low access to deposit accounts
and to credit from formal sources.' Lack of formal finance meant that small and marginal farmers had to
rely heavily on high cost credit from moneylenders, often with adverse consequences. Such informal
financiers were spread very widely across the country, and improving access to finance for India's rural
poor through flexible products presented a formidable challenge in a country as vast and varied as India.
3.     Government response. Reforms of rural finance sector had emerged as a key development
priority for Gol. The country's strategy for the sector had three major pillars: (i) increasing competition
amongst commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), cooperative credit institutions, and
microfinance institutions (MFIs); (ii) developing products for the better management and mitigation of
risks in rural finance; and (iii) reforming Rural Finance Institutions (RFIs). Under the third pillar, the
focus was on short-term rural Cooperative Credit System (ST CCS), which has the largest network
among all types of RFIs in India. The ST CCS, with its three-tier structure, had 108,779 Primary
Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), 367 District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCB), and 31 State
Cooperative Banks (SCBs) as of March 2005 .2 With its strong presence in rural areas, the system played
an important role in providing credit to marginalized farmers. However, it suffered from poor
governance, inadequate management, and weak regulation and supervision arising from dual control by
both state governments and financial sector regulators/supervisors.
4.     Recognizing the strong potential role of the ST CCS to serve the financial needs of small and
marginal farmers, the Gol set up a Task Force on the Revival of Rural Cooperative Credit Institutions in
August 2004.3 While the scale of problems varied across states and tiers, the Task Force identified as the
most pressing issue the impairment in governance, management and lending of ST CCS. Problems
identified included non-conduct of elections over long periods, supersession of boards, and interference
by state governments in administrative and financial decisions, including lending rates.
1 "India: Scaling-up access to finance for India's rural poor" (2004), Report No. 30740-IN, Washington D.C., World Bank.
Marginal farmers refer to those with less than 1 acre of landholding, and small farmers with 1 to 4 acres.
2 In the PAD, a term "Credit Cooperative Banks (CCBs)" is also used to refer three-tier institutions: SCB, DCCB, and PACS.
PACS constitute the base at the village level; DCCBs the intermediate tier; and SCBs, the apex.
The Task Force was appointed under the chairmanship of Professor A. Vaidyanathan to formulate a practical reform plan to
strengthen rural ST CCS. The final report was submitted to the Gol in 2005.
1


﻿5.    Based on the recommendations of the Task Force, the Gol, state governments, and core
stakeholders agreed on far-reaching reforms of the ST CCS, particularly on governance. This was
especially relevant as the national and state governments had joint responsibility for the supervision and
regulation of the sector, and the state governments had deep interests in the sector. As an incentive for
reform, the Gol developed a comprehensive assistance package, including a recapitalization grant to
transform potentially viable ST CCS into financially and operationally sound institutions with strong
governance processes in place. The provision of this package was contingent on a major revision of the
state-level legal and regulatory framework, which was detailed in a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) between the states, the Gol, and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development
(NABARD), and mandated the full adherence to the prudential norms and governance standards set by
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, India's central bank). NABARD was the key implementation agency.
6.    The Gol's package covered assistance for: (i) capacity building to strengthen the managerial and
technical capabilities of ST CCS; (ii) computerization; (iii) financial restructuring support to bring
potentially viable ST CCS to an acceptable level of financial health; and (iv) implementation support.
The total cost of the reform package was estimated at Rsl3,596 crores (~USD3 billion). Participation by
the states was on a voluntary basis to ensure commitment to the reform.
7.    Rationale for Bank involvement. The Gol requested financial and technical assistance from the
Bank and other development partners to support the implementation of its revival package. The Bank
was expected to contribute to the program through, among others: (i) bringing best practices and
technical expertise, drawing on experience in the reform of credit cooperatives worldwide and on
lessons learned from projects in India; and (ii) enhancing the impact of the reforms during the project
implementation period; (iii) insulating reforms during implementation; and (iv) be part of a platform of
funders supporting the program. The Bank contributed to the program through a Specific Investment
Loan (SIL), while some elements of the program, in particular recapitalization and associated
conditions, had a nature of Development Policy Loan (DPL). The project's objective was closely aligned
with the Bank's India Country Strategy 2004, which included accelerating rural growth under the
priority of promoting private sector-led growth.
8.     Engagement by other funders. The government's revival package also benefited from
financing and technical assistance (TA) support from other funders, including the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW) and TA from the Deutsche Gesellschaft fir
Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GTZ/GIZ). In December 2006, ADB's board approved a policy based
programmatic loan of USD1 billion to five states under the package (distinct from the five participating
states, PS, in the Bank project). KfW also approved a policy loan of EUR130 million to be disbursed in
parallel with the ADB loan. In addition, GTZ provided TA through NABARD, including the
development of a ST CCS training and certification system through establishment of the Center for
Professional Excellence in Cooperatives (C-PEC), support to the common accounting system (CAS) for
PACS and Management Information System (MIS) for ST CCS, and improvement of ST CCS audit and
rating systems.
1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9.    The PDO was to assist in providing Credit Cooperative Banks (CCBs)' members, including
small and marginal farmers, with significantly enhanced access to formal finance (credit, savings, etc.),
2


﻿by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the participating states are transformed into efficient and
commercially sustainable institutions.4
10.    The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to
measure the expected outcome:
i.   At least three-fourths of the participating ST CCS improve recovery rates by 5 to 10 percent a
year, over the project period (relative to the baseline);
ii.   A rapid and upward trend (increase of 70 percent over the project life) in ground-level financing
(credit) extended to farmers through the ST CCS;
iii.  A rapid and upward trend in the number of marginal and small farmers who receive credit from
the ST CCS (increase of at least 50 percent by the end of the project period, relative to the
baseline);
iv.   At least two-thirds of the participating ST CCS report increased profitability by the end of the
project period (relative to the baseline); and
v.   Participating ST CCS publish elections schedules and hold elections on a regular basis
(whenever due), over the project period.
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
11.    The PDO was not revised.
12.    In May 2011, the target rates for the KPI on Return on Assets (ROA) (4th KPI in Section 1.2)
were formally revised from 1 percent to 0.5 percent for DCCBs, and to 0.8 percent for SCBs (Level 2
restructuring). This was done to reflect the inherent lower profitability levels which resulted from
relatively lower margins available in agricultural finance, together with the higher volatility in
agricultural output and prevailing political economy factors (such as the debt waiver scheme in 2008).
The new target rates were deemed sufficient for long-term sustainability of the entities.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
13.    The ST CCS comprising SCBs, DCCBs, and PACS, were the institutional forms targeted. The
project directly aimed at improving the outreach, viability and governance of the sector over time.
As the ultimate beneficiaries, the project aimed at helping the members of rural cooperative financial
institutions to benefit from enhanced access to formal financial services. The focus was particularly on
small and marginalized farmers, which rely on the ST CCS for accessing crop loans.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
14.    The project had four components (Estimated Project Costs/Bank Financing at appraisal are
4 While the PAD's main section (B.2) and Financing Agreement had the same PDO, the datasheet of the PAD included an
additional sentence to the PDO: "The project aimed to support the Government ofIndia's (Go) program to reform and
revitalize the country's rural credit cooperative banks (CCBs), which include State Cooperative Banks (SCBs), District
Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) and Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)."
Recovery rates refer to a percentage of loan recovery (collection) to a total amount due (see also Section 3 for further
discussion). These are measured in differing ways - sometimes cumulatively, and sometimes, for the current period.

﻿shown in parentheses; project cost is provided in Annex 1, and detailed component descriptions are
provided in Annex 2):
-  Component 1. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building (USD25 million/USD20 million): This
aimed to build the capabilities of ST CCS in all three tiers to strengthen their ability to comply
with the new legal, regulatory and supervisory framework, and improve performance and
sustainability.
-  Component 2. Support for Implementation of Information Technology (USD100 million/USD80
million): This supported computerization of ST CCS to enhance their efficiency and transparency
through enabling the efficient implementation of the new CAS and MIS, and fostering cost
efficiencies through facilitating the pooling of costs related to back office transactions.
-  Component 3. Support for Financial Restructuring (USD618 million/USD495 million): This
supported the financial restructuring of potentially viable ST CCS through recapitalization (grant,
not equity) so as to restore the value of members' capital in the ST CCS (that had been eroded
through losses), and enhance these institutions' capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) to 7
percent. Provision of funds under the Financial Restructuring Support (FRS) was linked to the
implementation of a set of far-reaching and time-bound legal, regulatory and institutional reforms
(benchmark activities) to address the governance and operational weaknesses affecting ST CCS.
-  Component 4. Support for Project Implementation (USD7million/USD5million): This provided
support for: (i) capacity building for project implementation; (ii) special audits; and (iii) ensuring
effective project monitoring and information flows during implementation (including improved
disclosure/accountability mechanisms at all levels (central, state, district and village levels).
1.6  Revised Components:
15.    The components were not revised.
1.7  Other significant changes
16.    The project foresaw financing of reforms in five states. Initially, Gol identified the following
PS for the Bank project: Gujarat, Haryana, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Uttarakhand. Together they
accounted for 21,762 PACS (23% of total PACS in India).6 However, by 2010 it became apparent that
Uttarakhand was not making sufficient progress towards meeting the benchmark reforms, in particular
legal reforms, and thus would not be eligible for receiving recapitalization support. In December 2010,
illustrative of the 'no-compromise on reforms approach' adopted and experience-based-adjustment to
implementation, the Gol formally proposed the state of West Bengal as the substitution for Uttarakhand
to be funded by the Bank. Given this motivation, the Bank agreed and accepted West Bengal instead,
which increased the number of PACS under this project to 29,511 PACS (31% of total PACS).7
17.    In May 2011, USD60 million was formally transferred from component 2 (implementation
of IT) to component 3 (FRS package).8 The special audits done for each ST CCS after project

﻿appraisal revealed a broader financing gap to be covered under component 3 (see Table 1). The Task
Force had already highlighted that data quality issues could mean that estimates could vary, and had
suggested carrying out special audits to determine the most accurate financial gap.9 On the other hand,
the amount required under component 2 turned out to be smaller, due to: (i) IT cost estimates during
project preparation being revised downwards based on implementation experience in states (non-Bank
funded) where IT roll out had already progressed; (ii) fewer PACS being computerized relative to
original projections (17,000 revised down to 10,000); and (iii) lower costs of software development after
states agreed to adopt national level software that was designed and tested in the state of Tamil Nadu.
An amount of USD60 million was reallocated from component 2 to 3 through a Level 2 restructuring.
18.    The Gol contributed a larger share of the recapitalization funding than initially expected.
As specified in the PAD0, the share of recapitalization was to be based on a pre-determined formula, in
which losses were to be divided between the Gol, the state governments and the ST CCS itself by type
of underlying cause of losses. The Task Force report in 2004 had estimated that this formula would
result in around 68 percent of total recapitalization costs being borne by Gol, and 28 percent by state
governments and 4 percent by the sector itself. However, special audits of each entity revealed that a
larger share of the losses actually arose from the agricultural loan portfolio that was to be covered by the
Gol. Therefore at project closing, in the PS, Gol had assumed a larger share (77 percent).

19.    In March 2012, Gol requested a closing date extension by one year to allow for full
implementation of the individual components. The request stemmed mainly from two remaining
activities: (i) the completion of the FRS component which was, while already largely disbursed, pending
finalization of a few benchmark actions; and (ii) slower than expected progress of the IT rollout
component. The Bank concurred with this request (June 2012, Level 2 restructuring), since progress on
development outcomes across states had been positive overall, most key reform activities were achieved
(though a few outstanding benchmarks remained) and as the costs of extension were limited.
20.    The Gol later requested a cancellation of the undisbursed project amount. Following the
initial request in March 2012, during the year, it had become clear that the total cost for carrying out the
final round of recapitalization was much larger than initially anticipated (around 33 percent more than
the initial program size). Being in the backdrop of the 2008-09 global financial crisis - the response to
which had included expansionary fiscal policies that were then being tapered - and in view of broader
9As data quality issues are not uncommon in cooperatives, many other countries worldwide, such as Mexico, Bolivia, and
Paraguay, have also used a similar approach to assessing the correct financial position of the cooperative sector.
10 As detailed in the PAD on page 35, the Gol would assume all losses related to all credit businesses of PACS and
agricultural credit businesses of SCBs/DCCBs.
5


﻿concerns on fiscal imbalances, the Gol ultimately deemed it not feasible to allocate the additional
resources for the program. As a result, a partial cancellation in the amount of USD163.7 million from
IBRD loan (mostly towards FRS) and SDR13.3 million (approx. USD20.1 million) from the IDA credit
took place. ADB and KfW, who supported the government in rolling out the revival package in another
five states, were also affected similarly, and could not complete full disbursements. Though the
activities that were behind the reasons for requesting the extension were not fully completed, at the time
the extension request was made, the intention and objectives seemed worthwhile pursuing, and the
incremental costs to the Bank of this extension were negligible. As discussed below, data at project
closure on ST CCS capitalization levels indicated stronger than expected performance. Hence in
retrospect, as it turned out, Gol's action had only a small impact.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
21.    Strong country ownership with a careful assessment of needed reforms and extensive
stakeholder consultation contributed to a comprehensive reform package and good readiness for
implementation. Studies commissioned by the Gol's Task Force resulted in a very comprehensive and
holistic reform package, which included reforms on the macro, meso and micro-level, and provided a
clear set of reform incentives. The government broadly consulted with the relevant stakeholders on the
package, and prior to project effectiveness, a total of 13 states" had already signed the MOU with the
Gol and NABARD and six states had completed the upfront legal amendments, and special audits, and
recapitalization of PACS were initiated. This confirmed the overall good ownership for the Gol reform
package and readiness for implementation, which was later also reflected in the strong initial
disbursements and achievement of reform actions and capacity building activities under the project.
22.    The revival program    included a strong institutional set-up to implement, guide and
monitor the project. NABARD, with its strong national and state presence, was the main implementing
agency. NABARD set up a dedicated department fully responsible for program implementation. In
addition, implementation committees were established at national, state and district level with clear
Terms of Reference (TOR) to provide policy guidance and monitoring of the program at various
levels.12 This ensured an effective and coherent implementation arrangement across the country.
23.    The project preparation benefitted from    a strong Bank team    and ESW.13 The project
followed the design of the country-wide revival package for rural ST CCS prepared by the Gol. As key
features of the program were already determined by the Gol at the time of the project inception, the
project preparation focused on: (i) clarifications on the program outcomes, objectives, design and
" Representing two thirds of the ST CCS in India
12 The structure comprised (i) National-level Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC), which was responsible for
the overall policy and strategic direction of the reforms; (b) State Level Implementation and Monitoring Committees
(SLICs); and (c) District Level Implementation and Monitoring Committees (DLICs).
" The project inception mission took place in September 2006, pre-appraisal mission in November 2006, Quality
Enhancement Review (QER) in December 2006, Operations Committee Review (OCR) meeting in March 2007, appraisal in
March/April 2007, negotiations in May 2007, board approval in June 2007, and effectiveness in December 2007.

﻿implementation arrangements; and (ii) discussions on principles, terms and contents of the Bank's
engagement in the program. The Bank team included members who were familiar with the country
context, as well as global experts in cooperatives, bank restructuring, institutional development, and
technology and innovation. In addition, ESW helped a better and comprehensive understanding of the
sector and its challenges.
24.    The Bank team     coordinated well with other funders to ensure harmonization and
alignment under the program. Since project inception, the Bank team had emphasized to the Gol,
NABARD and other funders the importance of achieving a satisfactory alignment of the policy
framework and implementation arrangements among all funders supporting the program. The Bank team
closely worked with ADB and KfW during preparation, particularly on: (i) alignment between the
tranche release conditions of ADB and KfW, and the disbursement conditions of the Bank's fundingl4
(ii) coherent approach to the program and geographical coverage; (iii) an aligned and consistent M&E,
reporting, and supervision framework; and (iv) coordination on TA activities. 15
25.    Given the nature of the program, the selection of the Bank lending instrument posed a
challenge, yet was carefully analyzed. Lessons from previous Bank operations indicated that policy
reforms as well as recapitalization programs are generally more amenable to support with fast-
disbursing products (DPLs), while the institutional development contemplated under the project may be
supported more effectively through disbursements against specific expenditures (SILs). ADB and KfW,
other funders of the program, decided to support the Gol's program through a multi-tranche policy loan
with specific disbursement conditions. However, the Bank project had a larger focus on provision of TA
for the ST CCS. After careful assessments and discussions with the Gol, the decision was to use a SIL
through a sector-wide approach (SWAp), as the project's success crucially depended on the deployment
of project funds towards investments in the various areas for which they were earmarked. It was also
agreed that the project would not be appropriately supported through an Adaptable Program Loan (APL),
as the project was designed to support the country-wide reform over a well-defined time frame in states
that were willing to participate.
26.    The PDO targets were ambitious in a few dimensions. While the supported governance
reforms can be expected to lead to a substantially enhanced financial and operational performance of the
participating entities over time, and are essential requirements for a commercially sustainable financial
sector, it was optimistic to expect the extent of turnaround targeted on financial viability of the sector
within only five years. Also, as will be discussed below, a number of other exogenous factors affected
the viability of the ST CCS.
27.    In line with good practices, strong emphasis was placed on front-loading governance
reforms, and making recapitalization contingent on reform implementation. Such an approach was
in line with lessons learnt from other financial sector reform projects: (i) that financial capitalization
14 While the Bank team did not see conflicting arrangements between the ADB's policy loan and the Bank's SIL, 1st and 2nd
tranche of the ADB's policy loan (a total of USD500 million) was aimed to finance the ground work for key governance
reforms under the package (i.e. front-loading of a part of recapitalization).
15 The Bank organized a two day workshop in January 2007, which brought together representatives from Gol, NABARD,
and state governments, as well as sector experts and other agencies (ADB, KfW, GTZ and DFID) supporting the Gol's
program, to discuss and agree on key technical aspects related to the program's design and implementation arrangements.

﻿should be accompanied by necessary reforms in the overall legal, regulatory and governance framework,
and provided together with TA to improve the performance of the recapitalized entities; and (ii) key
reforms, that involve upfront commitments to good governance, competition and market discipline,
should be front-loaded to ensure the institutions' commitment to the restructuring effort.16
28.   Clear eligibility criteria for the FRS package were defined. The project followed the
categorization and thresholds under the Gol package. PACS with a recovery rate of over 50 percent (as
of June 30, 2004) were deemed to be sufficiently sound in their financial and operational management
and instantly recapitalized (category A). On the other hand, PACS with a recovery rate of between 30-50
percent received their recapitalization support in tranches, with the pay-out contingent upon progress in
their financial soundness indicators (category B). The state governments were to determine the future set
up of PACS with recovery levels of less than 30 percent (category C).
29.   The approach towards recapitalization or liquidation of category C PACS could have been
clarified further. The PAD details the project's support toward category A and B PACS, but further
clarity on the approach for category C could have been provided. In fact, the 1s meeting of the NIMC in
May 2006 had agreed that: (i) if a category C PACS improves its recovery to 50 percent by 30 June
2007, it could be considered for inclusion in the package; and (ii) in case a PACS remains ineligible, the
FRS due to such PACS would be directly adjusted with the DCCB concerned.17 This does not mean that
the project supported category C PACS. However, such PACS were given a period to improve their
recovery rate to the same levels as for eligible PACS, and had a chance to receive FRS if they met the
threshold. While the project did not provide the FRS to those that remained category C by the deadline
(ineligible PACS), these details were not reflected in the PAD.s
30.   In retrospect, risks affecting profitability of the sector could have been highlighted further
in the project design. The pre-appraisal mission had in-depth discussions with the Gol and NABARD
on key risks. Based on this, risks and mitigation measures were assessed and reflected in the PAD. The
project design could have reflected more strongly the risks due to credit management capacity of ST
CCS, as well as risks arising from crop loan programs with concessional interest rates and occasional
loan waivers applied by governments to agriculture credit.19
2.2 Implementation
31.   Periodic Bank's supervision mission ensured a deep and continuous dialogue with Gol,
NABARD and other funders. During the 5.5 year implementation period, the project benefited from a
total of eight supervision missions, including an intensive Mid-term Review (MTR) mission in January
2010. Supervision benefitted from having a task team leader and core team members located in country.
The team comprised of members with significant country/sector knowledge, crucial for overseeing
implementation of this complex project. Every mission had in-depth discussions with the Gol, state
governments, NABARD Head Office and Regional Offices, other funders, and included field visits to
SCBs, DCCBs, and PACS. The missions involved comprehensive review and guidance on key aspects

﻿of the implementation progress, including: benchmark activities, component tracking, and quality
assurance over the special audits for the FRS component and fiduciary aspects. Findings were captured
in detail in Aide-Memoires and clear action plans and recommendations listed (and followed up on).
32.    Strong commitment was given by the state governments and NABARD                   toward the
governance reform. In all the five Bank-funded states, substantial efforts were made toward the legal
and regulatory reform under the revival package. Regular and periodic meetings of the NIMC, SLIC and
20
DLIC ensured the coordination among the stakeholders and holistic approach toward the program.
NABARD and its Regional Offices and Gol maintained a consistent and strong position on the
irreversibility of reforms and did not compromise on these at any stage. They coordinated closely with
the state government and ST CCS, and monitored progress. In the last year of the project, Gujarat and
UP completed all reform benchmark activities and became eligible for receiving the full FRS.
33.    In early 2008, the Gol announced a loan waiver scheme.21 Against the backdrop of inadequate
risk mitigation and a spate of crop failures, millions of farmers, particularly small and marginal farmers,
had non-willfully failed to repay loans and had thereby lost access to formal finance and had to rely on
more expensive informal sources only. In extreme cases this had led to farmer suicides. Gol took the
difficult decision to support a one-time waiver to bring farmers back into the fold of formal finance.
While understanding the broader development dimension behind Gol's decision, Bank highlighted the
potentially adverse impact debt waivers could have on credit culture, as well as the risk they posed to
financial markets/institutions. While the waiver was implemented, Bank suggestions to communicate to
the farmers on the benefits of repaying and incentivizing farmers to repay were also implemented by the
Gol. Still the impact of the debt waiver led to a dip in recovery rates and this exogenous event impacted
the indicators on ST CCS' viability as measured by the ROA and recovery rate. After a significant dip
post-waiver, the recovery rate improved slowly and recovered back to normal levels.
34.    PACS own contributions to the FRS component were delayed and insufficient relative to
initially targeted levels. The Gol reform program required losses incurred due to fraud and corruption
to be borne by the cooperatives themselves. However, given the magnitude of contribution required as
well as contained margins on lending, a majority of PACS could not find adequate resources through
their own business surpluses. This could have eroded the impact of the recapitalization and contributed
to the lower than expected changes in their viability.22 That said the capitalization at PACS level from
20 Overall, 9 NIMC meetings (until January 2011), 84 SLIC meetings and 1,760 DLIC meetings were held (the numbers of
SLIC and DLIC meetings are in the Bank supported states).
21 The waiver was a one-time scheme (the last such national waiver was in 1989), waiving Rs71,000 crore (USD14 billion)
and affecting approximately 45 million households across the country. The key elements of the scheme included: (a) all
agricultural loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperative credit institutions up to
March 31, 2007 and overdue as on December 31, 2007 were covered under the scheme; (b) for marginal and small farmers,
there was a complete waiver of all loans that was overdue on December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid until February
29, 2008; (c) agricultural loans were restructured and rescheduled by banks in 2004 and 2006 through special packages; and
(d) the implementation of the debt waiver and debt relief scheme was to be completed by June 30, 2008 (Aide-memoire of 1st
supervision mission). The number of members receiving benefits of waiver of defaulted loans from the ST CCS was 12.9
million. Clear eligibility criteria were defined and implementation was cash-less (through accounting entries).
22 According to the Gujarat impact assessment, though a small sample size, only 4 out of 82 assessed PACS actually
contributed their share, while the others (62 PACS) used the funds from the recapitalization package to do so. The assessment
also indicates that the additional funds from the recapitalization were only visible in the accounts in 75 percent of the PACS.
9


﻿government resources was typically sufficient to achieve a healthy level of net worth, which mitigated
the adverse impact of low PACS' own contributions to the recapitalization.23
35.    Members Education of PACS was highlighted during the
implementation, but the attention paid under the project was
lower than expected. The Bank team emphasized the importance of
enhancing member awareness about the program. NABARD agreed
on the need for initiating a member education initiative and some
states initiated the activities such as preparation of member education
materials (Figure shows a poster developed in Odisha for example)
and financial literacy workshops. However, a lesser focus was given
to take a holistic and strategic approach toward members' education.
36.    A partial cancellation affected the full completion of FRS
and IT components, but extension and cancellation were carefully assessed and adverse effects
were mitigated. As discussed in Section 1.7, when the Gol made the extension request, the Bank team
thoroughly analyzed the incremental costs and benefits of the project extension. When broader fiscal
concerns came up during the last year of the project, the Bank team engaged in intensive discussions
with the Gol and NABARD, and also explored possibilities to obtain a counterpart funding only for IT
component. While the disbursement of remaining amount for FRS was not completed, it turned out that
capitalization levels were satisfactory (and higher than expected) with 73 percent of the component
amount disbursed. In part this was on account of the (exogenous) waiver program, which benefited
banks' through recoveries of past bad loans.24 The IT component also lacked funding; while manual roll-
out for the CAS was completed and the bidding process was initiated the project could not complete
computerization of PACS. This component therefore lagged expectations and only Haryana completed
partial procurement of hardware and software. However, post-program initiatives have provided
alternate avenues.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
37.    The M&E indicators were directly linked to the expected outcome. Since the project
inception, the Bank team emphasized the importance of tracking inputs, outputs and outcomes in a
systematic and timely manner. The five KPIs included well-targeted indicators and benchmarks to track
outreach (two KPIs), financial performance (two KPIs), and governance enhancements (1 KPI) in the
sector, all of which was directly linked to the overall expected outcome of increased access to financial
services by the ultimate beneficiaries (the farmers), and improved efficiency and sustainability of the
primary target group (the cooperative sector itself). In addition, outputs indicators were well designed to
cover timely and satisfactory component-wise delivery and expected outputs.25 The baseline, mid-term
and end targets were carefully analyzed based on the sector data obtained from NABARD and
23 Except UP, where the PACS share was significant (27%).
24 So the waiver reduced recovery rates temporarily, but also helped banks recover past loans - so had a two sided, effect.
25 From the 7b ISR (November, 2010), the five core financial sector indicators were added to the Intermediate Results
Indicators as part of a corporate mandate to capture data. These indicators were: (i) volume of Bank support: lines of credit -
microfinance; (ii) volume of Bank support: institutional development - microfinance; (iii) outstanding microfinance loan
portfolio; (iv) no. of active loan accounts - microfinance; and (v) percentage of project supported institutions that are
reporting on this indicator (supplemental indicator).

﻿NAFSCOB. An additional indicator on other financial services besides credit could have been useful to
focus ST CCS's activities beyond credit.
38.    Overall there were significant improvements in data quality at all levels, though
consolidated data especially for PACS faced challenges on timeliness and quality. Sector data
quality has clearly improved at all levels. The KPIs were tracked and updated in every semi-annual
mission. The Bank team also helped NABARD develop one page matrix to track progress of benchmark
activities in all PS. Still, the data collected had some weaknesses, particularly at PACS level. A table
format was prepared to collect consistent and unified indicators from each state, but the actual data was
sometimes not provided in a consistent or timely manner.26 The issues with data for the PACS was
mostly in terms of consolidating data from the large number of PACS (more than 100,000 country-
wide), even though data quality and availability at the individual PACS level, improved dramatically.
39.   Impact studies were undertaken both by NABARD         and the Bank. The PAD M&E
framework included reference to carrying out a long term impact assessment in three states. Impact
assessments were carried out at the end of 2011 by NABARD and the Bank's economics and research
unit conducted impact studies at PACS level in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh (a non-PS). While providing
useful information, NABARD's studies focused on outputs delivered by the program and the Bank
study, while focused on outcomes, faced difficulties in maintaining the 'control groups'.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards
40.    The project had no specific social or environmental safeguards issues and concerns, but the
safeguards category was not consistent in the appraisal documents and ISR. While the PAD
designated the project to category "C", the appraisal stage Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS)
categorized the project as "F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)". ISR also had category "F". From
what is stipulated in the ISDS and PAD, the project was meant to be "category "C", as the project did
not involve line of credit and was not likely to cause any significant adverse safeguards impacts.
Financial Management (FM)
41.    The FM performance of the project was rated "Moderately Satisfactory" for most part of
the project implementation, but downgraded to "Moderately Unsatisfactory" towards project close.
The auditors issued unqualified opinion throughout the project implementation period except for the
period October 2008 - March 2009 for which a qualified opinion was issued; this was resolved
subsequently on production of information by NABARD. However, delays in submission of Interim
Unaudited Financial Reports (IUFRs), audit reports and claims remained an issue. The FM performance
rating was downgraded to "Moderately Unsatisfactory" (see Annex 3 for detailed assessment).
26 The key issues included: (i) some of the data did not include the baseline as of 2005; (ii) only net annual increase was
available for the number of borrowers, and not the absolute figures (2nd KPI); (iii) some states provided a range of ST CCS's
recovery rates in the state, while others gave average (3rd KPI); (iv) individual DCCB's data was not provided or available to
track the number of DCCBs that achieved target ROA (4th KPI) and CRAR (Output Indicator for component 3); and (v) the
collection and delivery of data were delayed.
11


﻿Procurement
42.   The procurement has been rated "Moderately Satisfactory". Although the IT component
could not be completed, each state progressed with the procurement preparation (see Annex 3). More
recently, NABARD has submitted a list of 10 post review contract awarded during the 24 month period
from July 2011 to June 2013. The Procurement Post Review (PPR) is being conducted by a PPR
consultant engaged by the Bank at the time of preparing this ICR.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
43.   Computerization for ST CCS has been initiated and continued by NABARD, state
governments and the sector. Although the project could not support the IT component as envisaged,
the impact of this is mitigated by other initiatives. In a substantive engagement, NABARD is facilitating
a Core Banking Solution (CBS) platform with 205 SCBs/DCCBs in 16 states and three Union
Territories (UTs). The migration has been ongoing, and once completed, will help customers with more
efficient access to financial services. In addition, some states like Gujarat and Odisha, are financing the
automation of CAS and MIS for PACS with funding resources from the state, the SCBs and DCCBs.
44.   RBI set up an expert committee chaired by the then-chairman of NABARD to study the
three-tiered structure of ST CCS. The committee's final report (January 2013) recommended a change
in business model for PACS, in particular suggesting PACS could become "Business Correspondents
(BCs)" for DCCBs. Subsequently, based on RBI's acceptance of the recommendation, NABARD issued
a circular to SCBs and DCCBs in July 2013, to provide guidance on decisions and arrangements to be
made in case that PACS were to become BCs.
45.   Capacity building efforts for ST CCS continues with support from NABARD and the
sector itself. The Bankers Institute of Rural Development (BIRD) continues to be a center for providing
training of trainers programs to cooperative training institutes, such as Regional Institutes of
Cooperative Management (RICMs) and Institutes of Cooperative Management (ICMs). These institutes
remain proactively engaged in capacity building of the ST CCS.27 The Cooperative Development Fund
(CDF), which has been operated with annual surplus funds of NABARD, continues to support
institutional development efforts at PACS level, including resource mobilization, human resource
development, operational streamlining, and establishment of PACS Development Cells in DCCBs.
These initiatives bode well for the continued strengthening and future sustainability of the ST CCS.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
46.   The project's objective continues to be part of the Gol's overall strategy to promote rural
development and alleviate poverty. As discussed in Section 1, the project was highly relevant to
development priorities to reform the rural finance sector at inception. Its relevance continues. The
27 They have funding from their own and other independent sources, outside of the project/reform program.
12


﻿Bank's impact evaluation found that lack of adequate access to finance is the biggest constraint to
improving crop yields. In its latest Five-Year plan for 2012-2017, the Gol continues to place a strong
focus on increasing agricultural growth rates and promoting rural development to further reduce the
number of rural poor. Cooperatives, which in many instances are the only link to financial services for
the otherwise unbanked segment of the population (also echoed in the Bank's impact evaluation that
found that PACS were the most preferred, and most utilized, source of credit for small and marginal
farmers), continue to play an important role for providing the target beneficiaries with access to
affordable and reliable funding, and the government reiterated the important role of the cooperative
sector in providing financial services to the rural poor.28 A number of reforms such as improving the
crop insurance program, building technology and capacity of institutions, developing stronger
regulations, etc. are ongoing.
47.    The project also remains relevant with regard to the World Bank's new           country
partnership strategy (CPS) for 2013-2017. The CPS includes measures to foster rural development
and agricultural productivity, and supports the government of India in developing and rolling out
integrated approaches to financial inclusion, with a particular focus on rural areas. A project to help
scale up sustainable and responsible microfinance and another to foster housing finance are under
implementation and a project on agricultural insurance is being considered. The IFC supports measures
to deepen financial inclusion, focusing on the development and adoption of new technologies, and
responsible financial intermediation in the sector.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Brief discussion of causal linkages and outputs provided under the project
48.    The project delivered most of the expected outputs, despite lower than anticipated
disbursements.29 The project supported significantly higher outreach of financial services amongst tens
of millions of farmers, enhanced governance and supported improvements in the performance of the ST
CCS in the five PS. As discussed above, the Gol revival package included a number of far-reaching
governance reforms as benchmarks for recapitalization. It also included a massive roll-out of training
which was directly linked to build institutional capacity. The four project components, which were fully
aligned with the Gol revival package (see Annex 2 for a discussion of linkage), formed a holistic and
interconnected approach to enhancing governance, and through this enhance performance and outreach
of the sector as stipulated in the PDO. As Annex 2 details, the project delivered most of the expected
activities.
Assessment of outcomes supported under the government's revival package and the project
49.    There is agreement in the literature and the international donor community that poor
governance is one of the root causes of weaknesses and lack of sustainability of financial and

29 As discussed in Sections 1 and 2 above, the adverse impact of the cancelation, lower disbursement was significantly
mitigated.
13


﻿producer cooperatives worldwide.30 As discussed in Section 1, governance problems were widespread
in the Indian ST CCS, management and Board members had limited capacity and knowledge of their
respective roles, and government interference in day-to-day management was substantial. These issues
were identified in the Task Force report of 2004 as the core problems affecting the viability of the
sector, and constraining the provision of affordable financial services in rural areas.
50.    The following paragraphs will assess progress in the PS' made under the Gol's revival package
towards the stated project development objective. The assessment of achievements towards the stated
PDO are broken down into three dimensions: (i) impact of the revival package on the governance and
institutional set-up of the sector (main focus of the project towards building potentially viable and
sustainable ST CCS - 5th KPI); (ii) impact of the reforms on the viability of the sector (1" and 4th KPI);
and (iii) progress made towards providing members with enhanced access to financial and other support
services (2nd and 3rd KPI). The latter two were the longer term expected outcomes to be achieved by the
supported governance reforms.
(i)    Impact of the revival package on the governance of the sector (Highly Satisfactory)- 5th KPI:
51.    The revival package paved the way for the much-needed revisions of the legal framework.
Since the launch of the revival package by the Gol in 2006, the Cooperative Societies Acts (CSAs) were
amended in 23 states, including the five states supported under this project. By incorporating the agreed
benchmark reforms, the revised CSAs introduced far-reaching reforms to improve the sector's autonomy
and shield it from political influence (see Box 1). This has been a considerable achievement, given the
status that existed pre-project, and given that earlier attempts to revise the legal frameworks and enhance
governance failed in the absence of strong financial incentives.31 Model by-laws were developed in each
PS and the majority of entities in all three tiers amended their rules and by-laws in line with the revised
CSAs. The achieved governance reforms have since been further cemented by the 97th constitutional
amendment, which mandates the participation of women, scheduled tribes and scheduled castes in the
board of cooperatives.32 The 97th constitutional amendment highlights how much the need for improved
30 In 1995, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) defined cooperatives as "autonomous associations of persons united
voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and
democratically-controlled enterprise", and included amongst the seven core principles for cooperatives: (i) democratic
member control; (ii) member economic participation; (iii) autonomy and independence; and (iv) education, training and
information. See for example Shaw (2006), "Overview of Corporate Governance Issues for Co-operatives", Discussion paper
of the Co-operative College of Manchester, commissioned by the Global Corporate Governance Forum. Manchester, UK,
or Cuevas, Fischer (2006), "Cooperative Financial Institutions - Governance, Regulation and Supervision", World Bank
Working Paper No 82, Washington, DC.
31 The Task Force Report (2004), paragraph 2.17 onward, describes earlier attempts made to revamp the existing legal
framework by introducing a new model law, concluding that "Progress in implementing these suggestions has been very
tardy because of the States' unwillingness to share in costs and their reluctance to dilute their powers and to cede regulatory
powers to the RBI."
32 The 97th Constitutional Amendment now also covers cooperative societies, and highlights that the cooperative principles of
voluntary formation, democratic member-control, participation and autonomous functioning are to be adhered. It also
incorporates most of the provisions introduced on the state level CSAs with regard to boards, annual meetings, voting rights,
as well as mandates annual external audits. However, the Bank team noted already in the MTR in 2010, that the legal reforms
in the states of Haryana, UP and Odisha had proactively ensured participation from the marginalized social groups
(particularly scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and women) through reservation of specific numbers of directors on the
boards of the PACS and the DCCBs, even though this was not mandated under the program.
14


﻿governance is now understood and accepted within the country. This is a significant achievement and
relative to the widespread governance concerns (including un-elected boards, no fit and proper criteria,
government appointed boards, lack of standards and understanding of roles and responsibilities, lack of
representativeness of smaller farmers, etc) prior to the reform program, and today, there is a major
improvement in governance frameworks and practice.
Box 1: Reforming the Cooperative Societies Act - the example of Gujarat
The state of Gujarat signed a MOU with the Gol at the end of 2006, and revised its CSA in early 2008. The revised CSA
incorporated a number of important and far-reaching changes:
- Members of the sector, who are in arrears on loans, are excluded from voting until arrears are settled.
- For DCCBs and SCBs, the management committee should have at least two professionals on board which are in line with
'fit and proper' requirements of RBI.
- The number of state government representatives in committees is limited to one where the state government has a share in
capital, and none in cooperatives where the state government is not holding shares. The share in capital held by the state
government is limited to 25 percent, and no society is to be directed by the state government.
With regard to the operational autonomy of a cooperative, the revised CSA clarifies that the society shall have power to
freely determine its financial and internal administrative matters, including: (i) their respective area of operation; (ii) interest
rates on deposits and loans, subject to directives issued by the RBI; (iii) borrowing, investment, depositing of surplus, loaning
and business policies; (iv) personnel policies, including issues relating to recruitment, promotion, staffing, training, postings
and compensation of staff; (v) internal checks and controls systems, appointment of auditors, their compensation and other
internal administrative issues; (vi) borrowing from any financial institutions regulated by the RBI, keeping in mind the
interest of the society and its members; and (vi) freedom to affiliate or disaffiliate with any federal society.
The revised CSA also enhances the role of the RBI and NABARD in the regulation and oversight of the sector. For example,
it: (i) mandates that CEOs and Directors of SCBs and DCCBs adhere to regulations on fit and proper issued by the RBI; (ii)
determines that boards and management cannot be superseded without prior approval of the RBI unless in the case of a lack
of quorum, fraud and/or three consecutive years of loss; (iii) mandates DCCBs and SCBs to have their accounts audited by an
auditor approved by RBI; and (iv) assigns the regulatory and supervisory power to RBI and NABARD.
Since then, the CSA was further amended to clarify the timing of the annual meetings and the minimum participation rules,
mandate the representation of women, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes on the board of societies as stipulated by the 97th
Constitutional Amendment, and mandate audits carried out by a list of chartered accountants or the registrar within a
determined period of time.

52.     Under the revised CSAs, the regulatory and supervisory authority over the ST CCS was
moved from the state to the national level, which greatly enhanced the regulatory framework.
Prior to the revision of the CSAs, considerable powers were vested in the role of the state registrar, who
not only registered and liquidated the entities, but also set the legal and regulatory framework and
carried out audits. Under the revised CSAs, RBI is now fully in charge of determining the legal and
regulatory framework for the system. NABARD is the delegated supervisor33 and identifies corrective
actions. The corrective actions are then to be carried out by the registrar on the state level. This has
introduced a much-improved system of checks and balances between the state and national level, and
reduced the potential for interference. Further, a number of prudential norms and guidelines were issued
' With segregated roles and internal governance arrangements to manage its various roles as lender and delegated supervisor.
15


﻿to gradually transition the sector towards full prudential supervision. For the PACS, a first set of
- - - -34
guidelines concerning asset classification, provisioning and income recognition were issued in 2009..
53.    Also, staged capital adequacy norms for DCCBs and SCBs were introduced, which greatly
enhance the sustainability of the sector by clearly defining the regulations/standards required for
survival. This required the two tiers to eventually reach a CRAR of 9 percent by 2017. Institutions
unable to meet these standards would not be licensed. By defining these rules, the RBI/NABARD have
mitigated moral hazard risks, lowered the chance of inadequately capitalized cooperatives undertaking
banking activities and set the phased, 'rules of the game'. NABARD carries out statutory on-site
inspections on a regular basis (last financial year covered 31 SCBs and 214 DCCBs). Sanctions imposed
on individual entities for non-compliance are posted on its website.35 Finally, fit and proper regulations
for management and boards were issued for SCBs and DCCBs in 2007, though given the challenges in
finding the thousands of staff needed to meet the needs of the very vast cooperative network, these were
eased somewhat to factor in the actual availability of the large number of qualified candidates required
36
in rural areas.
54.    As a result of the changes in the legal and regulatory framework, important improvements
were made in the governance and quality of management of the ST CCS. In line with the
requirements of the revised CSAs, regular Board elections were carried out in the vast majority of
entities (close to 100 percent, see Table 4, Annex 2 for details). This was one of the core outcome
indicators for the project, and was fully met as regularly reported on during supervision. The presence of
the government on the Board was reduced in line with the stipulations of the CSAs, and the government
share of capital of total capital was brought below 25 percent in most entities.37 While this has helped
reduce the direct influence of the state in the management of the sector and has set in motion an
important shift in culture, as with all efforts at improving governance, more time is however needed to
fully reap the fruits of this change. Progress was also made in enhancing the quality of management in
SCBs and DCCBs, both through capacity building and fresh external recruitment. Improvement in the
quality of top management has been more gradual, given the challenge of attracting large numbers of
professional managers especially in remote locations. Efforts on this front are ongoing. All the visited
PACS confirmed that they held Board elections, and that Boards were active.38 They reported that on
34 See Circular 112 issued by the Registrars of 25 States on July 23, 2009, in which guidelines from NABARD for the
classification and provisioning of overdue loans, the treatment of investments, as well as rules for the treatment and
accounting of income are provided.
In 2011, NABARD issued fines to three DCCBs for non-compliance with know-your customer regulations, Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) provisions and investment classifications.
36 Since the first circular on the RBI's Fit and Proper criteria in February 2007, 6 revisions had been made on the criteria.
This was to reflect the availability of the professionals who have willingness to work in cooperatives sector, while ensuring
the acceptable level of capacity and quality of the board members. The key changes included: (a) decreasing a minimum
number of professional directors to three; (b) allowing the Board to co-opt the Board to attain the number of professional
directors; and (c) specifying the period of professional experience (8 years) and area of academic qualifications. This is a
reflection of the challenges of finding adequate numbers of professionals required for the vast network of cooperatives.
3 The ICR mission learned during the visits to the states that in most of the remaining cases the necessary steps were
introduced to convert the excess government capital into a grant.
3 The ICR team visited and interviewed six PACS in three PS. With the exception of the PACS in Odisha, where the boards
were superseded to ensure proportional representation of women and weaker sections (and subsequently the requirements of
the 97th Constitutional Amendment).

﻿average they held monthly to review current financial situation, overdue loans, and in some cases also
assess Board support in recovery of overdue loans.
55.    Apart from   legal amendments, enabling measures to facilitate ST CCS exercise their
freedom to link with any financial institution of their choice to save or borrow were put in place.
NABARD introduced direct borrowing facilities for DCCBs, without having to approach through the
SCBs. At PACS level savings mobilization was facilitated through provision of infrastructure and
systems support.
56.    Important achievements were made in the area of auditing and accounting. Having strong
accounting and auditing mechanisms in place is of particular importance for cooperatives, as it increases
the transparency and availability of information for members and thus facilitates "democratic control" as
stipulated by the ICA principles for cooperatives. In addition, the external audits introduce an element of
external oversight and revision into a sector where high frequently in depth supervision is not feasible
due to the sheer number of entities existing. In particular:
*  With project support, the CAS was rolled out in all PS and is being adhered to in most entities.
The system was well received by the sector, and led to a considerably enhanced quality and
uniformity of information at the individual PACS level. All PACS visited for the preparation of
the completion report confirmed that the CSA helped them get a much more reliable picture of
their incomes and expenses, capital adequacy, profitability, liquidity as well as asset quality.39
*  In the area of audits, the CSAs mandate that all cooperatives be audited annually, and a common
audit manual was developed. This goes far beyond regulations in many other countries with a
vibrant cooperative sector, where small cooperatives are exempt from external audits.40 The audit
manual has also reduced the arbitrariness of the audits and led to improvements in quality. The
external audits of SCBs and DCCBs are conducted annually in all five PS, but audits for PACS
are in many instances still backlogged due to capacity constraints of the office of the registrar,
lack of available Chartered Accountants, as well as delays from within the sector in preparing
their financial statements.41 Innovative solutions have however emerged. In Gujarat, the CSA
foresees the use of Chartered Accountants - they were trained to do the assessments, a common
format rolled out, and a uniform price for the audits determined. Around 90 percent of the
external audits are now done from auditors on a pre-approved list. Also, NABARD recently
introduced an incentive scheme for audit completion, which elicited a very positive response in
improving timeliness of audits.
57.    Finally, considerable progress was made under the revival package in harmonizing
capacity building measures, and in developing a strong institutional infrastructure for ongoing
training. Prior to the revival package, training institutions provided training to the sector, but there was
limited coordination and quality control. Under the revival package, standardized modules were
39 A number of PACS secretaries and board members reported that the improved quality and timeliness of the information
facilitated the recovery of loans. Nevertheless, the usage of the new system for the preparation of financial statements and the
assessment of core performance and soundness indicators is uneven and will need more capacity building and handholding.
40 In Mexico, for example, annual audits are not mandatory for the financial cooperatives that are below the threshold for
prudential supervision.
41 The last supervision report for the project shows that, in September 2012, only 15% of PACS in Odisha had their financial
statements for 2011 audited, and for the year 2010, 54 percent of the audits were still pending.

﻿developed and rolled out throughout the country, involving the existing training institutions of the
sector. This not only enhanced the quality of training, but also paved the way for the creation of the C-
PEC within NABARD's own training center BIRD.42 C-PEC currently collaborates with 27 training
institutions in 26 Indian states, and provides certification services for training institutions, assessment of
training needs and development of new modules, as well as quality control. This directly benefits an
estimated 25,000 participants annually. Many of the visited SCBs and DCCBs also confirmed using
modules developed under the revival package and from C-PEC for their training measures.43 There
seems to be general agreement in the sector and involved donor community that this coordinated and
institutionalized approach - that involved a 'cascading strategy to enhance outreach'44 - has been a great
success in reaching large numbers and the ongoing training provided through it will further contribute to
enhanced governance and managerial capacity in the sector. Such initiatives continue to receive funding
from various sources and are therefore, expected to continue to play an important role in the future.
Box 2: Impact of Capacity Building Efforts in Gujarat
It was observed that out of 99 responses, obtained in respect of "awareness about autonomous character of the PACS",
two-third reported that they have internalized this element. With regard to "recapitalization about need for business
development" nearly 80 percent of the sample PACS reported in affirmative.
In respect of the element "awareness about need for reduction of government interference", 53 out of 70 responses (75
percent) received indicate that they have realized the need for reduction in government interference in the affairs of
society. In respect of the element "awareness that a cooperative society has to be member driven", 94 sample PACS out of
99 (94 percent) reported that this element of the revival process has been internalized.
With regard to "sense of accountability", nearly 80 percent of sample PACS reported positively. Further during the
discussion, it emerged that the new CAS introduced under the revival package has helped in improvement in management.
With this it is concluded that the HR development initiatives taken up under the revival package have made fairly good
impact. It is however suggested that training in these aspects should be a continuous process.

(ii) Impact of the reforms on the viability of the sector (Moderately Unsatisfactory)- Pt and 4th KPI
58.    The results achieved towards viability of the sector have remained behind targeted levels.
While many good achievements were made in individual entities and in some states, in others
performance remained subdued. A majority of the DCCBs and SCB now report net profits; at the PACS
level, NAFSCOB data is unclear.45 What is clear is that on average even for many profitable ST CCS,
the level of profitability remains thin and this suggests a need for a broader look at lending margins,
42 C-PEC was created with support of the GIZ (former GTZ, see Section 1.1), who provided start-up assistance and on an on-
going basis technical assistance to the center. C-PEC certifies the training institutions, and also assumes the task of assessing
training needs, developing training modules, and doing quality control of trainings provided.
43 Gujarat SCB is providing Rs5 crore funding for its own training institution each year.
4 This entailed centralized content development and training of master trainers who in turn, trained others in delivering the
trainings (cascading strategy to develop a base of local trainers), use of decentralized training institutes and quality control.
45 Consolidated data from NAFSCOB has variable quality at best, but remains the main source of information for now for the
PACS level. Analysis of eligible versus ineligible PACS (many of which are dormant) was not possible on account of data
limitations and therefore, some of the analysis can be 'weighed down' on account of the weak performance of the ineligible
PACS.
18


﻿costs, etc.46 This section analyzes the main underlying reasons for the observed achievements. At the
PACS level, the discussion excludes the state of UP, for which no updated information is available with
NAFSCOB. For the DCCBs and SCBs, data for all five PS' were assessed.
59.    The revival package boosted the capital base of PACS. The PACS in the PS increased their
share capital by 30 percent since 2007 and also increased their reserves by 26 percent. The latter is likely
the direct reflection of the recapitalization that took place and helped boost the capital base of the sector.
In Haryana and Odisha, the reported capital to working capital ratio47 of the PACS has now increased
from 7 and 9 percent in 2007 to 10 and 12 percent respectively in 2012. The leverage ratio dropped in
Gujarat and West Bengal from 18 and 31 percent to a still strong 12 and 25 percent.
60.    The recapitalization of PACS also contributed to increased levels of CRAR at the DCCB
and SCB level (intermediate indicator 8, see Annex 4, Chart 1). While only 13 DCCBs were directly
recapitalized with project funds, most DCCBs gained from making recoveries on dues from adjustments
made from the recapitalization amounts received by PACS. The DCCBs increased their share capital by
46 percent since 200748 (in monetary terms by around USD 96 million), and their reserves grew by
another USD 220 million (increase of 31 percent). The increase in reserve was to some extent due to
subsidies provided by state governments in recognition of losses incurred from the crop loan portfolio,
but also the indirect effect of the increased recovery of earlier non-performing loans from PACS.49
Overall, the un-weighted capital adequacy ratio of DCCBs for the four PS, for which a consistent
database is available, increased from an average of 5.77 percent in 2005 to 9.22 percent in 2012. Four
out of the five SCBs were in 2012 meeting the required CRAR of 7 percent for 2014. Thus, overall
performance on capital adequacy met project intermediate indicator target levels (that two thirds of the
SCB and DCCBs would meet the regulatory minimum levels), though the performance varied across
46 With the imperative to improve financial performance being cast in stone on account of prudential regulations, and the
freedom to now operate independently, together with initiatives to control costs - most critically asset quality - it is expected
that business prerogatives will lead to a better balancing of financial and developmental objectives.
47 The CRAR is not calculated on the PACS level, so the substitute of capital to working capital (assets) ratio is being used.
48 Most of the increase stems from additional contributions from members. However, in Odisha for example, the capital
increase in 2012 also reflects grants that individual entities received from the government to meet the capital adequacy
requirements of RBI and become / remain licensed.
49 This indirect increase in capital and also in ROA was already factored in for the results framework. The recapitalization of
the PACS was channeled through the DCCBs. The recapitalization mechanism foresaw that the recapitalization would be
used to pay back the outstanding loans from PACS to DCCBs (as on March 31, 2004), so the DCCBs were allowed to deduct
the overdue loan portfolio from the amount of recapitalization funds that the PACS were to receive.
19


﻿states. 5o 51 Of course, with growth in balance sheet size, as would be expected, such DCCBs would need
to continue to operate profitably and mobilize additional capital. 52
61.    A number of reforms were initiated to help improve and facilitate the recovery of overdue
loans. In Gujarat, for example, ST CCS were allowed to incorporate a clause in their lending documents
to directly enforce overdue loans without proceeding to the legal system. This eliminated a lengthy
judicial process that according to interviewed entities could take up to 10 years for enforcing a claim.
Many of the visited PACS reported that they improved efforts to recover loans, and started involving
their boards in this process (see Box 3). Staff of entities from all three tiers also benefited from training
on risk management and loan appraisal/recovery. The Gol and state governments are also increasingly
providing interest rate subsidies contingent on farmers repaying their loans on time. The latter has,
according to sector representatives, greatly facilitates the repayment of loans. Finally, some of the SCBs
and DCCBs are now supporting their PACS in loan recovery efforts.
Box 3: Recovery efforts undertaken by the 6 PACS visited during the ICR mission
-   Two PACS included information on the largest defaulters in material presented at annual meetings.
-   One PACS displayed a board with names of the largest defaulters.
-   One PACS mentioned that the Board is very helpful for recovering loans. The Board regularly discussed the
outstanding loan portfolio, and was actively involved in recovery efforts.
-   Finally, some PACS highlighted the support received from "their" DCCB in recovering loans. The DCCB was not
only helpful in stressing the importance of recovering loans in general, but at times went along with the PACS staff
to talk to major defaulters in the system and convince them to repay.
Source: Interviews conducted during the mission
62.    These measures, together with the above described governance reforms, helped improve
the recovery rates53 over time, but not up to targeted levels (1st KPI, see Table 2, Annex 4). Four of
the five SCBs improved their recovery rates to 96-100 percent (up from 71-99 percent in 2005), while it
deteriorated in one. At the DCCB level, recovery rates improved annually by 0.78 percent since the
2005 baseline and against an ambitious annual target of 5-10 percent), but the performance was better if
50 Though project target levels on capital adequacy were met, the original government's revival package's targets were not
met on this indicator. The package optimistically expected that all ST CCS would achieve the minimum required CRAR of 7
percent within 3 years of implementation (in part due to improved recovery of loans from PACS), and eventually reach 9
percent through own retained earnings. This did not materialize partly as the recapitalization was not fully carried out, ROAs
continue to be low and some entities are still not showing improvements in their overall performance and will likely have to
be liquidated over time - an aspect that is not unusual for the banking system and one that the Bank project had forecast and
projected in its target levels (only 2/3 rd were expected to be viable). Such entities are expected to be phased out of the
financial system in line with the gradual strengthening of the prudential norms that RBI has introduced (requiring a minimum
CRAR of 4 percent by 2013, and 9 percent by 2017, though there is talk of timelines being hastened), an aspect that was built
into project expectations and target indicators.
5 By end March 2012, 35 DCCBs in the PS - mostly in UP - did not have the required capital level (see Table 1 in Annex 4).
52 The Expert Committee estimated that 209 DCCBs of the 370 DCCBs in the country will have to mobilize, as an aggregate,
Rs4,024 crore by 2014/15 and Rs6,498 crore by 2016/17 to achieve CRAR of 7 percent and 9 percent respectively.
5 Given that the recovery rate is relatively unique in the extent of its usage in the ST CCS, and is not a conventional asset
quality indicator in the banking system, it needs to be noted that this is partly a cash flow indicator and only partly an asset
quality indicator. A level of say 80% recovery rate, does not imply 20% NPLs or 20% write offs, which will typically be
lower. Drawing firm conclusions on how recovery rates translate into losses and NPLs is not available or possible. Going
forward, the CAS and MIS recognize this limitation with the indicator and have introduced more traditional asset quality
indicators that are now being used (extensively at the upper tiers, and more gradually at the PACS level).
20


﻿measured since loan effectiveness in 2007 (4.2 annually). Yet, the reported average recovery rate of 78
percent continues to be on the low side. The PACS level of the cooperative system shows even lower
levels of loan recovery. PACS in Gujarat now report recovery rates of over 70 percent (plus 2 percent
annually), and Haryana and Odisha had a drop in their recovery rates to now below 70 percent (minus
1.5 and 1.8 percent respectively).
63.   Some of the underlying problems in the area of loan recovery are:
*  Shortcomings in the lending products and loan evaluation schemes: Loans from PACS tend
to offer lower interest rates (10 percent compared to 30 percent for informal lenders), but are
restricted in the amounts they offer. This leads to some borrowers accessing funds from
moneylenders or other informal sources, which then get repaid first due to higher interest rates.
In addition, most PACS provide loans based on the government's crop loan model, and do not
use cash flow based assessments of the credit repayment capacity of the borrower. This is partly
mitigated by the strong incentive to repay to be eligible for a next round of finance, but delayed
recoveries (as distinct from defaults) are a consequence. The issue of product design is being
addressed through the business plans that were supported under the project, and through other
efforts at evolving the product mix for the ST CCS institutions.
*  Impact of the debt waiver on repayment culture: As discussed above, the Gol launched in
2008 a debt waiver scheme to help distressed farmers, particularly small and marginal farmers
who had often unwillingly become delinquent on account of crop production losses (mostly on
account of the vagaries of nature and inadequate insurance to cover such risks) and had lost
access to fresh credit from the formal financial sector. The scheme's reimbursement for
cooperative banks was around 2.5 times the amount the ST CCS received through the revival
package. Loans that were overdue between December 31, 2007 and February 29, 2009 were
reimbursed for small farmers (less than 2 hectares) and for large farmers a supplement of 25%
was provided in case of repayment. As the majority of the borrowers in PACS were small, many
saw their loans fully paid off by the scheme, while those farmers that had faithfully repaid on
time felt punished. This negatively impacted the repayment culture in the following years, as
people preferred to keep the balance open in case of another waiver, although recoveries
gradually improved.
*  Vagaries of weather and lack of irrigation: The PACS business model in lending is highly
concentrated in agriculture, and is vulnerable to the monsoon rains. While the government offers
insurance products, the uptake of the products needs to be increased from the current coverage of
around 20 percent of the farmers being insured. This effort is being pursued in parallel and the
current five year plan aims to double outreach of crop insurance.
*  Some of the DCCBs also reported that they face restrictions in recovering loans from
PACS, as the registrar approves and sends out the letter to enforce the loans from the respective
PACS. This is not only cumbersome, but also reduces the timeliness of loan enforcement.
64.   While a majority of the DCCBs and SCBs are profitable, the target ROA was not fully met
(4th KPI). As evident from the PDO indicator discussion (see Table 3 in Annex 4), though more than
2/3rd of the DCCBs reported a profit, none of the states met the targeted level of ROA of more than 0.5
percent. While over 76 percent of DCCBs in the PS were profitable in the financial year ended March
2012, the un-weighted average ROAs remain low, and targeted levels of viability were not met. As with
other indicators, state level variations exist; the state of UP lags behind others, although 28 of the 50
DCCBs improved their profitability since 2008, and 21 of them moved from loss making to reporting a
21


﻿profit (see Table 4 in Annex 4). Similar results were achieved in selected DCCBs in other states. For the
SCBs, while four of the five SCBs are profitable (80 percent above the targeted expectation of 66
percent), no SCB achieved the target ROA of 0.8 percent.
65.    The evolution of the profitability of the PACS appears to have been mixed.54 Around 59
percent of the entities in the five PS now report a profit, compared to 49 percent in 2005 (see Table 5 in
Annex 4). The data on the PACS is not sufficient to assess where the improvement in income stems
from, as separate data on profitability of the recapitalized PACS is not available. However, the visited
PACS suggest that most of the increased profitability stems from a diversification of business. As will
be discussed below, many PACS have increased their income sources through offering additional non-
financial services like storage facilities, paddy procurement, etc. which have helped compensate for
modest returns made through the lending business. Deposit taking PACS usually are able to earn a
spread of 4 percent on their deposits.5 This is risk free and compares well to the spread on loans funded
through refinancing from NABARD.
66.    A clearer and for the project more directly linked trend in the achieved improvements is
visible in the audit classifications provided by NABARD. The audits assess a range of financial and
operational performance indicators, which are then reflected in the overall rating assigned for each
entity. This indicator also covers the operational improvements through enhanced governance, and as
such is the most suited indicator to reflect the improvements made in the sector via the introduced
governance reforms. Audit data, which is available for four states for both 2005 and 2012, shows a
significant improvement. Around 47 percent of the DCCBs are now rated as A (compared to 25.5
percent in 2005), and another 22 percent are rated as B (compared to 26.5 percent in 2005).
(iii) Impact on members' financial access and other support services (Satisfactory)-2nd and 3rd KPI
67.    The Gol has made a strong push towards increasing access to credit for the agricultural
sector over the period under review. To foster the uptake of formal credit, the Gol has standardized
lending and refinancing packages, it provides direct interest subsidies, and also rolls out agricultural
insurance schemes. Direct support for technology upgrades and investment in storage and processing
facilities are provided both on the national and state level. Supported by the above measures, agricultural
output accelerated to an annual growth of 3.7 percent during the last government plan period, compared
to 2.4 and 2.5 percent in earlier periods. The increased output helped spur consumption in rural areas
56
and supported the recorded decline in poverty rates by rural poverty. A research paper by the RBI in
2009 confirms that there is a statistically significant direct and positive link between the provision of
credit to farmers and the agricultural output.57 In the absence of savings many farmers rely on credit to
finance the needed inputs and smooth consumption during the growth cycle. The provision of formal
credit at affordable rates helps the farmers reduce their dependence on moneylenders that charge higher
interest rates, and makes farming "affordable".
54 Data are drawn from NAFSCOB; data limitations are noted, but NAFSCOB remains the only source for consolidated
PACS data for now.
" The client for example receives 4 percent interest on the deposits from PACS, while the PACS get 8 percent on the deposit
from the DCCB.
56 The new government Five-Year plan for 2012 - 2017 highlights that rural consumption quadrupled under the last
government plan, and that rural poverty declined by an estimated 2 percent between 2004/5 and 2011.

﻿68.    Data from the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation show that the ST CCS continue
to play an important role in the provision of credit to the agricultural sector, particularly for the
smaller farmers. Support from the package and other schemes has contributed to, according to latest
data available 58, agricultural credit doubling between 2008 and 2012, and the number of loans increasing
by 50 percent over the same period of time (see Chart 3 in Annex 4). The ST CCS, which prior to the
revival package had lost market shares to commercial and rural banks due to their erstwhile dire
financial situation were able to again increase their share in total lending from a low of 15 percent in
2008 to 17 percent in 2012. What is particularly significant that in terms of number of loans, the ST
CCS accounts for over half of all loans. This implies that they have particularly benefited the small and
marginal farmer, as 66 percent of the portfolio of ST CCS goes to this client segment. The data also
confirm the still prevalent differences in market niches of the individual players. With their focus on
small borrowers, the average loan size in the ST CCS sector was Rs28,467 (approx. USD450) in 2012.
Commercial banks continue to cater predominantly to larger borrowers, and their average loan size was
Rs144,525 (~USD2,300) in 2012.
69.    Supported by the reform      package and the project, the PSs reported impressive
performance on outreach. About 11.2 million borrowers, of which 7.2 million were small and
marginal farmers, were reached in FY2012. Loan disbursements in the PSs just in FY2012 stood at
USD6.7 billion (2nd and 3rd KPIs). The target performance indicator of a 70 percent increase in ground
level financing provided by CCS was surpassed. Loans issued in the PS increased by 96 percent (to
USD6.7 billion in FY2012 in the PS') and loan outstanding grew by 82 percent, compared to 2005
baseline (see Table 6 in Annex 4).59 Recapitalization helped the PACS pay their overdues to the DCCBs
and receive new loans for on-lending to members. Growth in loans was particularly prominent in Odisha
and West Bengal. On the DCCB level, the share in lending for short-term agricultural lending increased
again since 2008, and now accounts for 61 percent compared to 56 percent in DCCBs. It should be noted
that the DCCBs did not receive the promised recapitalization in the PS, except in Odisha.60 Without the
promised capital for leveraging, the DCCBs had posted high growth rates in loans, reflecting the
positive impact of other measures which rendered this possible. The target of 50 percent increase in
number of marginal and small farmers was also achieved in Haryana, Odisha and UP, with an overall
impressive average growth of 66 percent in the PS (132 percent of the targeted level).
70.    While the reforms have not yet lead to substantive development of new financial products,
they have contributed to enhanced access to finance by rural households. The Bank's impact
evaluation showed that farmers viewed access to credit as a top constraint to improving productivity.
The project clearly contributed to improvements on this financial service (see above), in the absence of
linkages to an electronic payment system, payment services and where deposit products are rudimentary,
and where money is often transferred by the PACS to the nearest DCCB office for processing. However,
a push into new products will likely take place in the future. All DCCBs and SCBs are currently
upgrading to a CBS, which will allow the introduction of electronic payments, credit and debit cards, as

Cooperation under http://agricoop.nic.in/programmescheme.htm
59 After the waiver, it took more than a year for the ST CCS to recover lost ground and expand business. In real terms, the
DCCBs started growing their loan business only in 2010. Since then in the last two years, growth rates have been robust.
60 Odisha DCCBs which had received recapitalization reported the highest growth rate in agricultural loans for the period
2008 -2012 and also the highest growth rate of 27.4% in total loans during the two year period 2011 and 2012.

﻿well as the operation of POS devices. This will likely lead to the development of e-banking products,
including the usage of the Kisan Credit Card schemes for crop lending61, and considerably enhance the
services and convenience offered to the members of the sector. Considerations are currently also being
discussed in the ST CCS to convert PACS into business agents for the DCCBs. Furthermore, the
increased presence and outreach of ST CCS has contributed to improving the number of rural
households with access to financial services. The census in 2001 showed that 30.1 percent of rural
households had access to finance, while 54 percent of rural household reported having access in 2011.
71.    Finally, many PACS increased the number of non-financial services they provide to
members. Facilitated through the project as well as ongoing government initiatives, many PACS have
developed additional products. In Odisha, 1,858 PACS are now procuring paddy for the government.
The service currently reaches over 630,000 farmers and helps them guarantee a minimum price for their
produce. In Gujarat, around 4,000 PACS have storage facilities, and many are         in the process of
upgrading their facility to enhance the quality of storage. This will not only help the farmer move away
from distress sales, but eventually may also allow the PACS to do warehouse lending with other
financial institutions. Others are offering services such as milk collection centers. In Gujarat, 326 PACS
are now moving into offering a multiservice center for their members. In the tradition of Raiffeisen,
almost all PACS offer fertilizer and seeds to their members.
Box 4: Access to Finance for small and marginal farmers and business diversification at PACS
Impact studies conducted by the Bank suggest that loans from PACS are the preferred source, and indeed the dominant
source of formal credit for marginal and small farmers. Informal loans charge nearly three times as much as loans from
PACS and they also have a shorter maturity. 60 percent of respondents (farmers) responded that they would like to borrow
more from PACS at prevailing rates if they could. PACS appeared more likely to issue loans in amounts lower than requested
- thus increasing liquidity for the ST CCS is important for responding to the demand of the farmers.
ICR mission found, from the 6 PACS visited and interviewed, that PACS are diversifying and expanding non-financial
services. One PACS in Haryana started a bazaar (small retail shop) available for both members and non-members. One PACS
in Gujarat has purchased a tractor and is leasing it to farmers. It is also renting their premises to shopkeepers, dairy
cooperatives, and even to a RRB branch. One PACS in Odisha is helping marketing of agricultural products for the members.

3.3 Efficiency
72.    Economic and financial analysis, including Financial Internal Rate of Return (FRR) and Net
Present Value (NPV), is presented in Annex 5. Overall, one can conclude that despite the lower than
expected level of recapitalization and the exogenous waiver impact, the ST CCS improved capital
adequacy and achieved outreach, and also supported viability in many institutions. Some impacts,
particularly governance reform, involve an incremental process of change/strengthening over a
medium/long term. The FRR for the state of Odisha, in which the full recapitalization was provided,
shows an FRR of 11 percent; overall project presents a FRR of 10 percent, both with positive NPV.62
61 Kisan credit card scheme aims at providing credit support to the farmers for their production needs. Kisan credit cards are
issued to farmers on the basis of their landholdings and allow access to banks for obtaining credit.
62 As the PS were not yet identified at appraisal, the PAD randomly chose 10 DCCBs from about 370 DCCBs country wide,
and conducted FRR/NPV analysis. The ICR used the data from all the DCCBs in the Bank funded five PS. See Annex 6.

﻿73.   In the area of training, the development of a harmonized and institutionalized approach to
capacity building has greatly enhanced the efficiency and quality of the provided training. It has
contributed to a sustained effort in training now financed directly through NABARD and the ST CCS.
The well-coordinated way in which this training was provided also reduced the overall cost of the
program, leading to considerable gains in efficiency.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
74.   The overall outcome rating is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, highly satisfactory
achievements were made in the core area of reforms, namely governance. The project contributed to a
significant increase in outreach (ground-level financing and number of borrowers targets were
exceeded), ultimately benefiting over 11.2 million borrowers (including 7.2 million small and marginal
farmer borrowers) and 25 million ST CCS clients in the PS and contributing to a significant growth in
credit with USD6.7 billion in loans issued in the PS in FY2012 - it is noteworthy, that the Bank's
impact evaluation identified insufficient availability of funds from the ST CCS as being a key limitation
identified by its members (pre-project). While profitability of the sector remains a challenge, a majority
of institutions at SCB and DCCB level are profitable (though at low levels) and the underlying factors
for the lower than expected profitability stem from factors that were outside of the scope and influence
of this project. Overall, the project has laid the foundation for ongoing governance change in the sector
(included the needed cultural change), which on the longer term can be expected to lead to a
substantially enhanced performance of the sector.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
75.   The 97h constitutional amendment has now mandated to have at least two women on each
PACS board. Many states adopted the amendment and ensured that the changes were applied in ST
CCS. Haryana PACS now have at least one woman on the board (with efforts to increase this to two).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
76.   As described above, the share capital of the sector increased by USD 160 million63, which
together with the provided recapitalization contributed to the sector's overall strengthening and
increased resilience. The supervision of the sector improved as a direct consequence of the revised legal
frameworks. NABARD now has greater supervisory control and with RBI approval issues the regulatory
framework. The project also directly contributed to an efficient institutional mechanism for ongoing
capacity building (including quality control), including for auditing and accounting. These are critical
areas for supporting the strengthening of the sector from within on a continuous and cost efficient basis.
63 Change in share capital in DCCBs and PACS between 2007 and 2012, as reported by NAFSCOB for 4 of the 5 PS.
25


﻿(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
77.    The project had a positive impact on the productive side of agriculture. Almost all PACS in the
PS developed business plans, which included plans for non-financial services. This includes for example
upgraded storage space, support for procuring products with the government to secure the minimum
price, and other facilities along the value chain. Given the critical importance of value chains and
intermediation services in agriculture, the availability of these services (which lower reliance on middle
men who typically gamer most of the margins) on the local level has likely had a positive impact on the
livelihood of the rural population, but no assessment has so far been carried out to measure this impact.

Not applicable.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
78.    The risk to the development outcome is rated Moderate. The legal, regulatory, and
governance reform that were achieved under the project are likely to be sustained with the strong
commitment and efforts by the state governments, RBI, NABARD and the sector itself. The well-
established cascading training structure and unified training modules continue to contribute to the
sustained capacity enhancement of the sector. The ongoing automation of the sector at every tier can
lead to the efficient service delivery and further improvements in quality of data. The recapitalization
has helped strengthen the capital base of a sufficiently large portion of the ST CCS institutions, which
provides a financial cushion to sustain their operations. Potential risks remain and these are largely on
account of external factors, but there are several mitigating factors that alleviate the risk. For instance, in
the (unlikely64 ) event of another future large waiver program, asset quality and profitability may get
undermined (as it did in 2008, although the system recovered in the following years and in the unlikely
event this happens again, can be expected to recoup again). In the medium to long term, insufficienct
growth of crop insurance could pose risks. On this count, a mitigating factor is the steady growth of the
crop insurance program in recent years and the plan is to double coverage during the current Five Year
Plan period. The last (internal) risk factor relates to asset quality at the PACS level - while there have
been modest improvements on this front, the small gains need to be sustained and built upon, otherwise
ultimately there may be spillovers to the upper tiers. For now, the sensitization on the importance of
asset quality and the better management and governance, provide a basis to counter this risk to some
extent. A last mitigating factor is the improved incentive alignment supported through RBI's prudential
regulation of the ST CCS. With clear - and rising - standards expected of the ST CCS, issues around
complacency and moral hazard are mitigated. The message - re-emphasized through several instances of
de-licensing of some ST CCS institutions that did not meet the regulatory norms - to maintain standards
on financial performance has been unambiguously conveyed and is now widely understood in the ST
CCS. This will require continued efforts at improving financial performance, particularly maintaining
capital adequacy and asset quality, and improving profitability levels.
64 Fiscal considerations pose a constraint. Historically, prior to the 2008 waiver, the last comparable waiver was nearly 20
years ago.

﻿5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79.   Quality at entry was Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank team performed well in project
preparation and made sure that key project readiness measures were met. The project was modeled on a
government program that had just been put in place. The government program, as discussed above, was
very holistic in its approach to governance and the reform package, and had been discussed with
stakeholders. The Bank team had thorough discussions with the Gol and NABARD during project
preparation, and coordinated well with three funders which supported the revival package. The Bank
team had a good understanding of the sector issues through the ESW, and the PAD articulates the
country and sector background. The team conducted a holistic assessment of the revival package, and
ensured that the every aspect of the project design can contribute to the efficient delivery of the country-
wide package. The PAD has a sound technical, financial and economic analysis as well as detailed
implementation arrangements. The Bank team designed an M&E framework which well fitted with the
project outcomes, but the framework had weaknesses due to lack of data. The PDO was over ambitious
in the level of target setting on viability, and the PAD could have more prominently discussed risks and
challenges affecting the viability of the sector. However, overall, good preparation was evidenced by
disbursements; 13 percent within the first year, and more than 50 percent by the second year.
(b)  Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
80.   The Bank performance at supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the Bank
team has been very proactive in many small details, and made positive contributions to supporting the
project implementation. The team, many of whom were based in the country office, ensured a close
dialogue with the Gol and NABARD, and allowed timely actions whenever necessary. The procurement
and FM staff was also country-based, which helped an active involvement in monitoring and guidance
on fiduciary issues. A total of eight supervision missions took place semi-annually, and Aide-Memoires
captured in detail the project implementation progress and issues. Apart from the supervision missions,
the Bank team was also proactive in setting up additional meetings with the counterparts. The team
proactively made actions and had intensive dialogue with the Gol, NABARD and funders to address the
issues, when: (i) the government announced a debt waiver scheme, and (ii) the cancellation issue came
up in the last year of the project. The timing and justification of the restructuring are deemed reasonable,
given the good progress before the restructuring, and careful assessments made on the incremental costs/
benefits. The Bank team could have considered additional activities on credit risk management to
improve the viability of ST CCS, for example through a TA, to look into what was hindering
performance improvements, and make suggestions to supplement the dialogue/build knowledge.
27


﻿(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
81.   With a rating of moderately satisfactory for both quality at entry and supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a)   Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
82.   Borrower performance has been mixed, but overall positive. On the one hand, substantial and
ground making progress was made in putting in place the legal and regulatory framework for improved
governance at the state level. The CSAs in 23 states were adapted (including in the five PS) to introduce
enhanced governance regimes in the sector and eliminate/reduce the potential influence of the
government in their management. A constitutional amendment was passed on the national level, which
further strengthened the undertaken governance reform. RBI improved the prudential framework for
financial cooperatives and their supervision. There was overall good ownership for the reforms by the
involved parties on both national and state level, and the effort and dedication put into implementing the
reforms by key stakeholders on the national and state level has been impressive.
83.   As discussed above, profits of the ST CCS remain limited and the debt waiver negatively
affected the viability of the financial cooperative system during the project period. However, it is also
noted that the debt waiver helped small and marginal farmers obtain access to fresh loans. NIMC
stopped meeting after the 9th meeting (January 2011), so no fresh input was made. A partial cancellation
requested by the Gol after the one year extension affected the roll-out of computerization and FRS
disbursement to the states that completed the reform benchmark activities. However, while the IT
component was a missed opportunity, new initiatives outside of the reform program are supporting
automation at the ST CCS. Negative impacts due to a cancellation of FRS were lesser than initially
anticipated, given the sufficient capitalization level achieved at ST CCS.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
84.   The Performance of NABARD has been Moderately Satisfactory. Much of the achieved
reforms in implementing the enhanced legal and regular framework are due to the dedication of
NABARD staff, in particular on the regional level. The regional officers of NABARD have taken a vital
interest in helping the sector move along, liaise and coordinate with state representatives and
stakeholder, and make the program implementation work. At the central level, NABARD head office
played a key role to ensure the country-wide implementation and uniformed approach among the states.
However, there were also aspects were more could have been achieved - for instance on member
education and data measurement, review and analysis - and there were gaps that existed in the M&E and
28


﻿fiduciary framework (eg. delays in project audit reports) as discussed above. Therefore, overall the
performance of NABARD has been moderately satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
85.   Overall borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. While impressive results
were achieved in introducing improved governance in the sector, some of the measures taken by the
government directly impacted the viability of the sector.
6. Lessons Learned
86.   A longer project timeframe could have been considered given the complexity and effort
needed for reforming the cooperative sector in India. Evidence from other countries shows that
reform of the cooperative sector involves a complex shift in governance, management and culture, and
thus requires a much longer time for the sector to fully absorb such changes and start to grow
sustainably. While some of the key changes are visible in India, a longer project period could have been
considered. Also, impact of well-functioning reformed institutions should ideally be measured after
sufficient time, as internal processes, systems and products also need to change and full outcomes are
realized over a longer timeframe.
87.   Governance reforms should be supplemented from the start with a very strong focus on
enhancing credit risk management and recovery of non-performing loans. A key factor of profitable
and viable institutions relies on a sound credit risk management and efforts on recovering non-
performing loans. Therefore, governance reform should be complemented with a strong focus on
capacity building of the cooperatives to enhance the credit management skills, and provide an effective
monitoring and guidance system to ensure such skills are applied in daily credit operations.
Considerations should also be given to link the cooperative financial institutions with the credit bureaus.
88.   For ongoing monitoring and fine-tuning of the program, a stronger effort to collect,
monitor and evaluate PACS data at the central level is necessary. The availability of reliable PACs
level consolidated data are key to assessing the sector, designing project interventions, and capturing
project outcomes and impacts. Therefore, strong efforts are required at a central level to ensure the
availability of consolidated and comparable data especially at the PACS level. It is important that such
collected data are used effectively to guide decisions, adjust operations, and propagate good practices.
89.   To improve governance and capacity, efforts have to be brought to the field and the
cascading training approach provides a replicable model. Many members are unable to leave their
work for one day or longer, or afford the travel to a larger city. Therefore capacity building measures for
the lowest level have to be brought as close to the doorstep as possible. Train the trainer modules and the
decentralized 'cascading model' can be a model for other large scale training initiatives (across sectors).
90.   Early involvement of the Bank in program design is important. Even when the Bank
finances a part of the country-wide program, it is critical for the Bank team to be involved in the
29


﻿program design at early stage for better understanding of the program, contributing to a better program
design, and introducing a solid M&E mechanism and risk mitigation measures.
91.   Since members' (mostly farmers') demands are diverse, a project should consider different
types of financial/non-financial services. Financial services involve not only credit, but also different
products, such as savings and insurance. Also, rural cooperatives could play a role in meeting farmers'
demand through providing various agricultural related services, using their vast networks. Attention on
supporting appropriately designed products that take the diverse demand of farmers is critical.
92.   Close dialogue and strong coordination between the central and state governments are
necessary. When a country-wide program is implemented on a large scale financed by the central
government, it is critical to set up a solid mechanism in which the progress, achievements, issues and
concerns of each state are regularly tracked and communicated to the national level. Such mechanism
needs to be ensured through regular and continuous meetings, with clear and detailed role of monitoring
and guidance committees at each national, state and district level.
93.   Members' education needs adequate attention to communicate program benefits to the
ultimate beneficiary group. It is important that members understand the reform program and what the
reform means to them. The program needs to include a robust communication strategy for reaching out
to the members. In addition, financial literacy programs could also help enhance impact.
94.   For a front-loaded governance reform program, a clear reporting framework on reform
benchmark activities is critical. When a recapitalization component is based on achievement of certain
pre-agreed reforms and benchmarks, it is useful to track updates on progress toward achieving these
benchmarks in or along with the IUFRs, with a clear pre-agreed format.
95.   Country-based staff play a key role in close monitoring, guidance and support during the
project implementation. A country-based team, including procurement and financial management, can
ensure constant dialogue with the counterparts and enable to make quick actions. This is particularly
important when the project is complex with different stakeholders involved, which requires close
monitoring and follow-up, in addition to regular supervision missions.

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Technical Assistance for Capacity Building
1. Objective and activities
Component 1 focused on building the needed human capacity within the sector to: (i) help members and
the boards understand their roles in oversight; (ii) enhance staff's capacity to run the cooperative in an
efficient, financially and operationally sound way; and (iii) improve the capacity for oversight through
second tier institutions and external auditors. This complemented the legal and regulatory reforms under
component 3. Experience in other countries shows that the provision of capacity building is particularly
critical for enhancing governance of cooperatives in rural areas, as the required level of human capacity
is usually not available in these areas and thus has to be built up through existing staff.66
Output indicators
*  Capacity building for the Institutes of Cooperative Management's and the Junior Training
Centers' faculty to design and deliver basic training modules for the ST CCS is implemented
according to the plan
*  A member education strategy for selected PACS' members is developed and implemented
according to the plan
*  Training and capacity building for participating ST CCS to strengthen their ability to comply
with the new regulatory framework, as well as their managerial, operational and technical
capabilities is implemented according to the TA plan
2. Outputs of the Component
Under Component 1, the project funded train the trainer programs for 1,768 participants on the state and
district level, and directly supported the roll-out of training and capacity building programs to 109,348
sector participants. This translates to an average of five trainings provided per entity, which highlights
the massive scale of training provided.67 The participants included Board and general sector members, as
well as staff and management of PACS, DCCBs and SCBs in the five PS (see Table 1). The trainings
encompassed nine core training modules, which were developed under the revival package nationwide
and covered training to support the implementation of the common accounting and management
information systems, improve financial management, risk and credit assessment, conduct business
development planning, and inform boards and general members on their respective roles and rights (see
Table 2). Around 80 percent of the participants of an impact assessment carried out by NABARD in
2011 confirmed that the training had a positive impact on their performance.
66 See for example capacity building reforms supported under the Madagascar Microfinance Project.
67 NABARD and its training center BIRD confirmed that this was the second largest training effort undertaken within
NABARD.

3. Disbursements (Bank Funding Estimate USD20 million/Actual Disbursement USD4.5 million)
The component achieved most of the expected outputs with much lower costs than estimated at
appraisal, given that the activities were implemented through efficient delivery methods (using the
unified training modules and cascading model of training dissemination).
33


﻿Component 2: Information Technolo$y
1. Objective and activities
Component 2 supported computerization of the sector to improve the timeliness, availability and quality
of accounting information in PS. It was to build upon the introduction of a common accounting and
management information system supported under Component 1. While it is not critical for achieving
enhanced transparency, computerization is another tool for facilitating timely and efficient decision-
making and management within the financial intermediary. It can also positively affect the quality and
ease of data collection, off-site supervision and external audits of the sector.
Output indicators
*  New IT platform is installed in the PS
*  Participating ST CCS in all PS migrate to the new CAS within 3 years from the date on which
the MoU was signed
*  Participating ST CCS implement the new MIS within 3 years from the date of the first flow of
funds to the PS
2. Outputs of the Component
Limited project support was provided under component 2 for the computerization of the sector. Under
the program, it was determined that staff of PACS should first gather experience with manually
implementing the new CAS (financed under Component 1) to familiarize themselves with double
accounting, and help them move away from the single or informal accounting still prevalent at that time
in many PACS. The ICR team concurs that this step-by-step approach was needed to build the necessary
capacity and understanding for such a radical shift in accounting (see Box below). In parallel, a
common-national software was developed based on a software used in Tamil Nadu, and pilots to test
and adapt it to the specific state level requirements were carried in four PS. However, the ensuing
procurement and roll-out of the hardware and software was eventually stalled due to the aforementioned
closing of the government's revival package. Thus, the project only financed the hardware and software
as well as support and training for the transition to the new platform for 325 PACS in nine districts of
Haryana. In West Bengal, 3,141 PACS were computerized, but this was initiated prior to becoming a
member state and thus no project funds were used (See Annex 3, procurement). It should however be
noted that considerations are advanced in Gujarat and Odisha to finance the pending computerization
from within the sector, and similar discussions are ongoing in the other states. Moreover, all SCBs and
DCCBs are currently implementing a CBS, which allows the introduction of electronic payments and
transactions. This has created further interest within the sector to push for automation, either through
converting PACS into business correspondents with Point of Sales (POS), or fostering their
computerization. It is thus expected that the computerization will eventually still be carried out.
34


﻿Box: Experience with introducing the common accounting system and computerization - feedback received during
the completion report mission:
One of the visited small PACS highlighted that the introduction of the common accounting system has been a great help in
running their business. Prior to its introduction, they had relied on an informal system, many times calculating costs only in
their head and having limited paper trails. The new system now allows them to have an accurate reflection of their business,
track payments made and outstanding, and assess the true costs incurred. While they have received a computer under the
program, the management of the PACS did not yet feel comfortable in using it, and continued to use the manual forms for
common accounting system for their daily practices. To insert the information periodically into the computer, they rely on
one of the computer-literate members to come into the office.
Another PACS reported that they initially had strong internal resistance towards computerization, but eventually carried it out
with project support. They are now using the systems on a daily basis, and highly appreciate the ease and accuracy of data
and information it provides. They regularly share the print-outs with their Board members, who confirmed that the new
computer has helped them assess the entity's current financial situation and talk about the overdue loans. The staff of the
PACS however also highlighted that it was important to first prepare the accounts manually via the CAS, as this has helped
them understand the principles of double accounting and understand what the data and ratios include and measure.
3. Disbursements (Bank Funding Estimate USD20 million/Actual Disbursement USD1.7 million)
Due to cancellation, other three PS as well as Haryana (phase II) could not complete the procurement
and deployment process. However, manual roll-out of CAS conducted under Component I contributed
to better quality of information provided by ST CCS.
Component 3: CCS Financial Restructuring Support
1. Objective and activities
The recapitalization under Component 3 provided the needed capital and provided the monetary
incentive for introducing far reaching legal and regulatory reforms on the state and national level and for
reducing the role of state governments in the management and ownership of the sector. In this regard,
the recapitalization served as policy support as in many instances supported under a DPL. The
recapitalization also directly helped the sector boost its capital, thus allowing it to increase lending to the
targeted beneficiaries and increase outreach in line with the project development objective.
Output indicators
* All ST CCS deemed eligible for FRS as per the pre-determined criteria receive recapitalization
support upon the achievement of pre-agreed benchmarks
* Increase in CRARs for at least 2/3 of the participating ST CCS in the PS
2. Outputs of the Component
Status of reform benchmark activities is shown in Table 3. UP and Gujarat completed all the benchmark
activities, while other states also made a very good progress.

Around 14,000 eligible PACS as well as 13 DCCBs were recapitalized under component 3 when the
respective benchmark activities were met (see Table 5 and 6). The recapitalization of the sector is
however not yet complete. In all 89 of the 102 assessed DCCBs did not receive the expected
recapitalization support and some had to depend on the provision of grants from the state government to
meet the introduced CRAR of 4% mandated by RBI.68 The situation is similar in the other states of India
which signed the MOU with the government and embarked on the necessary reforms but were not
directly funded under the project. It should however be noted, that most of the expected benchmark
activities for recapitalization have now been met in the PS, which were the main expected output under
the project and capital adequacy project targets for DCCBs and SCB were met - so despite the lower
recapitalization amounts, the main objectives of boosting the capital of these institutions, was attained
(in part on account of the waiver which supported recoveries of bad loans and other measures).
68 This support was for example provided by the state government of Gujarat, which recapitalized 4 DCCBs that were not
meeting the capital adequacy requirements and would have otherwise had to be closed as a consequence.

3. Disbursements (Bank Funding Estimate USD555 million/Actual Disbursement USD404 million)
Due to cancellation, the final FRS disbursement was not completed (in particular UP and Gujarat that
achieved all the benchmark activities). However, the five PS committed to the legal and governance
reform under the Component, and achieved an objective of laying a good foundation toward a
sustainable cooperative sector.

﻿Component 4: Implementation
1. Objective and activities
The support for the implementing unit provided under the Component 4 also funded the special audits
carried out for all sector entities. These were needed to determine the actual amount of recapitalization
for each eligible entity. Component 4 also supported efforts to monitor state-level adherence to the
recapitalization benchmarks, as well coordinate and supervise activities on the state and national level.
Output indicators
* Implementation capacity of NABARD and of the SLICs, DLICs, and RCS in PS is strengthened,
as necessary
* Agreed M&E framework is developed and implemented
* A communications and dissemination strategy is prepared and implemented
2. Outputs of Component
Special audits to assess the situation of over 21,000 ST CCS were financed in all five states under
Component 4 (see Table 5 above). KPI were produced semi-annually in five PS. In addition, impact
studies were conducted (Gujarat, Orissa, UP and West Bengal by NABARD, and Andhra Pradesh and
Odisha by the Bank).

﻿Annex 3. Supporting Data and Information: Fiduciary Aspects
Financial Management
The key issues that were identified during the project implementation are listed below:
*  Delays in submission of IUFRs and audit reports. Out of the 20 IUFRs received during the
life of the project, 10 were past 90 days overdue, 8 were past 30 - 89 days overdue, and only 1
IUFR was received within the stipulated time of 45 days from the end of the reporting quarter.
The submission of audit reports is reflected in the Table 1. 70 In addition, Statement of
Expenditure (SOE) claims were submitted only once a year as opposed to quarterly claims.

*  Monitoring, accounting and reporting on PACS share of recapitalization remained an issue
and led to a downgrading of FM rating toward the project close. The ST CCS's share of
recapitalization contribution in UP was estimated at 26% (as compared to 5-10% in other states),
constituting a significant share of the total recapitalization. Although Aide-Memoires pointed out
the need to monitor and report such contributions in the IUFRs, this remained a pending action
till the project close. As per the last field visit to one district in UP in November 2013, out of
Rs35.6 million required to be raised as their own contribution by 132 PACS that received
financial assistance in the district, 56 PACS have raised Rs9.11 million (25%) from profits etc.
The others are unable to raise their contribution. Additionally, PACS in the district have raised
RsO.59 million as additional capital and have also recovered Rs2.1 million from out of the fraud
etc. However, it could not be confirmed, from the visit of sample district, if accounting entries
for PACS contribution as suggested by NABARD have been made.
*  Delays in audits of PACS by departmental auditors with the state governments, especially
in UP, remained an unresolved issue till project closure. The status of submission and audit of
financial statements of PACS in November 2013 is shown in Table 2.
70 During the first 2 years of project implementation, half yearly audit reports of the project were due for submission to the
Bank within 3 months of the end of the reporting period. From the 3rd year onwards an annual audit report was required to be
submitted to the Bank within 6 months from the end of the financial year.

Procurement
The final status of the procurement and rollout progress on the computerization of CAS and MIS is as
follows:
*  In UP, pilot testing of the National level core software, selected by the SLIC was carried out in
three PACS. The customization requirements for the software, based on this pilot testing, were
identified. Out of the 4,705 PACS eligible for IT support, electricity connection was available at
2,641 PACS. Computer hardware requirements had been already determined. The procurement
of hardware was not yet been initiated since floating of tenders was put on hold due to non-
availability of funds.
*  In Orissa, 1,200 PACS had been identified to be covered in the phase I computerization. The
requisite infrastructure in terms of having own building and electricity connection was ready.
The tenders for selecting the (i) Hardware vendor for supply and installation of computers,
printers and UPS, and (ii) Software deployment agency for installation of software, data entry
and providing training and three years onsite service support at these 1,200 PACS (under 17
DCCBs) have been invited in February 2012. Orissa State Coop Bank (OSCB) has adopted the
bidding documents recommended by NABARD while issuing these tenders. The bids were
opened in April 2012 and evaluation is completed. OSCB could not get the SLIC sub-
committee's decision on availability of funds that were expected from NABARD and the
contract was not awarded.
*  In West Bengal, the SLIC had approved to use the Common Software developed by a firm. The
common software was tested on a dry run in three PACS for testing (customization). The System
Integration vendor for supply of hardware, system integration and deployment of software, was
contracted pursuant to a procurement process initiated before West Bengal was incorporated as a
PS (in place of Uttarakhand) under the project. This procurement was reviewed and was found
not to be in compliance to the agreed procurement procedures of the Bank. The System
Integrator supplied the hardware to these PACS locations at their own cost. The System
Integrator was assigned with the task of implementation of the entire project, but could not carry
on the project further, because they had not yet been paid.
*  In Gujarat the dry run of core software on computerization of CAS/MIS was carried out in three
identified PACS. The tendering for procurement of hardware, system integration and deployment
of CAS was not initiated due to non-availability of funds.
*  Haryana could complete the roll out the state specific software in 325 PACS which was taken
up in for computerization in the first phase. For the remaining 277 PACS in Phase II tenders for
procurement of hardware and identification of the deployment agency (SDA) were floated but
the Roll out of the software in the second phase could not be completed since tenders could not
be floated due to non-availability of funds.

﻿Annex 5. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.    Assumptions in PAD. The project design as described in the PAD had the objective of dealing
with the external and internal factors that were seen to be undermining the ST CCS. The identified
undermining factors were inadequate legal framework, poor governance, weak operational capacity,
limitations on size and scope and the resultant low efficiency. The project was designed to address
inadequacies in regulation through support to reforms that require states to amend their cooperative
laws, consolidating regulatory powers in the hands of the central bank (by doing away with the
overlapping regulatory powers of states) and introducing prudential norms in all the three tiers. On
governance, the reforms were to be introduced in reducing state ownership of cooperatives, providing
voting rights for all shareholders, removing participation of state representatives in boards, periodic and
regular conduct of elections to boards, removing state interference in business, operations and
governance matters of the CCS and providing autonomy of operations to CCS to do business with any
institution of their choice without the bonding to the cooperatives in the different tiers. These reforms
were to be supported with capacity building and member awareness.
2.     Weak operational capacity was proposed to be addressed through strengthening management
capacity of CCS, training of staff, boards and senior management, improving accounting, MIS and audit
mechanisms, introducing a results-focused business planning framework and IT enablement. The scale
and scope issues were to be dealt through a focus on cost optimization, improvement of efficiency, risk
diversification through a wider range of products and services, and IT enablement which will increase
staff productivity. The freedom to price products, savings services at PACS level and integrating with
other financial products such as crop and asset insurance were also thought of as having the potential to
facilitate ST CCS expanding to achieve appropriate scale and benefit from economies thereof.
3.     In terms of impact, the interventions were to bridge the huge gap between demand and supply of
rural finance through effective leverage of capital infusion from the program. The expanded business
was expected to improve outreach to marginalized sections of rural households. Apart from improved
welfare resulting from increased access to financial services, cost reductions were anticipated from
substitution of high cost informal borrowing with affordable loans from ST CCS. Positive linkages both
forward and backward, increased autonomy of ST CCS resulting in member focused functioning and
therefore higher quality of benefits leading to better income and enterprise opportunities have been
assumed as likely outcomes.
4.     Assessment of economic impacts. As discussed in Section 3, the scenario of legal, regulatory
and governance reforms envisaged in the PAD have almost fully been realized. Overall the legal,
regulatory and governance changes have introduced a positive environment where good leadership can
take institutions on a sound, expansionary path. The value of these changes in economic terms is not
quantifiable, but the increasing economic activity level in local areas in which the institutions operate
will be a telling testimony to their effectiveness. However it must be noted that the reforms at these
levels of institutions take time to fully translate in to tangible improvements that impact local
economies. While changes are visible, impact of well-functioning reformed institutions will ideally
need to be measured after an interval of about three to four years as internal processes, systems and
products also need to change. These changes will not be knee-jerk response to legal and governance
reforms, but more calibrated and well thought out actions by managements that have to absorb the risks
45


﻿and own the outcomes. This is the reason why there will be a time lag between the initiation of reforms
and the full realization of outcomes on the ground.
5.     The linkages established by the reformed ST CCS had been varied. While systematic data
capture is not carried out, field missions regularly came across PACS providing an array of services
from improved supply of inputs, renting out farm equipment, aggregating agricultural produce,
undertaking procurement of produce from members on behalf of procurement agencies, undertaking
cooking gas supply, promoting and financing SHGs, collection of utility bills, etc. A number of PACS
had resumed savings mobilization from members after a long interval following the initiation of reforms
and preparation of new business plans.
6.     Assessment of financial impacts. As most of the analysis on the financial strength in ST CCS is
presented in Section 3, this section complements the analysis by adding a comparison between what the
financial analysis section in the PAD presented and the actual outcomes.
7.     The PAD randomly selected ten DCCBs in the country and analyzed the impacts expected on
their financial parameters. The analysis in the PAD showed that, over a five year period, following
receipt of financial assistance in 2007, the DCCBs' CRAR was expected to rise from an average of
minus 0.88 percent to 9.08 percent. In the same timeframe, it was assumed that ROA was to show
consistent improvement, rising from 0.07 percent to a 1.46 percent by the end of the period, providing a
good indication that the DCCBs would be able to achieve sustained profitability. Lastly, the dramatically
improved CRAR and profitability of the DCCBs were expected to lead to a substantial increase in their
lending, because they would achieve the creditworthiness required to increase their borrowing and
attract additional deposits.
8.     The actual outcome shows Odisha and other four PS separately. Odisha is considered separately
as only Odisha received the full FRS (Chart 1), while other PS received only a partial FRS. CRAR in
DCCBs evidences the expected achievements in both Odisha and other PS (average). ROA, however,
shows a weak result compared to the assumptions at appraisal, and does not demonstrate a strong
linkage between the FRS and profitability. Lastly, growth in lending achieved a very positive trend, with
a more rapid growth in Odisha.

9.        As the PAD       also noted, a conventional economic rate of return analysis is not straightforward in
this project. The Table 1 presents the FRR analysis in: (i) Odisha, where the FRS was fully completed;
and (ii) five states, following the same methodology applied in the PAD. Although a sample analysis of
10 DCCBs randomly selected from all the DCCBS in the country (including non-PS) in the PAD
showed a much better FRR, both the cases show a good level of FRR and positive NPV.

﻿STRENGTHENING INDIA'S RURAL CREDIT COOPERATIVES PROJECT
GOI Package for revival of STCCS - World Bank Assisted Project -
Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
The Government of India had set up a Task Force in August 2004 under the Chairmanship of Prof. A Vaidyanathan to
suggest an implementable action plan for reviving rural cooperative credit instituions including legal measures necessary for
facilitating this process. Accepting the recommendations of the Task force in principle, they were placed before the NDC at
its meeting held in June 2005.The recommendations were also discussed with state governments to arrive at a consensus. The
Revival Package was announced by Gol on 5 January 2006.
1.      Revival Package
Objective
The objective of the revival package was aimed at reviving the short-term rural cooperative credit structure (CCS) and make
it a well-managed and vibrant medium to serve the credit needs of rural India, especially the small and marginal farmers. It
sought to (a) provide financial assistance to bring the system to an acceptable level of health; (b) introduce legal and
institutional reforms necessary for their democratic, sel-reliant and efficient functioning; and (c) take measures to improve the
quality of management. It was also made clear in the package that all the three components are equally important and should
be implemented as an Integrated Package.
Approach
The proposed financial assistance was a one time measure only. Financial assistance was conditional and released only on the
implementation of the recommendations for legal and institutional reforms. States had the option to participate or not to
participate in the package. States that are not ready to make the choice immediately were given two years time to take a
decision in the matter.
Financial Package
Financial restructuring started first by bringing the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) to an acceptable level
of financial health through cleaning of their balance sheets and strengthening their capital base and then moved on to the
upper tiers. The DCCBs were thereafter provided assistance to clear the balance of accumulated losses, if any, and to reach a
minimum norm of capital adequacy. The same process was to be applied to the State Cooperative Banks (St.CBs).
Eligible Purposes
Financial assistance under the package was available for wiping out accumulated losses, covering invoked but unpaid and un-
invoked guarantees given by the State Governments and other dues to the CCS from them, and increasing the capital to a
specified minimum level. The package also included assistance necessary to bring all cooperatives, including PACS, to a
minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 7%. It was also expected that the CRAR of PACS will be raised
to 9% within three years and that of CCBs and Stcbs as prescribed by RBI. Such increase was to be done by the CCS from
their resources.
Eligible Institutions
The package provided for the capitalization of all societies in the three tier of the CCS . However in regard to PACS that
satisfy the eligibility criteria the capitalization would be direct and in regard to others the capitalization would take place in
the next higher tier. The package was to capitalize the STCCS entities in a bottom up approach beginning with the lower tiers
first and then moving upwards.
For the purpose of determining the eligibility of PACS they were classified as A,B and C category based on their recovery
percentage as on 30 June 2004, Thus PACS with a recovery of 50 % and above as on the above date were classified as A
category and were eligible for full recapitalisation assistance directly and PACS with recovery of 30 to 50% were to receive
the recap assistance in 3 annual back ended installments subject to their achieving an incremental increase of recovery of
10% points by 30 june 2006. As and when PACS in B category ( Recovery between 30 to 50 %) achieved 50 % recovery
they were eligible for full direct recap assistance without waiting for the year to year benchmark recovery. However
subsequently NIMC relaxed the eligibility criteria and all PACS ( including those with recovery percentage of less than 30%
as on 30 june 2004) that achieved a recovery of 50% by 30 June 2007 were considered eligible for recap assistance . As
53


﻿regards the NER states including Sikkim the eligible criteria was waived as a special case making all the PACS eligible for
assistance under a special package and a special dispensation with concessions was announced by GOI during 2006.
Technical Assistance
The financial package also covered the costs of training and capacity building to improve the financial and management
skills of staff and board members; for installation of uniform accounting and monitoring systems known as CASMIS, as well
as for computerization of PACS with provision for Hardware and Software including capacity building of the PACS
personnel.
Sharing Pattern
The liability for funding the financial package was shared by the Central Governments, State Governments and the CCS
based on origin of loss and existing commitments. The actual magnitude of the share was to be determined on the basis of the
findings of the special audit. However, a broad picture, based on available aggregate data as on March 2003, was estimated
as given below:
(' crore)
ElAents                 Col Share        State Govt Share      qcqcs Share       Fotal
cc. Loss CRAR          5476             2689                   401             8566
HRD-Spl. Audits         154                                                      154

Total                    924528                                                   13596
Legal and Institutuional Reforms
The root cause for the weak financial state of cooperative societies lies in poor management and governance, and unless these
are improved the entire recap assistance would be wasted . With this end in view the Package suggested amendments in
various acts such as Cooperative Societies Act of implementing States, BR Act, NABARD Act, DICGC Act, etc. States
were also committed to implement the acts as amended. While the amendment of CS act was completed in 23 states out of 25
that signed the MOU , The amendments to BR Act and NABARD Act are yet to be carried out. It was felt that no
amendments to DICGC act would be required since it was proposed to have a separate Deposit and Institutional protection
scheme for PACS.
The Package also suggested to bring down the State Government equity in these Institutions to below 25% of the
subscribed capital within a period of 3 years subject to the condition that there would be only one government representative
in the board of DCCB/StCBs while there would be none to represent the state Govt. in PACS, even if they had received
equity contribution from the state Govt.
Benchmark activities
Release of financial assistance under the financial package will be back ended and linked to achievement of pre-defined
benchmarks.
Implementation Mechanism
NABARD was designated as the implementing agency for the scheme. However, for guiding and monitoring the
implementation of the scheme at national, state and district levels, Implementing and Monitoring Committees were
constituted at National , State and district levels with senior level participation from GOI, State Govt, NABARD,SCBs and
also of chartered accountants.
2.      Gol Agreement with World Bank - Strengthening Rural Credit Cooperative Project
Gol had   entered into a loan agreement and financing agreement with International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the IBRD) and the International Devt. Association (the IDA) (the IBRD and IDA collectively referred to as
World Bank) on 02 November 2007 for an amount of US $ 600 million under strengthening of Rural credit Cooperatives
Project.
The objective of the project was to assist in providing the members of the CCBs, including small and marginal farmers with
significantly enhanced access to formal finance (credit, savings, etc) by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the
participating states transformed into efficient and commercially sustainable institutions.
54


﻿The project consisted various components viz., Capacity Building and Technical Assistance, Information Technology,
Financial restructuring of eligible CCBs in the participating states through a one time recapitalisation of eligible CCBs and
Implementation.
3.      Role of NABARD in implementing the package
i. Creation of an exclusive department
On announcement of the package by Govt of India, as an implementing agency, NABARD created a seperate department viz.
Department of Cooperative Revival and Reforms (DCRR) to pay undivided attention to take up the implementation of the
Revival Package throughout the country.
ii. Conduct of NIMCs
To oversee implmentation and monitoring of Revival Package as per the decision of Govt of India, National Implementing
and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) was set up under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Financial Services, Ministry of
Finance. Chairman/ Managing Director of NABARD was one of the members of the NIMC. NABARD faciliated conduct of
NIMCs. In the NIMC meeting, policy issues of importance and issues raised by the participating States were discussed and
decisions taken in the meeting. Nine NIMCs were held during the implementation period of the pacakge. The last such
meeting was held on 27 January 2011.
iii. Signing of MoU by States
Union Finance Minister addressed DO letter to all Chief Ministers of States on 6 January 2006. NABARD followed up with
States by correspondence, meetings, discussions with Chief Ministers of States for expeditious signing of MoU by the States.
NABARD also held interactions with State Government officials, made presentations on package urging upon signing of
MoU and advantages accrued to the CCS under the Package. Formats for signing of MoU for two tier structures and 3 tier
structures were prepared by NABARD.
Outcome
As a result, 25 out of 28 States signed MoU during August 2006 to 1 July 2008. i.e. 89% of the States covered. All North
Easter Region States signed MoU. (There are 28 States and 7 Union Territories in the country).
iv. Special Audit
The first step for CCS units to receive financial assistance under the Package was to complete the special audit with reference
date as on 31 March 2004.
Obiective
The main objective of the special audit was to determine the share of Gol, State
Government and the CCS concerned as envisaged in the package.
Implementation & Operational experience
NABARD as the principal implementing agency of the Revival Package for the STCCS, was responsible for proper and
timely conduct of the special audit and precise assessement of the extent of the financial assistance to all units of the STCCS.
The task involved conduct of special audit on-site using prescribed scheduled and tables, sample checking by Chartered
Accountant and then compilance and finalisation of the DLIC and SLIC.
For this purpose, audit manuals for conduct of special audit of PACS/DCCBs/SCB were prepared by NABARD. The manual
contained, in general, 8 Schedules and from the schedules sharing of financial assistance under the Revival Package and
Additional Provisioning required for cleaning of Balance Sheet was worked out.
Through operational experience, it was found that the PACS did not have norms for provisioning and no uniformity found in
provisioning accounts. Hence, NABARD in consultation with the RBI had prepared the guidelines on prudential norms for
PACS which was followed in special audit and continued to be followed since then.
Special audit of the PACS was conducted by Departmental Auditors. In states, where the Departmental Auditors were not
sufficient in number to complete the special audit within a reasonable period of time and the State Government, the ROs
were advised to engage Chartered Accountants for conducting the special audit also. The same CA was made as a member of
55


﻿the DLIC. As conduct of special audit is different from regular audit, extensive trainings were given to Departmental
Adutiors as well as CAs on the audit manual through Master Trainers. Regional Office officials and District Development
Managers (Chairman of DLIC) and CAs of DLIC & SLICs were also given trainings on Special Audit. Clarifications were
also given in respect of accounting related queries arisen during conduct of special audit. All audits were vetted by the
DCCB level Support Team (DLST) and 15% of audits by each auditor, already vetted by the DLST was sample checked by
the CA member of the DLIC.
The Chartered Accountant conducted on-site sample checking of 15% of special audits done by the auditors. These audits
were passed on to the CA only after due vetting by the DCCB Level Support Teams. The special audit of PACS was to be
completed first and then special audit of DCCBs and SCBs was to be taken up.
Out come
As the actual magnitude and recapitalisation assistance of the package was to be determined on the basis of the findings of
the special audit, the size of the overall package enhanced to Rs.21739 crore from Rs.13596 crore and Gol share increased to
15902 crore from ' 9245.28 crore. Details are given in Table No. III below.
Special Audit of 80883 PACS in 25 States were completed. 75479 PACS were recommended for recpaitalisation assistance.
52,902 eligible PACS in seventeen States, and 1510 ineligible PACS affiliated to 30 CCBs in three States were released
recapitalisation assistance. As regards CCBs only 13 DCCBs in Odisha were released recap assistance. Recapitalisation
assessed and released to the World Bank assisted States are given in Table No. IV.
NABARD in consultation with the RBI had prepared the guidelines on prudential norms for PACS which was followed in
special audit and continued to be followed since then. The guidelines were on prudential norms issued to PACS for adoption
in the State from 01 April 2009 In addition to this, PACS had also been advised to draw the balance sheet as per the format
prescribed by NABARD.
Audit Clearance
One of the reform measures brought in cooperatives was conduct of Statutory Audit by Departmental Auditors or CAs, as
decided by their Management. The Statutory Audit of PACS upto 31 March 2004 was completed in 80,639 PACS to faciliate
implementation of Revival Pakage. A need was felt to provide a one-time assistance to PACS to facilitate/updte the audit so
that it is regularly completed on continuous basis. With a view to clearing the existing arrears of audit in PACS, a one-time
Scheme for Audit Clearing was also announced by NABARD in September 2011 as its own initiative to continue the
momentum and in auditing of PACS achieved during the implementation of the package and also to make the auditing of
PACS up to date. The objective of the scheme is to provide incentive to the PACS for clearing arrears of audit by 31
December 2011 and help PACS to meet the additional expenditure to clear the arrears in audit. An amount of ' 8000/- was
given to each PACS for clearing the arrears of audit upto the financial year ending 31 March 2011 latest by 31 December
2011.
Appointment of CAs for conduct of Statutory Audit of DCCBs/SCB
As per the amendments carried out in State Cooperative Societies Act in the implementing States, the Stautory Audit of
StCB/CCBs were required to be conducted by professional Chartered Accountants from the panel approved by NABARD.
Impelmentation and Operationlisation
For this purpose, NABARD prepared a Panel of CA firms from the CA list provided by ICAI as per standardised norms and
was made available to DCCBs/Stcbs for selection of auditors by their Board.
Outcome
Since then, the SCB/CCBs in the impelemnting States are utilising the panel provided by NABARD for selection of Auditor
for conduct of Statutory Audit of their banks.
v. Training and Capacity Buildin2 initiatives to improve the Quality of Mana2ement
Objective
Task Force laid thrust on 'qualitative improvement in personnel in all tiers and at levels through capacity building and other
interventions leading to an increase in overall efficiency.
56


﻿Design
The Task Force had recommended for constitution of a Joint Group comprising members from NABARD, RBI, National
Counsil for Cooperative Training, Cooperative Training Establishments and Training Establishments of NABARD to finalise
the training strategy to be adopted in STCCS, prepare training modules at various levels and different categories of personnel
along with detailed session plans and prepare necessary reading material/training kits. The internal group of NABARD
examined this subject and also prepared a Road Map for Training Intervensions in STCCS. A National Committee was set
up for giving direction on capacity building in Cooperative Credit Institutions, and to assess the critical minimum training
needs at all level of cooperatives. The committee consisting of Trainers from the training Institutes of NABARD prepared
suitable course modules for each identified subject or issue, and also developed suitable training and reading materials and
detailed trainers Guide and got translated all these materials into various regional languages. Further considering the huge
number of trainees spread across the country, a novel and suitable strategy to train and equip adequate number of trainers was
devised by application of a cascading system of training to reach the trainees at the lowest tier of the STCCS. Accordingly
Master trainers selected from the implementing states that consisted of Officers both retired and serving from the StCbs and
CCBs and other experienced trainers from the Banking industry were trained at the National level Institute of NABARD,
BIRD on each course modules. These Master trainers later trained the state level trainers in the respective State level Training
Institutes and they in turn trained the district level Trainers to reach entire hierarchy of STCCS personnel. Besides these
trainers and training modules NABARD also formulated training modules on the core areas of Banking and Governance for
the Branch Managers of CCBS/STCBs CEOs of CCBS/STCBS and also for the Board members of CCBS/STCBS. They
were trained by apex level training Institutes like BIRD, Vamnicom, RICMs and ICMs directly to maintain the standard and
quality of Training.
As on 31 March 2005, the STCCS, with a three tier federal structure, had PACS (112309) at the grass root level; the central
banks (DCCBs-368) at the district level and the Apex Cooperative Banks (30) at the state level. In the North-Eastern states
and Smaller states, the SCB has been purveying credit through PACS without the intermediate tier.
Implementation
Considering the number of PACS in each State, nodal training institution partner was identified in each State so as to
coordinate, organise, monitor and report on the required training programmes for PACS in each DCCB either directly or by
collaborating with other training institutions or by contracting outsourced factuly etc. As the focus of the entire Revival
Package was autonomy of every cooperative institution, it was ensured that the training institutuions and the faculty involved
in the training programmes become responsible for transmitting such a message. For this purpose, Trainers Training
Programmes were conducted so as to equip the identified master trainers and district level trainers.
To start with modules, reading material and also trainers work book for the capacity building of the secretaries and elected
members of PACS were prepared. The programme design and methodology were field tested. Before finalising the
modules, reading material and trainers workbook, were got validated by persons having indepth knowledge in STCCS and
particularly PACS functioning. Thereafter, the focus was on conducting regular programmes based on modules and tool kit
developed by the working group. Nine modules / consisting of course material, reading material and trainers guide were
developed by NABARD are as under
Module-I:               Module for Secretaries of PACS
Module-II:              Module for elected members of PACS
Module-III&IV:          Training on CAS/MIS
Module-V:               BoD of CCBs
Module-VI:              CEOs of CCB/ StCB
Module-VII:             BDP for PACS Secretaries
Module VIII:            Orientation Programme for Branch Managers/Senior Officers of CCBs/StCB
Module IX:              Orientation Programme for Supervisors/ Inspectors for PACS
Operationlisation
For this purpose, ACSTIs of states, ICMs of states, VAMNICOM, Pune, CAB, Pune were also involved in conduct of
training. The training modules focused on governance, management, house-keeping, internal controls and MIS, member
involvement and business development and diversification. " Doing existing things better" and "doing new things
profitability" were the focus of the training programmes to PACS Secretaries.
Outcome
57


﻿So far, 86,276 PACS secretaries from 24 States and 1,29,775 elected members of PACS from 20 States have been trained by
2081 DLTs. Further, 6019 Departmental auditors and supervisors from 20 States have been trained to provide hand-holding
support and 76,457 PACS functionaries from 20 States have been trained in CAS/MIS. 39,387 PACS staff in 13 States have
been trained on Business Development and Profitability so far. Further, 8,188 Branch Managers/Senior Officers of
CCBs/SCBs in 23 States have been trained on business development/ diversification. The all India details of number of
training programmes conducted for Trainers / at PACS, CCB and StCB level are given in Table I and II. Details of Training
given in World Bank States as on 30 September 2013 are given below.

Member Awareness Programme
Objectives
Revitalisation of the cooperatives on a sustaibale basis would not merely depend on the enabling legal and institutional
arrangements, but actually on the members' understanding of their roles and responsibilities in making the cooperatives
member driven organisations and their active participation in the affairs of the cooperatives. In other words, member
awareness is a sort of insurance for the cooperatives and, therefore, a necessary and vital component of the reform process.
Recognising this, NABARD prepared Member Awareness Programme to implement through publicity literature like posters
and leaflets. Further, NABARD also prepared a concept paper on Member Awareness Programme with the strategy to
implelment through Mass Awareness through print publicity, media publicity, mobile projectors, involving the support
reputed autonomous institutions. However, due to non-availability of fund the above programme could not take off.
vii. Institutional Reforms
CAS and MIS
Accounting systems and practices followed in PACS prior to the implementation of the Package were largely determined by
the requirements of the Cooperative Societies Acts of the States concerned. However, lack of uniformity in the accounting
systems and standard financial statements coupled with absence of provisioning for bad assets and other accepted practices
had not only hidden their actual financial position but also hindered their business growth in many cases. Therefore, as
envisaged in Revival Package, Common Accounting System was made applicable to all PACS including LAMPS and FSS.
A Common Accounting System for use by PACS was designed by NABARD after extensive consultations with various tiers
of the STCCS and other stakeholders. The major components of this CAS are :
a.     Applicability of universally accepted basic concepts and principles in maintenance of accounts by the PACS.
b.     Adoption of standard financial statements, viz. Balance Sheet, P&L A/c. and Trading A/c.
C.     List of a common set of General Ledger Heads of Account compatible with financial statements; and
d.      Maintenance of minimum essential and Standard Books of Accounts.
58


﻿CAS and Management Information System (MIS) is the basis for the computerization in PACS.Uniformity in financial
statements, viz., Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Account, Trading Account coupled with adoption of certain basic accounting
principles regarded as an essential part, while the exhaustive list of GL A/c. heads and minimum standard set of books are to
be taken as best practices/measures under the CAS. A number of sessions were devoted to the CAS in the training modules
of PACS Secretaries and board members, to introduce the subject to them in varying degrees. CAS was introduced manually
in the PACS across the country and in all the WB assisted states as a prelude to computerized accounting system.
Outcome
All the PACS in the 5 implementing states under WB assistance have adopted the CAS manually.
viii. Computerisation of common accounting system (CAS) in PACS
As already decided by NIMC, CAS and MIS are (quote) "the core of the computerisation for PACS. As the entire focus of
computerisation of PACS is to obtain standardised consolidated information, preference is to be given to installation of CAS
in PACS even if it is to be handled initially through manual operations" (unquote). It needs no emphasis that the PACS staff
should be reasonably familiar with the CAS accounting heads, various books of accounts and postings to be made therein,
and MIS outputs required to be generated at various periodicities before moving over to computerised environment. It should
be taken as a prerequisite to the computerisation exercise.
As required by NIMC, NABARD had developed in 2007, comprehensive guidelines for getting State specific software
developed and for procurring of hardware. However, as none of the States except Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Tamil Nadu
had made any progress, the VIIth NIMC held in September 2009, directed NABARD to identify a software for all India
implementation and to examine the software developed by these 3 States for the same. These guidelines were prepared by a
committee headed by NABARD, Managing Director and had taken into account the requirements of the CVC as well as
requirements of the Government of India with respect to their borrowing agreements with the World Bank and the ADB. The
guidelines included the logic for computerisation of CAS and MIS in PACS, the conditionalities to be adhered and process to
be followed by the SLIC and the tender documents to be utilised for the purpose.
The tender documents issued were received on behalf of the SLIC at the office of the SCB or NABARD RO as was decided
by the SLIC. The RO provided necessary support for printing of these documents. The processing of the tender documents
received was done by a subcommittee of the SLIC in which NABARD RO was a member. As required by the Gol
agreements with the World Bank and ADB, all payments were directly made by NABARD RO to the vendors after due
verification and recommendation of the SLIC or respective DLICs.
Computerization of PACS:- Status
1. As per the decision taken in the VII National Implementing and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) meeting held in
September 2009, NABARD as the implementing agency finalized the Core Software and sent CDs containing the software
to all 20 States that have opted for the Core software viz., Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jammu &
Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, MP, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Orissa, Rajasthan, Sikkim,
Tripura, UP and W Bengal. Preceding this, the revised guidelines for rollout of the software and training of PACS staff &
hardware procurement were sent to all implementing States. The remaining 3 states that have gone ahead with
computerization viz, A.P, Haryana , and Tamil Nadu had adopted state specific software as per the decisions of the State
Govt./SLIC.
2. Guidelines on computerization of CAS and MIS for PACS were issued in two separate modules: (i) development,
procurement & deployment of software including training on software, and (ii) procurement and installation of hardware.
Cost of dry run, bilinguality, training of SDAs, Customisation and AMC for the first year are reimbursable under the Revival
Package.
3. Dry run of the software has been completed in 13 States viz., Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat,
Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan. Haryana,
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil nadu chose for state specific software and the computerization is in progress at different stages in
these states . Thus all the WB assisted states had completed the Dry run and customization of the software and further
progress in computerization is hampered for want of funds.
In Haryana, state specific software was developed by M/s Nelito Systems Ltd. Based on open tendering process, SLIC
awarded the hardware and software deployment contract for roll out of the software in 325 PACS to M/s HCL Infosystems.
Training of Software Deployment Agency (SDA) by Nelito wascompleted. Installation of hardware in all 325 PACS was
59


﻿completed. Training of PACS staff by SDA is also completed. SLIC had approved the tendering for SDA & procurement &
installation of hardware in respect of remaining 277 eligible PACS in the State. Tenders for hardware procurement and
identification of SDA floated for 277 PACS under Phase II. Finalization of vendor for hardware is in progress. Retendering
has been done for identifying vendor for roll out of software in the second phase. However the whole process is kept in
abeyance for want of funds under the package.
Outcome
Although the process of computerization is at different stages in the 5 states    there is a need to take the
computerization programme to all the PACS, as the same was halted due to non-availability of funds.
ix. Management Information System
Post reforms, PACS were expected to function as full fledged and self controlled financial intermediaries that establish their
own business policies to meet the challenges of a dynamic economic environment and business models. To help decision
making at PACS and at all other levels including those of the higher financing agencies, regulators and other agencies, there
was an urgent need to have a sound and standardized MIS at PACS. With the above objective, an MIS for PACS was
designed by NABARD after extensive field study and consultation with all the stake holders.
Under MIS, PACS were required to prepare and submit nineteen Annexures periodically to various agencies. These
statements were also required for the management of PACS to exercise operation control and take management decisions.
NABARD had brought out a comprehensive handbook on MIS which guided the PACS for preparation of Annexures. It
gave the tips/ explained the source of data required for compiling statements. It also indicated additional information
required to be furnished in the ledgers/registers so as to enable PACS to prepare the Annexures smoothly. Suitable
explanations were also given in the handout, to define various accounting terms/ratios as per requirement.
Outcome
It is understood from the field visits/success stories compiled, that the PACS have extensively used the MIS for improving
the business. All the PACS where Dry run of the software is completed are generating the MIS statements and same are
being used by the PACS and CCBs as observed during the field visit of ix support mission in Gujarat.
x. Internal Control System for PACS
Post reforms, PACS are expected to function as full fledged and self controlled financial intermediaries that establish their
own business policies to meet the challenges of a dynamic economic environment and business models. In order to enable
the PACS to have fool proof systems and procedures that would enable prudent decision making at their level, which would
also help the higher financing agencies, regulators and other stake holders to discharge their obligations smoothly and more
responsibly, it was necessary to have a sound internal control systems in PACS.
Design
NABARD designed a deailed guidelines on the Internal Control System for PACS. The main objectives of the Internal
Control System are to ensure that (a) business is conducted in an orderly, prudent manner in accordance with he testablished
policies, (b) transactions are entered into only under general or specific authority, (c) assets are safeguarded and liabilities
controlled, (d) accounting and other records provide complete, accurate and timely information and (e) management is able to
identify and assess the risk of the business. The various internal control measures to be adopted by PACS were spelt out
and PACS were advised to prepare Books of Accounts and Balancing and Reconciliation on quarterly basis and put up the
same to MC so as to ensure that some of the essential internal control measures are put into practice in the society.
xi. Institutional Protection and Deposit Safety Scheme for PACS
Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACS) have very poor resource base, both capital and member deposits.
At present, the deposits mobilized by the PACS are very insignificant mainly because of deposits mobilized by PACS are not
covered by DICGC or any other effective deposit insurance scheme. With the implementation of Gol revival package for the
rural credit cooperatives, PACS are expected to mobilize more and more deposits from their members. At the same time
deposits from the members of PACS need to be protected as safety of their hard earned money has to be ensured. With this
aim in view, NABARD has prepared a scheme of Institutional Protection and Deposit Safety Scheme for PACS. For
implementation of the schemes, two funds have been proposed - (i) Institutional Protection Fund and (ii) Deposit Safety
Fund. The proposal is under consideration of Gol.
xii. ReEulatorv Reform
As a part of reform process, professionalism was brought in cooperative banks. As financial institutions, the Boards of
SCBs/CCBs required minimum support at the Board level. For this purpose RBI prescribed Fit and Proper criteria for
60


﻿professionals to be on the Boards of Cooperative Banks both elected and co-opted and also for the CEO to be appointed by
cooperative banks.
All the banks are adopting the criteria prescribed by RBI. However, problem persists as they do not get suitable candidates
from outside due to low remuneration, lack of experienced Bankers of the suggested age profile etc.
xiii. Achievement of Benchmark Parameters In WB assisted states
Release of financial assistance under the financial package was made back ended and linked to achievement of pre-defined
benchmarks, in respect of legal, institututional and regulatory reforms and will, therefore, be phased over a period. The
benchmark prescribed and achievement made by the World Bank States are as under:
1. Act Amendment
All the states under the world Bank project viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have amended
their respective Cooperative Societies Act.
2. (i) Amendment to Rules
Gujarat, Odisha, UP and West Bengal have amended their respective cooperative societies rules while it is in progress in
Haryana.
(ii) Amendment of Bye-laws
Bye-laws have been amended in Gujarat, Haryana, and UP in all the three tiers of STCCS. The amendments of bye-laws are
in progress in Odhisa and West Bengal.
3. Conduct of Elections
Elections have been completed in all three tiers of the cooperatives in the States of Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West
Bengal except in cases of societies/banks where the matter is subjudice or they are under liquidation. In respect of Odisha,
the Cooperatives had elected Board soon after the implementation of the package and the election process for the next term is
yet to be started in the State.
4. a. Appointment of CEOs in SCBs and DCCBs
Gujarat, Haryana, UP and West Bengal (except CCBs) have appointed the CEOs as per Fit and Proper Criteria. In Odisha the
appointment of CEOs as per fit and proper criteria is pending.
b. Appointment of Professional Directors in SCBs and CCBs.
Gujarat, Haryana, UP and West Bengal (except CCBs) have appointed as per Fit and Proper Criteria. As the election is yet to
be completed in cooperatives in Odhisa the appointment of professional directors as per fit and proper criteria is pending.
5. Reduction of State Government equity to less than 25%
All the three tier structures in all the five States had reduced the State Government equity to less than or equal to 25%.
6. Release of committed liabilities
Gujarat and UP States have released their committed liabilities in full. Haryana, Odisha and West Bengal States did not have
any committed liabilities pending to be released, as per special audit.
7. Reduction of State Government Nominee
All the five States have complied with the norms prescribed in the package
8. Preparation of Roadmap for ineligible PACS
Gujarat had prepared the road map for their ineligible PACS.
In Haryana State, out of 33 ineligible societies, 22 had improved recovery and the rest are being strengthened. UP has
released funds for the revival of 1200 PACS, so that they are able to take up new business and improve themselves. In West
Bengal, RCS has prepared the Roadmap for ineligible PACS which is awaiting the approval of the State Government. Odhisa
is yet to complete the preparation of the Roadmap for inelgiible PACS.

analysis of PACS; Computerisation of PACS under the package would have brought more positive impact; Implementation
of the core software kept in abeyance at dry run level in 3 PACS. Customisation of the software was not done. Software not
made in bilingual in Gujarati. Hence, StCB has identified a seperate software in gujarati; CCB is giving hardware to all its
PACS and is sharing the cost of software with StCB; Preparation of BDPs - encourage PACS to adopt commercial activities;
PACS - important to ST structure. So CCB conducts seminars periodically for PACS to act as MSC; Encouraging PACS for
business diversification; In Gujarat, the State Govt. has decalred 4% rebate for prompt payers. So farmers get loans at 0%
inetrest; CCB will be paying 5.5% to PACS which repay KCC loans on due dates to avoid interest loss to societies due to late
settlement of interest subvention claims; PACS are following CAS -This has brought in transparency; Borrowing
membership shown improvement; Imbalances have been brought down to zero between members' loans and bank loans; The

compared to 3.07 crore farmers by commercial banks and 84 lakh by the RRBs. The average loan provided by
Cooperatives stood at ' 35,349 as against ' 86,328 by RRBs and ' 1,40,730 by the Commercial Banks. Total
Disbursements made by Cooperatives (ST&LT) during the last 6 years and the disbursements made to SF/MF are as

xvi Release of State Govts share in excess of requirement by participatinE States
A few States like UP, Maharashtra, Assam, M.P., Rajasthan, Gujarat have released fund to the DCCBs in their States, so as to
bailout the banks from non-compliance of Section 11(i) of BR Act, 1969 as applicable to Cooperative Societies. The details

NABARD's comments on the draft ICR
Observations
Performance Rating
Performance Rating by ICR - Outcome rating, Bank (World Bank rating), Borrower rating all rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. Bank and Borrower performance at entry level and exit level are Moderately Satisfactory.
Comments:
As discussed in the wrap up meeting dated 20 November 2013, World Bank may consider giving a higher rating
(Satisfactory) in view of the following reasons:
f. Post ADWDR, the performance of the banks took a dip and was subsequently corrected. But as the base year is
taken as 2005, the improvement does not appear to be substantial.
g. The PDOs review in Page 7 indicates that in 4 out of the 5 indicators, the date achieved is 30 June 2007. RoA is the
PDO which is shown as achieved in 18 May 2011.
h. Much of the progress has been made since 30 June 2011, even in the absence of financial support.
1.  Deciding on the achievement in PDOs alone is not sufficient to rate the overall performance. Learnings from the
field visits clearly indicate that the reforms have significant impact and are being internalised. The report has
mentioned these, but if the given the rating at MS, these do not seem significant.
66


﻿Bank team's response74: The Bank acknowledges the many positives but in line with internal guidelines, retains the ratings.
Result Framework Analysis:-
a) PDO indicators
While reviewing the PDO indicators in the report, under item 1 to item 5 the base line values have been taken as on 31-03
2005 in respect of STCCS in participating states by the world Bank as originally approved. The indicators viz Recovery
rates, the annual percent increase in ground level financing, the increase in number of SF/MF that received credit, and the
ROA of the participating states etc would have presented a more realistic picture as a consequence to the implementation of
the project had the Achievements under these heads as on 31-03-08/30-06-08 been compared with the achievements as on the
latest available data ( 31/03/12/30/06/12) since although the project was formally announced in January 2006, the financial
assistance was received by the PACS/DCCBS only after 2007.
Bank team's response: Noted, but the baseline was identified during preparation and was linked to the reform program
announcement.
b) Intermediate outcome indicators:-
Indicator No.-6:-While the report on indicators no.1 to 5 are as per the data furnished by NABARD , the item 6 mentions
about lack of use of MIS in CCBS under "comments". It may be mentioned that the core software being implemented in
PACS under STCCS is designed for the CAS and MIS for the PACS. While the implementation of the core software has been
with held in PS due to paucity of funds, PACS that have completed the customization and dry run make use of the same as
vouchsafed from the filed visits (Eg: Haryana). Similarly the respective DCCBs are also making use of the same as could be
observed from the data made available by the AMBALA CCB of Haryana during the field vist of ix support mission of the
World Bank. Thus it is not the lack of comprehension of the importance of MIS that mars the use of MIS by the PACS but
the delay in the implementation of the software across the PACS.
Indicator 10:- The observations that the approved output indicators were tracked only partially is not factually right. The
detailed Monthly progress report known as the status report were received from the PS and was consolidated by the
implementing agency. Further the Impact evaluation studies were conducted with the overall requirements of all the
multilateral agencies and a common terms of reference was followed in the reports. The outcome indicators as required by
the WB were separately tracked in the implementing states and were made available during the support missions.
Project Context Development Objectives and Design:-
Page No. 13 Para 3 Government response-
The figures reported about STCCS is differing from that reported in the VC Report dated 4 February 2005. As per the VC
report, the structure had 112309 PACS, 367 DCCBs and 30 SCBs.
Bank team's response: Noted, but data taken from PAD and the orders of magnitude are similar.
Page No. 14 Other donor enEaEements
The report refers the agency as GTZ instead of GIZ. Further GIZ was also involved in preparation of a guidelines for
governance in PACS and also helped in preparation of a model Deposit and institutional protection scheme that paved the
way for a comprehensive scheme prepared by NABARD for PACS which is still under the consideration of GOI.

noted/merited modifications made where necessary.

﻿Although the PDO mentioned here is as per the Project appraisal document and the over all increase in this was much more
than the target level of 50 % ( 66%) this has also a bearing on the extent of fragmentation of land and could only be
proportionate to the increase in membership of the PACs.
OriEinal components:-
Component 1:- The technical assistance for capacity building aimed to build not only the capacity of the STCCS personnel
but also the Board of directors, and the departmental personnel in the changed scenario of governance and accounting
system.( Needs revision in the elucidation)
Component 3:-The financial assistance aimed at making the institutions eligible to borrow from other institutions to ensure
continued credit flow to the farmers besides restoring the value of members capital and enhancing the CRAR to 7%'
Page 15, Para 1.5, Component 3 - Original Components
CRAR of 7% - as on 31 March 2004 may be added here.
Pg 17, Para 19 The Gol contributed a larger share of the recapitalization funding than initially expected
Table 1: Expected and actual recapitalization assistance provided (Rs Crore)
Total estimated project cost was ' 9596 crore. Further Gol added ' 4000 crore as contigencies. Hence the total package
worked out ' 13596 crore.
Amount released in 5 States by the State Govts is ' 479.78 crore and PACS share brought in is ' 21.75 crores. This
information may please be updated in the Table no. 1.
Bank team's response: Noted, but data taken from earlier submissions by state.
Pg 19, para 25 titled "The program had clear eligibility criteria for the FRS package"
Last sentence "This resulted from Gol-state government discussions, most of which occurred prior to the formal initiation of
the Bank's project preparation". Not clear what it means. The relaxation of the eligibility criteria was NIMC decision.
Pg 20, Para 31 titled "The approach towards recapitalization or liquidation of category C PACS was unclear".
The Package is very clear that if the PACS meet the 50% recovery criteria, they will receive direct capitalisation support and
if they fail to achieve 50% recovery, their overdues to the higher tier i.e., the DCCBs in r/o of 3 tier and StCB in r/o 2 tier ST
CCS would be extended to the higher tier as indirect recapitalisation. A roadmap for these category "C" PACS is required to
be drawn by the State Govts., which is a benchmark activity. Hence if the PAD incorporates the above 2, then the caption
needs to be re-examined.
"The issues were mainly due to the general lack of data on the sector, and insufficient computerization, but also due to a
lack of effort and support to harmonize the collected data on the central level. Given the recurring issues around
the collection of core data, NABARD could have considered standardizing data collection".
It is not clear what is meant by but also due to a lack of effort and support to harmonize the collected data on the central
level. The cooperative sector has not had an effective MIS. We have a data collection system in place (PACS data is
collected for the Dossier which is being published by NABARD regularly). But data has not been forthcoming which
necessitated work on designing MIS. With lack of computerisation at PACS level, this was not forthcoming. NABARD
cannot be blamed for this.
Bank team's response: Noted, explanation modified to pinpoint specific issues.
Page 21, Para 42
"This activity aimed at providing capacity building to the agencies responsible for data collection and reporting,
through strengthening their data gathering and compilation systems, as well as the skills of the staff that
undertake this activity. Despite the difficulties in getting the data, the project implementation did not focus its
resources on such support."
68


﻿We are not sure whether capacity building for M & E were reviewed in the earlier Implementation missions and
the observations sent to Gol/NABARD. The issue is not of the skills of implementation but lack of systems that at
PACS level. See para above

However, as per the available data, on credit flow to small and marginal farmers, there is substantial improvement in the

@ Cooperative banks as a whole in the country.
PaUe 22 Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes:-
Members education of PACS was repeatedly.................But the attention paid under the project was lower than
expected....
Efforts were initiated in this regard by the implementing agency in a few selected states including in WB assisted states vis.,
Haryana & U.P.
Monitoring and Evaluation Design -implementation and utilization:-
As pointed in the report, lack of availability of quality data with regard to the financial parameters of PACS was indeed a
constraint in the absence of an established accounting system and delay in computerization. The design of the monitoring
and evaluation had therefore. its limitations . (NABARD does not maintain comprehensive data on PACS and relying on the
NAFSCOB data might bring out inconsistencies when compared with other POD parameters collected directly from our R.Os
which needs to be kept in mind).

"This activity aimed at providing capacity building to the agencies responsible for data collection and reporting,

We are not sure whether capacity building for M & E were reviewed in the earlier Implementation missions and the
observations sent to Gol/NABARD. The issue is not of the skills of implementation but lack of systems that at PACS level.
See para above
Page 24 Para 46 (2.5) - Post-completion Operation/Next Phase-
"NABARD is currently facilitating the process of setting up a Core Banking Solution (CBS) platform, involving a total
of 200 SCB and DCCBs in 16 states and three Union Territories (UTs)."
The number is 205.

﻿Para 2.5 - Post-completion Operation/Next Phase -
"Subsequently, NABARD issued a circular to SCBs and DCCBs in July 2013, to provide guidance on decisions and
arrangements to be made in case that PACS were to become BCs".
May be corrected as "Subsequently, based on RBI's acceptance of the recommendation, NABARD issued a circular to
SCBs and DCCBs in July 2013, to provide guidance on decisions and arrangements to be made in case that PACS were to
become Bcs".
Page 26 Impact of the revival package on the governance of the sector (Highly satisfactory)
The revival package paved the way for the much needed revision of the legal frame work........the CS act were amended in
23 states and not in 21 states as reported.
.       ..........In the area of audit the CSA  mandate .............
Our comments:-Although the audit was in arrears in many PACs , it is worth mentioning in this context that the management
committee of NABARD had approved a scheme of incentive for clearance of audit in PACs that evoked response and the
audit in many states were brought up to date.
CRAR
Finally considerable progress was made under the revival package in harmonizing capacity building
measures....     ......
It would be worth mentioning the effort of NABARD in the capacity building of the STCCS. Developing the 9 modules by
its own faculty and also facing the challenge of training around 2 lakh STCCS personnel by a new and innovative method of
cascading of trainers viz. Master trainers at State level, and district level trainers could help leverage the training of the cross
section of STCCS personnel..Further harnessing the training infrastructure of the STCs and also of the national level training
institutes like Vamnicom, ICMs and RICMs. was achieved for the first time to reach the unusual number within the shortest
span of time.
Page 27, Box 1, Reforming the Cooperative Societies Act- the example of Gujarat
The amendments are as per MoU and done in all 5 PS and the other 18 implementing states too.
Page 28, Para 56
"Furthermore, staged capital adequacy norms for DCCBs and SCBs were introduced, requiring these two tiers to
eventually reach a CRAR of 9 percent by 2016/17".
CRAR norms have been applicable for licensing. As on date, 4% CRAR is the requirement. The Expert Committee has
recommended that CRAR requirement may be raised to 9% by 2017, which is under consideration of RBI. Hence this
sentence may be redrafted.
Page 29 Footnote 37 -
"With the exception of the PACS in Odisha, where the boards were superseded with view to not fulfilling the
requirements of the 97th Constitutional Amendment".
Observation factually incorrect. The supercession was done to ensure proportional representation of weaker sections and
women. 97th amendment came much later.
Page 30 Impact of the reforms on the viability of the sector:-
The report has exhaustively dealt the impact in the area of CRAR,recovery etc.
There were initial expectation that unviable entities would be liquidated or merged with profitable PACS:-
Although the support missions have talked about the consolidation/liquidation of unviable PACS, the MOU under the
project provided only for formulating a concrete road map for the unviable PACs and not necessarily their closure,
considering other socio political factors and also the same being purely at the domain and discretion of the Government of the
70


﻿PS. Much progress has been made in this regard in all the implementing states except in WB. as could be seen in Table 3 in
annexure -ni
Page 33 Para 67 Some of the underlying problems in the area of loan recovery are:
*   Shortcomings in the lending products and loan evaluation schemes: Loans from PACS tend to offer.......
borrower.
The lending portfolio of the PACS consists of short term loans as a major component and not of longer maturities as reported
in the report. PACs have little freedom in this aspect in as much as the major chunk of the crop loan (-%) is serviced by the
STCCs being the last resort for the farmers and also based on the GOI policy on farm credit. Further the credit repayment
capacity of the farmer is influenced by multifarious dynamic factors like, Monsoon, price of commodities etc.
Impact of the debt waiver on the repayment culture:
The comment with regard to the debt waiver scheme that it was 5 to 8 times larger than the amount disbursed under the
revival package is not factually correct. The total amount disbursed  under Agriculture Debt Waiver and Debt
Relief Scheme for the cooperative banks was to the tune of Rs.22125 crores that works out to hardly 2.5 times of the amount
released.
Page 31 Footnote 46
"The recapitalization mechanism foresaw that the recapitalization would be used to pay back the outstanding loans
from PACS to DCCBs, so the DCCBs were allowed to deduct the overdue loan portfolio from the amount of
recapitalization funds that the PACS were to receive".
The DCCB/SCB necessarily credit the account of the PACS with the entire Recapitalisation Assistance amount and then
recovered the dues of PACS to DCCB as on 31 March 2004 (as shown in the audited balance sheet of the PACS).
Page 32 Footnote 48 -
"Such entities are expected to be phased out of the financial system in line with the gradual strengthening of the
prudential norms that RBI has introduced (Requiring a minimum CRAR of 4 percent by 2013, and consecutively 7
percent by 2014/15 and 9 percent by 2016/17)"
P1 see comments at Sl. 10 above.
Page 34 Para 70 The margins from the crop loans decreased from 5.75 percent in 2005 to now 2.5 percent for the
system together.
The Statement that the margin from the crop loan has decreased for the cooperative system as a whole from 5.75% to
2.5% is not true. The refinance to the cooperatives at the rate of 4.5% give a margin of 2.5% to the system as a whole.
This along with the interest subvention of Gol at the rate of 2% and the interest subvention by the State Govt. even a
lower rate of 1% makes the margin at 5.5%. (The interest subvention given by the participating states ranges from 1
% to 4 %).
Bank team's response: Noted. The statements stand corrected.
Page 39 The M&E implementation faced challenges on timeliness, quality and consistency of data:-
NABARD as an implementing agency of the project had left no stones unturned for collection of data and furnishing to the
WB . However the system did not provide for a database of PACS due to sheer lack of data at the PACs level mainly due to
lack of man power in many states. Further data on PACS on the basic POD indicators were provided for each support
mission and there was no requirement of a periodical flow of such data at lesser intervals and therefore was not attempted.
Standard formats for data collection from PACs through the respective regional offices was made and no efforts were spared
in this regard with the only exception of W.B. during the last support mission due to the specific nature of problem with
regard to computerization in the state of WB .
Bank team's response: Noted. NABARD's role is recognized.

﻿"The CSAs in 21 states were adapted (including in all five states supported by the Bank) to introduce enhanced
governance regimes in the sector and eliminate / reduce the potential influence of the government in their
management (checks and balance)".
Number is 23.
Page 41 The Performance of NABARD has been Moderately Satisfactory.
"However, there were also aspects were more could have been achieved - for instance on member education and data
measurement, review and analysis - and there were gaps that existed in the M&E and fiduciary framework as
discussed above".
Regarding data measurement, pl see comments at Sl.No.5.
Regarding member education, a proposal was drafted by us. It is pending with Gol. So this observation against NABARD is
not justified.
Page 41 Implementing agency or Agencies' performance:-
While rating the performance of NABARD , the report take reservation to 2 areas that could have been achieved more.viz.
Member education and data review and analysis. The report also states about the gaps in M&E and fiduciary framework that
lead to the rating to moderately satisfactory.
While the member education programme had limitations as the same was not part of the financial package and consequently
suffered from lack of resources, efforts were made in initiating the awareness creation of the members of PACs through
literature and palm lets in selected states. Data management had its own limitations considering the sheer lack of data at
PACs level since the MIS could not be taken off which hampered the data compilation at PACs level . It is worth observing
that the data at DCCB and SCB level were analyzed and made available to the world bank/ GOI as per requirement. The
observation with regard to the monitoring and evaluation needs to be a point that finds a place in the lessons learned since
there were inherent limitations being a maiden project of its kind.
Bank team's response: The Bank acknowledges the many positives but in line with internal guidelines, retains the ratings.
Lessons learned:-
Comments:-
While the first 3 points are of course eye openers for a future project of this kind the 4th one viz capacity building of the
Board need not find a place here since the Capacity building of the members of the BOARD of PACS/DCCBS was one of the
most successful modules under the project that evoked excellent response. The vast number of BOARD of directors that was
trained and the content and coverage of this module would speak on this point. As regards reaching the members at their door
step the cascading effect of the training system had taken care of this aspect to a great extend and location and institution
specific training were also conducted under the package as sufficient freedom was given to the Regional offices and the
Training establishments in this regard.
Bank team's response: Added.
Annexures:-
Page 42 Despite available project funds for strengthening ......   ...........no dedicated training and capacity
building was actually provided...
The observation that the project implementation did not focus its resources on providing capacity building for the agencies
responsible for data collection is far from truth....Two of the 9 modules under the Project was on CAs /MIS . Not only the
STCCS personnel were trained on these module, even the departmental auditors were also imparted training on this module,
the end of which was uniform accounting and adoption of management information system. Refresher programs on CAS/MIs
was also imparted to strengthen the system and which indeed paved the way for better Book keeping across the PACs.
However the data collection and maintenance was hampered by the abrupt end of the package and consequent deferment of
the implementation of the core software. It may be recalled that the PACS in Haryana that adopted the core software could
provide the data on various businesss parameters to the satisfaction of the team members of the IX support mission. So it was
the delay in completion of the computerization that hampered the data management at the PACs level.

Comments against Odisha: Prior to the 97th Constitutional Amendment, elected boards were in place in the SCB and
DCCBs. In 2012, however, the boards were superseded with view to not complying with the Constitutional
Amendment. They are currently managed by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) nominated Committees.
Elections are expected in 2014.
The boards of the cooperatives were superceded in 2012, to ensure proportionate representation of weaker sections including
women. The 97h amendment to the Constitution has incorporated representation of weaker sections on the boards of the
cooperatives. Elections are expected in 2014.
