This paper proceeds with the reallocation of\n            proceeds and change in the target level of one performance\n            indicator.

Thus, US$30 million of IDA credit and US$30\n            million of IBRD proceeds will be reallocated from the\n            Information Technology (IT) component to the Financial\n            Restructuring Support (FRS) component."}, "docdt": "2011-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
