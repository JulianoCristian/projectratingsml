                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will assist in providing members of the credit cooperative banks (CCBs), including small and marginal farmers, with significantly enhanced access to formal
                         finance (credit, savings, etc.), by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the Participating States are transformed into efficient and commercially sustainable

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The assessment of the PDOs is Moderately Satisfactory and Implementation Progress (IP) remains Satisfactory. In the Bank-funded states, there appears to be overall progress on
                         the attainment of the PDOs including recovery rates, credit growth, outreach to small and marginal farmers, and conduct of elections. There is improving, although mixed,
                         performance of profitability, although this is recovering from the impact of the debt waiver program, and will improve significantly with the inflows of state and central government
