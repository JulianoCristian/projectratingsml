                         The project will assist in providing members of the credit cooperative banks (CCBs), including small and marginal farmers, with significantly enhanced access
                         to formal finance (credit, savings, etc.), by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the Participating States are transformed into efficient and commercially
                         sustainable institutions
