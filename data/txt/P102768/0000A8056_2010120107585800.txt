                         Project development objective Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3

                          The project will help to provide members of the rural cooperative credit system (CCS), including marginal and small farmers (the poorest groups in rural India),
                         with significantly enhanced access to formal finance (credit, savings, etc.), by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the participating states (PS) are
                         transformed into efficient and commercially sustainable institutions.
