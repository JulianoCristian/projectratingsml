                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project helps to provide members of the rural cooperative credit system (CCS), including marginal and small farmers (the poorest groups in rural India), with
                         significantly enhanced access to formal finance (credit, savings, etc.), by ensuring that the potentially viable CCBs in the participating states (PS) are transformed into
                         efficient and commercially sustainable institutions.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         An update on project achievements and remaining challenges comes against the back-drop of the recently approved 12 month project extension from June 30, 2012 to June 30,
                         2013. The assessment of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) is Moderately Satisfactory, and the rating for Implementation Progress(IP) has been downgraded to
                         Moderately Satisfactory from Satisfactory. The rating for IP has been lowered because project implementation has slowed pending government review of proposals for the allocation

                         Support (FRS) components remain.

                         At the same time, it is important to note that in Bank-funded states, it appears that good progress is being made in terms of overall credit growth, outreach to small and marginal

                         but this will improve significantly after the inflows of capitalization comes from the central government. There has also been significant progress across all states in terms of results
                         indicators and project benchmark activities. (Benchmark activities are a series of wide-ranging legal and institutional reforms which form the basis of all support by the Government).
                         The main implementation challenges in each of the 5 Bank-funded states revolve around the IT component and completion of all remaining benchmark activities that are linked to
                         recapitalization under the Financial Restructuring Support (FRS) component. One state (Gujarat) has completed all benchmark activities, and two others (UP and West Bengal) have
                         only one remaining activity before they will have completed the full set of legal and governance reforms set out by the Government, and which is a condition of recapitalization.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The team’s view remains that full project implementation can be attained. However, a strong push to finalize any remaining benchmark activities at the state level and a renewed
                         dialogue between the participating states and the Government will be important. The provision of resources for the FRS and the IT components to be initiated in states where the
                         procurement process has been stalled, is key for the credibility of the program, and its sustainability.
