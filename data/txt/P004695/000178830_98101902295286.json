about 19,000 villages by\n            1983. Under the project, electricity will reach an estimated\n            675,000 households and a population of about 5 million\n            spread over about 3,825 villages in 16 provinces in the\n            Northeast, and about 740 villages in 4 provinces (Chiang\n            Mai, Nakhon Sawan, Chonburi, and Songkhla), located\n            respectively in the Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern\n            regions of Thailand. The project villages have been selected\n            because of their high population density, their proximity to\n            roads and power lines and their role as market and service\n            centers for the surrounding less populated and comparatively\n            remote villages. The project includes (a) construction of\n            1,660 km of 22/33 kv 3 phase main primary lines and 9,820 km\n            of 22 kv, 1 phase primary line taps; (b) 2,030 km of the\n            existing 3 phase 22 kv primary lines to be replaced with new\n            conductors; (c) construction of 7,340 km of secondary lines\n            (460/230v); (d) installation of 5,370 distribution\n            transformers, 381,300 kwh meters, 31,000 streetlights; and\n            (e) supply of lightening arrestors, fuses, switches, feeder\n            reclosures and the necessary vehicles."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
