It was never declared effective because the reform\n            program in Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) (affecting two\n            thirds of the loan) was not fully implemented in the\n            aftermath of the Board approval. Once it became clear that\n            the efforts to restructure the operation in late 2005/ early\n            2006 would not succeed, SOSAC II was allowed to expire at\n            the end of June 2006 after the extended effectiveness\n            deadline was not met. SOSAC II had a troubled history almost\n            from the very beginning. The operation was originally\n            negotiated in 2002. However, the Government authorities\n            failed to sign the Minutes of Negotiations and the project\n            could not be presented to the Board in June 2002. The\n            Minutes of Negotiation were signed in April 2004 and the\n            operation was presented to and approved by the Board in June\n            2004. However, there was further delay because the operation\n            failed to get ratified by the Parliament of FBH. Final\n            efforts to reinvigorate the process to enable the operation\n            to be declared effective did not succeed as the Bank and the\n            Government could not reach agreement on the medium-term\n            expenditure framework for social assistance."}, "docdt": "2007-01-03T00:00:00Z"}
