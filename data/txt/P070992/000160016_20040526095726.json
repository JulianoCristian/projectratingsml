    cash transfer and labor programs and institutions in\n            Bosnia-Herzegovina--which reorient social protection towards\n            programs that protect the poorest and most disabled in a\n            fiscally sustainable manner. This is consistent with broader\n            efforts to reduce public spending and focus it on priority\n            needs, and to address regional imbalances within each\n            Entity. These objectives are key elements of the recently\n            approved Medium Term Development Strategy (PRSP).\n            Specifically, the priority program goals are to: (1) ensure\n            that protection for disabled veterans and survivor families\n            is better focused on the most disabled, while gradually\n            reducing public spending on veterans' programs; (2)\n            improve the impact and efficiency of the social safety net\n            for the poorest, in particular social welfare benefits and\n            services, including a strengthened role for the\n            non-government sector; (3) consolidate an appropriate\n            institutional structure for employment services at State and\n            Entity levels, and reorient active labor policies to\n            increase cost effectiveness, transparency and employment\n            outcomes; (iv) improve the efficiency and equity of pension\n            and disability programs, including pensions policy\n            harmonization between the Entities of BH; and (v) ensure\n            that social policy reforms are done on the basis of better\n            information, within the system and to the public, and that\n            living standards monitoring is  more effective and timely."}, "docdt": "2004-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
