The\n            Bank responded very quickly to Government\u0092s request for\n            emergency assistance. The Bank's Resident Mission, as\n            part of the local consultation group of donors, made\n            preliminary assessments of the flood damage and with\n            assistance from headquarters staff. The Government, having\n            handled emergency operations previously, quickly geared into\n            action after the 1988 floods and made quick assessments of\n            the damage. Recognizing the need for external assistance,\n            the Government agencies, approached the donors with the\n            estimates of flood damage and request for aid. However, the\n            Government, particularly Planning Commission, was unable to\n            expedite the bureaucratic process of project approval and\n            fund release. Consequently implementation slowed down. There\n            are five key lessons learnt from project implementation.\n            These are: (a) government's lengthy project approval\n            and fund release procedures should be reduced to a very\n            minimum for emergency rehabilitation project; (b) devolution\n            of implementation responsibility to field staff expedites\n            project performance; (c) appointment of local consultants to\n            design and supervise projects improves quality of work; (d)\n            for multi-sectoral projects, IDA's supervision\n            responsibilities should be clearly delineated. Thus, while\n            for Bangladesh it is appropriate to have primary\n            responsibility in the Resident Mission, where an appropriate\n            person can be identified to be task manager, there should be\n            clear understanding and budgetary arrangements for back-up\n            support from HQ, particularly for components requiring\n            specialized technical staff; and (e) attention should be\n            given to possible adverse environmental impacts of flood\n            control projects."}, "docdt": "1997-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
