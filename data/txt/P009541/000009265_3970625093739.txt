BANGLADESH
THIRD FLOOD REHABILITATION (EMERGENCY) PROJECT
(CR.2048-BD)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Flood Rehabilitation
(Emergency) Project in Bangladesh, for whichl Credit 2048-BD in the amount of SDR 102.8
million equivalent to US$133.6 million was approved on1 June 27, 1989. The Credit was made
effective on August 18, 1989.
All components of the Credit, other than the RHD component, required the first extension
from June 30, 1992, to June 30, 1993. BWDB, BIWTA, BTTB and ED components required a
second extension to June 30, 1994; and there was a further extension limited to the BTTB
component only to December 31, 1994. Disbursement was 98% of the total Credit amount. The
last date of disbursement was February 22, 1995.
The ICR was prepared by the staff of the World Bank's Resident Mission and
consultantsI in consultation with the Program Officers2 involved in the implementation of the
various components. The ICR is based on field visits and records available in the project files in
the Resident Mission. The Borrower contributed to its preparation by commenting on the draft
ICR and preparing its own evaluation of the major component under this Project.
The ICR mission comprised of W. Huq, S.A.M. Rafiquzzaman (IDA) and W.K. Cross and
R.K. Chowdhury (Consultants)

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
THIRD FLOOD REHABILITATION (EMERGENCY) PROJECT
(CR.2048-BD)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
].    IDA's assistance in disaster rehabilitation projects dates back to 1972. The Third Flood
Rehabilitation project is the fourth in the series of emergency projects. Assistance under this
project was provided in the wake of the 1988 floods. This project was designed and implemented
as part of the Government of Bangladesh's (GOB) emergency programs to restore flood damaged
infrastructure.
Project Objectives
2.     The main objective of the project was to restore priority infrastructure damaged in the
floods to promote efficient operation of the economy. The major components of the project were
flood control, drainage, roads, primary schools, inland water transport and telecommunication.
The project was implemented by six government agencies: Bangladesh Water Development
Board (BWDB); Education Division of the Ministry of Education (ED); Local Government
Engineering Department (LGED); Roads and Highways Department (RHD); Bangladesh Inland
Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) and Bangladesh Telephones and Telegraph Board (BTTB).
3.     The scope of work of the project was as follows: rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and
flood control structures; repair and some reconstruction of primary schools; repair of inland water
transport facilities; rehabilitation of rural roads, highways and associated structures like bridges,
culverts; and replacement of navigation aids and telecommunication facilities.
Implementation Experience
4.     The project was prepared and implemented in line with the Bank's Operational Directive
for emergency assistance.  It met the objectives of rehabilitating the flood damage to the
infrastructure. The Credit was declared effective on August 18, 1989, 37 days after signing.
Foreign and local consultants were engaged to assess the flood damage which were reviewed by
the appraisal mission.
5.     Overall project implementation was slow but the quality of work was satisfactory. The
original Credit closing date was June 30, 1092. This date was extended twice. All components
other than RHD required the first extension from June 30, 1992 to June 30, 1993. BWDB,
BIWTA, BTTB and ED components required a second extension to June 30, 1994; and there was
a further extension limited to the BTTB component only to December 31, 1994.
6.     Project implementation was mainly hampered by delay in project approval by GOB, lack
of GOB's counterpart funds in the initial project period, slow release of funds and delay in
ii



procurement. These are generic project implementation issues in Bangladesh. The delays would
probably have been longer had some time-saving practices not been adopted by the implementing
agencies. These measures were: allowing the field officials of the project agencies to award
contracts and application of sole source procedures for procurement of some equipment.
7.     Total disbursements from the Credit was SDR 110.1 million which is 98% of the Credit
amount. Due to exchange rate fluctuations and lower than estimated contract prices, an amount
equivalent to SDR 1.7 million was canceled.
Sustainability
8.     The project's objectives of restoring infrastructure to pre-flood conditionis have been
achieved. In some cases, the restored infrastructure was better than the pre-flood standard.
However, unless structures are maintained regularly, these will not last long. A major problem
with most government agencies, except LGED and RHD, is the lack of adequate funding and lack
of interest among the officials to focus on routine O&M. This is the focus of ongoing IDA
assistance, specially in agriculture and social sectors.
Lessons Learnt
9.     There are five key lessons learnt from  project implementation. These are: (a)
Government's lengthy project approval and fund release procedures should be reduced to a very
minimum for emergency rehabilitation project; (b) devolution of implementation responsibility to
field staff expedites project performance; (c) appointment of local consultants to design and
supervise projects improves quality of work; (d) for multi-sectoral projects, IDA's supervision
responsibilities should be clearly delineated. Thus, while for Bangladesh it is appropriate to have
primary responsibility in the Resident Mission, where an appropriate person can be identified to
be task manager, there should be clear understanding and budgetary arrangements for back-up
support from HQ, particularly for components requiring specialized technical staff; and (e)
attention should be given to possible adverse environmental impacts of flood control projects.

A. BACKGROUND
1.    Most of Bangladesh is a low-lying alluvial plain prone to flooding from both heavy
monsoon rainfall and the snow-melt surges of two of the world's largest rivers - the Brahmaputra
(Jamuna) and the Ganges (Padma). High ocean tides and cyclones also cause serious flooding in
the coastal areas in the south. Poor drainage systems add to the annual flooding. About half of
the country is vulnerable to annual flooding ranging from a depth of 30 cm, at the minimum, to as
high as 1-4 meters. The country's farming system is adapted to the normal flooding which is also
beneficial as the aquifers are recharged and soil fertility is enhanced through deposition of the silt
brought by the floods.
2.    Two unusually severe floods occurred in 1987 and 1988. The floods in 1988, which
peaked in August-September, surpassed all previous records in terms of its severity and the extent
of damage caused to the country. The simultaneous rise of the water levels in the three major
rivers - Jamuna, Padma and Meghna caused the floods. Normally, the rivers peak a month apart
from each other. High spring tides also intensified the problem. It was estimated that 53 out of
the 64 districts of the country, and about 45 million out of a population of 110 million were
affected. Damage occurred to infrastructure and equipment in: (a) roads; (b) flood control,
drainage, irrigation; (c) schools; (d) inland water transport; and (e) telecommunication.
3.    In November 1988, a joint Government of Bangladesh (GOB)/ United Nations (UN) Task
Force prepared a report on the flood damages for the special meeting of the UN General
Assembly. The report contained a preliminary estimate of flood reconstruction and rehabilitation
costs (excluding housing) of US$1.1 billion. Together with damages to rural housing and the
Dhaka city flood protection scheme, total reconstruction, rehabilitation and flood protection were
estimated at US$2.2 billion. Subsequently, at the donor coordination meeting in December 1988,



US$514 million worth of assistance was pledged by various donors. (This figure excludes
financing of damages to private housing and agricultural losses.) Of this amount, up to US$114
million was expected to be covered from the surplus and unallocated amounts under ongoing
credits. IDA's assistance through various projects, including the Credit, amounted to US$224.7
million.
4.    IDA's flood assistance strategy responds to Bangladesh's needs for flood rehabilitation
and flood control and preparedness over the short, medium and long-term. IDA's short-term
strategy in response to the 1987 and 1988 floods, has included reallocation of funds under
ongoing credits, expansion in the scope of planned new operations to include finding for
rehabilitation and preparation of "free standing" credits for flood rehabilitation. IDA medium-
term  strategy consists of ensuring continlued fundinig for essential flood rehabilitationi and
prevention work and providing overall coordination of donor flood rehabilitation efforts. IDA's
long-term strategy is to support and help coordinate efforts to examine technically and
economically feasible long-term measures to mitigate the severity of Bangladesh flooding
problem.
5.     The Third Flood Rehabilitation Project was the Bank's fourth "free standing" emergency
project to rehabilitate damages caused by floods and cyclones. In 1972, the Coastal Area
Rehabilitation and Cyclone Protection Project (Credit 339-BD) was the first (US$25.0 M) in the
series of flood and cyclone rehabilitation projects. The second was, the First Flood Rehabilitation
Project, which commenced in 1985 to assist in the rehabilitation of the damages caused by the
1984 floods. Following the 1987 floods, the Second Flood Rehabilitation Project, the third in the
series, was implemented.
6.     The Third Flood Rehabilitation Project aimed at providing emergency assistance in the
rehabilitation and/or replacement of priority elements of infrastructure and equipment in the target
sub-sectors. The area covered by the project extended to 53 out of 64 districts of Bangladesh.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
7.     The primary objective was to quickly restore the efficient operation of the country's
economy by rehabilitating/replacing the priority infrastructure damaged by the floods. It also
aimed to minimize the risks of damage or loss from future floods, through appropriate design and
location of works and equipment. The project was to achieve these objectives through the
following activities:
(a)    restoration, by Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), of irrigation,
drainage and flood protection works, including the compacted filling of
embankment breaches; the re-sectioning, strengthening and protecting the
damaged embankments. retiring the embankments where existing locations are
no longer safe; repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed water control
structures; and the reconstruction of town protection works including gauges,
sheet piling, brick matressing, boulder and cement block revetments, and flood
walls.
(b)    restoration, by Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and Local Government
Engineering Department (LGED), of roads and associated structures, including:
2



compacted filling of embankment breaches; resectioning, strengthening and
protecting the eroded embankments; reconstruction of the damaged culverts,
bridges and retaining walls, restoration of road shoulders; repair and
strengthening of damaged pavement; and the construction of additional drainage
and culverts in flood damages areas.
(c)    provision of furniture and equipment and reconstruction and repair of primary
schools to permanent standards by the Education Division of the Ministry of
Education (ED);
(d)    acquisition, by Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), of
navigational aids, hydrographic surveys, dredging and water gauging equipment
and vessels spares to replace the flood damaged equipment, including: steel
lantern buoys, mooring gears, dredger pipes, shore beacon markers, gauges and
recorders; acquisition of a buoy tender vessel, a crane boat and tug boat; repair of
flood damaged ferry docks and related structures, cargo jetties, passenger jetties,
port facilities and pontoons, including replacement of mooring shackles;
(e)    repair and replacement of telecommunication facilities byBangladesh Telephone
and Telecommunications Board (BTTB).
8.     Later, rehabilitation of coastal embankment and shore protection works was included as a
component to mitigate the damages caused to these structures by the April 1991 cyclone.

9.     The project was designed to help expedite restoration to pre-flood condition of priority
infrastructure, such as the road and waterway networks; the drainage, irrigation and flood control
system; and primary school facilities in specific regions of the country. The project was prepared
by the Bank's Resident Mission with assistance from the headquarters, based on the damage
assessments made by the participating agencies. Its design and concept were appropriate and
timely.
10.    As the project was an emergency operation, normal project preparation and appraisal
procedures were not followed. Agreement was reached with the Borrower that the selection of
rehabilitation works by the implementing agencies would be subject to the following criteria: (a)
repairs to be undertaken would be significant, and a consequence of the 1987 and 1988 floods, or
works which if not undertaken would seriously reduce the effectiveness of other flood damage
being repaired under the project; (b) reconstruction work would restore structures to their original
specifications to ensure optimal performiianice; (c) other sources of finance were not available;
and (d) the works and goods have been approved by the supervising consultants employed under
the Project.
11.    Consultants were employed by four implementing agencies (BWDB, RHD, LGED and
BIWTA) to do the following: (a) validate the agencies' and UN task forces' assessment of
damages; (b) identify works and goods to be included in the project; and (c) subsequently
provide techlical assistance and monitor implementation. In the case of assessments of the
damages to the primary schools which were located in remote areas, it was agreed that the
3



Upazila Parishads3 under the supervision of LGED and local consultants would assess the
damage, prepare action plans for the rehabilitation and reconstruction and monitor the
implementation. Later, the Bank appraised the action plans on the basis of the implementation
capacity of the ED. BTTB's assessment of the overall damage to the telecommunication facilities
was considered excessive. A consulting firm, financed under the Australian Trust Fund, was
engaged to prioritize and finalize the rehabilitation activities in the sector.
12.    Without IDA's assistance, it would have been quite difficult for the country with limited
resources to rehabilitate the damaged infrastructure within a reasonable period of time. Based on
the experiences with earlier disaster financing operations, the project was designed to be
implemented directly by BWDB, RHD, LGED, BIWTA, BTTB. LGED was also responsible for
rehabilitating the primary schools under ED. The roles of the agencies were clearly delineated in
the project.
13.    During review of the project's Yellow Cover Memorandum  of the President and
Technical Annex, it was concluded that assurance was needed that the whole spectrum of
environmental and hydrological issues pertaining to flood control should be included in the
project studies. But these studies were not done. It is possible that due to the emergency nature
of the project and the urgency of rehabilitating flood control infrastructure, the environmental
impacts could not be given adequate attention. Nevertheless, the adverse environmental impacts
of flood control projects on fisheries and agriculture were generally of concern in Bangladesh
during the late 1980s when the project became effective and attention should have been given to
these concerns in the design and reconstruction of flood control structures.
D. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
14.    Overall implementation progress was slow but quality of work was good. The Credit
closing date was extended twice from the original closing date of June 30, 1992. All components
other than RHD required the first extension from June 30, 1992 to June 30, 1993; BWDB,
BIWTA, BTTB and ED components required a second extension to June 30, 1994; and there was
a further extension limited to the BTTB component only to December 31, 1994, for taking
delivery of goods.
15.   Implementation of the components was impeded due to three major factors: (a) delay in
obtaining approval from the Planning Commission; (b) lack of GOB's counterpart fund in the
initial project period4; (c) slow release of fund; and (d) delay in procurement. These are generic
implementation issues in Bangladesh.
16.   Implementation of BWDB-executed component was initially delayed due to late release
of funds which led to delays in bid invitation and award of contract. Despite the initial delay, the
component was satisfactorily completed by the revised Credit closing date of June 30, 1993.
BWDB component included repair work to the Patenga embankment to protect Chittagong
Export Processing Zone. The repair had been partially completed when the cyclone of April
1991 caused further damage to the embankment. A decision was taken to transfer the repair work
3 Administrative unit of local government which is now abolished.
4With GOB's improved revenue mobilization efforts from early-1990, counterpart funds are not a problem
for high priority projects.
4



to the Priority Works Program (PWP) which was initiated with IDA's assistance to rehabilitate
the embankments damaged by the cyclone. For this purpose SDR 3.6 million from this Credit
and SDR 12.8 million from three other IDA credits (Cr. 1467-BD, 1784-BD and 1870-BD) and a
Yen 2.7 billion Japanese grant were allocated to the Priority Works Program (PWP), for which a
separate ICR dated September 16, 1996, has been issued.
17.    The reconstruction and repair of the primary schools was initially delayed due to delay in
approval of the Project Concept Paper5 (PCP) by the Planning Commission which resulted in late
availability of counterpart funds from GOB. However, all the works were completed by the
revised Credit closing date of June 30, 1994. There was a saving of SDR 1.44 million in this
component, of which 0.8 million was reallocated to the components executed by BTTB.
18.   Implementation of the components executed by LGED was also delayed due to late
approval of the PCP, late release of counterpart funds and delay in the appointment of
consultants. There were also delays in the procurement of motorcycles. However by June 1993
all the works were completed by LGED.
19.    The implementation of the inland water transport component by BIWTA was initially
delayed due to the late appointment of the consultants and release of fund. However BIWTA was
able to complete the procurement of all goods except the buoy tender vessel, by June 30, 1993.
The procurement of buoys was completed by June 30, 1994.
20.   Implementation of the telecommunication component by BTTB also suffered from the
problems of delayed approval of PCP, release of counterpart funds, and appointment of
consultants. The delay in obtaining Planning Commission's approval of the component and mid-
term changes in the scope of the component slowed project implementation. Major
implementation problems were faced with the reconstruction of the cyclone damaged earth
satellite station which was included in the project after the 1991 cyclone. Appointment of the
foreign consultants for evaluating the tender documents was delayed. Moreover, BTTB was not
able to identify, on time, the need for other supplementary equipment to make the operation of the
earth satellite station more efficient. BTTB has requested INTELSAT to finance the procurement
of this equipment.
21.    The delays mentioned above would probably have been longer had some time-saving
practices not been adopted by the implementing agencies. The responsibility to award contracts
were devolved to the field officials of the agencies. This was successfully done with assistance
from national consultants. The agencies also procured some equipment which were needed
urgently through sole source procurement procedures.
22.    Disbursements of the Credit over the project period are set out in Part II. Disbursements
for outstanding commitments continued till December 31, 1994. Of the total Credit amount of
SDR 102.8 million, the amount disbursed was SDR 101.1 million. Due to exchange rate
fluctuation and lower than estimated contract prices, an amount equivalent to SDR 1.7 million
was canceled.
5This is the initial project proposal prepared by the implementing agencies for approval by the country's
highest project approving authority - Executive Committee for National Economic Council (ECNEC).
ECNEC is composed of Cabinet ministers and headed by the Finance Minister.
5



23.    The ICR estimate of the quantities and costs of civil works, equipment and consultancy
services is very close to the estimates made during the project preparation. This is so because in
the President's Memorandum for this Project, there were no physical targets specified. The
implementing agencies, particularly BWDB, used an overall target for its budget for flood
damage repair.
E. PROJECT RESULTS
24.   The project's development objective has been achieved, albeit with some delay. The
project successfully restored the priority infrastructure damaged by the floods of 1987 and 1988
to their original specification. In some cases they were restored to better standards either through
replacement of damaged structure and/or addition to the existing ones. However, the two years
delay in completing the repair and reconstruction works indicates that the objective of urgent and
emergency restoration was not fully achieved.
F. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
25.    The sustainability of a project of this type depends on the proper maintenance of the
infrastructure restored, and equipment procured, under the project. All agencies except LGED
and RHD have inadequate operation and maintenance budgets. LGED and RHD have developed
a system for carrying out routine and periodic maintenance. LGED's field-based staff are
responsible for carrying out regular maintenance of the infrastructure. The maintenance work of
the roads constructed by RHD is undertaken by prequalified contractors, thus eliminating
inexperienced contractors and improving the quality of work. As a result of IDA efforts to make
BWDB more conscious about the need for proper maintenance, it has produced an O&M plan
which is attached as Appendix B to this ICR. The ED's maintenance budget has been increased.
The maintenance budget is administered by the school management committee and the
maintenance work is supervised by the Thana Education Committee headed by the chief
executive officer of the Thana administration. BIWTA and BTTB suffer from problems of
inefficient management which results among other things in inadequate maintenance. The recent
focus of the new projects financed by IDA and other donors is on1 improved O&M.
G. BANK PERFORMANCE
26.    The Bank responded very quickly to Government' s request for emergency assistance.
The Bank's Resident Mission, as part of the local consultation group of donors, made preliminary
assessments of the flood damage and with assistance from headquarters staff. As the operation
was of urgent nature, the Bank saved time by not following the conventional project preparation
and appraisal procedures. As a major development partner, it was only appropriate that IDA
extend assistance for emergency rehabilitation to a country which sustained heavy losses due to
flood.
27.    Except one component, the Bank's supervision of the project was however not adequate.
Since supervision responsibility for agriculture projects is delegated to the Agriculture Unit of the
Resident Mission, the BWDB component of this project was supervised regularly by the
Agriculture Unit in conjunction with other projects. However, for other components, supervision
6



responsibility was not well-defined. Those components were supervised by relevant RMB staff
and HQ staff when HQ staff were in the field for other missions. Consequently, such missions
lacked multi-disciplinary expertise needed for proper supervision of this project.  Poor
implementation of the telecommunication component indicates that supervision missions should
have included appropriate technical staff to advise BTTB. For components requiring specialized
staff, such as telecommunications and inland water transport, joint supervision with appropriate
skill-mix from the Bank's headquarters and Resident Mission should have been arranged.
H. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
28.    The Government, having handled emergency operations previously, quickly geared into
action after the 1988 floods and made quick assessments of the damage. Recognizing the need
for external assistance, the Government agencies, approached the donors with the estimates of
flood damage and request for aid. However, the Government, particularly Planning Commission,
was unable to expedite the bureaucratic process of project approval and fund release.
Consequently implementation slowed down.
29.    Overall performance in project management by the implementing agencies was mixed.
RHD and LGED completed the project activities within the first extension, i.e., by June 30, 1993.
BWDB completed most of its activities (other than the additional work added following the 1991
cyclone) by June 30, 1993.  ED. being a non-technical organization, faced difficulty in
monitoring the activities of the project after the Upazila Parishad was abolished. BIWTA's tender
procedures took longer than the estimated time while BTTB's overall performance was less than
satisfactory.
30.    Despite the delay, the works executed by the implementing agencies was of standard
quality and was undertaken in accordance with design standards and construction specifications
agreed with IDA.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNT
31.    The five key lessons learnt from the implementation of project were the following:
(i)   in responding to emergencies, GOB (Planning Commission in particular)
needs to make a special effort to reduce its bureaucratic procedures for
project approval and fund release;
(ii)    devolution of implementation responsibility to the field staff of the
implementation agencies expedited project implementation;
(iii)   the experience with the appointment of local consultants to design and
supervise construction of the works has been positive. Acceptable
standards of construction were achieved and close site liaison between
the contractor and the consultant enabled quick resolution of problems;
(iv)    for future multisectoral projects, IDA's supervision responsibilities both
for overall project and for various components has to be clearly defined.
7



It would be appropriate in the case of Bangladesh to have primary
responsibility  in the Resident Mission  but there should be clear
understandings and budgetary arrangements for back-up support from
HQ, particularly for components requiring specialized technical staff,
and
(v)     for future reconstruction of flood control infrastructure, attention should
be given to possible adverse environmental impacts of flood control
projects on fisheries and inland water transport, or in transferring flood
damage to other areas.

APPENDIX-A: BWDB'S CONTRIBUTION TO ICR
BANGLADESH WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD
FINAL EVALUATION REPORT
ON
THIRD FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT
(IDA CREDIT NO.2048-BD: PART-A. BWDB)
Introduction
I.    This is final evaluation report of IDA aided"Third Flood Rehabilitation Project", Credit
No. 2048-BD for Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) component (part-A). The
credit with an amount of US$40271 million was made effective on 18-8-89. The Credit provided
fund for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the infrastructures damaged during the floods of
1987 and 1988 in order to restore the facilities to its original form.
Background Of The Project
2.    In the year 1987, a severe flood occurred in the country resulting large scale damages to a
number of BWDB's completed and on-going project. With a view to restore these damage infra-
structures to its original form by providing rehabilitation and reconstruction works, necessary
assessment of the damages were carried out by BWDB and categorized as: a) Short term Flood
Damage Rehabilitation (FDR) works to be completed in one year b) Long term Flood Damage
Rehabilitation (FDR) works to be completed more than one year. Accordingly, Government of
Bangladesh (GOB) approached International Development Agency (IDA) for providing
necessary assistance to execute these FDR works. Responding to GOB's request, IDA agreed to
extend assistance to the short term FDR works and provided US$6.9 million through Second
FDR project, Credit No. 1876-BD. effective on 18th March, 1988 and also provided US$41.90
million through a component of Second Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation
(SSFCD&I) project, Credit No. 11 84-BD for long term FDR works. In the first year of FDR (i.e.
in 1988), an unprecedented flood occurred in the month of Sept./88 and a cyclone of Nov./88
which caused extensive damages, once again, to the infrastructures of the BWDB's projects
jeopardizing the whole FDR program already set in motion.
3.    In view of these, the whole FDR program was re-assessed afresh by inclusion of damages
to already executed FDR works of 1987 flood, balance works of 1987 floods and fresh damages
of 1988 flood. Subsequently, GOB requested IDA for providing necessary Project Aid for the
rehabilitation of the above flood damaged infrastructures. Accordingly, IDA supervision Mission
visited the affected areas and submitted its"'Aide-Memoire" of Dec./88. As follow up to this, the
local Resident Mission Bangladesh (RMB) Mission again visited the affected areas and submitted
another "Aide-Memoire" in March-April/89. As per recommendation and finding of these"Aide-
Memoires", a final assessment report of 1988 flood damage was prepared by the three local
consultants, namely, M/s. Bangladesh Engineering and Technological Services (BETS),
Development Consulting Services Ltd. (DCS) and Bureau of Consulting Engineers Ltd. (BCE).
The total estimated cost of FDR works was US$98.47 million. IDA agreed to provide US$86.29
million in addition to US$8.72 million for balance FDR works already executed during 1987-'88.
27



So the total Project Aid requirement for this project was US$95.01 million (US$86.29 m +
US$8.72 in). Out of this, an amount of US$54.30 million was available from the existing IDA
Credit No. 1184-BD (Saving-US$5.50 m), Credit No. 1876-BD (US$6.90 m) and Credit No.
1870-BD Part-D (US$41.90 rn). Therefore., a further amount of US$40.71 million (US$95.01-
US$54.30 m) was required through a new 'Third Flood Rehabilitation Project", Credit No. 2048-
BD (Part-A). This credit was signed on July 7, 1989 with effective date on August 18, 1989.
This credit is complementary to other three IDA credits as above for the FDR project approved by
GOB as a single project in 1988 and revised in 1994. To facilitate smooth implementation of the
project, the FDR works were divided into five categories viz (I) Embankment (ii) Canal (iii)
Protective work (iv) Structure (v) Others. Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared with the
assistance of the consultants have earlier been sent to the World Bank.
Scope Of Work
4.     The Third Flood Rehabilitation works have four categories such as civil works,
Administration, Equipment and Consultancy services. Civil works consist of mainly repair and
rehabilitation of flood damaged embankments, protective works, irrigation and drainage systems
etc. Consultancy Services were required for the project as described in para 3. An index map
showing the location of Third Flood Rehabilitation project is attached.
Implementation Arrangements
5.     Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) under the Ministry of Water Resources
(MOWR) was responsible for implementation of the project. The works were organized through
Zonal Chief Engineers (CE), Circles under Superintending Engineer (SE) and Divisions under
Executive Engineer (EE). The design assistance were provided by BWDB's Ceiitral Design
offices and the consultants.  The project was monitored by the Superintending Engineer,
Monitoring- I under the guidance of Chief Engineer, Monitoring & Evaluation at the Board level.
Project Design
6.    It was prepared and processed as an emergency project following 1988 flood. Based on
the experience of the earlier flood damage restoration project, the initial assessment was done by
BWDB field units. It's design and implementation arrangement were appropriate and timely in
the given situation to restore the project performances. The project was a follow up of Second
Flood Rehabilitation (Cr. I 876-BD and 1870-BD, part-D).
Consultant
7.     The project works were implemented with the assistance of three local consulting firms
and two expatriate individual Consultants. The Consultant's scope of works include (a) make an
assessment of the damages, (b) to assist in the implementation of rehabilitation works. Besides,
two expatriate Consultants, one civil engineering Specialist and the other as river training
specialist were appointed for the project to work with the Chief Engineer, Monitoring &
Evaluation.

Operational Experience
10.    The project was originally planned for completion in three years (FY89-90 to FY 91-92).
The implementation was mostly (i.e. 99%) completed in June, 1993. Repair and maintenance
work based on operation status survey were carried out during Financial year (FY) 93-94. During
implementation of the project, a number of problems have been encountered. The remarkable
ones, among others were (a) Delay in possession of land (b) timely flow of local (GOB) fund (c)
delay in tender finalization and (d) 1991 cyclone in South West and flash flood in North East
region. However, steps have already been taken up by the concerned agencies of the Govt. To
streamline the land acquisition problems for timely execution of the future projects. Also,
measures have already been taken by GOB to ensure timely flow of fund to the projects.

Evaluation Of Bank's Performance
Appraisal
11.   IDA was approached in September, 1988 by GOB for emergency assistance for this
project. In view of it, the IDA supervision Mission visited the affected project area and in their
first "Aide Memoire" of dated December 8, 1988 following a subsequent "Aide Memoire" in
March-April 1989 of local RMB Mission, IDA agreed to provide necessary fund for the project,
leading to a satisfactory credit negotiation.
Fund Release
12.    The over all fund release procedure was simple and effective. The FDR bills as received
from the field offices were transmitted by the Superintending Engineer, Monitoring-I to the
respective consultants, who, in their turn, scrutinized, verified and sent the eligible reimbursement
bills back to SE, Monitoring-I's office for final submission to IDA for disbursement. During
implementing period, the Bank's performance in case of disbursement were satisfactory.
Supervision Mission
13.   IDA fielded five supervision mission during implementation of the project. The Bank
staff were cooperative and contributed to the satisfactory implementation of the project through
working relationship and advice, both technical and financial.
Evaluation Of The Borrower's Performance
Technical/Financial Matters
14.    BWDB's general performance in the implementation of the project was satisfactory. The
process of preparation of estimate, tender documents etc. Were satisfactory. Award of contracts
through tender was hampered and delayed in some cases due to lengthy procurement procedures.
TIhe work could have been better executed if competent/qualified contractors were awarded the
works.
Domestic Fund Allocation and Release
15.    Domestic fund allocation were not adequate in initial years, while fund release were not
made in a timely manner. Up to FY90-91 the working Divisions did not receive fund in time. As
a result they could not pay thie working contractors in time. This affected the progress of the
work to some extent. Improvement in this field was observed from FY91-92 that helped timely
completion as well as ensuring quality of works.
Variation in Actual and Estimated Project Cost
16.   In some cases, the actual project cost has increased due to change in design, the process
of tendering and the usual price escalation.

Bidding Procedure And Contract Approval
17.    Bidding procedure and contract approval system in some cases delayed the start of the
works and consequelitly affected the completion schedule. The system needs improvement.
However, a committee is now working on it for standardization of contract documents and
bidding procedures.
Others
18.    Design offices need improvement. Prompt supply of data from the field to the design
offices is required for timely preparation of the design.
Lessons Learned From Implementation Of The Project
19.    The implementation experience of the project suggests a number of lessons that may be
relevant for further operations: (a) The project restored structures as to the original, or in some
cases with better designs and higher specifications, where original design was found to be
inadequate; (b) the implementation delay could have been avoided by: timely placement of local
currency; advanced acquisition of lands, one year before the implementation; and finalization of
designs and award of all contracts within December.

APPENDIX-B: BWDB'S O&M PLAN
BANGLADESII WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD
THIRD FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT ( CREDIT NO. 2048-BD, PART-a)
OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) PLAN
Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is responsible for planning, implementation and
O&M of Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects. Till June 1994, BWDB has
completed 500 nos. Of projects/schemes covering a gross area of about 3.8 m ha, of which most
of the completed & ongoing projects were affected by 1987/1988 floods. Accordingly, this
project was taken up to rehabilitate these as a follow up to second Flood Rehabilitation Project
(Cr. No. 1876-BD and 1870-BD).
BWDB organizes its O&M of its completed projects througlh Meimnber O&M supported
by 5 zonal offices, 16 units and 48 O&M  Divisions.  On farm  development and water
management are being looked after by Land and Water Use Directorate (LWUD), while Land and
Revenue Directorate (LRD) is responsible for assessment and collection of irrigation service fees.
BWDB existing O&M practices include the (a) operation of infrastructures like Pump
house, Navigation locks, Irrigation-Drainage system and (b) maintenance of all infrastructures.
The fund is provided by Government of Bangladesh (GOB) from its revenue and complement in
World Food Program (WFP).
Presently, the O&M is undertaken by BWDB with consultation with beneficiary groups
(but they do not participate in management). The maintenance being carried out which covers:
(a)    Routine Maintenance (presently labeled as preventive maintenance)
(b)    Annual Maintenance & Repair (presently labeled as periodic maintenance).
(c)    Emergency/Special Maintenance.
BWDB through on going system Rehabilitation Project (Credit n1o. 2099-BD) and
SSFCDI (Cr.1870-BD) are addressing the O&M issues in Pilot Scale. In System Rehabilitation
Project (SRP), some of these concepts have been tested and presented into improved O&M
procedures. BWDB is planning to replicate these in phases to all of its FCDI projects to ensure
better project performance through O&M with participatory management approach as envisaged
in the guidelines for peoples participation (GPP) approved by GOB/MOWR in August, 1994.
Further, SRP has also developed O&M plan for all of its sub-projects and a general O&M plan
for all BWDB projects. BWDB has endorsed this document for adaptation in all project. This
plan will contain among others:
(a)    Operation Plan
(b)    Maintenance schedule
(c)    Budget
(d)    Staffing and Logistics.
32



GOB emphasis the efficient O&M of the completed BWDB projects for the sustainability
of these. Accordingly, new initiatives like approval of GPP and increased budget allocation shall
improve the present situation in the coming years. Besides, BWDB is also looking for other
altemative approaches in O&M of its projects through its ongoing projects (like Bhola phase 11,
compartmental pilot project etc.).

completed strucrmrs. However, they rais.:d their reservations. It was stated 'A major problem with rnost
goYCrnmwnt aegencies, excepL LGED and Rio, is the Ikck of edequLate fund &nd lack of interest among the
ofticials to focus on routine 0 & M'.
On borrower's performance, the World Bank report stated that the Governrment agencies resic-d
fast to the needs for external assistanre but failed to expeditz thc pToject GpPro4]a end fwnd releese -
'Recizing the need for extemel assistance, the Government agtncies, reached out to the donors with
the esturtates cf flood damage and request for eid. However, the Government, particularly Plann.irg
Commission, was unable to expedite the burerucratic process of project approval and fund rclesca.
Consequettly imnplementation slowed donm".
