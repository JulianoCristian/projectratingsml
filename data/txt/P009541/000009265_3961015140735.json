Two\n            unusually severe floods occurred in 1987 and 1988. The aim\n            of the Third Flood Rehabilitation (Emergency) Project is to\n            restore priority infrastructure damaged by flooding so as to\n            promote efficient operation of the economy. It also aims to\n            ensure appropriate design and location of works and\n            equipment to minimize the risk of damage or loss arising\n            from future floods. The project consists of: (i)\n            rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and flood protection\n            works; (ii) rehabilitation of roads and associated\n            structures; (iii) repair and some reconstruction of primary\n            schools; (iv) repair of inland water transport facilities;\n            (v) repair of telecommunications facilities; (vi)\n            rehabilitation of urban infrastructure; and (vii) provision\n            of technical services by local and foreign consultants."}, "docdt": "1989-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
