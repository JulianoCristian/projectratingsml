Indicator 1 :              Growth in non-resource exports
Value                      US$ 438m                                             US$ 641m            US$ 623m
Date achieved              08/08/2008                                           03/31/2013          12/31/2012
                           Lao exports and imports grow very strongly over the project implementation period, as the country
                           became increasingly integrated into the regional economy. Aggregate export growth was driven
Comments                   principally by natural resource based exports (mining and hydropower), while non-resource exports
                           increased by 42 percent from project start in 2008 to 2012 (the latest full year for which data is
                           available). The target was largely achieved.
Indicator 2 :              Growth in trade in services

                               TRADE DEVELOPMENT FACILITY PROJECT

                     IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT



1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal, one of the main elements of the Government of Lao PDR’s National Socio-
Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) was to improve competitiveness in order to increase non-resource
exports and economic growth. Total exports, after stagnating during 2000-03, increased by around 5
percent in 2006, with most of these going to ASEAN countries and China. Apart from the mining sector
exports that benefited from commodity price increases, export growth was driven by agriculture (mainly
coffee and maize) and garments, with both of these industries increasing by over 20 percent.
Implementing the strategy of increasing non-resource export growth was considered to be of critical
important for sustaining high rates of economic growth, the generation of employment opportunities for
Lao PDR’s youthful population, and the achievement of shared growth and poverty reduction policy
objectives.

A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) prepared in 2006 strongly emphasized the need to build
competitiveness and further objectives associated with international and regional integration.1 The DTIS
“Action Matrix for Trade Related Assistance” was approved at a National Validation Workshop on
September 12, 2006 following extensive stakeholder consultations. It outlined priority areas where trade-
related technical assistance (TRTA) would be needed.

The DTIS identified five priority areas where external trade-related technical assistance and reform
efforts should be concentrated: (i) export competitiveness; (ii) trade facilitation; (iii) business
environment; (iv) trade policy, trade agreements and global opportunities; and (v) trade opportunities for
the poor. The GoL intended to implement its trade agenda through the establishment of a permanent
National Integrated Framework Governance Structure (NIFGS), a multi-agency entity consistent with the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Integrated Framework (IF), and the Vientiane Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness in order to better coordinate Official Development Assistance (ODA) in this sector2. The
overall aim was to provide more coherent and effective implementation of the reform plan spelled out in
the DTIS Action Matrix, increase the benefits from ODA, and reduce overlaps, gaps and transaction costs
associated with fragmented stand-alone development partner assistance.

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MoIC), along with development partners, established the Trade
Development Facility (TDF) as the principle mechanism for financing the implementation of the DTIS
Action Matrix via a Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). Initial commitments to the TDF MDTF were made

  The Integrated Framework (later the Enhanced Integrated Framework) is a global multi donor initiative aiming to facilitate the
effective participation of Least Developed Countries in the multilateral trading system. The program, which is operated out of the
WTO Secretariat in Geneva, was established by the International Monetary Fund, the International Trade Centre, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank. It provides a
coordinating framework in support of aid-for-trade in Least Developed Countries.

                                                                9
by the European Union (EUR 4,200,000) and Australia (AUD 3,050,000) in 2008. In early 2012 Germany
made a commitment (EUR 280,000) to also join the MDTF. The World Bank acted as administrator for
the MDTF and contributed additional resources to supervise the project. The rational for Bank
involvement included prior country-level analytical work, including the preparation of the DTIS on behalf
of the government, significant experience in trade-related lending activities in Lao PDR (the Customs and
Trade Facilitation Project) and elsewhere in the region, and close linkages to Country Assistance Strategy
objectives to improve competitiveness and connectivity. The majority of trust fund resources were on-
granted to the MoIC to finance the TDF Project (initially US$ 6.8 million at appraisal, later increased to
US$ 7.6 million upon restructuring). The balance of resources (US$ 1.7 million) was provided for
implementation support and complementary analytical and advisory activities provided by a World Bank-
based facilitation team.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

The development objective of the TDF was to support the establishment of the National Integrated
Framework Governance Structure (NIFGS) and implement NIFGS's initial activities facilitating trade and
cross-border movement of goods, and increasing the capacity of the government to undertake specific
tasks related to regional and global economic integration. These activities were to support the GoL’s
larger aims of poverty reduction and economic development as reflected in the NSEDP.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The PDO was not revised during implementation.

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) 3 noted that a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework
would be put in place, with a set of indicators for each component of TDF-financed activities. The
National Implementation Unit (NIU)—which the project would aim to strengthen as the principle aid-for-
trade coordination unit in Lao PDR—would prepare yearly updates of the indicators for the TDF Steering
Committee. These would be prepared based on day-to-day management and on aide memoires of
implementation support missions for each component. In addition, the NIU would be responsible for
gathering progress reports which would detail progress towards agreed results.

A detailed framework for monitoring results was prepared and approved during the mid-term review of
the TDF (in January 2011). To contribute towards the building of a program based approach for trade, the
TDF results framework was linked and interrelated with the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) log
frame and combined into a joint TDF-EIF results framework for trade related technical assistance in the
Lao PDR. This combined results framework was linked to the overarching outcomes of the 2006 DTIS
Action Matrix, as follows:

        Better trading environment, with simplified bureaucratic procedures including in customs;
        Improved legal and regulatory framework;
        Enhanced general capacity of line ministries and agencies involved in the trade sector;
        Improved private sector capacity to compete in the international market;
        More effective participation in bilateral and multilateral negotiations; and,
        Increased competitiveness of Lao PDR products and contribution to poverty reduction.


3
 At the time of preparation, recipient-executed projects (financed via trust funds) did not require a formal Project Appraisal
Document as part of the preparation and approval process. Thus, the task team prepared a modified PAD incorporating many, but
not all, aspects normally required. As such, preparation of a full results framework was deferred to the implementation stage.

                                                             10
An updated version of the TDF results framework is included in the datasheet. This framework provided
for PDO level results as well as intermediate outcome indicators for each component. The PDO level
results referred to annual targets for growth in non-resources exports, services, and to an improvement in
Lao scores on measures of trade facilitation and logistics. Annual intermediate outcomes indicators were
identified for each of the five project components.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the Lao producers and workers whose income opportunities
would be enhanced by better integration in the world economy and improved external competitiveness.
The GoL would also stand to benefit from strengthening of its capacity to effectively manage its trade
reform agenda and to better coordinate the aid-for-trade (AfT) support it receives from the donor
community.

1.5 Original Components

The TDF MDTF was set up to finance investments; technical assistance and capacity building initiatives;
analytical, diagnostic and advisory services; and the provision of goods for a total of US$ 6.82 million
(later increased to US$ 7.6 million after restructuring) with the following five components.

       A. Trade Facilitation (US$ 0.8 million at appraisal, US$ 1.08 million at restructuring)

This component of the TDF was led by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MoIC) Department of
Import and Exports and was to finance technical assistance for government agencies (mostly other than
Customs) to help them simplify their procedures, automate their processes, and better coordinate on the
trade facilitation agenda under regional and international agreements. This included (i) technical
assistance, ICT investment and training to establish the Lao PDR Trade Portal for the dissemination and
use of this information, creation of basic procedures and systems for the capture of customs and other
trade information, and the preparation of a diagnosis of future requirements for the automation of
licensing and registries for potential future financing. In addition, (ii) support was provided to prepare a
Trade Facilitation Master Plan; assist trade-related agencies in integrity development; and build capacity
to improve the coordination amongst these agencies to deliver on the trade facilitation agenda. Customs
operations were already being rationalized and automated through the introduction of an automated
system financed by a parallel World Bank financed project (the Customs and Trade Facilitation Project4).

       B. Strengthening of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards and Technical Barriers to
          Trade Frameworks (US$ 1.77 million at appraisal, US$ 1.55 million at restructuring)

This component sought to: (i) strengthen the SPS institutional, legal and regulatory framework; (ii)
determine risk-based policies and control measures for SPS; (iii) strengthen the role of the private sector
in managing SPS; and (iv) strengthen the TBT institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks. The
component, which involved activities across a number of government agencies including the Department
of Food and Drugs (Ministry of Health), Department of Agriculture, Department of Livestock and
fisheries and Department of Planning (Ministry of Agriculture, and Department of Standardization,
Quality Assurance and Metrology (Ministry of Science and Technology), aimed to facilitate international
trade and improve food safety, animal and plant health. The component financed technical assistance,
training and goods.

    C. Increasing Export Competitiveness and Business Environment (US$ 1.39 million at
       appraisal)

This component, which was led by the MoIC Trade Promotion and Product Development Department,
was designed around interventions based on the principles of developing a market for business
development services in priority sectors. Details of the interventions to be financed were to be worked out
during project implementation and based on detailed feasibility studies so as to improve the productivity
of selected sectors with a high potential growth for export, namely the garment industry, handicrafts,
secondary wood processing sectors and agro processing amongst others. This component financed
technical assistance, training, and goods.

    D. Capacity Building, Trade Policy, Trade Agreements and Global Opportunities (US$ 1.75
       million at appraisal, US$ 2.40 million at restructuring)

This component was to finance technical assistance and training programs, and was designed flexibly to
adapt to changing circumstances and priorities. Its objective was to (i) develop home grown capacity and
strengthen local research and academic institutions; and (ii) strengthen government managerial and
technical know-how and ownership of the trade related policy agenda. Technical assistance was to be
provided to support the GoL in its ongoing negotiations at the bilateral, regional and multilateral level and
in particular with respect to the legal obligations, implementation issues and negotiations associated with
efforts to accede to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trade policy activities were led by the MoIC
Foreign Trade Policy Department and capacity building activities were led by the MoIC Economic
Research Institute for Trade. Particular attention was to be given to ensure that the component ensured the
transfer of know-how and the building up of institutional capacity and institutional memory.

    E. Strengthening of the National Implementation Unit (US$ 1.11 million at appraisal, US$ 1.21
       million at restructuring)

The final component of the TDF was to provide technical assistance, training and capacity building in
accounting and administrative systems, procurement, project management, performance indicator
determination and verification, and results management. It was also to finance investments in office
equipment, management information and IT systems. The overall objective was to build the capacity of
the MoIC to manage aid-for-trade resources effectively and efficiently as part of broader efforts to move
towards a program based approach in trade.

1.6 Revised Components

No substantial changes were made to components during implementation.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

This project was restructured in January 2012, based on the recommendations of the mid-term review, as
follows:
     The financing plan was updated to account for the new contribution to the TDF MDTF of EUR
        280,000 from the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the
        realization of exchange rate discounts and earned investment income from existing contributions
        (from AusAID and the EU). The overall grant size was, therefore, increased by US$ 784,145
        (from US$ 6,815,855 to US$ 7,600,000). Additional resources were provided to complete the full
        scope of activities planned under the Lao Trade Portal assignment (Component A); to support an
        intensified pace of WTO accession negotiations (Component D); to address priority issues

                                                     12
         associated with regional commitments at the ASEAN level (Component D); and for further
         investments in the strengthening of the NIU (Component E). Some cost savings were recorded on
         SPS due to less technical assistance being required than originally envisaged (Component B).

        The closing date of the project was extended from February 28, 2012 to March 31, 2013 as
         justified by time compression between appraisal and actual start-up of activities (due to delays in
         the signing of legal agreements between the Bank and the trust fund donors), and due to a slower
         than expected start of several of the project components. The extension was to ensure that there
         was sufficient time available to complete all activities. A revised action plan that reflected the
         new proposed closing date was agreed with the government at the mid-term review.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project was designed to support implementation of the DTIS Action Matrix that had been approved
by GoL in September 2006. Initial resources of US$ 1 million were allocated from the global Integrated
Framework (Window 2) trust fund to begin supporting the implementation of the DTIS Action Matrix
with much of the resources devoted to the strengthening of the NIU. In addition, AusAID financed a
technical advisor to start building up the capacity of the new NIU staff as part of its commitment to the
TDF. However the majority of resources to support implementation of the DTIS Action Matrix were to be
provided via the newly established TDF MDTF.

Project design was informed principally by the 2006 DTIS (which had been undertaken by the Bank) as
well as other relevant analytical work, including the 2007 Investment Climate Assessment5 and a 2006
SPS Capacity Building Assessment6. However, no dedicated resources were available to finance actual
preparation of the TDF project. In addition, at the time when the project was prepared, there were no
systematic Bank guidelines for the preparation of projects financed via recipient executed trust funds.
Formal preparation of a Project Appraisal Document was not required at the time of preparation, so the
team prepared a modified PAD incorporating many, but not all, of the requirements normally found in
such a document. This situation affected the overall project preparation and led to start-up delays and
impacted somewhat on project implementation. Project components were arrived at through dialogue with
MoIC management, as follows:
     Component A (Trade Facilitation), with most of its resources dedicated to designing the Lao
        Trade Portal, was prepared largely in parallel with the 2008 IDA-financed Customs and Trade
        Facilitation Project.
     Component B (Strengthening SPS and TBT Frameworks) was prepared on the basis on
        extensive analytical work undertaken by Bank staff of the Agriculture and Rural Development
        Department that had culminated in a Lao specific SPS Action Plan for Capacity Building.
     Component C (Export Competitiveness and Business Environment) described in very general
        terms actions to be undertaken and sectors to be targeted. This was based on the analysis in the
        DTIS that listed several sectors that had “a high potential for export”. However, no sector
        background work had been initiated on these sectors, to identify their problems and possible
        project interventions. The PAD admits up front that:” Given that the thinking on this component

        has not been finalized, this component is designed in a flexible way to allow for future
        improvements”7.
       Component D (Capacity Building, Trade Policy, Trade Agreements and Global Opportunities)
        was to finance technical assistance and training programs, and was designed to adapt to changing
        circumstances. It was based to developing home-grown capacity; strengthening the local research,
        academic and vocational institutions; and improving government managerial and technical
        knowledge. The capacity building aspects of this component were based on design activities
        undertaken by the EU8 while the activities to support WTO accession were left broadly undefined
        in order to provide rapid response resources to the GoL negotiating team.
       Component E (strengthening the National Implementation Unit) was based on the need to (i)
        build/enhance the capacity within the MoIC to manage project procurement and financial
        management of the TDF project as well as of other aid-for-trade projects; and, to (ii) ensure that
        the MoIC would assume full ownership of the trade development agenda.
       The preparation of the M&E framework was left as a task to be completed once the project had
        started. The NIU was tasked with its preparation with support from the World Bank facilitation
        team. The framework was developed during the first year of project implementation, but not
        formalized until the project was restructured at the mid-term review.

Financial Management and Procurement assessments were undertaken during project preparation to
assess weaknesses, and to proposed mitigation measures to manage risks.

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the analysis presented above, the ICR rates Quality at Entry as satisfactory. The PDO and
design were well aligned with GoL policy and the CAS, and the analytical work supporting the project
was solid. Lessons from similar operations/projects were incorporated into the design. However, in the
absence of systematic Bank guidelines for the preparation of projects financed via recipient executed trust
funds, the project suffered from start-up delays and lack of a detailed results framework.

2.2 Implementation

Project implementation was to be coordinated by the NIU, with day-to-day technical implementation of
activities undertaken by Government Sub Executing Units (GSEUs) established across a number of
agencies as part of the National Integrated Framework Governance Structure. The project had a slow start
largely because (i) the finalization of the financing agreements with donors took longer than anticipated;
and, (ii) it took time to build up the necessary capacity and skills of the NIU and GSEU staff to
implement a project that was significantly larger and more complex than any previous aid-for-trade
project in Lao PDR. Supervision of the project was intense with six supervision missions undertaken prior
to the mid-term review of early January 2011, as well as day-to-day support provided by the full-time and
in-country World Bank facilitation team. Implementation support missions were undertaken jointly with
co-financing donors.

The mid-term review of January 2011 undertook a thorough review of progress achieved and made
suggestions on how to improve project implementation. This review led to the restructuring as explained
above in section 1.7 and the formal approval of a detailed results framework.

The mid-term review recorded the following key findings:
    The pace of implementation of the TDF had accelerated substantially and the MoIC was
       demonstrating strong ownership and clear commitment to the program. While some components
       under the TDF were performing better than others, overall implementation progress was
       considered to be “Satisfactory”.
    The continued relevance of the project was assessed and considered by the mission to remain
       close to the priorities of the GoL and donors to support closer regional integration and
       modernization of trade.
    Solid progress was recorded at the level of the project outcome indicators, indicating that the
       overall direction of the project was appropriate. Some details per component:
           o Component A (Trade Facilitation): Agreement was reached to scale down the process
               simplification activity that was part of the Lao PDR Trade Portal design and to proceed
               with documenting the trade-related procedures “as is”. This would reduce the overall cost
               of consultancy services and prevent the project support from being eroded due to internal
               resistance to change. Staff made concrete suggestions to improve the draft of the Trade
               Facilitation Master Plan.
           o Component B (SPS and TBT Frameworks): This component had encountered serious
               procurement delays and was given greater urgency as to permit progress in Laos’ WTO
               accession efforts. Issues of coordination challenges between SPS-related agencies were
               addressed through the transfer of responsibility for this agenda to the Planning
               Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
           o Component C (Export Competitiveness and Business Environment): Support to several
               sectors was inhibited due to a number of sector specific issues. The mid-term review
               mission made efforts to move the agenda forward and identify other resources that could
               be helpful in that process. In some instances the TDF-supported interventions were scaled
               down.
           o Component D (Capacity Building, Trade Policy, Trade Agreements and Global
               Opportunities): The support of the TDF to Lao PDR’s WTO accession process and
               related initiatives to engage with concerned sectors was reviewed, with additional
               resources provided to support the final, intensified phase of accession. Additional
               activities in support of ASEAN regional integration challenges were also mapped.
           o Component E (Strengthening of the NIU): Substantive progress was noted in building
               up the capacity of the NIU. The mission recommended that to enhance the long-term
               sustainability of technical skills of NIU staff it would be advisable to appoint additional
               government officials to the NIU. Substantial improvements in procurement and financial
               management were noted after earlier recommendations had been implemented.

2.3 M&E Design, Implementation and Utilization

As noted above, the design of the formal results framework was left for the NIU to finalize and it was
only at the mid-term review stage that the project results framework was formally approved. The NIU
was tasked with the compilation of the results framework and its capacity was strengthened by the
appointment of a full-time M&E Officer. Result indicators are obtained from readily available
publications, the review of project documents and supervision reports, and discussion with the people
involved in project implementation. As such, some provide statistical precision while others are basically
an informed assessment of progress or the absence thereof. The intermediate result indicators appear well-
designed and even before their formal inclusion in the M&E framework, were guiding project
implementation. Progressive efforts were made over the course of the project to shift the focus of six-
monthly progress reports from activity to outcome based reporting.

          Box 1: Trade facilitation in Lao PDR – getting faster, but still behind regional comparators

  Trade facilitation performance is improving, but high logistics costs due in part to a landlocked supply chain,
  continue to tax competitiveness and limit the scope for diversified growth. Improvements have been made
  through reform to customs processing procedures, through the introduction of an automated customs declaration
  processing system (ASYCUDA World) and via investments in better border infrastructure. Time Release
  Survey data shows that the mean customs clearance time has reduced from 17.9 hours in 2010 to 11.2 hours in
  2012. The same survey shows mean non-customs clearance times (which apply to around a third of imports, but
  account for a disproportionate share of time taken) falling from 5.0 to 2.9 days. Variances have also been
  reduced over the same period. These results are consistent with World Bank enterprise survey data which also
  shows that manufacturing firms reporting that the average number of days to import and export has fallen.

      Figure 1: Lao PDR’s scores on cross-country             Figure 2: …and average clearance times at the border
      measures of trade facilitation have improved…                           have been reduced




   Source: Logistics Performance Index 2012                  Source: Time Release Surveys 2009, 2012

  Perceptions of trade facilitation performance in Lao PDR have also seen progressive improvements under the
  global Logistics Performance Index 9 . However, gains in Lao PDR are from a low base and the country
  continues to compare unfavorably against neighboring Vietnam and Thailand. Trader expectations for
  performance at the border are also rising. Similarly while tariffs have progressively fallen, non-tariff measures
  (many of which are implemented in a non-transparent way), are increasingly seen as binding constraints to both
  greater imports and exports.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Capacity within the NIU (and more broadly within MoIC) to undertake effective procurement and
financial management was very weak at the start of the project, as was noted in the PAD. At the time of
appraisal, the MoIC had no prior experience of implementing large technical assistance projects.
Strengthening these capacities so as to ensure adherence to the procurement and financial management
guidelines was given great attention during life of the project, not only to ensure efficient implementation
of the TDF but also to build donor confidence and lay the foundations for a program based approach in
trade. AusAID provided a full-time technical advisor within the NIU from approximately one year before
project effectiveness to support the establishment of the NIFGS and build capacity in the MoIC.




9
  Lao PDR’s score under the Logistics Performance Index has improved from 2.08 in 2007, to 2.17 in 2010 and to 2.38 in 2012.
However, in 2012 Lao PDR still ranked 113 out of 155 countries.


                                                            16
The NIU grew in size considerably over the life of the TDF, as the number of government officials
appointed to the unit grew, supplemented by a number of full-time national consultants financed by the
project and by the EIF. A full-time procurement advisor was on board for one year after which the
advisor’s services were available on a part-time basis. A full-time financial management advisor was also
in place throughout the period of project implementation. Internship programs were designed to transfer
skills to junior staff and NIU officials attended various training courses provided by the World Bank. The
NIU staff has access on a case-by-case basis to advice from World Bank procurement and financial
management specialists based in Bangkok and Vientiane. NIU staff turnover requires that capacity
building on fiduciary issues remains an ongoing activity. Lengthy procurement for the large packages
requiring full competitive selection of consultancy teams caused delays in a number of key activities,
particularly those relating to trade facilitation and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, in the early stages
of project implementation. However as the NIU team gained experience, fiduciary performance gradually
improved. By the time of the final Implementations Status and Results Report (ISR) prepared by the
World Bank, it was noted that the NIU had gained an outstanding record on managing procurement and
financial management, and in this regard was considered to be one of the strongest performers in the Bank
portfolio.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The TDF project closed on March 31, 2013. The preparation of a successor project (Second Trade
Development Facility Project or TDF-210) started in mid-2012 informed by the updated 2012 DTIS, as
well as related analytical work prepared during TDF-1. A PAD outlining the scope of activities for TDF-2
was presented to the Executive Board on December 4, 2012. Increased confidence among donors in the
capacity of the MoIC to effectively and efficiently manage aid-for-trade resources, as well as strong
government leadership and clear priorities, resulted in increased resources becoming available to support
the second phase of the program. The number of donors increased with commitments made by AusAID,
the European Union, GIZ and IrishAid11. IDA Financing has also been committed to TDF-2, with the total
size of the project reaching US$ 14.0 million (including an IDA grant of US$ 4.0 million and an MDTF
Recipient Executed grant of US$ 10.0 million). The IDA Financing and MDTF Grant Agreements were
signed in March 2013 and the project became effective in May 2013, allowing for seamless continuity
from TDF-1 to TDF-2.

The design of TDF-2 reflects lessons learned from TDF-1. The follow-on project has a deepened focus on
addressing the binding constraints to increased integration by Lao PDR into the regional and multilateral
trading system. The breadth of activities to be financed under TDF-2 has been reduced compared to under
TDF-1, allowing for a deeper engagement in a smaller range of selected areas. The project includes three
main technical components. The first component—Trade Facilitation, Trade Policy and Regulations—
provides for follow through implementation in existing areas under TDF-1 where implementation is
moving to a set of second generation reforms, post WTO accession. The second component—
Diversification and Competitiveness—provides for a new engagement reflecting the increasing challenges
that Lao PDR is facing in this area, including an enterprise level matching grants scheme and support to
manufacturing productivity and labor standards. Finally, the—Mainstreaming Aid-for-Trade—component
provides support to the next generation framework for the management of trade related technical
assistance in Lao PDR, as well as formal movement to a program based approach to support
implementation of the 2012 DTIS Action Matrix/Roadmap for Trade and Private Sector Development.

                           Box 1: Lao PDR’s accession to the World Trade Organization12

     What has happened?
      Following the completion of accession negotiations in late 2012, Lao PDR became the 158th member
        of the WTO in February 2013. The accession process required a series of negotiations with members of
        the “working party”, including answering several hundred questions from WTO members. It is the
        completion of a fifteen year process, with application first made in 1997. However, the year 2012 saw
        unprecedented progress including the reaching of crucial agreements with the US and EU, and three
        meetings of the working party in Geneva.
      The WTO General Council approved the accession protocol for Lao PDR’s membership in October
        2012. This was the final agreement on exactly what Lao has done in terms of reform, and what Lao has
        agreed to do over the next 3-5 years. It includes a “working party report” and a “schedule of
        commitments”. The National Assembly ratified the accession package in December 2012. Formal
        membership came into force 30 days after the ratified documents were deposited with the WTO Secretariat
        in Geneva.

     What does it mean?
      Lao PDR is a least developed country and so was allowed to receive “special and differential
        treatment” during the accession process, generally meaning that Lao did not need to make as deep
        commitments as other acceding countries and has been given more time to fully implement commitments.
      It means signing up to the WTO core principles of non-discrimination, transparency and predictability
        and ensuring that these principles are incorporated into Lao law. Plus a series of more specific reform
        measures to bring Lao legislation into line with the WTO agreements on issues such as subsidies, price
        controls, restrictions, and state enterprises.
      The average tariff has been bound (so cannot be raised above) 18.8 percent. This will not have a
        significant impact, as Laos will have to make deeper commitments to ASEAN member states by 2015. The
        WTO agreements cover both trade in goods and trade in services. Market access commitments have been
        made in 10 service sectors allowing foreign access (in for example, banking, telecoms, distribution,
        health, environment, tourism, construction, air transport). This means that there are limits on how the
        country regulates these sectors.
      The terms of Lao PDR's accession package, including the extent of commitments made, are in line
        with other similar recently acceding countries (such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Nepal).
      While a surge in foreign investment resulting from accession is not to be expected, accession to the
        WTO is an important externally verified signal of reform and sustained commitment to reform.
        However, for Laos to fully benefit, commitments will need to be fully implemented. This is a challenge
        as the reform pressure will be reduced once Lao is a WTO member and, other country experience
        suggestions, there will be a very real risk of backsliding.

     What are the World Bank and Development Partners doing?
      The World Bank and Development Partners have been supporting the Lao WTO accession process
        for more than four years under the Trade Development Facility Multi Donor Trust Fund financed by
        AusAID, EU and GIZ. Support has been provided in partnership with a number of other development
        partner initiatives. The TDF has supported the direct costs of negotiations - including the last five Working
        Party negotiations in Geneva, drafting of legal texts in key areas (especially on sanitary and phyto-sanitary
        measures), bilateral negotiations, technical assistance to the negotiating team (including the first and only
        full time lawyer in MoIC), and a series of sector impact studies in professional services, distribution
        services, financial services, transport and telecommunications. Similarly, it included a substantial program
        on trade facilitation (including the launch of the Lao Trade Portal - which allows Lao to meet WTO Trade
        Facilitation Agreement requirements on transparency and publication) and, via the Customs and Trade
        Facilitation Project, support on customs reform, including the phase out of reference pricing and movement

     towards compliance with the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement. The second series of the Poverty
     Reduction Support Operations (Development Policy Lending) was also instrumental in supporting a
     number of trade facilitation reforms required as part of Lao PDR’s WTO accession process.
   The World Bank and Development Partners have recently approved a Second Trade Development
     Facility (TDF-2), a follow on operation to support the "beyond WTO" agenda over 2013-17, co-
     financed by AusAID, EU, GIZ and Irish Aid. This will support key aspects of the next phase trade program
     of MoIC, including post accession work on trade in goods, trade in services and trade facilitation.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The TDF was designed to support the establishment of the NIFGS and its initial activities that were based
upon the 2006 DTIS Action Matrix. These activities were in turn fully aligned with GoL’s development
priorities and the key objectives outlined in the 6th and 7th National Socio-Economic Development Plans
covering 2006-2010 and 2011-2015 periods respectively. Both of these Plans underscored the
significance of increased trade and closer international integration as part of efforts to generate and
sustain pro-poor economic growth. The project was also in line with commitments made by the GoL to
the WTO accession process.

The TDF was similarly aligned to the strategic objectives of the World Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy for the period 2005-2010 as well as with Australian and EU country strategy objectives, and
formed a core part of a larger country trade and competitiveness program including the IDA Customs and
Trade Facilitation Project, policy dialogue under the Poverty Reduction Support Operations, and
complementary analytical work on trade and private sector development issues.

Upon completion on March 2013, the TDF remained highly relevant to the new Country Partnership
Strategy 2012-2016, whose first strategic objective was competitiveness and connectivity, particularly
outcome 1.1 “Strengthened government capacity to support growth diversification and competitiveness”.
The approval of the TDF’s follow-on project, TDF-2 demonstrates GoL’s continued strong commitment
to improving trade facilitation, competitiveness and the mainstreaming of aid-for-trade.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

PDO Indicators

Positive results been achieved across all components of the TDF, and the capacity of the MoIC to manage
a large multi-sectoral reform program (through the National Integrated Framework Governance Structure)
has grown substantially over the life of the project. Over the 2008-13 implementation period, Lao PDR
has become much more closely integrated into the regional and international economy as measured by
substantial increases in trade in goods and services. While significant barriers remain, measured
improvements in trade facilitation and logistics have been achieved (particularly in terms of time
performance). Activities undertaken with financing from the TDF have contributed towards faster and
more transparent trade facilitation; better coordination among government agencies operating at the
border; improved integration into the regional and multilateral trading system; increased productivity in
the garments export sector (a key diversified manufacturing industry); and increased aid-for-trade
management capacity.


                                                      19
Key achievements include substantial trade negotiating efforts culminating in Lao PDR's formal
accession into the World Trade Organization in February 2013; the approval and implementation of a first
National Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan; the establishment of a permanent National Trade
Facilitation Secretariat, the launch of an electronic Trade Portal that puts all trade-related information on
tariffs, licenses, measures, laws, regulations and import/export procedures into the public domain; the
establishment of an inter-agency SPS Risk Evaluation Group; substantial legislative reforms on SPS
measures associated with WTO accession; the completion of a TBT diagnostic assessment; the launch of
fee-based productivity training services in the Garments Skills Development Centre; support to the
operations and commercialization of the Lao Handicrafts Festival; and measured growth in domestic trade
policy research capacity, including the design of a technical trade policy and competitiveness curriculum
for civil servants and the publication of the Lao Trade Research Digest.

Lao PDR now has the key building blocks in place to manage and implement an effective aid-for-trade
program, with enlarged capacity and heightened ambitions for the next phase of the program - to
commence in early 2013 under the Second Trade Development Facility.

However, as with any intervention of this nature it is not possible to directly attribute the changes in the
PDO level results indicators, namely growth of non-resource exports and services and improvement in
trade facilitation, solely to TDF project activities since many factors other than the TDF project
components will have had an impact on these outcome indicators. In particular, non-resources exports and
exports of services are affected by exchange rate developments and commodity price shocks inside and
outside of Lao PDR, by the export performance of competitors, by the implementation of regional
preferential agreements, and by growth of income in destination markets13.

In addition, the time lag between (i) agreeing upon policy changes, their translation into new regulations,
their implementation by agents that often are resistant to change, and (ii) their impact on the behavior of
economic agents is substantial and certainly lengthier than the lifetime of the project. Similarly, the
relatively modest scale of the TDF interventions also suggests that expectations of significant impact on
these indicators should be modest.

Project outcome indicator 1: Non-resource exports grew by over 40 percent over the project
implementation period, in line with growth rates expected over the project implementation period.

Project outcome indicator 2: Trade in services rose by more than 100 per cent over the course of the
project, substantially above the expected target growth rate, largely because of rapid growth in tourism
receipts.

Project outcome indicator 3: Lao PDR’s score under the Logistics Performance Indicators rose from 2.25
in 2008 to 2.46 in 2010 and 2.50 2012 (on a scale from 0 to 5), but still registered a relatively low place
compared to comparator countries (the ranking improved from 117th in 2007 to 109th out of 155 countries
in 2012). Hence, there is considerable scope for further improvement and a need to vigorously pursue the
trade facilitation agenda through the ongoing Customs and Trade Facilitation Project and under the next
phase of the TDF (in TDF-2).

Intermediate Outcome Indicators

The attribution gap and length time lag is somewhat easier to address at the level of intermediate outcome
indicators, with the following results recorded under the project:
     Lao PDR become a member of the WTO in February 2013, a culmination of 15 years of
        negotiations (see box for further details);
     Non-customs clearance time was reduced from 5.0 days in 2009 to 2.9 days in 2012 exceeding
        the target;
     The gap between current trade-related information made available to the public and that required
        to facilitate trade and for Lao PDR to accede to the WTO was substantially closed by the launch
        of the Lao PDR Trade Portal;
     A national Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan was approved by the government, and a
        permanent national coordinating body (the Trade Facilitation Secretariat) was established;
     The gap between the current legal and regulatory framework on SPS issues and that required to
        facilitate trade, protect health and for Lao PDR to accede to the WTO was substantially achieved
        by the revision of a number of SPS related laws, decrees and subsidiary pieces of legislation;
     An interagency SPS Risk Evaluation Group was established as part of efforts to build capacity on
        risk evaluation and assessment, but is not yet fully operational;
     The TBT assessment was completed, as part of efforts to identify policy and reform requirements
        and investment financing needs to establish a National Quality Infrastructure framework;
     Productivity gains among firms benefitting from TDF sub-projects were achieved only in the
        garments sector (through the establishment of the Garment Skills Development Centre, and
        subsequent launch of fee-based training services);
     The great majority (85 percent) of participants in trade-related capacity building activities rated
        the initiatives as relevant to their work;
     Capacity in the MoIC Economic Research Institute for Trade to produce research outputs was
        noted, with growth in the number of research projects completed during the life of the project
        (from zero to five), and through initiatives such as the launch of the Lao Trade Research Digest
        and the holding of regular research forum events; and
     NIU management of AfT resources rose from 11 percent of total TRTA in Lao PDR before the
        start of the TDF to around 72 percent out of a much larger volume of AfT by the end of the
        project implementation period.

Well-designed impact evaluation studies of individual project components might have shed more light on
the outcome impact of the project. Yet such studies would provide interesting results only when sufficient
time has lapsed after the intervention. A case in point would be an evaluation of the impact of the training
provided to firms and individuals by the Garments Skills Development Centre, e.g. in addition to the
measurement of increases in productivity in firms where in-house training has been provided, the analysis
could cover the replacement of foreign line managers by Lao nationals; reduction of staff turnover;
increase in the share of females in the line, middle and top management; increased profitability; and
exports and investment.

Rating: Satisfactory

3.3 Efficiency

The efficiency of project implementation was negatively affected by slow start of project implementation.
This was largely due to (i) the more than one year time lag between appraisal, signing of administrative
agreements with donors, and signing of the grant agreement and project effectiveness; and (ii) the NIU
was at the outset a very small and weak institution and some time was required to recruit essential staff,
and familiarize them with World Bank procedures. Once those administrative and institutional

                                                    21
components were in place, the TDF operated effectively. An example is the support given to the Garment
Skills Development Centre where effective implementation started only in 2011, after which time
progress was very satisfactory.

Despite the slower than anticipated start of initiating the various project components, project activities
were generally efficient in their implementing modalities, composition of inputs, and interaction with
beneficiaries. Well-managed procurement and financial management processes ensured cost-efficiency
and the smooth execution of project components once their launch was agreed upon. Some procurement
delays could have been further shortened somewhat e.g. the recruitment of FAO to draft SPS legislation,
and the procurement of consultancy services for the Lao Trade Portal took considerable time. Once the
relevant issues were solved, services were delivered very effectively. The project also implemented a
much appreciated degree of flexibility to adjust component financing to changing circumstances and
needs. This was done during the mid-term review when additional resources obtained from reducing
support for other components and the new contribution to the TDF from GIZ were allocated to priority
activities (on trade facilitation, on WTO accession negotiations and on ASEAN integration needs).

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Based on the rating for relevance, effectiveness and efficiency, the TDF is rated Satisfactory. As noted
earlier some of the problems and delays encountered during project implementation resulted from some
weaknesses in project preparation that left many issues to be solved during project implementation,
including the design of the M&E framework. However, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce’s
capacity and ownership of the project grew strongly and steadily during the course of implementation, in
excess of expectations at the time of appraisal. This resulted in some key potentially transformative
results towards the end of the project implementation period, most importantly including accession to the
World Trade Organization, but also the launch of the Lao Trade Portal, trade facilitation reforms, the
successful preparation of a DTIS update “in-house” and demonstrated improvements in aid-for-trade
coordination and management capacity. These achievements would not have happened either at all, or at
anything like the same pace, were it not for the resources provided under the TDF. Satisfaction with
results achieved was demonstrated by the government’s strong desire for a follow-up operation, and by an
increased number of development partners providing enlarged commitments to the second phase project
(TDF-2).

Rating: Satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Gender issues were not specifically addressed during the design of the TDF and thus not articulated in the
PAD. Yet during the course of TDF implementation, gender issues were selectively addressed in a
number of interventions, particularly in the context of the support given to the garment industry (where
employment is highly female intensive).

                                                         22
In order to remedy this gap, efforts were made during implementation to improve knowledge and
understanding on the linkages between trade and gender in particular, with resources from an additional
grant from the Gender Action Plan. Analysis was undertaken on entrepreneurship, analyzing the World
Bank’s enterprise survey data from a gender perspective14; significant primary research was also carried
out on labor standards in the garments industry, laying the foundations for scaled up “better work”
activities under TDF-2 15 ; and a macro-micro study on the linkages between gender and trade was
prepared as background for the DTIS update exercise16. Issues associated with the poverty, gender and
environmental impact of increased trade and integration were also closely integrated into the updated
2012 DTIS, led by the MoIC.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project devoted substantial resources to strengthening the capacity of the MoIC NIU to undertake the
overall management of the national trade agenda. Areas where major improvements have been realized
are in procurement and financial management, and increasingly in technical and policy bases area.
Broader success can be seen through the institutional change that has accompanied growing confidence
and capacity in the NIU. Initially, part of the General Division within the MoIC Foreign Trade Policy
Department, the NIU now forms the heart of the Foreign Aid Division in the MoIC Planning and
Cooperation Department, established in 2011. This expansion in mandate, together with strong national
ownership of the trade agenda within MoIC, has provided for a gradual move from a project to program
based approach. The NIU is now in a position to effectively manage not only TDF resources, but also
other trade-related support provided to the MoIC, and is driving the adoption of common standards in
terms of reporting, oversight and transparency across all TRTA in Lao PDR. Most significant is the fact
that the ownership of the trade agenda of the GoL has increasingly become national in contrast with the
situation at the outset of the TDF when external development partners were largely responsible for
defining the trade agenda.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The main risks to the development outcome are a function of its sustainability. The risk to Development
Outcome is considered ‘moderate’ given the risks detailed below per project component, together with the
remedial actions undertaken to mitigate these risks.

     Component A: Trade Facilitation
      The sustainability of the Lao Trade Portal and the probability that it will develop further will
        depend to a significant extent on the effective implementation of the Roadmap for Process
        Simplification and Harmonization agreed upon in March 2013. The Roadmap specifies the
        process of licensing simplification, the decision to provide for continuous updates of the data base,

    adequate dissemination so that SMEs will increase their use of the Portal, and the identification of
    the financial resources to provide a sustainable resource base for the Portal. For the next few
    years TDF-2 will further support the Portal and will help in identifying sustainable financial
    resources, but dedicated staffing will be required. Linking the Portal to the Single Window and a
    unified fee structure for border agency services, the preparation of which is being supported by
    the World Bank’s global Trade Facilitation Facility MDTF, will also contribute to its
    sustainability.
   Implementation of the Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan has had a good start and will
    require that the MoIC will be able to play the coordinating role required to assure that all related
    ministries and agencies continue to honor their commitments.

Component B: Strengthening the SPS and TBT Framework
 Lack of coordination between ministries and agencies involved in the SPS and TBT framework
   may weaken now that Laos has obtained WTO membership and stall further progress. Agencies
   involved in SPS and TBT implementation are still reluctant to adopt the necessary transparent
   risk management practices; success in this endeavor is not assured. Moving the responsibility for
   coordinating this to the Planning Department in the Ministry of Agriculture is a step in the right
   direction. TDF-2 has included further support on developing the SPS legal framework as a
   continuation of activities under TDF-1.
 The broader SPS capacity building agenda will also receive continued support from the Asian
   Development Bank’s recently launched SPS Handling Project.

Component C: Improving Competitiveness and Business Environment
 Efforts were made by the Garment Skills Development Centre to ensure the charging of fees for
   all services provided to the industry as part of efforts to ensure cost recovery. However, the
   Centre is still not yet able to cover all costs, including overheads. Additional resources will be
   provided under TDF-2 to support the transition to full cost recovery; however this will require
   continued growth in fee income (both in volume and margin terms).
 The output for other interventions is more mixed. Agribusiness activities in Luang Prabang have
   been fully taken over by the UN Cluster Project (with SECO support), and silk activities by the
   Sustainable Silk Production Project (with support from the World Bank-Japan Social
   Development Fund). However, the output for agribusiness activities in Pakse, for secondary wood
   processing and for e-commerce in the handicrafts sector is uncertain without further donor
   financing.

Component D: Trade Policy and Agreements
 Now that WTO accession has been obtained, there is a risk that the reform momentum could
   weaken and that implementation of the agreements and further work on the outstanding issues
   could stall. For this reason the TDF-2 will continue its support for this agenda, including
   supporting implementation of the phased commitments made as part of Lao PDR’s accession

                           Box 3: The Lao Trade Portal – making trade more transparent17

     The Lao PDR Trade Portal (www.laotradeportal.gov.la), launched by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
     on June 22, 2012, enables traders to cut down the number of trips needed to get information or the length of
     time for carrying out transactions when trading across borders. In a transitional economy such as Lao PDR, new
     firms often find it difficult to get information on business processes. The private sector has identified a lack of
     transparency and predictability surrounding regulations as a major investment climate constraint. It is also the
     first step towards the establishment of a National Single Window which will allow traders to discharge all
     import/export obligations through one channel electronically.

     The Lao PDR Trade Portal provides traders with access to:
     • All trade-related laws, regulations, measures, restrictions and licensing requirements and tariffs indexed,
     cross-referenced, and searchable by commodity code;
     • Detailed process maps of business procedures for importing and exporting;
     • Full listings of national standards for products;
     • Procedures for clearing goods at the border;
     • Downloadable forms; and,
     • E-alerts which traders can customize to receive information on commodities.

     “The creation of the Lao PDR Trade Portal is a key milestone in improving our country’s business
     environment,” said Dr. Nam Viyaket, Minister of Industry and Commerce at the launch event for the Lao
     Trade Portal, “The Seventh National Social and Economic Development Plan (2011-2015) identifies trade
     information services as one of its priority areas. If we want to take part in international regional trade and
     production networks we have to move swiftly towards paperless transactions,”

     The Lao PDR Trade Portal is also helping Lao PDR comply with WTO and ASEAN commitments that
     require member countries to make their trade-related regulations available to the public in an easily accessible
     manner.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

       (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Design of the project was well informed by a large stock of analytical work, including principally the
2006 DTIS that was carried out by the Bank, as well as an Investment Climate Assessment and related
work on SPS issues. Limited resources to support formal preparation of the project meant that a number
of key tasks normally undertaken during project preparation (including development of a results
framework) were deferred to the implementation stage. However, much of the design activities were
carried out by the Customs and Trade Facilitation Project task team, which was prepared at the same time
as the TDF and also informed by the same underlying analytical work. The project was closely aligned

based on the Lao model - World Bank (2012) Developing a Trade Information Portal, The World Bank, International Trade

with the objectives in the CAS as well as with government’s strategic priorities, and the task team
benefitted from close specialized support from the International Trade Department, and from similar
projects under preparation at the same time in Cambodia and Vietnam.

Rating: Satisfactory

(b) Quality of Supervision

The impact of limitations resulting from the lack of resources available during preparation, was mitigated
by intense supervision of project implementation, including: (i) organizing regular (twice per year)
intense implementation support missions, undertaken jointly by the Bank and donors contributing to the
MDTF; (ii) establishing an active TDF facilitation team in Vientiane to provide ongoing day-to-day
implementation support to the client, with resources from the Bank-executed portion of the MDTF; and,
(iii) by undertaking a strong program of complementary analytical work. A list of research papers and
dissemination briefs is provided Annex 10.

The availability of additional resources to provide high intensity implementation support and an in-depth
trade-related analytical program, including with substantial staff inputs from the World Bank’s
International Trade Department in Washington, DC, was a key factor in supporting the strong results
achieved by the government under the TDF. That implementation capacity in the MoIC on both fiduciary
and technical issues grow substantially over the course of the project was due to a significant extent to the
high investments made by the Bank in implementation support. The pooling of resources by development
partners into a single MDTF, also help to reduce transactions costs and provide the client with the space
to develop capacity and ownership. Similarly the availability of Bank-executed trust fund resources from
the MDTF allowed for an intensity of technical assistance, both in-country and mission-based from the
International Trade Department that would not have been possible under regular circumstances.

It was also notable that the project benefitted from most of the task team, including the task team leader,
being based in the country office (in Vientiane) and from the maintenance of a consistent task team
through the 4.5 year project implementation period, including the same task team leader from project
effectiveness to project closing.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The excellent performance of the Bank team during project implementation compensates for limitations
during project preparation.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Government performance was generally Satisfactory, although there were initial challenges during the
project start-up period to ensure effective coordination between the MoIC (responsible for technical
implementation) and the MoF (responsible for fiscal coordination and management of the designated
account through which project resources flowed). By the time of the mid-term review, the government
was in compliance with all legal covenants in the grant agreement.


                                                     26
Inter-agency coordination presented significant challenges over much of the implementation period, but
progressively improved driven to some extent by the political objective of WTO accession. Institutional
arrangements developed during the course of the project, including for example the establishment of a
permanent National Trade Facilitation Secretariat, played a major role in improving coordination
between trade-related government agencies. Similarly, the process of preparing the 2012 DTIS update
acted as a catalyst for better policy consistency across government departments on trade policy and
competitiveness issues.

Rating: Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Project implementation involved a large number of government stakeholders including several
departments from the Ministry of Industry of Commerce (Planning and Cooperation; Foreign Trade
Policy, Imports and Exports; Economic Research Institute for Trade; Trade and Product Promotion) as
well as departments from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Planning; Agriculture; Livestock and
Fisheries), the Ministry of Health (Food and Drugs) and the Ministry of Science and Technology
(Standardization, Quality Assurance and Metrology). Initially coordination challenges between the
numerous agencies slowed implementation, but over time performance improved with strong results
achieved across the components. WTO accession efforts acted as a strong incentive for coordination in
this regard.

A substantial number of technical activities were completed under the project, involving work by a large
number of technical implementing departments across several ministries. Significant experience was
gained on how best to address inter-agency coordination issues across government of the type necessary
to manage aid-for-trade resources. Inevitably some components saw faster progress than others, but on
balance the quality of implementation was high. Activities undertaken under the TDF have leveraged
significant additional resources to support aid-for-trade in Lao PDR. A number of lessons were learned
during implementation of the TDF, which have informed the design of the follow-up operation (TDF-2).
This include the need in the second phase to focus activities around fewer areas to allow greater depth of
engagement; follow-up activities to consolidate gains and push for further reform, simplification and
harmonization in trade facilitation; the need to leverage the opportunities provided by WTO accession to
deepen regulatory policy reform; and a decision to step back from sector work on competitiveness to
instead provide direct resources at the enterprise level as part of efforts to facilitate broad-based private
sector development.

Project management skills in the National Implementation Unit, the lead coordinating unit for the TDF,
grew substantially over the course of TDF implementation, as did the quality of progress and financial
reporting. The project benefited from a strong and transparent work planning process, with regular six-
monthly steering committee meetings to review progress over the previous six months and approve
detailed work plans for the next six months. The establishment of this system (as part of the National
Integrated Framework Governance Structure), and the clear delegation of authority to high capacity and
well-motivated officials within the MoIC has been a key factor in this success.

The MoIC prepared its own independent evaluation report on the TDF prior to project closing. A brief
summary of this report, as well as comments received at the Program Executive Committee meeting
where the report was presented, is provided in Annex 7.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Lao PDR now has an effective and well-functioning aid-for-trade management structure (the National
Integrated Framework Governance Structure), that has seen substantial growth in capacity over the life of
the TDF. This has been recognized within the global Integrated Framework program where Laos is now
considered to be a model case study on the effective management and use of aid-for-trade resources. A
key achievement was the endorsement in 2012 of an updated Diagnostic Trade and Integration Study
(DTIS), setting out an updated framework for Lao PDR's trade and integration priorities. While the
original 2006 DTIS was carried out by the Bank, the 2012 update was prepared directly by the
government (the first time that an LDC has successfully updated a DTIS "in house").

An enlarged multi donor trust fund to support the second phase of the program (TDF-2), with increased
donor contributions and new donors joining the program (including IDA) is a strong indication of
"crowding in" and increased development partner confidence in the project management capacity of the
MoIC to manage aid-for-trade resources in Lao PDR.

         Box 4: The Garments Skills Development Centre – addressing labor mismatches in the Lao
                                          manufacturing sector

  For the Lao garment industry, labor productivity is critical for the industry to remain competitive. Labor is the
  only factor that the industry requires locally as all other inputs are imported. On average, this represents around
  20 percent of garment production costs. While real wages in Lao PDR continue to rise, labor productivity
  remains low in most industries including in garments. Despite trade preference access for the EU and US, the
  industry struggles to compete with more competitive exporters in Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh.
  However, in the context of a natural resources boom, the garments manufacturing sector is one of the few
  industries that creates meaningful employment opportunities (of which a majority of workers are female
  migrants from rural areas).

  Like other sectors, the garment industry also faces shortage of semi-skilled workers and has high turnover rate,
  with firms losing as many as 6 percent of workers per month. Larger garment manufacturing firms recognize
  the need to invest in better technology, logistics and human resources to enhance export competitiveness. Firms
  often run their own in-house basic training for entry-level operators as well as some supervisory coaching.
  However, it is more challenging for them to run more advanced training for supervisors and team leaders. In
  2011, the Association of the Lao Garment Industries (ALGI) and the Ministry of Industry established the
  Garment Skills Development Center (GSC), with the support of resources from the Trade Development Facility.

  In response to the primary objective of the industry to increase labor productivity, GSC engages with
  manufacturers offering demand-driven, fee-based training services. Training courses are tailored to the needs
  and requirements of the industry, and utilize a comprehensive garment skills curriculum adapted from a similar
  facility in Indonesia, including on areas such as line leading and balancing, quality management, leadership and
  motivational skills.

  The GSC is in the early stages of development, still expanding product offerings and working to achieve full
  cost recovery in an environment where only a limited number of firms are willing to pay for employee training.
  However, early impact evaluation of on-site training services delivered for supervisory skills in the factory has
  shown an average 18 percent increase in daily productivity among targeted production lines, using industry
  measures of productivity (Standard Allowed Minutes).

6. Lessons Learned

Key lessons learned for the Lao trade program during the implementation of TDF-1, and incorporated into
the design of TDF-2 include the following (as highlighted in the PAD for TDF-2):
     Reform momentum needs to be maintained once the goal of WTO accession has been
        achieved. A key lesson that has been learned from reform experiences in other countries that
        have acceded to the WTO is that momentum can be lost once the incentive of accession is
        removed. MoIC may lose influence and convening power in the post accession period, and
        struggle to ensure follow through with efforts to continue streamlining of regulations. This will
        require significant efforts to raise awareness on the benefits of maintaining a WTO-consistent
        regulatory framework, not simply for the sake of acceding to the WTO but as a broader means of
        building economic competitiveness. It is, however, expected that the focus will shift
        progressively to pending regional/ASEAN commitments, many of which are linked to aspects of
        the WTO agreements.
     Similarly, it may also be appropriate to respond more rapidly to emerging trade policy
        needs. A constant challenge under TDF-1 has been how to balance careful planning and
        accountability with being able to respond rapidly to emerging priorities. This has, at times,
        created tension with other project modalities, particularly those where implementation takes place
        outside of government and such projects can respond more quickly with the rapid mobilization of
        resources.
     Translating reforms into results takes time. The time it takes to implement institutional
        reforms, and for those reforms to translate into results that are visible to the private sector can be
        long and uncertain. Similarly, trade outcomes are rarely under the total control of policymakers in
        the way that specific policy levers may be. A multiplicity of stakeholders, particularly for the type
        of second generation reforms towards which Lao PDR is moving, can make it hard to sustain
        reform momentum. Thus it is appropriate to adopt a more realistic level of ambition and focus
        more deeply in fewer areas, and then clearly monitor results achievement over time.
     The complexity of moving to a full program based approach will be taxing on the
        implementation team. This will require continued and deepened investments in capacity
        development for the long term, as well as continued partnerships with initiatives financed outside
        the TDF. The capacity of MoIC has grown progressively and significant lessons have been
        learned by both the client and TDF donors during the implementation of TDF-1.

More general lessons for application in countries undertaking similar aid-for-trade programs, particularly
Least Developed Countries in the context of the EIF program are as follows:
    Projects that are aligned with government priorities (in this case the DTIS Action Matrix and
       NSEDP) and adopt the principles of participatory preparation have the best chance of obtaining
       continued government ownership and support.
    Better quality of project at entry will permit a better allocation of resources (even the
       elimination of project components as too complex for the resources at hand), avoid
       implementation delays, and complex and lengthy negotiations with potential beneficiaries.
    It is very important to make the most of political commitment to reform. The commitment of
       the GoL to join the WTO opened the door to a number of key reforms on trade facilitation and on
       SPS/TBT that might have taken many years to occur otherwise, or would have been implemented
       out of line with international standards.
    Support for improving the overall business environment has a greater chance of success than
       selectively supporting priority sectors.
    Be flexible, not dogmatic in component design and implementation and adjust to the concerns
       of the beneficiaries. Allowing a more gradual implementation of the Lao Trade Portal (without in
       the first instance insisting on process simplification) allowed the project to proceed with full and
       continued backing of the beneficiary.

                                                     29
      Capacity building of government staff and the private sector is essential for the
       sustainability of project results. Much was gained by devoting substantial project resources to
       build up that capacity of the NIU and by disseminating WTO agenda across the country. TDF-2
       will benefit from having the support of a fully effective NIU and thus will, in all likelihood, avoid
       excessive implementation delays. Similarly, capacity building for research and policy analysis
       needs to be closely integrated with operational project activities.
      The availability of resources to provide for high intensity implementation support and
       complementary analytical work on trade was essential. This included the establishment of a
       full-time, in-country facilitation team, as well as significant specialized support from the
       International Trade Department. This level of intensity of support was possible only through the
       provision of resources from the Bank-executed portion of the TDF MDTF.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce commissioned its own independent Implementation Completion
Report prior to closing of the TDF project. The report was an extensive document that was prepared
drawing broadly on the World Bank’s own ICR methodology. It reviewed not only the TDF but also the
other AfT projects managed by the NIU. A summary of this report is included in Annex 7, along with the
comments of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the ICR prepared by the World Bank. The
government’s view is that the TDF performed well and was instrumental in contributing towards key
national achievements, highlighting accession to the WTO as well as preparation for the ASEAN
Economic Community in particular. The Ministry also stressed the importance of the TDF MDTF in
building a platform for improved inter-agency coordination, strengthened dialogue with development
partners and increased national ownership of Lao PDR’s Aid for Trade program.

(b) Co-financiers/Donors

Comments and feedback were solicited from the three contributors to the TDF MDTF: Australia, the
European Union and Germany, copies of which are included in Annex 8. The three donors expressed
broad satisfaction with the TDF and concurred with the assessment presented in the ICR. There was
common appreciation of the role of the TDF in facilitating improved coordination in the delivery and
management of AfT resources in Lao PDR and of strengthened policy dialogue on trade related issues
between the government and development partners. All three donors to the first phase of the TDF have
made commitments to the second phase of the program, reflecting a high degree of confidence in an
established mechanism for supporting the government’s AfT program (in addition, new donors have also
joined the second phase). However, a number of areas were also identified where the co-financiers would
like to see increased focus during the second phase, including the need for greater private sector
participation and a stronger focus on business enabling environment issues, greater prioritization and
efforts to ensure linkages among and between activities, as well as more focus on effectiveness and
efficiency at the activity level.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

A range of other partners and stakeholders were consulted during the preparation of the ICR, including
from the private sector, other government agencies and development partners. A list of persons met is
included in Annex 9. Discussion also took place during the Trade Program Executive Committee meeting
in April 2013 at which a draft of the government’s own independent Implementation Completion Report
was presented for feedback.

Annex 2: Outputs by Component


Component A: Trade Facilitation
This component of the TDF focused on providing support to a series of activities aiming to improve trade
facilitation, focusing principally on non-customs agencies. Activities benefited from a strong technical
implementation team that grew in capacity and confidence over the course of the project. Significant
results have been achieved, including the preparation, subsequent approval by the national Cabinet, and
commencement of implementation of the National Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan. Similarly
a permanent National Trade Facilitation Secretariat has been established via a Decision of the Deputy
Prime Minister as part of efforts to improve coordination among public sector agencies operating at the
border.
     The launch of the Lao PDR Trade Portal in June 2012 was a major achievement and the result of
          two years of preparatory work. The portal, which fulfills WTO and ASEAN commitments, is a
          key part of efforts to reduce barriers to entry and improve trade transparency and predictability
          for the private sector. It puts all trade related laws, regulations, tariffs, licensing requirements and
          measures into the public domain for the first time in Lao PDR (www.laotradeportal.gov.la) -
          making the country one of the first within ASEAN to meet publication requirements under the
          ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, and also fulfilling obligations under the WTO Trade
          Facilitation Agreement. More recently the Lao Trade Portal has been highlighted as a good
          practice model across the Bank and by a number of other international organizations. The
          Ministry of Industry and Commerce has also licensed the Trade Portal system to Lesotho and
          received similar interest from Nepal and Cambodia.
     In March 2013, a detailed roadmap for process simplification and harmonization among non-
          customs border agencies received high-level endorsement. The roadmap sets out a detailed
          program of work to restructure business processes among non-customs border agencies (moving
          from "as is" processes to a "to be" model), with implementation to take place under the follow-up
          operation (TDF-2). The Trade Portal reports legislation and regulations on SPS and TBT but has
          not yet been able to fully translate these regulations in “measures” that can guide traders in their
          operations. Automation of the trade related processes in line ministries and agencies will be
          greatly facilitated by the existence of the Portal and will be taken up when the Single Window—
          supported by the World Bank’s global Trade Facilitation Facility MDTF—is launched.

Results indicators suggest that Lao PDR's performance on trade facilitation and logistics has improved
significantly over the course of TDF implementation, but that a large gap with regional comparator
countries remains. Similarly, while the private sector recognizes that improvements have been made in
terms of processing times and transparency, expectations have also risen.
     The Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan for 2011-2015 were approved in July 2011 after
         intense public consultation.
     A permanent National Trade Facilitation Secretariat has been established as part of efforts to
         improve coordination among public sector agencies operating at the border.
     The Lao Trade Portal was launched in July 2011 and represents a major achievement in that by
         consolidating prevailing trade related regulation in one accessible place it has greatly enhanced
         the transparency of trade related regulations.

Component B: Strengthening SPS and TBT Framework
This component provided support to the modernization of the legal and regulatory framework for SPS and
TBT. After a slow start and significant coordination challenges, good results have been achieved with
progressively stronger inter-agency coordination - driven in part by pressing WTO accession

                                                       32
requirements. A TBT regulatory gaps assessment was satisfactorily completed in mid 2011 and as of early
2013, a financing is under preparation to obtain resources from the Enhanced Integrated Framework to
implement the TBT action plan.

The SPS risk based policies work program achieved solid results with the formal establishment of an
inter-agency SPS Risk Evaluation Group, building on significant capacity investments and experience of
practice risk analysis gained. Follow-up work on this will be taken forward under the new SPS Handling
Project financed by the Asian Development Bank.

Similarly, after some delays the SPS Legal Services assignment (the largest and most substantial part of
the component and contracted to FAO) has made significant progress supporting SPS legal drafting as
part of WTO accession efforts. Timely and high-quality support to the preparation of a number of key
legislative instruments was provided during WTO negotiations, with follow-up work in support of post-
accession obligations set to take place as part of TDF-2.
     Legal and regulatory reforms have led to a substantial closure in the gap between the current legal
         and regulatory framework on SPS issues which was required to facilitate trade, protect health and
         help Lao PDR to accede to the WTO.
     Four key pieces of SPS related legislation have been approved (Decision on Food Inspections ,
         Decree Implementing the Law on Plant Protection, Decree on Animal Movement Control ,Decree
         on Animal Disease Control and Prevention )
     A TBT regulatory gaps assessment was satisfactorily completed and financing to implement the
         TBT action plan is expected to be acquired from the EIF.
     Some progress in establishing the SPS risk based policies framework achieved with the creation
         of the REG; but this group is not yet operational and further work will be required (and will be
         taken up under a new SPS handling project financed by the ADB).

Rating: Satisfactory

Component C: Improving Competitiveness and Business Environment
This component provided for a series of sector competitiveness studies, followed by pilot implementation
of sub-projects in selected sectors. The results in this component have been mixed, with very strong
results in the garments sub-project, but more disappointing results in other sub-projects (handicrafts,
agribusiness and secondary wood processing). Component C also saw much weaker implementation
arrangements than under other components of the project. Experience gained under this component has
fed directly into the design of the follow-op operation (TDF-2), where there will be a movement away
from sectoral competitiveness interventions (with the exception of garments).
     Very promising results have been achieved in the garments sub-project with the establishment of
         a well-managed Garment Skills Development Centre operating under the supervision of the
         Association of Lao Garment Industries, one of the strongest sectoral business associations in Lao
         PDR. Measured growth in the delivery of fee-based productivity training services shows evidence
         of private sector demand being met by the Centre and is a vital step towards achieving the
         financial sustainability. The Centre has adopted a strong results focus from the outset, and uses
         productivity improvement data from previous clients as part of its marketing strategy when
         approaching potential new clients. The evaluation of in-house training events suggest that the
         productivity of production lines improved by 48 percent, overall productivity rose by 18 percent,
         and supervisor’s performance improved by 43 percent. Participants in the training courses
         indicated a 90 percent satisfaction with the relevance of the course material and achieved an 80
         percent score on the end of course tests.

Additional support to the Centre will be provided under the follow-up operation (TDF-2), as part of a
larger engagement of labor standards and productivity in the Lao manufacturing sector.

In the handicrafts sub-sector, resources were provided over a number of years to support the annual Lao
Handicrafts Festival. A detailed business plan for Festival has also been completed and is under
implementation as part of efforts to improve commercialization and move towards greater cost recovery.
Training was also provided to handicrafts firms to improve access to markets through better use of e-
commerce. However, it is unclear if this has resulted in significant impact in terms of increased sales. A
related Sustainable Silk Production Partnership Project emerged out of this component, financed via a
grant from the Japan Social Development Fund.

Good quality analysis has been undertaken to map the market potential to link local agribusiness
(vegetable) producers to the tourism sector in Luang Prabang and joint pilot activities have commenced
with the UN Trade Cluster Project, financed by Switzerland/SECO. However, there are concerns about
sustainability and finding a viable exit strategy. An export facilitation / phytosanitary testing laboratory
has been established in Champasak to support improved export market access for vegetables based on
analytical work on agribusiness in the south of the country undertaken as part of the component. However,
there are similar concerns as to the longer term sustainability of this facility and of real private sector
demand being met.

Activities in the secondary wood processing sub-sector were scaled back given insufficient evidence of
demand from the private sector, with more limited activities focusing on building the capacity of the
Wood Processing/Furniture Association.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Component D: Capacity Building, Trade Policy, Trade Agreements and Global Opportunities and
Agreements
This component provided for a set of support measures aiming to improve Lao PDR's ability to engage
effectively in the regional and multilateral trading system. Activities have been principally focused
around support to WTO accession efforts, where implementation benefited from a committed and
motivated implementation team.

WTO accession activities, supported in part under Component D of the TDF, saw substantial progress
throughout the life of the project and in particular during 2012 with the completion of three working party
negotiations (previously during Lao PDR's 15 year accession period, working parties have never taken
place more frequently than once per year) and the completion of all remaining bilateral negotiations with
key working party members. Lao PDR's WTO accession package was finally approved by WTO members
in late October 2012, with formal accession taking place in February 2013. This is possibly the most
significant result achieved under the project. The TDF provided for a large, long-time and full-time team
to support WTO negotiations, including the only full-time lawyer in the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce, and financed the bulk of the direct costs of negotiations (including the holding of working
party and bilateral negotiations). Good quality accession impact analyses have also been undertaken in a
series of sub-sectors including on professional services (law, accountancy and engineering) distribution
services (including wholesale, retail and franchising) and financial services (insurance). Additional
activities on regional/ASEAN integration have also been undertaken during the latter stages of project
implementation (as focus has begun to shift from WTO towards pressing ASEAN commitments),
including analysis on preference utilization and market access, overlapping agreements, and a business
guide towards ASEAN opportunities.

Promising results have also been achieved in trade research activities, including the design of a
curriculum and pilot delivery of an advanced trade policy and competitiveness short course for civil
servants, the holding of a series of regular Trade Research Forums, and the publication of three editions

of the Lao Trade Research Digest. Given the large amount of training activities undertaken through this
component, a monitoring system was put in place to measure satisfaction and relevance among training
participants. However, engagement between ERIT and other departments within MoIC remains rather
weak with both demand (from other departments) and supply (of ERIT’s services) rather limited.
     Support to the preparatory work for WTO accession was highly successful and resulted in formal
        WTO accession in February 2013. The project financed background studies, extensive legal
        advice and the costs of part taking in the several working parties. Support of the USAID/LUNA
        project, among others, also contributed to this positive outcome.
     The MoIC ERIT designed and delivered advanced trade policy, competitiveness and management
        courses for MoIC staff at headquarters and in the provinces, undertook academic research,
        published several issues of the Lao Trade Research Digest and organized a number of research
        forum events.

Component E: Strengthening the National Implementation Unit
This component provided for capacity investments in the National Implementation Unit, the core anchor
team responsible for managing aid-for-trade resources in Lao PDR as part of the National Integrated
Framework Governance Structure. After four years of implementing the TDF, the initially rather
inexperienced staff at the NIU have grown into an increasingly seasoned team. Staff are ambitious, highly
motivated and supported by high-level management with clearly delegated responsibilities. The unit,
initially spun out of the General Division in the Foreign Trade Policy Department has become the Foreign
Aid Division and forms the heart of the newly established Planning and Cooperation Department in the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Capacity growth has also been seen on technical issues, with
significant experience gained in the NIU from the process of leading the development of an update to the
Diagnostic Trade and Integration Study (the first time this has been successfully undertaken "in house" by
an LDC government - the original DTIS was prepared in 2006 by the World Bank).

A well-developed work planning process across implementing departments and coordinated by the NIU,
has emerged as one of the enduring strengths of the TDF. This capacity will serve as the foundation for
the follow-up operation (TDF-2). An enlarged Multi Donor Trust Fund to provide financing for TDF-2,
with increased donor commitments and with new donors joining the MDTF as well as a commitment
from IDA, provides strong evidence of increased development partner confidence in the capacity of the
MoIC NIU to effectively manage aid-for-trade resources in Lao PDR. The challenge for the next phase
will be for the team to continue to meet and exceed expectations that are now higher, with increased
policy reform ambitions and an enlarged resource envelope.
     Capacity building in the NIU has endowed the MoIC with a strong unit responsible for managing
         AfT resources in Lao PDR as part of the National Integrated Framework Governance Structure.
     The NIU has become the Foreign Aid Division within the new Planning and Cooperation
         Department of the MoIC and manages the procurement and financial management not only for
         the TDF but also for several other aid-for-trade projects. The share of TRTA received by Lao
         PDR that is managed by the NIU has grown considerably over the life of the TDF, as donor
         resources have “crowded in”.
     The successful completion of the 2012 DTIS update “in house” by the MoIC NIU was a major
         achievement among participating LDCs in the EIF program.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis


The activities supported under the TDF all followed proven approaches in their respective fields. In
appraising activities, particular attention was given to the existing capacity constraints of the core
implementing departments.

Trade Facilitation. High trade transaction costs have been shown throughout developing countries to act
as a major barrier to competitiveness, especially so in landlocked developing countries that already face
considerable geographic constraints 18 . While the country has made significant improvements in
improving border performance through major reforms and investments, Lao PDR still lags behind
regional competitors19. Border performance will need to be above regional averages in order to offset the
disadvantages of being landlocked.

SPS/TBT. Trade in agricultural products is a major source of demand in Lao PDR and, in the context of a
mining and hydropower boom, one of the few sectors that has the potential to general significant income
generation and employment opportunities in rural areas (with significant pro-poor and gender positive
outcomes)20. However, lack of a modern regulatory framework and increasingly high standards in middle-
income regional markets pose threats to further increases in the trade of SPS-sensitive products21.

Trade Policy. Effective participation in the fast growing regional economy requires predictable and
transparent trade policy and regulations. Lao PDR has made significant reforms as part of the WTO
accession process, but ensuring that the private sector fully benefits from these reforms will required
additional efforts to follow through with both multilateral and regional (ASEAN) commitments, and to
fully disseminate, implement and enforce enacted legislation.

Competitiveness. Activities under this component aimed to support improved private sector
competitiveness and trade diversification in the context of an ongoing natural resources boom. This
approach is informed by significant analysis of the risks of lack of diversification faced in Lao PDR22, and
on the export survival challenges faced by Lao firms when entering new markets23. Similarly, activities to
improve manufacturing competitiveness through improved labor productivity in the garments sector build
on successful experiences gained through the Better Work/Better Factories approaches in Cambodia and
Vietnam, as well as on research conducted in Lao PDR24.

   Cross-country research has shown that each additional day that a product is delayed prior to being shipped reduces trade by at
least 1 percent. Or put differently, each day of delay is equivalent on average to a country distancing itself from its trading
partners by an additional 70km. Estimates of the costs of poor trade facilitation are even higher for perishable agricultural
products, where a day’s delay reduces a country’s relative exports of time-sensitive to time-insensitive agricultural goods by 6
percent. See Djankov, Freund and Pham (2006) ‘Trading on Time’, Policy Research Working Paper No. 3909, Washington DC:
The World Bank.

   See data from the Logistics Performance Index, the 2011 Lao PDR Investment Climate Assessment and the 2012 Lao PDR

Strengthening of the NIU. There is growing cross-country evidence on the returns to be obtained from a
well-coordinated and coherent approach to managing and absorbing trade related technical assistance.
This has been demonstrated primarily through the Integrated Framework/Enhanced Integrated Framework
program to support the effective participation of LDCs in the multilateral trading system and the
mainstreaming of trade into national development strategies. Similarly, prior to TDF-1, aid-for-trade in
Lao PDR was characterized by very few projects being implemented by the government with significant
overlaps and gaps in assistance, limited government ownership and poor impact. While challenges clearly
remain, progress made in building government capacity to manage aid-for-trade (through the NIU and
across MoIC) under TDF-1 has begun to demonstrate meaningful results in terms of aid management
capacity and effectiveness of project delivery.

Participants included representatives from all government departments involved in, and benefitting from
aid-for-trade interventions, the private sector and development partners. Substantive comments were
received, and incorporated into the revised and final version of the independent evaluation report.

The Bank’s own two-week ICR mission followed on from the completion of the MoIC independent
evaluation report, and included discussion with all key stakeholders involved in the implementation of the
TDF (see Annex 9 for the list of persons met). A wrap-up discussion was held with key stakeholders at
the conclusion of the mission on May 3, 2013.

Annex 7: Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR27


The MoIC commissioned its own independent ICR that was discussed at a very well attended Fourth
Program Executive Committee Meeting held in Vientiane on April 3, 2013. The government’s ICR was
an extensive document that was prepared drawing broadly on the World Bank’s own ICR methodology. It
reviewed not only the TDF but also the other AfT projects managed by the NIU. It contained an
exhaustive narrative pertaining to the implementation processes of the TDF, the implementation of its
various components, an evaluation of the various components as implemented and an overall evaluation
of the project.

This Annex reports briefly on the overall evaluation contained in the government’s ICR and on the main
conclusions of the meeting as recorded in the minutes.

Comments from the MoIC on the ICR prepared by the World Bank follow.

          1. Summary of findings related to the TDF

The TDF’s overall assessment is rated as “satisfactory” based on the results for the set of issues covered
by the evaluation criteria. Ratings for each issue within the evaluation criteria are given an equal weight
to arrive at an overall evaluation score for each criterion. The results for the overall TDF-1 assessment are
as follows:

     Relevance         Effectiveness         Efficiency            Sustainability      Gender               Overall
          5.8                2.5                  4.5                    5.3               4.0                  5.0
       Highly           Satisfactory         Moderately             Satisfactory      Moderately           Satisfactory
     Satisfactory                           Satisfactory to                           Satisfactory
                                                 Fully
                                             Satisfactory

Relevance – The TDF-1 responded to key needs and challenges faced by the GoL and businesses, and it
had strong synergies with other trade-related technical assistance. It also responded well to the changing
circumstances in the international and domestic environments, particularly in terms of the growing
importance and opportunities for private sector-led export growth in the region and global economy.

Effectiveness – The program achieved or exceeded most of its targets under the results framework and
generally contributed in a substantial way to faster and more transparent trade; improved integration into
multilateral trading system; increased skills and productivity in particular export sectors, most notably
that of the garments industry; and increased AfT management capacity.

Efficiency – Project activities were generally efficient in their implementing modalities, composition of
inputs, and interaction with beneficiaries. Activities were well articulated and complemented other trade-
related activities and the GoL’s overall strategy and action plan under the National Social and Economic
Development Plan. Despite start-up delays, nearly all activities were delivered in a timely and cost-
efficient manner.

  Montague Lord, Independent Evaluation of the Trade Development Facility Project, February 2013, draft report presented to
the National Implementation Unit of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.

                                                              41
Sustainability – The TDF-1 has been especially noteworthy in two areas: first, the trust fund has had
strong ownership by the Government; second, it has involved substantial intra and inter-ministerial
collaboration. The increasing shift from donor to national management of resources has made an
important contribution to the institutional capacity of the MoIC and has helped to ensure that issues
surrounding activity prioritization and cost-effectiveness are sustained in the future.

Gender Issues – Although there was no mention of gender issues in the TDF PAD, the TDF program
supported a major training intervention in the garments industry, an industry where employment is highly
female intensive.

        2. Key discussion points and conclusion of the meeting

a. On the key TDF-1 achievements: the assessment presented is part of a broader assessment process,
   which includes project completion report prepared by MOIC, and an ICR to be prepared by the World
   Bank, where MoIC’s assessment will be used as key input;
b. Regarding questions raised about the baseline data for the results framework, the meeting clarified
   that baseline data are based on 2008 data; the NIU maintains the data including updates for all the
   indicators;
c. Highlights of key results from TDF-1 include significant improvement in national capacity to manage
   TRTA including completion of the first ever nationally led DTIS; development of the Lao Trade
   Portal, meeting WTO and ASEAN repository requirements (the design and functionalities of the
   Trade Portal is currently being replicated in Lesotho); WTO accession, and others;
d. Although clearly some things worked better than others, TDF-1 has been a commendable success,
   especially given the capacity limitations at the start of implementation. There have been many
   important lessons learned through the course of TDF-1 implementation, which have informed the
   design of the follow-on operation (TDF-2) which has benefited from increased donor resources being
   made available;
e. On the draft TDF-1 evaluation commissioned by MoIC, the overall view of the meeting was that the
   assessment is comprehensive, however in finalizing the report, it is recommended to strengthen the
   following aspects:
        Effectiveness. More analysis is needed around outcomes/impacts as outlined in the PAD.
        Results framework. More elaboration is required on the underlying project logic for a trade-
           related technical assistance project, from trade policy/capacity building/regulatory reform, to
           reduced compliance costs, to changed private sector activity, to increased trade,
           growth/poverty reduction.
        Efficiency. A greater focus is needed, particularly in the future under TDF-2, on “value for
           money”. This does not necessarily mean cutting spending but achieving greater results, cost-
           efficiency, better justification why certain project activities are supported, and what can be
           done better. More analysis of the linkages and complementarities between workshops,
           trainings, studies and dissemination events across different components would help the
           broader policy development process.
        Sustainability. More assessment of the sustainability of interventions and changes brought
           about by the TDF would improve the report.
        Gender. Gender was not sufficiently considered in the PAD due to limited understanding of
           gender dimensions/linkages with trade in the Lao context at the time of project preparation.
           However, TDF-1 has been instrumental in supporting studies and research to get a better
           understanding of issues and inform future programing. The net result is that the body of
           knowledge of trade and gender issues in Lao PDR is now much improved, and the results of
           this work has ensured that TDF-2 is fully gender informed.

   Description of the evaluation methodology. It would be useful to describe the evaluation
    methodology in more depth, including an indication of how recommendations from the
    assessment will be taken into consideration by MoIC in the future.
   While recognizing differences in implementation models, some participants highlighted a
    number of activities jointly supported by the TDF and other donor supported projects
    (including the LUNA project) and commented that successful collaboration between the two
    projects should be more clearly highlighted in the evaluation.

Ms. Kelko Miwa
Country Manager, Lao PDR
East Asia and Pa:ific Region
The World Bank

       Thank you for sharing the draft I mplementation Compl"'tio-. M d Rf~ults Report
(ICR) for the Lao PDR Trade Development Fadlity Project (TDF) for comments by the
Ministry of I ndustry and Commerce (Mo!C).

       First, I wculd like to congratulate the World Bank, in close cooperatlcn with other
Partners (Austra ia, the European Union, and Germany), for the successft.J completion
of the TDF-1. This project has been challenging for the MoiC on many levels, but the
success of the project has reassured us to be on the right track. Nevertheless, with
reference to the "highly satisfactory" performance of the project In the majotity of
indicators (as outlined in the I CR) and moderate risk, I would like to recommend to rate
the overall performance of the proj ect also with "highly satisfactory".

        The TDF has contributed, In close cooperation with the Govern m~nt of Loo PDR
and other development partners, to major achievements such as the accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on 2 February 2013 as well as preparing Lao PDR for
the upcoming ASEAN Economic Community 2015. In particllar, the TDF has
significantly Increased ownership of the Lao PDR Aid for Trade program across all
implementing agencies. The prospects of joining the WTO has facilitated Inter-agency
coordination and allowed to establish a well-functioning ooordination structure. The
capacity of the MoiC, and In particular the National Implementation Unit (NIU), leaves
the Government of Lao PDR with an effective and efficient stnucture to coordinate
future trade-related assistance to tackle future developmerlt challenges.

       One of the key development challenges for the MoiC is how to best utilize t he
opportunities offered by WTO accession and ASEAN Economic Cc mmunity in 20 15 for
the private sector and mitigate possible negative effects. Particular atterntion will be
paid towards maintaining the reform momentum the WTO accession has created and
implement commitments. The second TDF, which was established as a follow-on project




                                         44
        to the first TDF due to the great success, will be the main source of flnandng to
        Implement the Roadmap of the OTIS 2012 Update.

               In the long-run, it is also critical to ensure sustainability of the project. Over the
        course of the TDF-1 project, the Moi C has Increased the r umber of Government officers
        engaged In the project, working side-by-side with national and in:emational experts in
        order to maximize the benefit for the Governm ent. I would like to emphasize the
        Importance of this knowledge transfer to Government staff as well as reassure the
        continuation to do so In the flllture.

               I further would like to highlight the good cooperation between the Government
        of Lao PDR and the World Bank, as trust fund manager·    . However, a major challenge
        under TDF-2 will be to improve cooperation between development partners/donors in
        tihe area of trade and private sector development. The· goal is to use the Program
        Executive Committee (PEC) as the main coordination body for all ongoing trade-related
        assistance within MoiC.

              Lastly, I would like to thank all development par:ners contributing to the TDF
        and reassure that the MoiC remains committed under the TDF-2 to successfully
        implement the project and working towards tangible resul:s.

           Thank you for sharing the drnft TDF completion report and opportunity to provide comments.
           We appreciate Lhat our initial comments are rctlected in the revised draft report.

           We broadly agree with the TDF overall assessment as satisfactory. However, although TDF is
           considered to be a good example and has delivered a good result, there is still room for
           improvement in number of areas. These include improved inter-agency coordination; more effort
           to priori lise high impact activities and therefore improving cost-eflectiveness; and creating better
           linkages between the components {e.g. research being linked to policy refonn). The lessons
           learned section of the JCR report provides a useful reflection on TDF implementation.

            We commend the World Bank TDF Facilitation Team for their great contribution and S'llpport to
            this program. We have appreciated their approach and their responsiveness to our priorities. We
            look forward to on-going cooperntioo during the implemeotmion of the second phase of the TDF.

            We look fo rward to our cominued cooperation.

I would like to thank you tOr sharing wnh us the draft com:>leuon report of the abovt-
menl ioned project In this regard. I am pleased to note that the earlier E.L 's comments have
been incorporated into lhis te'Yised \•enoiun.

I agree with the general conclusions of the repon it>eluding Slltisfactory results of TDF as
regards 1ts efficiency in delivery based on the agreed work plan. TDF also made an tmpcrtant
contribution to enhance cfTectivcness of Aid for Trade activit-   ies in Laos in partf:ular to
impro\•e coordination across relevant ministries, development panners and between the
govemmem and development partners under Trade Programme Executive Commiucc
S-tmcture This mechanism provides valuable inputs to help us .:Ostering the policy dialogue
with lhc government under the Trade and Priva[e Sector Development Worl.ing Group.

I would however like to note the project impact is somewhat less tangible in its effects to
improve business environment for the private sector. A high Jevel of technical barriers for
trade across the border still exist~ and there has been a relatively low le\'C: I of private sector
awureness and involvement in TDF, in particular concerning the activities on trade policy. We
would therefore like to request that the World Bank i s payi11g particular t.ttention tc further
engage strategically the private sector in TDF2 activities to cost rc the project bring concn:te
benefits to the private. sector.

I look forward to our continued cooperation.

Yours sincerely.

    Dear Ms Miwa,

    we very much appreciate the World Bank's efforts in drafting this very informative
    and concise Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report for the first phase
    of the Lao PDR Trade Development Facility (TDF). We believe that in general the
    ICR report provides a good outline of the project concept and implemen:atlon as well
    as the achieved results and lessons learned.
    We woulu wel ~ome a more comprehensive review of the results achieved through
    the TDF. We recommend to undertake a more in-depth assessment of how out-
    comes are related to specific interventions. In add~ion, a close examination of the In-
    put-output ratio could provide useful insights for further optimizing the effectiveness
    <tnd efficiency of the TDF.
    We would like to use the opportun~ to express our sincere appreciation for the fruit-
    ful and close cooperation with the World Bank, the European Commission and Aus-
    Aid in the framework of TDF I and looking forward to continuing our joint engagement
    in the second phase of the TDF.


    Kind regards,

Annex 11: Aid-For-Trade in Lao PDR


The following short note provides a summary overview of the major related projects currently providing
aid-for-trade resources to Lao PDR, and the broader context of donor assistance into which the TDF
(including both TDF-1 and TDF-2) is located. In a number of areas, effective partnership arrangements
have been established between aid-for-trade projects operating through government systems and those
operating outside.

The Second Trade Development Facility Project (US$ 14.0m, 2013-17) is the largest source of trade
related technical assistance to Lao PDR, and is co-financed jointly by Australia/AusAID, the European
Union, Germany/GIZ, Irish Aid and the World Bank. The project is informed by priorities in the 2012
DTIS update and focuses on trade facilitation, trade policy, support to diversification and competitiveness
and the building Lao institutions responsible for managing aid-for-trade. It follows on the First Trade
Development Facility Project (US$ 7.6m, 2008-2013), which provided resources to support the
implementation of the original DTIS action matrix. Both TDF and TDF-2 are implemented by the MoIC.
In addition, and with financing from the World Bank-Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF), a
Sustainable Silk Production Partnership Project (US$ 1.8m, 2011-15) aims to develop domestic
supply chains in the production of silk products through a market based approach. The JSDF Silk project
is implemented as part of the TDF.

The World Bank/IDA Customs and Trade Facilitation Project (US$ 12.5m, 2008-16) is financing the
automation of customs systems through the installation of ASYCUDA and related regulatory reforms and
adjustments necessary to operate a modernized declaration processing system. The project is implemented
by the Lao Customs Department, MoF and aims to facilitate trade by improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of customs administration. The project is simplifying customs procedures, eliminating
duplication and redundancy, reducing transactions costs and time to clear goods, and increasing
transparency and accountability. The World Bank is also financing inputs towards the design of a next
phase of customs administration through a Lao National Single Window Preparation Project
(US$ 1.35m, 2012-13) with resources from the global Trade Facilitation Facility. Once implemented the
National Single Window system will allow traders to submit all import, export and transit information
required by regulatory agencies via a single electronic gateway instead of submitting essentially the same
information numerous times to different government entities, some that are automated and others that still
rely heavily on paper.

Trade and investment climate issues form one of five core components in the annual Poverty Reduction
Support Operations (PRSO4-US$ 10m, 2008; PRSO5–US$ 20m, 2009; PRSO6–US$ 20m, 2010;
PRSO7–US$ 10m, 2011; PRSO8–US$ 20m, 2012) as part of direct general budget support/development
policy grants by the World Bank, with parallel financing by Australia, the European Union and Japan.
The PRSOs have supported a series of reforms associated with trade facilitation, investment policy and
customs modernization.

The Enhanced Integrated Framework (US$ 1.3m, 2010-13), financed from the EIF Multi Donor Trust
Fund28, has provided Tier 1 resources to support capacity development in the NIU and an update to the

   The EIF is a global multi donor initiative aiming to facilitate the effective participation of LDCs in the multilateral trading
system. The program, which is operated out of the WTO Secretariat in Geneva, was established by the International Monetary
Fund, the International Trade Centre, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations
Development Program and the World Bank. The EIF Multi Donor Trust Fund, which has received contributions from more than
20 donors, is administered by the United Nations Office for Project Services.

Diagnostic Trade Integration Study. Strong partnership arrangements have been established between the
TDF and EIF with shared investments in the NIU and common arrangements to reduce transactions costs
including joint progress reporting, a shared financial year, joint work plans and steering committee
meetings and a single external audit. It is expected that these arrangements will continue under TDF-2.
EIR Tier 2 resources will also be available to support financing gaps for priority trade and private sector
development interventions in Lao PDR, likely to be in areas where the TDF-2 is not providing resources.

The Asian Development Bank is financing two major trade-related projects in Lao PDR: an Improved
SPS Handling in the Greater Mekong Subregion (US$ 13.5m, 2012-17) grant/loan focusing on
building institutional capacity and systems for the administration of sanitary and phytosanitary measures;
and an SME Development Program (US$ 15.0m, 2010-14) grant/loan providing sector budget support
and related technical assistance to support enterprise registration and improved private sector policy. The
ADB GMS SPS Project will be the largest source of financing for investment in SPS measures in Lao
PDR. As such, the proposed TDF-2 SPS legal framework subcomponent has been carefully designed to
complement the ADB project, which will not provide any resources for SPS legal work.

The United States Agency for International Development Laos-US International and ASEAN
Integration (LUNA) Project (US$ 5.3m, 2009-13) provides technical assistance to support the
implementation of the Lao-US bilateral trade agreement, WTO accession and ASEAN commitments. The
project, which focuses primarily on legal technical assistance, has played a key role in the development
process for a range of laws and regulations related to trade agreements including on transparency,
intellectual property, technical barriers to trade, electronic commerce, regulatory impact, commercial
dispute resolution, and on legislation affecting services such as telecoms, insurance and lawyers. Effective
partnership and coordination arrangements have been established between TDF-1 and LUNA based on
recognized relative strengths of the two project approaches, with the TDF able to provide longer term
institutional and capacity building investments, and LUNA able to bring in targeted and highly
specialized legal technical assistance on demand. In some cases this has involved specialization by the
two projects and in other areas joint interventions. It is anticipated that such an approach will continue
under TDF-2. USAID also finances an ASEAN Single Window Project which provides technical
assistance and awareness raising across ASEAN member states, including in Lao PDR. Both projects are
implemented by consulting firms.

Germany, through the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit , is implementing the
third phase of the Human Resource Development for Market Economy Project (EUR 6.8m, 2011-
2014) supporting activities across SME policy and business development support services, public-private
dialogue and vocational training. With resources from the German Monterrey Fund, GIZ also implements
a Supporting Lao Integration into Regional Markets Project (US$ 1.0m, 2011-2013), including
Germany’s contribution to TDF-1.A follow on Regional Integration of Laos into ASEAN, Trade and
Entrepreneurship Development (EUR 6.4m) program is under preparation for the period 2013-2017
aiming to support the integration of Lao PDR into ASEAN (and including GIZ’s contribution to the TDF-
2 MDTF).

The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) financed project Enhancing Sustainable
Tourism, Clean Production and Export Capacity (US$ 4.0m, 2011-2013) provides resources for UN
agencies within the UN Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade and Productive Capacity to provide technical
assistance to Lao PDR, with a focus on trade promotion in the tourism sector. SECO also finances a Lao
WTO Accession Support Project providing direct consultancy services to support WTO negotiations.

The International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, through its Investment
Climate Advisory Services Program, provides technical assistance to the Lao government to improve
the overall enabling environment for doing business. Funded by SECO, the Tax Simplification Project

                                                    55
(US$ 1m, 2012-2015) is supporting efforts to strengthen the tax regulatory environment and improve the
tax administration system for SMEs by increasing transparency, fairness and equity. With co-funding
from Korea, the Regulatory Reform Project (US$ 0.3m, 2012-2015) aims to improve the legal and
regulatory framework related to licensing and on broader regulatory reforms related to the World Bank
Group’s Doing Business indicators. The project follows on from earlier initiatives focusing on support to
preparation and implementation of the Investment Law, and on broader support to public private dialogue
via the Lao Business Forum.
