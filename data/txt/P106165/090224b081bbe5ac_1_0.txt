                         the life of the project. Over the 2008-13 implementation period, Lao PDR has become much more closely integrated into the regional and international economy as measured by
                         substantial increases in trade in goods and services. While significant barriers remain, measured improvements in trade facilitation and logistics have been achieved (particularly in
                         terms of time performance). Activities undertaken with financing from the TDF have contributed towards faster and more transparent trade facilitation; better coordination among
                         government agencies operating at the border; improved integration into the regional and multilateral trading system; increased productivity in the garments export sector (a key

                         diversified manufacturing industry); and increased aid-for-trade management capacity.

                         Key achievements include substantial trade negotiating efforts culminating in Lao PDR's formal accession into the World Trade Organization in February 2013; the approval and
                         implementation of a first National Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan; the establishment of a permanent National Trade Facilitation Secretariat, the launch of an electronic
                         Trade Portal that puts all trade-related information on tariffs, licenses, measures, laws, regulations and import/export procedures into the public domain; the establishment of an inter-
                         agency Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures Risk Evaluation Group; substantial legislative reforms on Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures associated with WTO accession; the
                         completion of a Technical Barriers to Trade diagnostic assessment; the launch of fee-based productivity training services in the Garments Skills Development Centre; support to the
                         operations and commercialization of the Lao Handicrafts Festival; and measured growth in domestic trade policy research capacity, including the design of a technical trade policy
                         and competitiveness curriculum for civil servants and the publication of the Lao Trade Research Digest.

                         Lao PDR now has the key building blocks in place to manage and implement an effective aid-for-trade program, with enlarged capacity and heightened ambitions for the next phase
                         of the program - to commence in early 2013 under the Second Trade Development Facility.
