"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Trade Development\n            Facility (TDF) Project for Lao People's Democratic\n            Republic were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            highly satisfactory and grantee performance was also highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: reform momentum\n            needs to be maintained once the goal of World Trade\n            Organization (WTO) accession has been achieved. A key lesson\n            that has been learned from reform experiences in other\n            countries that have acceded to the WTO is that momentum can\n            be lost once the incentive of accession is removed.\n            Translating reforms into results takes time. The time it\n            takes to implement institutional reforms, and for those\n            reforms to translate into results that are visible to the\n            private sector can be long and uncertain. The complexity of\n            moving to a full program based approach will be taxing on\n            the implementation team. This will require continued and\n            deepened investments in capacity development for the long\n            term, as well as continued partnerships with initiatives\n            financed outside the TDF. Better quality of project at entry\n            will permit a better allocation of resources; avoid\n            implementation delays, and complex and lengthy negotiations\n            with potential beneficiaries. It is very important to make\n            the most of political commitment to reform. Support for\n            improving the overall business environment has a greater\n            chance of success than selectively supporting priority\n            sectors. Be flexible, not dogmatic in component design and\n            implementation and adjust to the concerns of the beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "2013-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
