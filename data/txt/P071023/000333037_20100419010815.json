"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Financial Capacity\n            Development Project for Mongolia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            Bank and Government should be realistic about the risk of\n            procurement delays at the outset to avoid administratively\n            costly extensions or squeezing the timeframe for\n            implementation. The Government and Bank should extend\n            projects if there is a reasonable chance of increasing the\n            developmental impact. The Bank should be realistic about the\n            risks related to designing financial sector projects that\n            target only a few banks. Monitoring and evaluation\n            indicators must be sufficiently demanding if they are to\n            serve as useful tools for a project. For a successful\n            privatization, government must maintain a commitment to a\n            controlled and transparent privatization process. The\n            savings bank privatization in Mongolia demonstrated the\n            well-known lesson that the most important factor affecting\n            outcome is not the government's development of a good\n            action plan, but the Government's commitment to fully\n            implement the plan."}, "docdt": "2010-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
