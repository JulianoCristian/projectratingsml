     Adjustment Credit Project for Kenya was unsatisfactory. The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, institutional\n            development was modest, sustainability is uncertain, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was marginally\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, reform is a technical as well as political\n            process. Second, up-front actions required from the\n            Government before the release of the first tranche were few.\n            This prevented IDA from gauging the political feasibility of\n            some of the components of the reform program, such as bank\n            restructuring. Finally, interest rate liberalization was\n            implemented with success. However, whether its timing was\n            appropriate is questionable."}, "docdt": "1992-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
