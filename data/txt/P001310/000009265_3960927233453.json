The project did not\n            achieve its objectives, institutional development was only\n            partially achieved, sustainability is unlikely, and the\n            performance of the Bank was marginally satisfactory while\n            the Borrower's was unsatisfactory. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, the preconditions for\n            an FSAO must be in place before successful changes in the\n            pattern of credit allocation can be achieved. Second, unless\n            disbursements of the foreign exchange lending accompanying\n            FSAOs are closely controlled, they can offset or contradict\n            the policy aims of the operations. Third, achieving\n            market-determined interest rates requires that the\n            Government operate in at least one truly competitive\n            financial market, be it the market for bonds or foreign\n            currency. Finally, the goal of bank restructuring exercises\n            is to change Bank lending behavior not to make the balance\n            sheets of troubled banks look like those of untroubled banks."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
