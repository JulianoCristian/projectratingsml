liberalization,\n            more active use of generalized monetary policy instruments\n            and reductions in the fiscal deficit. It also includes the\n            revision of banking legislation, improved prudential\n            supervision of the banking industry and a strengthening of\n            the regulatory and incentive framework for capital markets\n            development. The institutional reforms include the\n            restructuring of troubled banks and \"near bank\"\n            financial institutions as well as a strengthening of the\n            Central Bank's capacity to supervise despository\n            institutions.
