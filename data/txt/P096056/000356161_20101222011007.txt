                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Benin Second Multisectoral
HIV/AIDS Project ("Project") is to contribute to: (a) strengthening access to and
increasing utilization of prevention services for vulnerable groups (women, youth) and
high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers and staff of some key ministries; (b)
improving access to and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS-infected
and affected persons, notably those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and orphans and
vulnerable children (OVC); and (c) consolidate the coordination, management, and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the national response to HIV/AIDS to ensure its
sustainability.

2.      The proposed changes, the subject of this restructuring paper, aim to: (a) revise
some of the outcome indicators baseline and end-of-Project target values to take into
account new data and reflect changes which occurred during the past 32 months of
implementation; and (b) reallocate the Credit proceeds. At the time of the Project
preparation, data for the baseline values of Project outcome indicators reported in the
results framework were either not available or estimated on a provisional basis. On
another hand, given higher than planned spending in the Vehicles and Equipment
category, due in large part to the higher than anticipated cost of acquiring two mobile
HIV/AIDS testing laboratories and its operating costs, the Government of Benin (GOB)
has requested a reallocation of the Credit's proceeds to cover overdrawn categories, and
to allow the Project to move forward smoothly until the closing date. The reallocation
does not entail changes in activities, and project cost is not affected. All expenditures will
continue to be financed at 100%.


PROJECT STATUS


   General status of the Project

3.      The Project's mid-term review (MTR), held from January 18-29, 2010, found that
the Project remains both highly relevant and feasible. The review showed that it has been
making steady progress towards the achievement of the PDO and was rated Satisfactory.
Given the good progress made up to the date of the MTR, achieving the PDO by project
closing was considered very likely. The Implementation Performance (IP) was also rated
satisfactory in the Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) approved on October


                                              4
22, 2010. The Project is in full compliance with all legal covenants. As of November 22,
2010, 35 months after effectiveness, 56% of the Credit amount has been disbursed. This
rate is somewhat satisfactory if one considers the difficult environment that surrounded
the implementation of the Project's activities, such as the social unrest with recurrent
strikes observed within Benin's civil service, particularly in the health sector.

4.       The Project has ensured so far, among other things, the financing of social
mobilization and HIV prevention services carried out by civil society organizations
(CSOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs). A total of more than 800 sub-
projects have been financed for information, education and communication (IEC)
activities and for direct support to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and orphans
and vulnerable children (OVC) to mitigate the impact of HIV. To improve access to
treatment, care and impact mitigation services, the Project has begun rehabilitating
laboratories, constructing incinerators in the country's departments, and providing
medical equipment, anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment, drugs to manage opportunistic
infections, reagents, and other medical consumables. The proceeds of the Credit have
also been used to support training for more than 1,000 traditional healers and religious
leaders in the Vaudou convents, and an estimated 500 health personnel to effectively
manage opportunistic infections and ARV regimes.

   Specific issues singled out during the Project MTR


5. The MTR was an opportunity for primary stakeholders
involved in HIV/AIDS control to discuss the main issues
concerning project implementation.


6. The first issue of concern was the low progress
achieved with regard to the environmental safeguards. The
Environmental Assessment (EA) was rated Moderately
Satisfactory (MS) after the MTR due to the delay
experienced by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to acquire
medical waste management equipment for health centers at
the national level. The MTR mission recommended a
number of measures to strengthen the medical waste
management sub-component of the Project, including
outsourcing key activities to civil society and private actors to
allow the national medical waste management agency to

                                           5
focus on the oversight, supervision and technical support for
these activities. Over the six months following the MTR,
progress achieved under this subcomponent is deemed to
be satisfactory: On the Government side, the necessary
equipment, the additional materials and training expenses
related to medical waste management are covered through
the Ministry of Health Budget and through the IDA Credit
proceeds; an environmental health specialist of the Ministry
of Health has been appointed as responsible focal point for
following up the MWMP recommendations during project
implementation; the proceeds of the Credit have been used
to: (i) procure small equipment distributed to health facilities
for collecting and destroying medical waste; (ii) prepare
technical documents used for the training of health staff in
charge of medical waste management; (iii) construct
incinerators in 20 health facilities; (iv) recruit a
communication agency to design sensitization materials in
the field of medical waste management. From the Bank
side, the project is being supervised by a Sr. Environment
Specialist based in Abidjan who is following up on issues
concerning : (i) the model and placement of incinerators; (ii)
training; and (iii) the distribution of equipment at health
centers. To date, safeguards implementation is satisfactory
7.      A second issue of concern discussed at the MTR was the status of counterpart
funds. While the full amount pledged by the GOB to pay supplementary allowances to
civil servants working on the Project has been received by the implementing agency, the
rating has been downgraded from Moderately Satisfactory (MS) to Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU). This is because the inter-ministerial decree ­ outlining the specific
allowances to be paid to the various categories of staff to allow utilization of the
counterpart funds ­ has still not been finalized. After the MTR, the issue was discussed at
length with the Ministry of Finance and has now been solved in accordance with the
national policy provisions on allowances to be granted to civil servants.

8.      The third issue raised during the MTR concerned the Project's monitoring and
evaluation (M&E). The MTR includes detailed discussions on this subject,
recommending that a new results framework be prepared in order to clarify some project
indicators and better tie indicators to project activities, taking into account the data
provided by the Second Generation STI/AIDS Surveillance survey carried out in 2008.


                                            6
9.     Finally, the MTR concluded that the proceeds of the Credit should be reallocated
to cover overdrawn categories and allow a smooth implementation of the Project until the
Closing Date, scheduled for December 31, 2011.


PROPOSED CHANGES
10.     There are not any changes proposed for the original PDO, the Project three
components, nor in the activities outlined for each component. All institutional and
implementation arrangements as originally set-up in the Project Appraisal Document,
Financing Agreement and detailed in the Project Implementation Manual will remain
unchanged. The restructuring does not entail an extension of the Credit's Closing Date,
scheduled for December 31, 2011, which will leave sufficient time for the remaining
SDR 10.2 million to be fully disbursed. The Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP),
as disclosed in-country and to the Bank's Info Shop prior to appraisal, is unchanged. The
total Project cost remains the same and the Project will continue to be implemented in
conformity with the MWMP. The Project Safeguard category remains unchanged, and
no Safeguard Policy is triggered.

11.     The only changes requested in this Restructuring Paper concern the Project results
indicators and the reallocation of the proceeds of the Credit.

Results and indicators


12.     The MTR made recommendations to prepare a new results framework to clarify
the baseline and end-of-Project target values of some indicators. The MTR specifically
recommended that the PDO-level results indicators and the intermediate results indicators
that were agreed upon during Project preparation and negotiations be adjusted based on
the results of the Second Generation STI/AIDS Surveillance Survey carried out in 2008,
on achievements at the MTR. The values of the indicators should be either provided
(baseline) or adjusted (end-of-Project targets) to reflect achievements over the past 35
months of implementation. These revised indicator values are reported in the Annex
(Results Framework and Monitoring) of this document.

After thorough discussions between the Bank team and the Benin counterparts, it was
agreed to use year 2008 data provided by the Second Generation STI/AIDS Surveillance
Survey (SGASS) as baseline values for the Project. The rationale is that the SGASS is the
main data source for several core indicators of the Second Multisectoral HIV/AIDS
Control project, especially those related to the behavioral aspects. As the project became
effective in 2008 and started its activities that year, the Bank team and the Benin
counterparts agreed that it is more appropriate to retain the SGASS 2008 data as baseline
data and for the basis of the monitoring of the project performance, instead of relying on
those of 2005 released in 2006, which were outdated and would definitely give a biased
picture of the project performance since the situation has drastically changed in 2008, the


                                            7
year of the beginning of the project. The end-of- project targets values have also been
revised to a more realistic level to take into account progress achieved during the past 34
months of project implementation.

Reallocation of Credit proceeds

13.     The request for the reallocation submitted by the GoB is essentially based on the
fact that the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was confronted to higher levels of
spending for rehabilitation works, equipment, consultant services, training and operating
costs than originally planned. To face this situation, funds under some of the concerned
categories were overdrawn with the view of not hampering the smooth implementation of
the Project, while awaiting the MTR to request a reallocation of the Credit's proceeds
among existing categories. As regards specifically equipment, related funds under
Category 2 were overdrawn due to the fact that, at the Project preparation stage, the
costs of some medical equipment were underestimated, as were also the needs in
equipment (motorcycles, computers and related office equipment) of the beneficiary
entities, especially at the decentralized levels, such as the departmental and communal
HIV/AIDS committees in charge of providing support and assistance to local
communities engaged in the fight against the epidemic. The Government requests
therefore that the funds under Category 2 be increased not only to cover the overdrawing
but also to procure goods that have already been planned. It is also requested that funds
under Category 5 (Operating Costs) be increased given that costs of expenses incurred
locally were much higher with the depreciation of the US Dollar against the CFA Franc
in 2008-2009. Funds under Category 4 (Grants to CBO and Line Ministries) are reduced
in the reallocation request, to avoid overlap as these beneficiary entities benefit massively
from the assistance of other donors.

14.     The reallocation would not entail changes in any activities. Total Project cost
would not be affected. All expenditures would continue to be financed at 100%.
However, the Task Team has amended the withdrawal schedule submitted by the
Government with regards its proposed reallocation for Category 6-PPF refinancing; the
actual disbursed amount is XDR 90,251.38 while the proposed allocation in the request is
only for XDR 89,000. The new withdrawal schedule amended by the Task Team is as
follows:

*** Rationale for using year 2008 data as baseline for the Project: After thorough discussions between the Bank team and the Benin counterparts,
it was agreed to use year 2008 data provided by the Second Generation STI/AIDS Surveillance Survey (SGASS) as baseline values for the Project.
The rationale is that the SGASS is the main data source for several core indicators of the Second Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Control project, especially
those related to the behavioral aspects. As the project became effective in 2008 and started its activities that year, the Bank team and the Benin
counterparts agreed that it is more appropriate to retain the SGASS 2008 data as baseline data and for the basis of the monitoring of the project
performance, instead of relying on those of 2005 released in 2006, which were outdated and would definitely give a biased picture of the project
performance since the situation has drastically changed in 2008, the year of the beginning of the project.
