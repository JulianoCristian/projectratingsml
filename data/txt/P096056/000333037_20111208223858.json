The\n            changes are as follows: (i) a reallocation of the proceeds\n            of the credit; and (ii) an extension the closing date from\n            December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012. There will be no change\n            in the project development objective (PDO), project\n            components, and institutional arrangements. The expected\n            outcome of the restructuring would be a more effective\n            project implementation resulting in a better control of the\n            HIV/AIDS epidemic through improved prevention of\n            transmission by high-risk groups, treatment of those\n            infected by the virus, and better management of the national response."}, "docdt": "2011-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
