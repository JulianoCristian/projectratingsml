Multisectoral\n            Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired\n            Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Control Project for Benin\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: survey\n            techniques such as Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS)\n            should be planned, financed, and carried out under the\n            project to monitor indicators based on household data. It is\n            crucial to express effectiveness conditions in precise terms\n            in order to avoid loopholes that can jeopardize project\n            implementation. Having a thorough understanding of HIV or\n            AIDS epidemic dynamics by population group and geographic\n            areas is a mandatory pre-requirement to design programs and\n            invest resources where they can achieve the highest impact.\n            The selection of indicators in the results framework needs\n            to be aligned with the likely major contribution made by the\n            Bank resources, following the results chain. Using a\n            fiduciary agency to manage the subproject component can be\n            the key to successful implementation as it leaves the\n            Project Implementation Unit (PIU) free to concentrate on\n            coordination instead of getting involved in a field for\n            which it does not have a comparative advantage. Using a\n            fiduciary agency, like Agence de Gestion Fiduciaire du Benin\n            (AGeFIB), to run the financial management of simultaneous\n            funding of community-based organizations increases operation\n            efficiency where community level action is required.\n            Allocation of roles and responsibilities should be defined\n            precisely upfront. Using local councils to work with\n            Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and to be responsible\n            for implementing and coordinating the Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M and E) system at the decentralized level can\n            be a key to success by producing needed data in a timely and\n            efficient manner."}, "docdt": "2013-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
