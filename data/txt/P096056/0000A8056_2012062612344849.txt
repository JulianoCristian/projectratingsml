                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the proposed project are derived from the country's strategic plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and its effects, and for preventing the further
                         spread of HIV/AIDS by means of a multisectoral program approach. They are essentially similar to those under the predecessor project. Thus, complementing the
                         activities financed by other sources, the purpose is to help Benin Government implement its new 2006-2010 National Strategic Framework for boosting its national
                         response to HIV/AIDS by contributing to increase and improve the coverage and utilization of prevention services, treatment and care for specific high-risk and
                         vulnerable groups. More specifically, the project will contribute to: (a) strengthening access to and increasing utilization of prevention services for vulnerable groups
                         (women, youth, etc.) and the high-risk groups such as the commercial sex workers and staffs of some key ministries; (b) improve access and utilization of treatment and
                         care services for HIV/AIDS infected and affected persons, notably those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and orphans and vulnerable children (OVC); and (c) consolidate
                         the coordination, management, and the monitoring and evaluation of the national response to HIV/AIDS for its sustainability.
