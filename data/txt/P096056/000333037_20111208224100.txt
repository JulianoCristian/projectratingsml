7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objectives of the proposed project are derived from the country's strategic plan for
fighting HIV/AIDS and its effects, and for preventing the further spread of HIV/AIDS by means of a
multisectoral program approach. They are essentially similar to those under the predecessor project. Thus,
complementing the activities financed by other sources, the purpose is to help Benin Government
implement its new 2006-2010 National Strategic Framework for boosting its national response to
HIV/AIDS by contributing to increase and improve the coverage and utilization of prevention services,
treatment and care for specific high-risk and vulnerable groups. More specifically, the project will
contribute to: (a) strengthening access to and increasing utilization of prevention services for vulnerable
groups (women, youth, etc.) and the high-risk groups such as the commercial sex workers and staffs of
some key ministries; (b) improve access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS
infected and affected persons, notably those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and orphans and vulnerable
children (OVC); and (c) consolidate the coordination, management, and the monitoring and evaluation of
the national response to HIV/AIDS for its sustainability.
