                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the proposed project are derived from the country's strategic plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and its effects, and for preventing the
                         further spread of HIV/AIDS by means of a multisectoral program approach. They are essentially similar to those under the predecessor project. Thus,
                         complementing the activities financed by other sources, the purpose is to help Benin Government implement its new 2006-2010 National Strategic Framework
                         for boosting its national response to HIV/AIDS by contributing to increase and improve the coverage and utilization of prevention services, treatment and care
                         for specific high-risk and vulnerable groups. More specifically, the project will contribute to: (a) strengthening access to and increasing utilization of prevention
                         services for vulnerable groups (women, youth, etc.) and the high-risk groups such as the commercial sex workers and staffs of some key ministries; (b) improve
                         access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS infected and affected persons, notably those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and orphans and
                         vulnerable children (OVC); and (c) consolidate the coordination, management, and the monitoring and evaluation of the national response to HIV/AIDS for its
                         sustainability.

                         The project is making good progress towards the achievement of its development objective in spite of the recurrent strikes of the health sector staff throughout the country to claim for
                         better working conditions and financial reward. The setting up of the national HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation system is completed and now has to be made fully operationalAs of
                         February 11, 2011, the physical execution rate of the Project stands at nearly 80%, while 66% of the IDA Credit has been disbursed. .
