basic safety net for\n            the immediate future; 2) design a sustainable social welfare\n            system for the medium term; and 3) develop administrative\n            capacity for delivery pf pensions, and veterans'\n            (including disabled war veterans) benefits. There are four\n            main components. The first component develops the social\n            welfare structure by defining objectives and\n            responsibilities of and interaction between public and\n            private entities concerned with planning, management,\n            administration, and delivery of social welfare services;\n            drafting related regulatory acts, instructions, and\n            guidelines; developing standards for accreditation and\n            professional qualification; drafting job descriptions and\n            determining skills requirements, staffing, and training\n            needs. This component also strengthens policy analysis and\n            administrative skills of the UN Interim Administration\n            (UNMIK) Department of Health and Social Welfare (DHSW)\n            staff; introduces strategic planning and policy development\n            capacity; and develops an information and communications\n            strategy aimed at welfare system workers and the general\n            public. The second component upgrades the social welfare\n            infrastructure. The third component builds the capacity of\n            the Centers for Social Welfare (CSW). The fourth component\n            strengthens essential servicesin the pension,\n            veterans', and disabled war veterans' benefit administration."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
