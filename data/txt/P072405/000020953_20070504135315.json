Some\n            lessons learned included: i) The project design teams have\n            to carefully assess the specific country situation, actual\n            capacity at central as well as local government\n            institutions, and have realistic expectations. This is\n            especially important where the policy formulation and\n            sectoral governance are weak. It is quite a challenge to\n            prioritize the needs of a post conflict country, with\n            completely devastated and abandoned social programs.\n            However, defining clear priorities and, if needed, working\n            out possible alternatives, is crucial for achieving the\n            project expected outcomes; (ii) The project teams need to be\n            flexible and consider developing possible alternative\n            strategies in the course of project implementation, in order\n            to ensure achieving all project objectives; (iii) Continuous\n            government ownership and capacity building is fundamental\n            for a successful project implementation and the\n            sustainability of reform activities beyond project life.\n            Although the daily management work for SP project was\n            carried out by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) members,\n            the main responsibility for the implementation of each\n            project component laid with the Department of Social\n            Welfare, under the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.\n            This Department, in close collaboration with all related\n            institutions, is making laudable efforts to carry on the\n            reform activities supported under the project."}, "docdt": "2007-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
