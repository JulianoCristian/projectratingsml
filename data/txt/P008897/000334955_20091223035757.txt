               REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT 

               ON A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO LOAN NO. 845-TU 

            TO ISTANBUL GUBRE SANAYII ANONIM SIRKETI (IGSAS) 

                WITH GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY 



1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendations on a proposed
Amendment to increase the amount of Loan No. 845-TU for an Ammonia-Urea
Manufacturing Project to Istanbul Gubre Sanayii Anonim Sirketi (IGSAS)
(Istanbul Fertilizer Industry A.S.), approved by the Executive Directors in
May 1972, from $24 million to $42 million. The proposed additional loan of
$18 million would be provided as a second tranche of Loan No. 845-TU, would
bear interest at 8-1/2 percent and bC1th tranches would have a term of 15
years, including 5 years grace from the date of the original loan. A guaran
tee fee of 1-3/4 percent would be payable by the Borrower to the Turkish
Government on both tranches.

2.        In 1973, IGSAS proposed, and the Executive Directors accepted, in
response to my memorandum of October 4, 1973, (R73-234), a major increase
in the capacity of the plant covered by the project. It was expected at
that time that the cost of the expansion could be borne from Turkish resources.
However, as described more fully in Part IV below, IGSAS and the Turkish
Government have now requested' an increase in the amount of the original loan
to cover part of the cost of this expansion.


                         PART I - THE ECONOMY


3.        A report (316a-Tu) entitled lithe Economic Development of Turkey"
in five volumes dated April 22, 1974 was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 31, 1974. An economic updating mission visited Turkey in
November 1974 and its report is currently being prepared. Country data sheets
are attached as Annex 1.

4.        Growth in gross national product in the last decade continued to be
high, averaging about 7 percent a year in the period 1962-72, with industry,
power, transport and construction being the main growth sectors. In 1972,
GNP increased by 7.6 percent, but in 1973 increased by only 5.5 percent mainly
due to a decrease in agricultural production as a result of poor weather con
ditions. Transport, communications and private sector services also recorded
lower rates of growth, although this decline was offset in part by high
growth rates in industry, trade and financial services. For 1974, prelim
inary government estimates indicate a growth rate of around 7 percent.

5.        The budgetary situation in the last decade was dominated by the
relatively rapid growth of public expenditures. Tax revenues also grew rapid
ly, but the increase was more than offset by the rise in current expenditures
                                   - 2 


and transfers.   As a result. the overall budget deficit increased and the
Treasury borrowed increasingly from the Central Bank. However. in 1972 and
1973, the Treasury introduced a stricter control of current expenditures and
shifted its deficit finanCing from borrowing from the Central Bank to the
sale of Government bonds. Expenditures and deficits rose again in 1974 fol
lowing the Cyprus hostilities. whose full impact on the budget has, however,
not been assessed yet. The impact is likely to be more substantial in sub
sequent years. as defense appropriations are being increased.

6.        Over the years. the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) have earned
low profits, necessitating increasing budgetary transfers to meet their cur
rent and investment needs, with the exception of the manufacturing sector
where profits have been improving. The State Railways and the Coal Corpora
tion, on the other hand, have continued to be major losers. During 1974
prices of several SEE products were raised substantially (ranging from 20% to
167%) to improve their financial situation and this has resulted in an in
crease in net profits and net savings. Nevertheless, these enterprises con
tinue to rely heavily on budgetary transfers. Reform of the SEEs--in
organization, management, executive and labor skills, and pricing policies-
remains crucial, especially to prepare Turkish industry for competition from
the EEC.

7.        The rate of inflation has been high in recent years, increasing
from about 20 percent in 1973 to 30 percent in 1974. Inflationary pressures
have been fueled by growth in domestic liquidity which has averaged about
25 percent per year during 1970-72 and which rose by more than 25 percent in
1973 and 1974. Other contributing factors have been increases in agricultural
support prices, import prices and minimum wages. To ease inflationary pres
sures, domestic liquidity will have to be contained without discouraging
investment and growth. The Government has recently raised interest rates to
encourage private savings and term lending, but lending rates should be set
even higher in view of the high rate of inflation. (The increases included
raising the interest rate on medium term credit from 12 to 14 percent and
rates on time deposits up to one year from 4 to 6 percent.)

8.        Turkey's development strategy has placed greater emphasis on growth
of output through higher labor productivity, rather than increased employment.
As a result, the labor surplus, including the estimated labor surplus in
agriculture, rose from about 1 million in 1962 to 1.6 million in 1972, about
10 percent of the labor force. Emigration has so far e8iled the pressure on
employment. Bettveen 1965 and 1972, net emigration amounted to about 400,000
and was expected to be about 70,000 per year during the Third Plan period
(1973-77). The Third Plan continues to emphasize investment in capital
intensive industries, and projects a growth in non-agricultural labor surplus
by another 300,000 by 1977. With the slowdmm in Europe on employment of
Turkish workers (paragraph 11), unemployment should be a major concern of
economic policy. Speedy implementation of land reform and rural development
programs would help to dampen migration from rural to urban areas. In addi
tion, labor intensive production methods need special emphasis in the choice
of projects. l:mvever, E'ven with these measures and faster growth than plan
ned in construction and l'lervices, urban unemployment is likely to remain a
serious problem.
                                   - 3 


9.        The prospects for continued high economic growth are good. The
Third Plan constitutes the first phase of Turkey's long-term strategy for
the period 1973-95, the ultimate objective of which is to raise standards of
living in 1995 to those of Italy in 1970, through rapid industrialization and
decreasing dependence on external resources. The Third Plan aims at annual
growth rates of 8 percent in GDP, 12.7 percent in fixed investment, a mar
ginal national savings ratio of 38 percent (compared with about 18 percent in
the Second Plan), an annual increase in commodity imports and exports of 9.4
percent and 7.1 percent respectively and a decline in gross inflows of offi
cial external assistance to $130 million' in 1977 (compared with over $300
million in 1972).

10.       The Plan anticipates that two-thirds of the increase in national
savings will come from the public sector through large increases in both tax
revenues and in surpluses of the State Economic Enterprises (SEE's). Given
the past performance of SEEs and delays in implementing a general reform,
the expected rapid growth in their surpluses does not appear feasible. It
will also be difficult to raise tax revenues to the extent envisaged by
the Plan, but there is scope for some increase if policies are pursued
more vigorously, e.g. improving the tax administration and effective col
lection now under way, widening the tax net to cover agricultural incomes,
increasing the rates of property taxation, introducing a value-added tax and
liberalizing imports to offset tax losses due to import substitution and
reductions of custom duties under the EEC agreement. Domestic resource
mobilization in the public sector is therefore likely to remain a constraint
in the growth of public investment. Besides ensuring improved financial
performance from the SEEs, higher external borrowing as well as policies to
increase long-term domestic borrowing from the private sector, will be
necessary to achieve the ambitious planned investment targets.

11.       Although prospects for a growth rate of 7-8 percent are good, the
Plan's projection's seem to underestimate the difficulty of raising the
savings level and balancing the external accounts at a reduced level of
external assistance. Experience of the last two years underscores the in
adequacy of present efforts to mobilize larger domestic savings to support
rapid growth of investment especially in the public sector. Plan projections
of balance of payments have been overtaken by developments in the interna
tional scene. The sharp increase in the petroleum import bill and other
import prices during 1974 and the prospect of further increases in the next
several years mean that the foreign exchange needs for i~ports will be much
higher than Plan projections. Commodity imports and exports in 1973 were
above the level projected for 1977. Workers' remittances in 1972 were al
ready higher than the 1977 target and have continued to grow, but their
future is made uncertain by the decision of the Federal German Government in
November 1973 to temporarily prohibit further entry of foreign workers from
non-ECC countries because of the consequences of the energy crisis.

12.       From 1967 to 1970, the balance of payments situation was character
ized by increasing trade deficits and a strict system qf import controls.
                                   - 4 

This led to shortages of essential imports and. consequently, to under
utilization of production capacity. To alleviate balance of payments
pressures, the Turkish lira was devalued in August 1970 from TL 9 to TL 15
per US$ and revised to TL 14 in December 1971. The 1970 devaluation, to
gether with associated stabilization measures, rising world demand and prices
and a rapid rise in workers' remittances (from $140 million in 1969 to $740
million in 1972) helped to improve the situation considerably. This improve
ment continued in 1973, with an inflow of $1.2 billion in workers remittances,
and with exports increasing by 49 percent and imports by 34 percent. The
overall result was a surplus in the current account and a gross increase in
reserves over 1972 of about $730 million.

13.       After two years of substantial surplus, however, the overall balance
of payments went into deficit in 1974., with reserves declining by about $360
million. This was mainly due to sharp increases in the trade deficit, the
slow-down in the growth of worker's remittances, and partly to a reduction of
official capital inflows. The large trade deficit resulted from a decline in
export volumes because of recession in major importing countries~ agricultural
supply constraints, and some restrictions on exports to relieve donlestic
shortages and divert some goods to Cyprus. In addition, the terms of trade
worsened and the import bill increased sharply (mainly petroleum, wheat, iron
and steel). Due to poor crops in 1972 and 1973, as well as rising prices,
imports of food products increased from $46 million in 1973 to an estimated
$308 million in 1974. Export pricing policy was not flexible enough, partic
ularly for cotton, whose export volumes fell sharply as the Government's mini
mum export price remained fixed despite a fall in international prices well
below it. As a result, gross reserves, which stood at over $2.1 billion in
August have declined to about $1.6 billion at the end of 1974 or about 5
months of imports. In May 1974, the lira was revalued vis-a-vis the dollar
to TL 13.50 per US$, without a change in parity with other currencies. In
September 1974, the exchange rate per US$ was readjusted to TL 13.85.

14.       At the end of 1973, total external debt outstanding and disbursed
was $2.9 billion, of which all but 3 percent is public or publicly guaranteed.
The share of the Bank Group in total debt outstanding was 12.1 percent in
1973. The average terms of new credits have been hardening in recent years
and this trend is expected to continue. Of the total gross official external
assistance of about $411 million in 1972, the Consortium members provided an
estimated $260 million. Of this, about $105 million came from the United
States and $38 million from West Germany. Debt service as a ratio of exports
of goods and non-factor services was about 6 percent in 1973 and is likely to
remain around this level in the medium-term. However, in view of the uncer
tainties surrounding remittances and oil prices, Turkey should continue to
exercise great care in its external debt management, including restraint in
its resort to suppliers' credit financing. Meanwhile, Turke v continues to
Je creditworthy for Bank financing.

               PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY


15.       The 1970 economic stabilization program (see para 12 above) and
devaluation of the Turkish lira enabled Bank Group lending, which had
previously been intermittent, to be established on a continuing basis at
a high level. Bank Group lending amounted to $114.0 million in FY1971 and
doubled to nearly $230 million in FY1974. Inclusive of the proposed loan,
the Bank Group will have lent $1,009.8 million to Turkey, (of which $919.6
million was outstanding as of February 28, 1975), through 35 lending oper
ations. Five of these operati0ns were in agriculture, eight in industry
(including DFCs), four in power and the rest in urban development, transporta
tion, and vocational education. Agriculture accounts for 20 percent of the
funds lent, industry and DFCs for over 30 percent and power for about 20
percent. Annex II contains a summary' statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of February 28, 1975, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.

16.       Implementation of projects has been satisfactory in the private
sector but less so in the public sector where projects have been significant
ly delayed due to political uncertainties and related administrative problems.
As a result, disbursements have been slower than expected. A comprehensive
review of these projects is being undertaken with the Government, with a view
to seeking viable solutions tp implementation bottlenecks.

17.       In view of the improvements in the balance of payments situation,
IDA lending was discontinued after FY1973. Bank lending is mainly directed
at supporting Turkish efforts to improve: (a) lagging public sector saving
through financial and management reform of State Economic Enterprises (SEEs);
(b) the distribution of income and an increase in living standards in an
economy entering its second decade of roughly 7 percent yearly growth, through
increasing employment in investment projects~ more concerted rural development
efforts, and better urban planning; and (c) long-term capacity to earn foreign
exchange, through diversification, especially promotion of industrial exports
and tourism.

18.       While the focus of Bank lending is on supporting institutional and
structural changes, continuation of recent levels of lending is equally im
portant in view of the increase in projected capital import requirements.
Turkeyts Third Plan goals of an annual 8 percent growth rate and increasing
competitiveness in preparation for eventual full EEC membership, require fur
ther import liberalization and higher external borrowing in the near term.

19.       In support of the objectives stated above it is proposed to devote
future Bank resources to certain key sectors, of which agriculture is the
most important; in this sector emphasis will be put on rural development and
the strengthening of agricultural credit mechanisms. Industry (including
mining and DFCs) and power, where strengthening of management and financing
of SEEs is the key task, will also receive significant support. This program
will be supplemented by further loans in selected sectors. Until recently,
                                    - 6 


Bank lending was focused on the Istanbul region, with emphasis on urban
planning, water supply, power distribution and industrial finance, and on
the Cukurova region around Adana on the southern coast, with emphasis on
power, irrigation, and fruit and vegetable production. It is expected that
the focus of our lending will gradually shift to the Anatolian plateau and
eastern Turkey (e.g. Elbistan), in support of efforts to widen the geographic
al base of development, discourage too rapid urban migration, and improve the
distribution of income.

20.       In this connection, in FY75 the Bank provided a $65 million loan to
TSKB to help finance small and medium scale private industrial enterprises,
particularly in the less developed regions. A rural development project in
the Corum-Cankiri region is scheduled for negotiations in the near future
and is likely to be ready for Board conside~ation before the end of FY75.
A second loan to TEK to further strengthen the Turkish national power system
is also at an advanced stage of preparation.

21.       Projects for subsequent fiscal years include projects for urban
bus transport and wastewater disposal in Istanbul, tourism infrastructure on
the Mediterranean coast west of Antalya, agricultural credit essentially to
support export oriented agro-industrial enterprises and, subject to satis
factory arrangements regarding the riparian issue, the Karakaya Power Dam
on the Euphrates River in eastern Turkey.

22.       The European Investment Bank and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
continue to serve as important sources of external financing on non-commercial
terms. The Bank has cooperated closely with both agencies for financing proj
ects with large external financing requirements. Such collaboration will be
continued in the future, whenever suitable opportunities arise. Similarly,
the Bank has worked closely and proposes to do so in the future with the
UNDP in undertaking feasibility studies, preparing projects or providing
technical assistance.

23.       IFC has invested in tourism, in the production of nylon yarns, pulp
and paper, glass, aluminum and steel pipes. As of February 28, 1975, gross
commitments totaled $71 million of which $50 million were still held by IFC.
IFC is currently investigating investment opportunities in the industrial
sector, including textiles, synthetic fibers, and inorganic materials.

                    PART III - THE FERTILIZER SUB-SECTOR


24.         The background on the fertilizer sub-sector in Turkey was provided
in Part III of my Report dated April 28, 1972 (P-l062) to the Executive
Directors, and is attached hereto under Annex III. Additional background is
included in Volume III of the report on "The Economic Development of Turkey"
cited earlier. Briefly, agriculture continues to be the largest sector in
the economy, employing 60% of the total labor force, supplying much of the
ra\., materials for industry, accounting for the bulk of' the country's commodity
                                   - 7 


exports, and providing about 30% of the net domestic product. Turkish agri
culture is concentrated on the production of cereals (mainly wheat) and live
stock; however, fruits, nuts and industrial crops, such as tobacco, cotton,
and sugar beets, represent a growing share of this production. The sector has
considerable potential for growth although in recent years its performance has
been somewhat disappointing, because of unfavorable weather conditions; insuf
ficient utilization of existing irrigation facilities; and lack of adequate
inputs and supporting services for the production of fruits, vegetables, live
stock and forestry. As mentioned in Part II, ongoing Bank projects and some
of the projects for the subsequent fiscal years, are designed to stimulate
agriculture production and further grot-lth of that sector.

25.       The farmers in Turkey are making increasing use of fertilizers.
Their use parallels the shift towards more intensive forms of cultivation,
as a major source of agricultural growth. As a result, fertilizer consump
tion which stood at 422,000 tons in 1963 tripled during the First Plan
period (1963-1967); thereafter it more than doubled during the Second Plan
period (1968-1972) and reached 3.3 million tons in 1972. This trend contin
ues, and consumption is estinlated to increase to over 4 million tons by 1975.
Growth in consumption has been accompanied by rapid growth in the domestic
production of fertilizer, which increased from 322,000 tons in 1963 to 1.4
million tons in 1972 and to an estimated 2.4 million tons in 1974. Neverthe
less, there is still a large gap in domestic demand which will need to be
met through imports, even though domestic fertilizer production continues to
increase in Turkey. Although urea fertilizer was introduced in Turkey only
recently, its consumption has developed rapidly in the past 3-4 years.
Urea enjoys a considerable advantage over other forms of nitrogenous fertil
izers, and it is expected that with further demonstration to the farmers of
the correct methods of its application, the consumption of nitrogen in the
form of urea will continue to expand rapidly in Turkey.


                         PART IV - THE PROJECT


The Original Project and Its Revision

 26.         The original project for the construction of a fertilizer plant at
Izmit, to produce annually 248,000 tons of ammonia, of which 158,000 would be
converted to urea and the balance of 90,000 tons sold do~estically, was
approved by the Executive Directors on May 16, 1972. Total project cost
was estimated at about $58 million, of which the foreign exchange cost was
estimated to be about $32 million. The Bank provided a loan of $24 million
to meet a portion of the foreign exchange cost, the balance of which was
covered by IGSAS through a long-term loan from the State Investment Bank (SIB).
The entire local cost was to be covered primarily by equity subscribed by
 IGSAS shareholders and in small part by SIB. The detailed description of
 the original project, as well as the organizational, financial and procure
ment arrangements, were summarized in Part IV of my aforementioned Report and
Recommendation to you, ,\Thich is attached hereto under Annex III. The loan
,.;ras signed on June 30, 1972 and hecame effective on October 6, 1972.
                                     - 8 


27.       Since approval, a market study commissioned under the project,
established that consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers was increasing much
faster than anticipated. In addition, the engineering consultants hired
under the project confirmed that due to technological advantages, the enlarge
ment of the proposed plant would not only offer additional economies of scale,
but also overall financial and economic benefits to IGSAS (the Borrower) and
Turkey (the Guarantor). In these circumstances, and given the fact that pro
duction of fertilizer by other manufacturers in Turkey was increasing much
more slowly than expected, IGSAS decided in October 1973 to request Bank
approval to increase the annual production capacity for ammonia by 33 per
cent to 330,000 tons and of urea by 87 percent to 511,000 tons, thus taking
advantage of economies of scale. The expected higher increase in urea
consumption led IGSAS to reduce the amount of ammonia to be sold under the
original project from 90,000 tons to 38,000 tons, and to balance the plant
with additional urea capacity and thereby further increase the benefits of
the project. The total cost of the revised project, arrived at by IGSAS by
scaling up previous estimates and not on the basis of a Bank reappraisal,
was estimated to be about' $83 million including $45 million in foreign
exchange.

28.       Details of the proposed expansion of the original project and of
the financial arrangements are summarized in my memorandum (No. R73-234) dated
October 4, 1973, which is attached as Annex IV. Based on my recommendation
contained in the Memorandum, ~he proposal to amend the loan agreement (No.
845-TU) to allow for the expansion, was approved on October 11, 1973. Because
of Turkey's strengthened balance of payments outlook at the time, which was
prior to the oil crisis, and because of the need for financing several large
new projects in Turkey for which Bank financing was required, the Bank was
not asked to participate in financing the increased cost of the enlarged
project, but merely to approve the propose-d expansion. The Borrower arranged
to secure additional long-term financing from SIB, raising SIB's total contri
bution to $21 million in foreign exchange and $4.2 equivalent in local cur
rency. The remaining increased local costs were covered by additional equity
participation of its shareholders.

Implementation of Expanded Project

29.       Implementation of the expanded project has largely proceeded on
schedule. Procurement commenced in late 1973 and about 80 percent of all
goods have been ordered. As of March 31, 1975, all of the original loan had
been committed for equipment and engineering services and $7.3 million had
been disbursed. In addition, contracts for about US$5 million for equipment
to be financed under the additional loan have already been made. It is ex
pected that about US$13 million of the additional loan would be used for fi
nancing equipment and about US$5 million for engineering services. Disburse
ments of the Bank loan for imported goods will be made for elF (port of entry)
costs. As of November 1974, civil works on the plant site were about 25 per
cent complete, with the construction of the compressor house, control room,
boiler house stack, prilling tower and storage for bulk and bagged urea,
underway. Additional supporting structures for major equipment associated
with the ammonia and urea units were under construction, and erection of
                                 - 9 


some plant and equipment items was about to commence. Physical completion of
the plant is now expected for April 1976 and start of commercial production
in September 1976.' This is about 9 months later than scheduled and is largely
attributable to the difficult equipment delivery situation which is being ex
perienced internationally. The implementation of the project by the Borrower
continues to be satisfactory, under a capable and competent managerial team.

Current Project Cost and Proposed Financing Plan

30.        As indicated earlier, (para 27) the total cost of the expanded proj
ect as estimated by the Borrower in October 1973, was $83 million. However,
partly on account of an underestimate in terms of equipment prices in effect
at that time, but primarily because of sharp increases in international prices,
the estimated cost has since risen substantially. The revised cost, based on
the equipment ordered and civil works'constructed, is now estimated to be
about $130 million, with a foreign exchange cost of about $68 million.

31.       As a result of the higher oil prices, substantially higher costs of
its investments and the current pressure on the balance of payments, the
Government finds it difficult to arrange for the financing of the additional
foreign exchange costs of the expanded project from the 1975 investment budget
for SIB and the state-owned shareholders of IGSAS, Istanbul Petrol Rafinerisi
Anonim Sirketi (IPRAS) (Istanbul Petroleum Refinery) and Turkiye Petrolleri
Anonim Sirketi (TPAO) (Turkish Petroleum). Multilateral and bilateral agen
cies have declined to participate in the financing of a project as far ad
vanced as IGSAS. In the absence of additional financing by mid-1975, IGSAS
would have to cancel orders, re-order them later at almost certainly higher
costs, and forego project benefits because of added delay. In these circum
stances, IGSAS and the Government have requested supplemental Bank financing
for the part of increased cost due to the increase in plant capacity, while
inflationary cost increases would be borne by IGSAS shareholders (through in
creased equity subscriptions) and an additional loan from SIB. In view of the
Bank's original involvement in this project, its satisfactory implementation
record to date and its economic benefits to Turkey, I consider this request
reasonable, and propose that the Bank provide a second tranche of $18 million
to the loan of $24 million approved in 1972, which would bring the total to
$42 million, or a little over 60 percent of the revised foreign exchange cost.
This compares to the provision of nearly 75 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of the original project, under the initial loan approved in 1972. The
supplemental Bank financing would cover the additional foreign exchange needs
resulting from the increase in the capacity of the project approved in
October 1973, while the Borrower would arrange with its shareholders and SIB
to cover the increase in project cost, both local and foreign, caused by price
escalation since October 1973. The details of the expanded project, taking
into account the proposed additional loan, are provided in the Loan and
Project Summary in Annex V.

32.       The following table summarizes the revised financing plan:

The additional debt financing from SIB would'be obtained on conditions similar
to those of the supplemental Bank loan. IGSAS shareholders will subscribe
the additional equity in the same proportion as their present equity holding
(TPAO 60 percent, IPRAS 40 percent). The supplemental Bank loan would be at
8-1/2 percent, and would have the same maturity as the original loan (No. 845
TU). IGSAS would pay a guarantee fee of 1-3/4 percent to the Government as
guarantor.

Procurement

33.       All procurement under the original and the proposed Bank loan has
been and will continue to take place in accordance with the Bank's procure
ment guidelines. The equipment for the original and the additional Bank loan
is principally being procured through international competitive bidding ex
cept for (i) equipment items costing less than US$25,OOO and (ii) equipment
whose availability is limited or critical for the successful operation of
the project, for which limited bidding using international shopping proce
dures is being followed. Under the present difficult world-wide supply
situation for fertilizer manufacturing equipment, it is anticipated that the
value of such equipment could reach US$9 million out of the total Bank loan
of $42 million as compared to US$4 million under the original Bank loan.

Financial Covenants

34.       The above financing plan is based on a debt - equity ratio of about
60:40, as envisaged for the original project. It would also result in a cur
rent ratio of 2.0 at the project completion date as required in the original
Loan Agreement. The debt service coverage should improve substantially from
the 1.5-2.0 range originally forecast to between 2.3-3.5 due to the improved
profitability of the project. Because of the delay in the startup, the be
ginning of commercial operations would coincide with the beginning'of repay
ments under the loan. To avoid initial cash flow difficulties and the like
lihood that IGSAS would have to resort to short-term borrowing to meet debt
repayments, it is proposed t~at the grace period on the original Bank loan
be extended by one year. Both tranches of the Bank loan would then have an
overall length of 15 years, as in the original Loan Agreement, but would in
clude five years of grace from the date of the original 'Bank Loan, except
                                 - 11 


for two repayments totalling US$280,OOO which are due in 1976 and 1977 on
early maturities of the original loan which have already been sold by the
Bank to third parties.

Economic and Financial Rate of Return

35.       Despite its increased costs, the economic and financial returns of
the expanded project are high, even when using conservative estimates for
revenues and operating costs. The economic return is estimated at about 26
percent (compared to 15 percent for the original project), based on an ex
pected import price for urea of $175 ton/elF bagged, as used in other recent
Bank Group financed urea projects. The financial rate of return (after taxes)
is estimated at 23 percent (compared to 13 percent for the original project).
The project's returns have increased substaqtially because of higher fertil
izer prices and lower capital costs than those of new fertilizer projects.
The project will be the first urea fertilizer production facility in Turkey,
where more than 200,000 tons of urea, at an estimated value of at least
US$50 million, are presently being imported annually. Although more urea
fertilizer is needed, availability and high prices (at present about US$350/
ton) are restricting imports. Since urea is one of the most economic nitrogen
fertilizers, the project continues to be of vital importance to Turkish agri
culture.



                  PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY


36.        The Amending Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Istanbul
Gubre Sanayii Anomin Sirketi and Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi and
Istanbul Petrol Rafinerisi Anonim Sirketi, the Amending Guarantee Agree
ment between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank, the Report of the Com
mittee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed increase in
the amount of the loan are being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors.

37.       I am satisfied that the proposed increase in the amount of the loan
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.


                          PART VI - RECOMMENDATION


38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
amendment to Loan No. 845-TU.

C.    PROJECTS IN EXECUTION   1/
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 587/143 Second Seyhan Irrigation Project: US$12 million
Loan and US$12 million Credit of February 20. 1969. Closing Date: June 30,
1975.

          Work on Stage II of the Seyhan Irrigation Project is being perform
ed in a satisfactory manner. There has been a slight delay in progress due
(i) to the need to terminate and readvertise several small civil works con
tracts due to issuance of a Government decree to protect contractors from
financial distress from inflating costs on contracts with no price escala
tion provisions; and (ii) delays in on-farm development caused by the failure
of farmers to make lands available because of interference with production
of high value cotton crops. Efforts are underway to determine the Govern
ment's intentions regarding usage of loan/credit funds for the training of
project personnel.

Cr. No. 236 First LivestocF Project:   US$4.5 million credit of February 22,
1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1975.

          Implementation of this project was initially delayed by administra
tive difficulties encountered by the Turkish authorities in fulfilling some
of the effectiveness conditions, including securing services of necessary
staff for the project unit. These delays were largely due to the absence,
following a reorganization of the Turkish Government administration in
March 1971, of an effective coordinating link between the various ministries
concerned with the project and between the Government and the Bank Group.
These problems have been resolved, the project is virtually fully staffed,
and satisfactory progress is being made. About half the Credit has been
disbursed and the balance should be disbursed over the next 18 months. At
full disbursement some 140-150 farmers will benefit which falls short of the
original target of 250-300, mainly due to increased input costs.

Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$13.5 million loan of June 9. 1971.
Closing Date: September 30, 1976.

          The project is about two years behind schedule due to the initial
reluctance of the Ministry of Education to provide the project unit with
adequate qualified staff and authority commensurate with responsibilities
that this unit had to undertake. However, a new project director and deputy




1/    These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
      the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
      any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
      to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
      understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua
      tion of strengths and weaknesses in project executions.
                                                              ANNEX II

director have been appointed, other vacancies filled, and long standing prob
lems concerning the appointment of technical assistance specialists are in
the process of being resolved. The procurement of equipment (the major com
ponent of the project) is also proceeding satisfactorily. Although only
limited progress has been made in the implementation of the overall educa
tional objectives of the project, these are now receiving increased attention.
Similarly, interim actions are now being initiated to prepare training pro
grams for the Management Training Institute and select fellowship candidates
and staff which had been held in abeyance pending enactment of legislation,
still not approved, to establish the Institute. Cost estimates are being
updated by the Project Unit, but preliminary indications suggest cost over
runs of about 65 percent over appraisal estimates. Only minimal disbursement
has been made to date; however contracts totaling more than $5.0 million have
been awarded, and disbursements are expected to increase significantly during
the first half of FY1976.

Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Export Project: US$1O million
Loan and US$15 million Credit of June 22, 1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.

          The project was initially delayed by difficulties in making the
loan/credit effective by the due date. Progress with 3 of the 5 major project
components is satisfactory (refrigerated trucks, ferry boats, marketing
facilities). A new extension approach has been initiated to increase fruit
and vegetable production, the fourth component. The fifth, the agricultural
credit survey, is not likely to produce meaningful results, and other arrange
ments have been made to prepare an agricultural credit project for Bank fi
nancing.

Ln. No. 763 TEK Power Transmission Project:    US$24 million loan of June 22,
1971. Closing Date: March 31, 1975.

          The implementation pace of this project has been significantly
slower than originally anticipated due to shortage of staff. First contracts
were awarded early in 1972 and work is now progressing according to the re
vised schedule. Problems in meeting the financial covenants were considered
in connection with the Elbistan project which incorporates revised procedures.
The closing date has been extended to June 30, 1976 to allow time to complete
procurement.

Ln. No. 775 Fourth Cukurova Power Project:    US$7 million loan of June 30, 1971.
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.

          The transmission line and substation works have been completed and
the only outstanding work is the equipment of the System Control Center. All
work is expected to be complete by mid-1975. The Borrower (the Government),
is aware of the beneficiary's (the Cukurova E.A.S.) serious shortage of cash
stemming from the impact of increased fuel oil costs. The beneficiary has
presented a revised power tariff to the ~anister of Energy and Natural

Cr. No. 281 Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million credit of
January 25, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.

          Project construction schedules were revised in 1973, with the new
completion dates for Silifke, Koprucay and Tokat subprojects being one, five
and two years respectively behind the original schedule. Progress on con
struction of irrigation and drainage channels and on farm works at Silifke
and Tokat is now proceeding well, but is still behind schedule at Koprucay
because of the extremely short annual work season. Provisions for the em
ployment of consultants and training of national staff still remain to be
implemented.

Ln. No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion Project:    US$76 million loan of April 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 1976.

          The project is over a year and a half behind schedule, due to
delays in beginning procurement, stemming largely from a failure to install
efficient project management, realign the division of responsibility between
the Board and senior management, and appoint critically needed foreign con
sultants. Following continuing discussions between the Government, the
company and the Bank on these problems, a well qualified senior executive
has been appointed as the president of the company in January 1975, and en
couraging progress is being made gradually in realigning responsibilities
between the Board of Directors and the president.

Ln. No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project:   US$37 million loan of June 30,
1972.   ClOSing Date:   June 30. 1977.

          The supply of water for Istanbul has increased by 48 percent since
1971, but shortages persist, particularly on the European side. Project
progress is about one year behind appraisal estimates, but better progress
is expected now that necessary consultants have been engaged. Progress on
water source developments should mean that water shortages throughout Istanbul
should be substantially reduced in 1975. Institutional improvement in lSI
are expected to begin soon, but progress is likely to be quite gradual.

Cr. No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development Project:     US$2.3 million credit of
June 30 t 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.

          Four consultant groups started work between November 1973 and
February 1974. Work on the Wastewater and the BUS/Traffic Engineering and
Control Projects is proceeding satisfactorily. The Wholesale Market Complex
has been somewhat delayed due to questions about site suitability. The Urban
and Transport studies are proceeding reasonably well.

Ln. No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) Project:     US$24 million loan
of June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.

           (Project reviewed in attached Report.)

Cr. NO. 33U Second Livestock Project: US$16 million credit of September 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 31. 1976.

          The project has started slowly due mainly to difficulties in securing
the services of both local and expatriate technical staff. Salaries and side
benefits for local staff have recently been increased and recruitment is
picking up. Improved salaries and conditions for foreign specialists are
under discussion, with a view to early filling of all vacancies. The basic
project organization is now in place and implementation is expected to accel
erate substantially, provided all staff shortages are overcome as expected.

Ln. No. 873-TU TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$40 million
Loan of December 28, 1972. Closing Date: December 31. 1976.

          Since the first Bank loan was made in 1950, a satisfactory rela
tionship has been developed with TSKB whose standard of appraisal work is
consistently high. This loan to TSKB has been almost fully connnitted and
when completely disbursed will bring Bank lending to TSKB to $168 million,
not including the recent loan of US$65.0 million signed in January 1975.

Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 TU, Ceyhan Aslantas Hultipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of Harch 22, 1973. Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.

          The loan/credit was made effective as of Harch 20, 1974. Construc
tion underway thus far includes the access road to the camp site at Aslantas
darn, campsite buildings, the river bridge at the dam site and some irrigation
and drainage works on the left bank of the Ceyhan river. Energoproject has
been appointed as engineering consultant for the Aslantas Dam and Power plant.
Contracts for on-farm development equipment have been awarded. Topraksu and
the Ninistry of Agriculture have not yet employed consultants for on-farm
development and extension, and the Government has been asked to take imme
diate action to correct the situation.

Ln. No. 892 Istanbul Power Distribution Project:   US$14.0 million loan of
Hay 25, 1973. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.

          Progress on this project has been delayed by about two years and
costs are approximately twice what was estimated at appraisal. The consultant
to be appointed to study the gas supply system has not yet been selected and
this delay is affecting the work of associated consultants. These and other
problems are being reviewed with the parties concerned to work out an agreed
timetable for remedial actions.
                                                               ANNEX II

Ln. No. 893-TU Turkish State Railways:     US$47 million loan of May 25, 1973.
Closing Date: September 30, 1976.

           After initial delays, procurement of track material and other Bank
financed items is now progressing satisfactorily. TCDD's locomotive produc
tion, which is being financed by another external lending institution, is
considerably behind schedule for reasons not entirely within TCDD's control.
Remedial measures are being taken t. resolve production problems, since this
may adversely affect the project in the long-run. In addition, the track
renewal program is proceeding slower than planned, although the Railways ex
pect more rapid progress in the next year. Several key provisions of the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements, including required increases in passenger
tariffs, have not been carried out as scheduled and the Bank has informed the
Guarantor and the Borrower that appraisal of a second loan to the Railways,
planned for FY1975, will have to be postponed until satisfactory remedial
steps are taken.

Ln. No. 957-TU Antalya Forestry Project:    US$40 million loan of January 28,
1974. Closing Date: December 31 1 1978.

          The date for effectiveness for this loan has been extended for a
fifth time to December, 1975, to allow the Government additional time to
resolve the question of selecting a satisfactory new plant site location. A
new site east of Antalya has been identified and a feasibility study is under
preparation. Implementation of the project has also been delayed by diffi
culties in the hiring of consultants for forestry development and studies,
although some progress in resolving major difficulties has now been made.

Ln. No. 1023 Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project:    US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Closing Date: July 30, 1982.

          This loan to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) and the Turkish
Coal Authority (TKI) is to help finance the development of an open-cast
lignite mine in east central Turkey and the construction of an adjacent
lignite-burning 1200 megawatt power station and associated transmission lines.
Date for effectiveness of this loan, originally November 1, 1974, has been
postponed to May 15, 1975, to enable the Government to establish new elec
tricity tariffs.

Ln. No. 1024-TU DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey):    US$40 million loan of
June 28 t 1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.

          The loan was declared effective by September 30, 1974. Submission
of subprojects has been slower than anticipated, however two projects totaling
$10 million have recently been approved and disbursement is expected to begin
shortly.

Ln. No. 1078-TU TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey):   US$65 million
loan of January 22, 1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.

          The loan is expected to be declared effective by April 30, 1975.

Technical Assistance Project - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK):    US$1.9
million grant of August 20, 1967.

          Technical assistance contracts covering the second phase of the
work were terminated in November-December 1972. Achievement, though short
of target in some respects, is generally satisfactory and TEK now has a much
improved accounting, budgeting and financial reporting system. Contracts for
the last phase of the work have been signed and final training programs have
gotten underway, with one group of accountants having already completed train
ing and further training groups being planned.

                   PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR   11 


1.        Reports on the Turkish industrial and agricultural sectors were
distributed to the Executive Directors as Annexes to the main economic re
port entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-30a dated February 1,
1971). They include "The Manufacturing Industries" (Volume V, Annex III,
dated December 10, 1971 - see paras 86 through 96) and "Agricultural Policies
and Problems" (Volume III, Annex I dated March 10, 1971 - see paras 35
through 38 and para 111).

2.        Turkish manufacturing output grew by about 10 percent per year in
the 1960's with industries like machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals
providing much of the impetus for growth. Industrialisation has reached a
level of sophistication and diversity which now includes aluminium, motor
vehicles, durable consumer goods, synthetic fibres and major chemical inter
mediates. Production of all types of fertilizer reached 200,000 tons in 1971
and includes both nitrogenous and phosphate fertilizers. As a result indus
try now represents about 20 percent of net domestic product, as compared
with about 16 percent in 1962. But this rapid growth has often been motivated
by Turkish foreign exchange constraints and a consequent desire for import
substitution, even when competitive cost production was not possible.

3.        Agriculture continues to be the largest sector in the economy,
providing about 30 percent of the net domestic product and about 70 percent
employment in 1970, supplying much of the raw material for industry and
accounting for the bulk of the commodity exports. Turkish agriculture is
concentrated on cereals (mainly wheat) and livestock, but fruits, nuts and
industrial crops also represent a large share of agricultural production.
In recent years, the agricultural sector has lagged behind the rest of the
economy growing at about 3.1 percent per year during 1965-70. Much of the
disappointing performance, apart from unfavorable weather conditions which
have had an adverse effect particularly on wheat production, has been due
to insufficient utilization of existing irrigation projects, inadequate con
centration on fruit and vegetable, livestock and forest development and
lack of inputs and supporting services. Several projects financed by the
Bank Group during the last year or presently under discussion focus on these
problems in an attempt to reduce these constraints, e.g. irrigation rehabili
tation, fruit and vegetables and livestock.

4.        The use of farm inputs grew rapidly in the sixties. Fertilizer
consumption increased from 20,000 tons of nutrient in 1960 to 463,000 tons
in 1971, i.e. an average annual increase of 33 percent. The rapid increase
in fertilizer consumption was due to a well conceived extension program by
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a distribution system which,
until recently, provided adequate supplies of fertilizer where needed and
the provision of sufficient credit by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT)
on liberal terms. However, in 1970 and 1971 consumption stagnated. This
was due mainly to supply constraints: in particular shortage of foreign
exchange and insufficient credit for the procurement and storage by dis
tributors and retail buying by farmers. The credit stringency was due to
cash shortages in the ABT Fertilizer Financing Fund (which provides 80-85
percent of all fertilizer credits), primarily caused by inability of the
farmers to repay loans after the poor harvests in 1969 and 1970. It is
estimated that if fertilizers and credit are available in sufficient quan
tity and on time, farmer's demand would be 20 percent above the actual con
sumption in 1971 of 463,000 tons of nutrient. The slowdown of consumption
growth since 1969 therefore does not indicate weaker demand for fertilizer
use, but is primarily due to shortages of foreign exchange and domestic
credit. The generally healthier situation of the Turkish balance of pay
ments (see paras 18 and 19) and the specific provisions in the project
(see para 40 (c» should ease the foreign exchange constraint. The Fruit
and Vegetable Export Project (762/257-TU) includes a study of the ABT with
the objective of improving the supply of domestic credit. Depending on the
results of the study, there may be Bank Group lending for agricultural
credit in the future.

5.        Procurement and distribution of domestic and imported fertilizers
are carried out by three major State Economic Enterprises (the Agricultural
Supply Organization, the Association of Agricultural Credit Cooperatives and
the Sugar Factories Corporation) and, to a lesser extent, by production and
sales cooperatives and private dealers. The limitations on imports of
fertilizers and credit shortages after 1969 created a number of bottlenecks
in the distribution system which, due to lack of coordination among these
various agencies, resulted in shortages of fertilizer in some regions and
excess stocks in others. Capacity for fertilizer storage is adequate, but
improved planning and coordination between storage points is required. To
help coordinate fertilizer production and distribution, the Government has
set up a Fertilizer Committee under the Ministry of Agriculture, on which all
agencies and Government Departments concerned are represented.

6.        The distribution of fertilizer is controlled by the Government
through a system of import licensing and by setting prices for both ex
factory and retail sales to farmers. In the case of domestic fertilizers,
distributors' margins are fixed. At present, losses on the sale of domestic
fertilizers are made up by profits on the distribution of imported fer
tilizers (because c.i.f. prices are lower) and, where Government controlled
                                                           k~NEX III
                                                           Page 3 of 8



distributors are concerned, through budget subsidies. As a result of this
pricing policy and the decision to restrict import allocations in 1970,
government-owned agencies are presently the primary means for fertilizer
distribution.

7.        Comparison with other countries suggests that fertilizer consump
tion in Turkey will continue to grow but, partly due to the supply constraints
noted above, growth rates are unlikely to be as high as they were in the
1960's. The Bank estimates growth of nitrogen consumption to average about
15 percent during 1971-75 slowing to 10 percent during 1975-80, although these
figures may be regarded as conservative. Urea was introduced in Turkey only
recently and urea consumption has developed rapidly in the past two years to
63,000 tons in 1971. Urea enjoys a considerable advantage over other forms
of nitrogen fertilizer in that it is relatively concentrated (46 percent
nitrogen content) and thus more economical to handle. To obtain satisfactory
results, however, it must be used carefully and this requires intensive
research and demonstration to farmers of the correct methods of application.
Assuming these measures are adequately carried out, the Bank believes that
consumption of nitrogen in the form of urea could continue to expand rapidly.

                       PART IV - THE PROJECT   1./

1.        A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of the IGSAS Ammonia-Urea Manufacturing Project"
(PI-6a) dated April 12, 1972, which is being distributed separately. A
Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.

2.        The Project. The proposed project consists of the construction of
a fertilizer plant to produce for sale 274,000 tons per year of urea and
90,000 tons per year of ammonia (other than ammonia produced and converted
into urea). The plant is to be located at Izmit (see map) about 80 km from
Istanbul on the Asian shore of the Marmara Sea, adjacent to an existing oil
refinery which would provide feedstock and fuel for the project. Urea would
be sold for consumption in Turkey as a fertilizer. Ammonia would be sold in
part (38,000 tons per year) to a petrochemical plant manufacturing capro
lactam (the raw material for nylon) and in part (52,000 tons per year) to a
plant manufacturing diammonium phosphate fertilizer. The project includes
the purchase and installation of a 750 ton per day single stream ammonia
plant, a 830 ton per day single stream urea plant, construction of buildings
and related civil works and the provision of engineering consultant services.
Auxiliary facilities such as roads, office space, laboratories and utility
systems would be shared with the neighbouring refinery with only minor addi
tions needed as part of the project.

3.        A new Company, Istanbul Gubre Sanayii Anonim Sirketi (IGSAS) has
been formed to build and operate the plant. The Company will be run as a
private enterprise under the Turkish Commercial Code. The equity of IGSAS
will amount to TL 330 million and will be subscribed by TPAO (Turkiye Petrol
leri Anonim Ortakligi, an oil company controlled by the Turkish Government)
and IPRAS (Istanbul Petrol Rafinerisi Anonim Sirketi, a subsidiary of TPAO)
in the proportion of 60:40. Engineering consultants will be employed by the
Company in all technical phases of its work including the initial period of
operation until local staff is sufficiently trained.

4.        Capital Cost and~Jnancin~. The total cost of the project, including
initial working capital, is estimated at $57.(; million equivalent, of which
the foreign exc.hange component is $32.0 million. This estimate takes into
account the probable effects of the latest currency realignments and also
includes contingency and price escalation allowances amounting to $10.2 mil
lion. TPAO and IPRAS have given an undertaking to provide the Company with
additional funds that may be required to meet any project capital cost over
run. Financing will be provided from the following sources:

5.        SIB has given a commitment to provide a loan of TL 142.5 million
to the Company. The loan will be at 10-1/2 percent interest and have a term
of 15 years. The Company will have an initial long term debt equity ratio
of about 60:40. Debt service coverage is estimated at 1.5 in 1975 rising to
2.0 by 1979 and gradually increasing thereafter. Payment of dividends and
other borrowings by the Company are restricted to protect the Company's cash
position.

6.        The Bank loan of $24 million will be repayable over 15 years in
cluding a 4 year period of grace and will be guaranteed both by the Govern
ment of Turkey and jointly and severally by TPAO and IPRAS. The Government
of Turkey will charge the Company a 1-3/4 percent guarantee fee on the amount
of the Bank loan, which will bring the effective interest rate payable by
the Company to 9 percent. This is lower than the current interest rate for
industrial borrowing in Turkey which normally varies from 10-1/2 percent to
11-1/2 percent depending on the status of the borrower. The exchange risk on
the Bank loan will be borne by the Company.

7.        The ability of TPAO and IPRAS to provide their share of the fi
nancing has been given particular attention by the Bank in view of the
magniture of the sum involved and the tight liquidity situation of these
two Companies. At the Bank's request, the Government of Turkey has there
fore agreed that, whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the
funds available to TPAO and IPRAS would be inadequate to cover their equity
contributions or to honor the cost overrun commitment, the Government would
make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, to cause the necessary funds
to be provided.

8.        Procurement and Disbursement. The Bank proposes to finance the
foreign exchange cost of specific items of equipment machinery and spare parts
for the proposed project (see Annex III). These items will be procured on
the basis of international competition. Goods and services to be financed
by the Borrower out of local funds including all civil works, which are
expected to be provided by Turkish contractors, will be procured under pro
cedures which will ensure a reasonable degree of competition. It is expected
                                                             ANNEX III
                                                             Page 6 of 8



that disbursement of the Bank loan would take place over the three year
construction period of the project commencing June 1972. rGSAS is exempt
from import duties on goods required for the project and bids will be
evaluated on a net-of-duty basis.

9.        Technology. The complexity of ammonia-urea plants entails certain
technical risks which can lead to delays in construction and start up of
operations. As far as the project is concerned, these risks will be limited
through the employment by the Company of an engineering consulting firm
(see para. 3) and the fact that the relatively small size of the plant will
not give rise to major technical difficulties in process design and equipment.

10.       The handling of effluents by urea and ammonia plants is still in
the experimental stage. However, both TPAO and IPRAS are well aware of public
concern over water and air pollution and plan to keep abreast of the latest
developments for pollution control. The project cost estimates include items
of equipment for the treatment of liquid effluent and sanitary waste and also
allow a margin for any additional expenditure that may be required. The
methods to be adopted for handling plant effluents will depend on the anlmonia
and urea processes finally selected and the Company has agreed to solve these
problems to the satisfaction of the Bank.

11.       Marketing and Distribution. As urea is a relatively new product in
Turkey, particular attention has been given in project preparation to minimize
the commercial risks. The success of the project depends to a large extent
on the efficiency of the marketing and distribution arrangements and the rate
at which farmers' interest in using increasing quantities of fertilizer in
general, and urea in particular, can be developed and maintained. The Govern
ment of Turkey and the Company have given the following assurances which will
help develop the market for urea in anticipation of the level of demand
required at the time the project comes into production in the mid 1970's and
will help provide the necessary incentives for the expansion of fertilizer
production and consumption in the future:

     (a)  The Government of Turkey has agreed to appoint IGSAS to
          carry out a comprehensive marketing study for urea to be
          completed by March 31, 1973. Detailed terms of reference
          and suggested staffing, which may include consultants for
          certain aspects of the study, are being drawn up by IGSAS
          and will be reviewed by the Government and the Bank. IGSAS
          will be responsible for implementation of the study after
          its recommendations have been approved by the Government.

     (b)  Agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Agriculture
          and the Ministry of Rural Affairs concerning the establishnlent
          of urea trials and with the Ministry of Agriculture Extension
          Service on increasing extension work to promote the proper
          use of urea.
                                                             ANNEX ILL
                                                             Page 7 of 8




     (c)  The Government has agreed to continue issuing import licenses
          for urea with the intention of developing a market for at least
          160,000 tons of urea per year by 1975, when IGSAS is scheduled
          to come into production. After this period, the Bank estimates
          that the market demand for urea would be met by IGSAS for some
          years to come. In order to avoid the possibility of over
          production from existing or future plants producing urea and
          nitrogen fertilizers, the Government has undertaken to with
          hold the provision of incentives or finance for the establish
          ment of plants to produce and sell urea and other nitrogen
          fertilizers unless additional production capacity is required
          to meet Turkey's projected agricultural development needs.

     (d)  Fertilizer credit requirements, appropriate policies, capital
          sources and institutional and procedural arrangements for
          supplying these requirements, will be studied under the Credit
          Survey for which Bank/IDA financing is being provided as part
          of the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project (762/257-TU). Credit
          needs for distribution and sale of urea will also be examined
          under the Urea Marketing Study to be carried out by IGSAS in
          coordination with the Credit Survey. In the meantime, the
          Government has undertaken to provide, through the Agricultural·
          Bank of Turkey, appropriate credit facilities to enable eligible
          farmers to purchase urea under the existing fertilizer pur
          chasing credit system.

     (e)  The pricing policies to be adopted by the Government for urea
          and for fertilizers generally will be examined as part of the
          Urea Marketing Study mentioned above. IGSAS has agreed to
          consult the Bank before establishing the prices or altering
          the prices charged for i~s products.

     (f)  At present responsibility for programming supplies of ferti
          lizer and procurement of imports, distribution and allocation
          of fertilizers to distributors and other agencies, statistical,
          research and other services are shared by a number of Ministries
          and Government agencies, which makes coordination difficult to
          achieve. An attempt at better coordination is being made through
          the Fertilizer Committee established in 1970 and chaired by the
          ~tinistry of Agriculture on which all concerned are represented.
          The Government has agreed to appoint IGSAS to this Committee.

12.       Benefits. At full production the annual output of ammonia and urea
from the project measured. in terms of current world market prices will amount
to about $18.9 million per year. The savings in foreign exchange, after
allowing for foreign debt service and imported materials used in production,
will be $7 - 8 million per year.
                                                            ANNEX III

13.       Potential returns from increased application of urea fertilizer are
high. Fertilizer is recognized as one of the major requirements for an ex
pansion of Turkish agricultural output. Increased use of fertilizer will both
help reduce Turkey's reliance on cereal imports in bad years and further the
development of fruit and vegetable growing for export, a promising activity
which is already receiving bank Group support. The ex-factory selling price
of urea will be fixed after consultations between IGSAS and the Bank and is
expected to be close to the $62 per ton level presently proposed by IGSAS.
This is about 12 percent less on a nutrient basis than the current price of
domestic nitrogen fertilizer but about 14 percent more than the c.i.f. price
of imported urea forecast for the mid 1970's (US$55 per ton). The ex-factory
price of ammonia is estimated at $47 per ton for the 38,000 tons per year sold
to the caprolactam plant and $52 per ton for the 52,000 tons per year sold to
the diammonium phosphate plant, the price difference being accounted for by
the additional expense of shipping ammonia to the latter plant. The 1974-75
import price of ammonia may be considerably lower than these levels for large
bulk deliveries but not for the small quantities that IGSAS expects to sell.

14.       At these price levels, the internal economic return of the project
is estimated at 15.4 percent, the internal financial return before tax at 14.7
percent and after tax at 13.0 percent. The financial projections show that
after the first two years of operation of the plant, it would be possible to
reduce the ex~factory selling prices of urea and ammonia to levels comparable
with current world market prices and the Company would still show an accept
able rate of return. Higher prices in the first two years are necessitated
by the low debt service coverage in these years. The Government would thus
have some flexibility, after the first few years of operation of the plant,
to achieve a better balance between the prices charged by the industry and
world market prices. It is expected that the price paid by the farmer for
urea would not be affected by the change-over from imported to domestic
production urea. In the longer run however the farmer stands to benefit
directly by any price reductions that can be achieved.

           TURKEY: Proposed Amendment to the Loan Agreement
              845-TU (Ammonia-Urea Manufacturing Project)


1.        I submit the following recommendation regarding changes to the Loan
Agreement for the ammonia-Urea Manufacturing Projec.t in order to expand the
size of the project from one producing 750 MTD of ammonia and 830 MTD of urea
to one producing 1000 MTD of ammonia and 1550 MTD of urea, increasing the
total costs from $57.8 million-to $82.5 million, with no additional funds
requested from the Bank.

2.        On May 16, 1972, the Executive Directors approved a loan to Istanbul
Gubre Sanayii Anonim Sirketi (IGSAS) with the guarantee of the Republic of
Turkey for $24 million to help finance a fertilizer project producing an
nually 248,000 tons of ammonia of which 158,000 tons were to be converted
into 274,000 tons of urea and the remaining 90,000 tons would be sold (see
president's Report and Recommendation, distributed as R 72-96 on May 3, 1972).
The loan was signed on June 30, 1972 and became effective on October 6, 1972.

3.        Since approval, a market study commissioned under the project has
found that consumption of nitrogenous fertilizer in Turkey has increased
faster than anticipated; actual consumption in 1972 was 370,000 tons, 60,000
tons (20%) more than projected. Overall, fertilizer consumption jumped 28%
in 1972 compared to the previous year in which growth had been unusually low.
Revised forecasts based on this experience show a shortfall in production
which will not be met by other facilities. Furthermore, the engineering con
sultants hired under the project confirm that due to technological advantages,
an enlargement of the proposed plant to the new size would offer savings.
Accepting this recommendation. the Borrower, its shareholders (Turkiye
Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi - TPAO. and Istanbul Petrol Rafinerisi Anonim
Sirketi - IPRAS) and the Government have requested that the Bank approve an
increase in the size of the project to an annual production of 330,000 tons
of ammonia, of which 292,000 tons would be converted into 511,500 tons of
urea and 38,000 tons would be sold.

4.        The additional financing required of $24.7 million will be provided
by the State Invest~ent Bank (SIB) and the shareholders, including $13.0 mil
lion in foreign exchange. The SIB has increased its original loan from

$10.2 million equivalent to $25.5 million equivalent under the same terms and
conditions. The Government has agreed to increase the 8,mount of funds that
may be converted from the SIB loan into foreign exchange from $8 million to
$21 n.lllion to cover the increased needs of the project. In addition, the
shareholders have increased their share capital from $23.6 million equivalent
to $33.0 million equivalent. Cost overruns wil be borne by TPAO, IPRAS or
the Government as provided in the original Loan and Guarantee Agreements.
The financing plan is thus:

                                                       =
With the revised project, the company will have an initial debt/equity ratio
of about 60/40 and a debt service coverage of 1.2 in 1976 rising to 2.2 by
1980. These figures are in line with the original financial projections.
Because of economies of scale, the financial and economic rates of return
on the project will increase slightly.

5.        In order to develop the market for urea in Turkey, The Government
has agreed to increase its program for the importation of urea between now
and the time the plant comes into production.   IGSAS has also agreed to
engage market consultants to examine market conditions and to advise on the
various possibilities open to IGSAS for assuring continued market develop
ment prior to project completion.

6.        In the absence of objection (to be notified to the Secretary or
Deputy Secretary by the close of business on October 11, 1973), I propose to
agree to appropriate amendments to the Loan Agreement allowing for the proposed
expansion of the project.
