was\n            satisfactory, though sustainability is unlikely, given the\n            Government of Turkey's lower than expected funding\n            levels for longer term research, and the inability to retain\n            income generated for the maintenance of staff (including a\n            continued erosion of staff numbers, and technical capacity),\n            particularly at the Agricultural Economics Research\n            Institute (AERI). It is highlighted that despite lessons\n            from previous sector operations, those were seemingly not\n            incorporated into the project design, which would have\n            helped in attaining sustainability, and enhanced\n            institutional development. The first lesson points at the\n            already known structural problems in the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), namely that of a\n            fragmented research structure, and inflexible personnel\n            management policy, which were not addressed; thus, it is\n            paramount for future operations to acknowledge the risks of\n            proceeding with investment lending, in the absence of\n            broader structural, and civil service reforms. Moreover, the\n            insufficient local ownership within the research community,\n            or MARA, calls for broader stakeholder involvement, and\n            commitment to project design during preparation of future\n            operations. And, while the research funding through a\n            competitive grant system worked reasonably well, such grants\n            need to be complemented by funding for longer-term research,\n            carefully explained to the research, and extension\n            community, with particular attention to procurement, and\n            financial arrangements, as well as commitments to long term\n            technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2002-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
