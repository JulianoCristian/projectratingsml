research services to provide appropriate technologies for\n            solving farmers' problems and raising their incomes,\n            with a concentration of effort on the less developed regions\n            of eastern and southeastern Turkey.  The project will\n            strengthen: (a) the research capabilities of institutions\n            developing technology suitable for eastern and southeastern\n            Turkey; (b) national research programs in the areas of\n            erosion control/soil conservation, soil fertility, pesticide\n            management, residue control, and farming systems research;\n            (c) research planning, budgeting and monitoring systems; and\n            (d) capacity for testing food products for conformity to\n            pesticide and hormone residue regulations; and will\n            establish an Agricultural Economic Research Institute. The\n            project includes civil works (laboratories, offices,\n            workshops, staff housing), laboratory and field equipment,\n            vehicles, staff training, incremental vehicle and equipment\n            operating costs and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1992-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
