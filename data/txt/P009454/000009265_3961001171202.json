First, conditions of\n            loan and subloan pricing permit more rational\n            decision-making by lenders and subborrowers. Second, the\n            project expands term lending facilities in Taka, offering\n            fixed and variable rate subloans, and introduces US\n            dollar-denominated term lending, providing a line of credit\n            equivalent to US$25 million. Third, it supports private\n            sector development through subloans for industrial\n            investments.  Furthermore, the project includes technical\n            assistance for the development and application of\n            environmental guidelines and standards for industry."}, "docdt": "1992-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
