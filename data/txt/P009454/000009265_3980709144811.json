Some lessons learned\n            included: in the case of weak institutional capacity by the\n            implementation agency and the difficulty to improve such\n            capacity during the time scope of the project. In the\n            absence of an adequate regulatory framework for the\n            financial system, the financial statements for financial\n            institutions could be misleading, and therefore an in depth\n            analysis of the financial institutions may be necessary when\n            adequate information is crucial for project design. The\n            timetable for implementation of technical assistance\n            components should be realistic, taking into accounts the\n            procedures and past experience of the country. Projects\n            should openly acknowledge those issues that cannot be\n            addressed under that operation but need to be covered at a\n            later stage."}, "docdt": "1998-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
