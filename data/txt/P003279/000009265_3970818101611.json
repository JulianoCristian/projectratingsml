and\n            management counselling to small-scale entrepreneurs. The\n            project will also strengthen the Small Enterprises\n            Development Corporation (SEDCO). Specifically, the project\n            will: (i) provide a line of credit to SEDCO for on-lending\n            to an estimated 470 SSEs; and (ii) provide technical\n            assistance. The technical assistance will improve the\n            institutional efficiency of SEDCO, help finance a management\n            training program for small contractors and finance a study\n            of the construction sector and its potential for small\n            construction firms. The project will play a critical role in\n            strengthening the Government program to provide an effective\n            integrated package of technical and financial support to\n            small-scale entrepreneurs."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
