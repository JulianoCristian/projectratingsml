The obkectives of the project were (a) institution\n            building through the strengthening of the Small Enterprise\n            Development Corporation (SEDCO); (b) employment creation;\n            and (c) broad-based socio-economic development through\n            establishing and strengthening Small and Medium Enterprises\n            (SMEs).  Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) project preparation\n            should include identification of the principal constraints\n            to SME development and the project should address these\n            constraints in a comprehensive fashion; (ii) critical to the\n            success of support measures for SMEs is vision for the SME\n            sector; (iii) intermediation through a unique intermediary\n            such as SEDCO should be avoided; (iv) whether through one or\n            more intermediaries, on-lending access by retail\n            institutions should require continuing compliance with\n            explicit eligibility criteria including both financial\n            performance (solvency and efficiency) as well as a\n            qualitative capacity to effectively lend to the SME sector;\n            (v) to the degree possible, lending and technical assistance\n            to SMEs may need to be separate functions to ensure that\n            borrowers feel the correct set of incentives; and (vi)\n            lending rates both to and from intermediaries should be\n            comparable to market rates and positive in real terms to\n            avoid financial and real market distortions."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
