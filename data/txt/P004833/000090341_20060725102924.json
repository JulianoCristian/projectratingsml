Lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: Continuity of responsibility from project\n            preparation to execution is essential. The project was\n            prepared mainly with national level agencies but executed by\n            local authorities. Greater public information is necessary;\n            attempts were made to inform the public about the project,\n            but they did not succeed. Procurement of compatible traffic\n            signals is complicated. Traffic management, though valuable,\n            is messy and difficult to implement. The experience in Hanoi\n            and HCMC is not atypical of Bank experience. Measuring\n            outcomes of institutional strengthening/capacity building\n            remains a challenge. Government structure in Vietnam poses\n            considerable implementation challenges. Approval processes\n            are complicated, cumbersome and long."}, "docdt": "2006-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
