The analysis further\n            demonstrates the detrimental impact of currently ongoing,\n            resource degradation and its socioeconomic consequence; and\n            identifies all pertinent positive and negative impacts\n            expected of program interventions. Project interventions\n            comprise demining, demobilization, community development,\n            and reconstruction. Of the four, the component supporting\n            reconstruction and rehabilitation of non-community\n            infrastructures may have major negative impacts-although\n            this component could have a distinct positive impact when\n            correcting existing infrastructure problems. General risks\n            concern the overexploitation of forest resources; accidents\n            connected with demining; conflicts over land use, especially\n            between farmers and herders, and newcomers and residents;\n            social and political discrimination; the spread of sexually\n            transmitted diseases-particularly HIV/AIDS; disappearing\n            species and the loss of habitats; flooded lands;\n            agro-chemical pollution of water and soil from pesticides;\n            soil salinity, sedimentation, and erosion; increase of\n            water-borne illnesses; air pollution caused by dust from\n            solid and liquid waste disposal; transformation and\n            destruction of coastal areas and mangrove areas because of\n            shrimp production;  Mitigation measures will include\n            rehabilitating degraded natural habitats; construction and\n            rehabilitation of anti-salinity dikes; involving the\n            population in improving land management; and institutional\n            measures that improve knowledge of biodiversity and\n            environmental management, evaluate natural resources,\n            regulate their uses, and put in place measures for their\n            conservation; and training, information, and awareness\n            building measures. Also recommended is supplementary project\n            financing from the GEF Operational Program on sustainable\n            land management in order to further improve the land\n            resource base of the Casamance."}, "docdt": "2004-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
