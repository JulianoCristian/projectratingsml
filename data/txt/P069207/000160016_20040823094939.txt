  After almost 20 years, the conflict inCasamance inSenegal is nearing a negotiated settlement that should
  end the violence that has inflictedhundreds o f civilian deaths and injuriesuponthe Casamance population
  and generated large numbers o f displaced persons and refugees. Although this conflict was o f low
  intensity, thus allowing "business as usual" to go on in the rest o f the country, the disruption o f the
  economic and social life o f the populace posed an unsustainable constraint on the region's potential. If
  unfettered, this potential couldbringsignificant economic development to the Casamance region and, as a
  consequence, to Senegal as a whole.
  InApril2000, anewpresidenttook office asthethirdPresidentoftheRepublicofSenegal.Asaresult of
  his commitment to resolving the thorny Casamance issue, contacts for future peace negotiations started
  anew. Since then, the situation has improved significantly, culminating in the co-signing in 2001 o f two
  peace agreements by representatives o f the Movement (Mouvement des Forces Dimocratiques de la
  Casamance (MFDC)) and the Government o f Senegal (GoS). Those sketchy peace agreements briefly
  touched on such political questions as the billeting and disarmament o f armed groups, prisoner liberation
  and freedom of movement, as well as economic and social recovery issues such as mine clearance,
  reinsertion programs and improved road access.
  Inthe wake ofthose agreements, the GoSundertookthe developmentofthe Programme deRelancedes
  Activith Economiques et Sociales en Casamance (PRAESC). The program had the financial and
  technical backing o f all donors, led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the
  EuropeanUnion (EU) and the World Bank.
  The World Bank's role will be pivotal duringthe post-conflict process. Like all o f Senegal's partners, the
  World Bank i s committed to promoting the peace process within the context o f the PRAESC. This World
  Bank presence inCasamance will manifest itself intwo ways: (i)         a project specific to Casamance, Le., the
  Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project (CERSP), which will finance a portion o f the
  activities described inthe PRAESC; and (ii)       some o f its ongoing projects in Senegal, which will re-direct
  some o f their resources to Casamance.
  The CERSP will be the World Bank's primary vehicle inCasamance and i s presented inthis document.

  2.1 DESCRIPTIONOF THE CONFLICT

  Casamance, a natural region situated along the Casamance River in southwestern Senegal consists o f two
  administrative regions: Ziguinchor and Kolda, with respective areas o f 7,339 km2 and 21,011 km2.
  Casamance i s separated from the rest o f Senegal by the enclaved Republic o f The Gambia and the
 Gambia River.
 Casamance has an estimated population o f 1,341,000 inhabitants belonging to various ethnic groups -
 Diola, Fulbe (Peuls), Mandingue, Soninke, SQkre, Wolof, Toucouleur, Bambara, Manjaque, Mankagne,
PCpel, Balantes and Bairnouk - all with distinct languages or dialects.' Separatist aspirations among the
 Casamanqais date from the colonial period, during which the populace resisted French influence. The
region's geographic and political separation, resulting from the presence o f the Gambia River and the
 former British colony o f The Gambia, has preserved its separate languages and cultures but has also

 prevented real integration with the rest o f Senegal, from which the Casamance population has remained
 somewhat aloof.
 The Casamance region has always been known for its cosmopolitan character and ethnic diversity. The
 area known as Basse Casamance, i.e., the Ziguinchor region, and Moyenne Casamance, the SCdhiou
 department in the Kolda region, whose populations are predominantly Diola, have a relatively high
 economic potential, mainly due to agriculture and tourism. The social and economic life o f the population
 revolves around the Casamance River. The population o f Haute Casamance - the area comprised o f the
 two other departments o f the Kolda region, Kolda and VClingara                   --  i s predominantly Fulbe and
 Mandingue. Poorer and with less economic potential, its physical remoteness from Dakar limits its
 development prospects.

 Cause of the Casamance conflict
 "At root, MFDC (Mouvement des Forces De`mocratiquesde Casamance) militancy is the outgrowth o f economic
 grievances and, secondarily, cultural ones that compound Diola rejection o f the impositions o f an alien central
 government. Though the Casamance i s Senegal's main food-producing area, the CasamanGaishave felt themselves
 neglected in terms o f investment from Dakar. They lack roads and transport to get food to market. Central
 government attempts to increase rice output by non-traditional methods gave rise to cultural resentment as well as
 labor shortages, particularly among the Diola. (Rice cultivation for the Diola combines deep religious significance
 with economic subsistence and is closely fitted to the local ecology.)
 "The keenest grievance has been expropriation o f land since independence by both the State and immigrants from
 northern Senegal. A significant migration o f Muslimfarmers and petty traders to the Casamance occurred in the
 1980s, when they encroached on Diola land and destroyed forest cover in order to plant groundnuts. Though lands
 are nominally divided between Muslims and Catholics, a common Diola religious tradition uniting the Diola with
 the land, and with the forest in particular, continues to run strong. It unifies Muslimand Catholic alike against the
heterodox Muslim settlers from the north. The latter stand accused by the Diola o f pillaging the resources o f the
Casamance with the complicity o fthe authorities."

The conflict aimed at independence for Casamance has been impeding this region's development. The
causes are complex and include historic, economic, and social factors (e.g., youth unemployment and land
tenure problems) as well as cultural issues (e.g., the failure to acknowledge local specificities). Despite its
apparent ethnic roots, the conflict i s mainly economic and political, however. As with other recent
regional conflicts, the main cause i s the marginalization o f the region within an overly centralized
country.
The separatist insurrection is straining the government's military and political capacities and paralyzing
Senegal's most fertile region. Untilrecently, this conflict was portrayed as solely a Senegalese problem.
However, ethnic and economic factors have caused clashes between Senegalese security forces and the
MFDC guerillas to affect the stability o f neighboring countries, and particularly that o f Guinea-Bissau.
Thus, the conflict has grown from a local one to a sub-regional one. Given the cultural and economic ties
existingamong The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Casamance, a peaceful resolution in Casamance would
promote regional stability.
The conflict's intensity has varied over time, with quiet (albeit tense) periods broken by sporadic
outbreaks o f violence.
Combat zones have shifted from one area to another within the region, causing population displacements
usually o f short duration. Untilrecently, Haute Casamance - i.e., the Kolda and VClingara departments -
were spared, but an increase in livestock rustling and vandalism by armed gangs that then fled to Guinea-
Bissau led to the closing o f the border with that country in September 2002. This border has since been
re-opened.

 Peace agreements between the Government o f Senegal and the MFDC were signed on March 16 and 23,
 2001. Those sketchy peace agreements briefly touched on such political questions as the billeting and
 disarmament o f armed groups, prisoner liberation and freedom o f movement, as well as economic and
 social recovery issues such as mine clearance, reinsertionprograms, and improvedroad access.

 2.2    CURRENT STATUS

 Despite the progress made, low intensity violence, some criminal and some political in nature, has
 persisted in the area. Dissension within the MFDC has sometimes provoked violence. However,
 discussions within the Movement have gone on under pressure from a Casamance population exhausted
 by more than 20 years o f fruitless conflict. After some changes at the top (including the death due to
 illness o f a major past military leader), the MFDC now seems close to the unity necessary for a peace
 process.
 Contacts between both parties resumed with a high-level meeting on May 4, 2003 between the President
 o f Senegal and the political leader o f the MFDC. The MFDC convened a conference o f the Movement's
 major leaders from October 6 to 8, 2003. The conclusions o f this meeting were quite clear about the
 commitment o f MFDCrepresentatives to ending the violence and reaching a final peace agreement.
 InJanuary 2004, the Government announced significant progresstowardspeace. While no overallpeace
 accord has been signed yet, negotiations with the three separate factions have begun. The most radical
 faction has just signed an agreement that ends combat, withdraws troops to their barracks, ends road
blockades by ex-combatants and agrees to restorehehabilitate basic social infrastructure inthe area. There
have been no significant attacks in several months; indeed, the army i s feeding the rebels as an incentive
to get them to lift roadblocks, and the Government feels that the conditions for security and peace are
present. These initiatives intensified until the adoption o f Amnesty Law No. 2004.20 on July 21, 2004.
On the same occasion, the Government established the Agence Nationale de Relance des Activitks
Economiques et Sociales en Casamance (ANRAC, created by decret o f No.2004.822 o f July 2004) to
implement, among other things, the PRAESC.


2.3    HUMANAND SOCIAL IMPACT

The toll of the conflict is now fairly well documented: many thousands o f lives lost, hundreds o f people
injuredby mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and tens of thousands displaced either internally or
externally. According to the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF), which works inCasamance, the
consequences include around 30,000 displaced persons,2 231villages deserted and 4,000 school students
displaced and accommodatedintemporary housing. Land mine victims from 1988 to 1999, as reportedby
the NGO Handicap International (HI), totaled 433, including 95 deaths. Most o f these accidents occurred
inthe latter half of the 1990s. The UnitedNations HighCommission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates
that there are 13,000 refugees inGuinea-Bissau and The Gambia.
The area most affected lies south o fZiguinchor on the border with Guinea-Bissau. MFDCapparently had
regrouped its forces and placed land mines in fields to protect them. The mines, combined with frequent
fighting, pushed civilians out o f the region toward inner Casamance and Ziguinchor city. Other parts o f
the Ziguinchor region, especially the north, have been less affected thanks to a separate peace agreement
between the GoS and the so-called `northern wing' o f the rebellion. Violence, apparently more criminal
than military in nature, has also been reported there, however. After the battles, armed gangs leave

 randomly placed antipersonnel mines to prevent effective pursuit. This atmosphere o f lawlessness
 increases feelings o f insecurity among the localpopulation.
 The Kolda region i s markedly less afflicted. The impact o f the conflict decreases as distance from the
 Ziguinchor region increases. Land mines have been detected only in the SCdhiou department, for
 example, while the Kolda and VClingara departments are almost untouched.
 The health system has also suffered: many health centers have shut down and the vaccination program
 (Programme klargi de vaccination, or PEV) was unable to reach its assigned objectives. Access to the
 health system i s especially difficult inthe many rural areas inwhich infrastructure has been destroyed and
 health care workers have often left. Infrastructure not destroyed has been neglected and left unattended,
 leading to theft o f eq~ipment.~Unsafe conditions and the difficulty o f free movement, especially during
 the rainy season, make access to health facilities even more problematic. Finally, displaced persons
 cannot always afford the requiredco-payment (tickets modkrateurs) or drugs, even when health facilities
 are nearby.
 The extent o f the A I D S epidemic i s not well known, for lack o f reliable data. With few health facilities
 operating, exhaustive data collection has been impossible. In the Ziguinchor department, 3,300 AIDS-
 infected persons have been identified, for a prevalence rate o f 0.90 percent. Of these, 1,500, or 45.45
percent, are females. In the Kolda department, 4,300 adults (i.e., individuals aged 15 and older) are
 infected, for a prevalence rate o f 0.80 percent. Of these, 2000, or 45.5 1percent, are females. Indramatic
contrast, the AIDS infection rate among sex-workers i s estimated to be 20 percent.
Maternal mortality in this region is alarming: the figure in Kolda i s 1,200 maternal deaths per 100,000
birthsvs. anational average o f about 510 deathsper 100,000 births.
As for the education sector, the Ministryo f Education estimates that the Ziguinchor region has a school
deficit: 37 schools that have either closed or failed to open, for a deficit o f 96 classrooms affecting
approximately 3,840 students. As a result, most students have moved toward the city and department o f
Ziguinchor where they attend school inmakeshift buildings. Paradoxically, the Ziguinchor region has the
highest level o f school enrollment in Senegal, reflecting the Casamanqais' strong belief inthe benefits of
education.


2.4    ECONOMICIMPACT

The Casamance conflict has taken a toll on the southern part o f Senegal, a region with great agricultural
potential, abundant rain, and land suited to the cultivation o f rice, fruits, and vegetables. Forestry
resources are also plentiful and include many indigenous species. Important fish resources are provided
by the 86-km-long coastline, the 300-km-long river and numerous ponds. In the mining sector,
Casamance has oil, peat bogs, gnafouran, and shell sediments inthe river's islands. The land issue, which
i s central to Casamance economic life, i s at the epicenter o f the conflict and i s therefore critical to its
resolution.

             affected by the violence.

      (iv) Finally, the formal private sector, particularly in the tourism area, is plagued by the lack o f
             safety, and some companies have hadto cease operation.

 It is difficult to assess the overall impact o f the Casamance conflict on the Senegalese economy. Impact
 on the government budget i s limited interms o f expenditures. Top officers inthe Senegalesearmy (Armde
Nationale Sdnkgalaise, ANS) state that defense budget increases have been small since the army opted to
transfer troops into Casamance to enforce law and order. The conflict i s therefore not consideredto have a
 significant impact onmilitary resource^.^
Beyond the capital destruction costs, most o f the economic losses for Senegal are thus opportunity costs
arising from the inability to exploit Casamance's economic potential, which has inturn had an impact on
the State's fiscalrevenues, poverty alleviation andGDP growth.
Duringthe conflict, public investmentinCasamancebythe Government o f Senegal remained constant or
even increased. However, many projects were slowed or even stopped due to the lack o f security.
It is difficult to estimate what the volume of private investments would have been under normal
circumstances and what benefits it would have brought to both the local and national economies. Still, it
seems that investments have not been commensurate with this region's potential. Tourism has been
negatively affected, with many investors shunningthe region for fear o fpotential customer flight.
The greatest economic impact has been on the poorest o f the poor in Casamance, and especially its
farmers. Inparticular, they have been unable to fully exploit the locally available agricultural potential.
The sowing o f landmines, which began in August 1997, led the NGO Rencontre Africaine pour la
Dtifense des Droits de 1'Homme (RADDHO) to assert at the Organization o f African Unity (OAU)
Summit in Ouagadougou inJune 1998 that no rice had been cultivated inCasamance during the previous
crop year and that none would likely be planted that year. Likewise, fruit and vegetable crops are also
very probably affectedbythe presence of landmines.


2.5     RECONSTRUCTIONEFFORTS

There are many development projects in this region, o f which some are described in the following
paragraphs. Yet few so far have offered activities specifically aimed at post-conflict reconstruction.

     (i)    The only agencies active in mine clearance are the French NGO Handicap International (HI)
            and, to a lesser extent, UNICEF. HI offers social and medical assistance to land mine victims
            and has started mine hazard outreach and training campaigns. These activities are ongoing, and
            HIis seeking supplemental fundingto continue its activities. HIalso wishes to conduct a Level
            1 Survey o f mine-infested zones, subject to funding.6 UNICEF, whose 2001 program was
            financed by USAID, i s collaborating with HIon outreach campaigns.


4 It mustbe acknowledged, however, that the tax recovery rate has always been low, even inthe absence of such a
declaration.
  This assertion is questionable since it assumes that troops stationed inCasamance do not cost more than in other
places. No data is available to refute this, however.
 "This [survey level I]is the investigation o f suspected minedareas to collect information onthe general location o f
mines. Ths information gathering process i s intended to identify general details o f where the mines may be located
and which areas are safe. I t will also establish high and low risk areas, in which case further planning can be

    (ii)UNICEF       has also been involved in aiding displaced persons, as has the World Food Program
          (WFP), which launched a Food for Work program in 2001 in support o f Internally Displaced
          Persons (IDPs) and other affected people. UNICEF's program "aims to support people
          negatively impacted by the crisis and to create a peace-enabling environment through better
          access to basic social services."
    (iii)Althoughthereisnodedicateddemobilizationprogram,UNICEFisworkingonpeace-building
          through its program, as i s USAID, which finances similar small programs in both the
          Ziguinchor and Kolda regions.
Despite the sporadic violence in Casamance, none o f the many other development programs i s
specifically aimed at conflict resolution. For instance, the multi-donor Transport Sector Program
(Programme Sectoriel des Transports 2, PST2) is engaged inrehabilitating the Diouloulou-Bignona road
and the port o f Ziguinchor. Similarly, a few decentralization promotion projects, such as the EU's
PADEL (Projet d'appui a la dkcentralisation et au dkveloppement local) or the French Cooperation's
ADDEL (Projet d'appui au dkveloppement local en Casamance) or GTZ's PAARZ (Projet d'appui a
1'autopromotion de la Rkgion de Ziguinchor) are ongoing. They are progressing, although sometimes
very slowly. Since early 2004, many initiatives have emerged:
          These include, among others, GTZ's financial and technical support, amounting to CFAF 3.4
          billion, for the Projet d'Appui au Dkveloppement Socio-kconomique pour la Paix en
          Casamance (PROCAS), an essential component o f which i s the improvement o f basic service
          provision and infrastructures, primarily by rebuilding homes through the traditional solidarity
          system, and the rehabilitation or diggingo f modernwells to improve accessto drinking water.
          Canada recently formulated a program for the restoration o f socio-economic activities in
          Casamance through the local development fund (Fonds Local de Dkveloppement - FLD) made
          available to the Government. This program, valued at CFAF 1.3 billion and defined as part o f
          the PRAESC, revolves around support for the development o f community infrastructures and
          the promotiono f socio-economic activity.
          USAID has launched a support program to re-establish viable communities by grouping
          persons who remained invillages duringthe conflict, IDPs, refugees, as well as ex-combatants
          o f the MFDC. Financing totaling CFAF 635 million will boost water supply by improving
          wells or diggingnew ones and byrehabilitating health centers and classrooms.
          The Islamic Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in A h c a
          (Banque Arabe pour le DkveloppementEconomique de Afrique - BADEA)have resumedtheir
          financial support to the Programme de Lutte Anti-Sel (salt abatement program) in the
          Ziguinchor and Kolda regions for the construction o f anti-salinization andor water retention
          dikes.
         Italy has initiated a new program named ((Fonds Local de Dkveloppement de Skdhiou en
         Moyenne Casamance )) (local development fund for SCdhiou in Moyenne Casamance)
         amounting to CFAF 2,500 million. This program i s a follow-on o f the PRIMOCA and has two

           finance over the 2003-2005 period the water management infrastructure project for Basse
            Casamance (Projet d 'Am&agement Hydro-Agricole de la Basse Casamance) for a total o f
           CFAF 800 million, as well as the provisiono f public services inthe Kolda region for a total o f
           CFAF 2,200 million, which includes:

 Over the same period, the GoS will provide counterpart financing totaling CFAF 2,658 million for
 projects and programs specific to Casamance that are funded by its partners. GoS i s also contributing
 counterpart fundingfor national projects and programs of which Casamance-related activities are a part.
 Finally, a mine clearing unit from the Senegalese army has been assigned for the long term to the
 Ziguinchor region. This unit has been provided with up-to-date equipment (e.g., mine detectors) and has
received support from national service volunteers to perform humanitarian mine clearing o f villages and
roads.


2.6    CROSS-SECTORAL NEEDSAND SECTORAL PRIORITIES

Current and planned activities in Casamance are in urgent need o f coordination. Indeed, many activities,
however limited, are being implemented in the absence of proactive and global dialogue, despite the
Government's official stand against piecemeal approaches. As a result, comprehensive and detailed
knowledge o f the issues at stake in Casamance i s laclung and interventions occur on a case-by-case basis
depending on the agenda, capacity, and available funding o f the implementing agency. Problem-solving i s
thereby complicated, since few if any agencies can provide a comprehensive solution to any given
problem. In addition, numerous and substantial sector needs must be addressed in order to lay a solid
groundwork for economic and social recovery inCasamance.
2.6.1    Land mine clearance
The first land mines appeared in Casamance in 1991. Until 1997, their use was limited, improvised and
sporadic, usually at the initiative o f individual combatants. Since mines did not yet pose a significant
hazard, an elaborate mine clearance policy was not justified. The existence o f mine stockpiles hadnot yet
beenascertained. Between 1991and 1997, landmineincidents claimed only about a dozen victims. It was
only in 1997, i.e., about fifteen years after the conflict had begun, that the use o f land mines intensified in
Casamance, a trend manifested in the large number o f incidents noted. From 1997 onward, mines began
to be deployed according to conventional military methods.
Land mines mainly affect local populations, claiming numerous victims and causing family upheaval
through the loss o f a parent or the infliction o f a severe physical injury. Their economic impact i s also
substantial. Because many accidents occur as people are harvesting crops or collecting firewood, farmers
avoid activities on portions o f their village lands out o f fear. It i s the fear o f a potentially mined area,

 Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                                8


 more than the actual number o f mines placed, which influences the population's behavior and risk-
 avoidance strategy. Different age groups exhibit different behaviors, and women and children often pay
 the heaviest price. Behavioral changes caused by the actual or supposed presence o f land mines have a
 lasting impact on production potential.
 2.6.2     Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (DRR)
 There are no reliable estimates o f the number o f combatants needing to be reinserted into civilian life.'
 According to information gathered (based on sightings o f combatants in the Bignona area during the
 elections, reports by NGOs onrecent MFDC activity, the existence o f four fronts, etc.), there are probably
 about 1,200-2,000 combatants' who would be subject to eventual demobilization. It i s also probable that a
 number o f young people are recruited for short-term actions, but do not actually leave their villages
 and/or families tojoin "the underground".
 In addition to these active combatants, two specific groups have been directly affected by the combat:
 namely, injured or chronically illex-combatants and the family members &e., widows and orphans) o f
 those killed in combat. There are also a number o f women who may have been forcibly recruited by
 combatants. These two groups are believed to total 2,300 persons.
 These various groups are assumedto be accompaniedby their immediate families. The exact whereabouts
 o f these families are obviously not h o w n at present, but they are probably among the refugees in Guinea
 Bissau and The Gambia. Therefore, ifwe assume an average of 7 additional persons for each person to be
 demobilized, the total number o f persons would be 18,400, a figure exceeding the currently estimated
 total number o frefugees."
 2.6.3     Local development
 The effects o f the crisis have been most severe in Basse Casamance (Ziguinchor region), the southern
part o f the dkpartement o f Stdhiou (arrondissements o f Tanaff and Diattacounda) and the southeastern
part o f the dkpartement o f Kolda, where observers note that many activities contributing to the region's
wealth have been abandoned due to the hazardous conditions. The conflict has therefore contributed to a
decline incereals production (and thus to a deterioration in food security"), which went from 41,600 tons
in 1990 to 33,500 tons in 1996, a drop of 19.7 percent. The reappearance of mines in 1997 accentuated
the downward activity trend, despite rainfall that was once again "normal". Natural resource management
projects, many involving costly infrastructures, were scaled back or even stopped.
Important projects (such as the expansion o f the Ziguinchor industrial zone that was to have included the
establishment o f about fifteen SMVSMEs by 2000) have been suspended or cancelled, and tourism has
been seriously disruptedfor several years, although a modest recovery has been noted over the past few
years.




'ThisNovember
7      is true despite meetings with political and military leaders o f the MFDC.
  In            2003, an authorized military spokesman estimated this number at 500 combatants at most.
  According to some sources, a considerable number o f women are active inthe `underground'. They are thought to
be involved in particular in weapons trafficking and distribution (e.g., munitions transport and placement o f land
mines). Rumor has it that they are paid each time a land mine claims a victim, with the price depending on whether
the victim was a civilian or a soldier. MFDC authorities reject this claim, however, citing the Diola tradition that
bars women from combat. N o mention is made o f child soldiers.
10 This figure would be a maximum. Indeed, according to tradition, warriors (or combatants inthis case) are young
unmarried men, and warrior/combatant status ends with marriage. It is therefore possible that the direct dependents
o f combatants are few innumber.The situation is obviously different inthe case o f leaders and commanders.
I1 The special CRD report dated May 15, 1999 conceming the Prime Minister's visit at that time mentions a decline
inagricultural activity o fover 50percent, according to then-recent studies.

At the socio-economic level, many private and/or community-level infrastructures -mainly homes, wells,
roads, community gardens, community centers, individual and community plantations - have been
 abandoned or even destroyed.
Inaddition, there has been a marked population movement (involving over 28,200 people) away from
villages that have become unsafe. This has led to increased population density in various townships
(communes)'2o f both regions, and especially in the regional capitals. Inthe region o f Ziguinchor, there
are indications that over 231 villages have been abandoned. In the region o f Kolda, according to a
 summary provided up by the prefect o f the department o f SCdhiou in June 2003, 69 villages in the two
arrondissements o f Diattacounda and Tanaff, which are the most affected by the conflict, with a total
population o f 21,780 inhabitants, have been abandoned.
According to government sources inZiguinchor, over 37 schools (or 96 classrooms) there have sustained
physical damage, and 31 o f those have been completely abandoned. To deal with the classroom shortage
in the region, local populations have constructed temporary shelters: 519 inthe department of Bignona,
 122 in Oussouye and 177 in Ziguinchor. Inthe department o f SCdhiou, 75 temporary shelters have been
builtinDiattacoundaand22 inTanaff, usingout-of-pocket contributions o fthe localpopulation.

youth centers, 32 shops, 15 bridges and the customs checkpoint o f SilCty (on the Gambian border). In
terms o f medical and social welfare infrastructures, available information indicates that 28 health posts
have been abandoned in the region o f Ziguinchor. Those involved in community development and the
decentralization process feel that the State has transferred skills without transferring the means, know-
how andmechanisms needed to facilitate localdevelopment.
Livestock theft, especially in the Kolda region, was regularly reported in 2001 and 2003. Revenues
derivedfrom natural resource useby the Forestry Service have also declined by 62.2 percent, from CFAF
45 millionin 1991 to CFAF 17 millionin 1997.
2.6.4    InfrastructureRehabilitationandReconstruction
Some populations face enormous difficulties due to a lack o f infrastructures or the non-functionality o f
those that do exist. Most problems are in the sectors o f transportation, education, health, hydraulics,
electricity, irrigationinfrastructures, environment, fisheries, and tourism; to name only a few.
2.6.4.1    Transportationsector
Ifthere is an issue directly relevantto the security situation inCasamance, itisthat ofthe accessibility of
the southern regionv i s - h i s the rest o f Senegal as the Gambia River i s a natural barrier. Eventhough, the
development partners o f both countries have long stated their willingness to contribute to the buildingo f a
bridgeover The Gambia River, there i s still some political disagreement betweenthe two governments on
thisissue.
Without a solution, the options for enhancing access to Casamance will mainly consist of road
rehabilitation operations. Roads in Casamance are generally in very poor shape (as they are in Senegal
generally), with 28.5 percent (1998 estimate) o f paved roads and 82 percent (1994 estimate) o f unpaved
roads inpoor condition.
Based on the general comparative situation as o f November 2000, it appears that road networks in
Casamance are in worse condition than the national average. The security situation cannot be blamed
entirely for this difference, since the regions o f Diourbel and Kaolack are also below average; the

 situation common to Casamance's two regions i s exacerbated, however, by the physical inaccessibility
 specific to them.
 As o f late 2003, air transport was still the safest means o ftransportation despite its relatively highcost for
 most potential customers. Indeed, the capsizing on September 26,2002 o f the ferry the "M.S. L e Diola"
 significantly slowed the maritime connection between Ziguinchor and Dakar, which had been the most
 reliable and cheapest means o f transporting people and goods between those two cities. That route i s now
 served only by a military vessel and a small cargo ship. The Govemment i s inthe process o fpurchasing a
 new boat to serve the route and has indicated its intention to bring in private participation in the
 company's management.
 Since the option initially chosen by the Ministry o f Transport and Equipment, Le., to charter a vessel by
 the end o f October 2003, has not materialized, financing was mobilized by the German Cooperation and
 the EBI to purchase a vessel. This process could take 10-12 months, however. The option o f private
 managementwill be studied for that boat.
 2.6.4.2   Educationsector
With a gross enrollment rate o f 93 percent in 1999, the region ofZiguinchor ranks second after Dakar. Its
 87,739 students are distributed among 20 pre-schools, 292 primary schools, 28 middle schools, 5
 secondary schools, and 16 technical and vocational schools.
The unsafe conditions have either closed or immobilized 37 schools in the region. They account for 96
classrooms that would serve about 3,840 students. Most (70 percent) o f this displaced student population
i s concentrated in the department and commune o f Ziguinchor, where they are accommodated in
temporary shelters.
According to the Ziguinchor school inspectors, three schools (81 classrooms in Bignona) have reopened
inthe region of Ziguinchor with the assistance of UNICEF and so-called "pioneer" teacher^.'^ In2002,
there were 27 `pioneers' inthe field. Many classrooms inthe region are still intemporary shelters: 519 in
Bignona, 122inOussouye and 177 inZiguinchor.
For the rural communes (communes ruraux, CRs) affected by the conflict in the arrondissements o f
Diattacounda (CRs o f Diattacounda, Samine, Djibanar) and Tanaff (CRs o f Tanaff Niagha, Simbanding
Brassou) in the department o f SCdhiou (Kolda region), there are 35 and 22 temporary shelters,
respectively. These two arrondissements have, respectively, 15 and 23 classrooms that lack teachers.
According to available statistics, the gross enrollment rate inthe Koldaregionwas 70 percent in 1999.
2.6.4.3    Healthsector
The health care situation is critical in Casamance, especially in the region o f Kolda, with insecurity an
aggravating factor. Populations on the move often leave everything behindintheir fear o f the fighting and
are forced to move inwith relatives. This leads to overcrowding and fosters the spread o f disease.
Insum, the healthcareinfrastructures andequipment inthe regionface the following constraints: (i)          poor
spatial distribution, inadequate number o f health posts and scarcity o f drugs; (ii)  inadequate size o f many
current public health posts; (iii)    inadequate, absent or outdated equipment; (iv) absence o f fencing,
lodging and running water in certain posts; (v) shortage, or even absence, of staff in health care centers
and health posts; (vi) shortage o f hospital beds relative to demand; (vii) shortage or absence o f logistical
means; (viii) scarcity o f hnds for the purchase o f drugs and fuel; (ix) dilapidated buildings and/or
unsanitary conditions in some public health facilities; and (x) the poor conditi8on o f roads, which makes
the evacuation o fpatients difficult.

 Inthe regionofZiguinchor the health service is poor: 28 healthposts (HPs) out of 81 are closed (5 for
 lack o f staff and/or equipment and 23 due to unsafe conditions, o f which 11 have been de~troyed)'~;3
 HPs are operating with moderate technical facilities and reduced staff; the regional hospital is
 overburdened, and the mental health center at KCnia barely hnctional (due to a lack o f staff and
 dilapidated facilities). The region o f Kolda has one o f the weakest levels o f coverage in the country in
 terms o f health care infrastructures and staff. The average radius o f a health post service area exceeds 15
 km.
 2.6.4.4    Hydraulics sector
Despite its abundant rainfall, Casamance has significant problems with safe water supply. The rate of
 coverageof the population is 38 percent in Ziguinchor and 26 percent in Kolda, which is far below the
national average o f 54 percent.
Despite the difficulties, facilities (boreholes, tubewells or wells) have been built but not in sufficient
numbers. Throughout Senegal, the State (with the help o f its development partners) and NGOs have
installed 927 motorized boreholes; 74 equipped boreholes or wells; 1,028 boreholes, tubewells or wells
equipped with manual pumps; and 2,100 wells or tubewells usingtraditional water-extraction systems.
2.6.4.5    Hydro-agricultural installationssector
Casamance possesses good potential for irrigated agriculture (throughcontrolled flooding). About 9,000
ha o f irrigated perimeters are being worked inBasse Casamance and Moyenne Casamance. On the other
hand, salt encroachment may seriously compromise this potential if the phenomenon i s not addressed.
Thisrequires substantial investment, however, inthe area o f hydro-agricultural installations.
A number o f primary works have been built under large programs, but practically no secondary works.
Secondary infrastructures should therefore be built over the short-tenn wherever they are feasible and of
immediate utilityto the population.
Over the longer term, the large-scale primary infrastructure programs should be re-launched after an in-
depth study of surface water trends in recent years. It should be noted that no hydraulic facility has
suffered any damage because o f the conflict.
2.6.4.6    Environmentalsector
With regard to the environment, the plundering of forest species is striking in Casamance. Hazardous
conditions prevent Water and Forestry Service agents from venturing into the bush. Wood-cutting i s
therefore occurring inan anarchic fashion, leading to substantial deforestation.
Inthe very short term, one can hope that improved security conditions will enable Water and Forestry
Service agents to resume their surveillance and maintenance o f wooded areas. This should stop, or at least
slow, the current deforestation. However, the long-term mode o f conservation and exploitation o f these
natural resources will needto bere-defined.

THE PROGRAMMEDERELANCEDESACTIVITES ECONOMIQUESET SOCIALES
                                      ENCASAMANCE (PRAESC)

InNovember 2000, the Ministryof Economy and Finance contacted the main donors interested inthe
Casamance issue to request their participation inrecovery activities in Casamance under the coordination
o f the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This
collaboration led to the Programme de Relance des Activitks Economiques et Sociales en Casamance



l4The district ofZiguinchor is the most affected bythese closures (11posts).

 (PRAESC). PRAESC i s a comprehensive and evolving document that defines a framework and activities
 aimed at Casamance's recovery. The document was drawn up under the leadership o f the World Bank,
 with a Japanese Government grant from the Special Fundfor Policy and HumanResources Development
 (PHRD). It i s based on high-level discussions with many individuals and organizations, both
 governmental and non-govemmental, who had solid knowledge o f field conditions.
 The PRAESC was designed with the goal o f coordinating all activities in Casamance in order to avoid
 redundancies and inefficiencies resulting from a disorderly approach by multiple donors and programs,
 and o f ensuring that Casamance's fundamental, initial reconstruction needs are properly met. The
 PRAESC will be implementedby the ANRAC.
 Priority Interventions
 The top priority i s the re-establishment o f safe conditions and basic social and infrastructure services in
 the two administrative regions that make up Casamance. Once peace agreements are signed by all parties,
 the following tasks are urgent:
     o demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants so that they can return to socially and
         economically stable civilian lives;
     o restoration o f public safety through quick and precise location o f minefields, and commencement
         o f the mine clearance process as soon as possible;
     o restoration o f effective primary and secondary economic and social infrastructure, and especially
         transport infrastructures, the lack o f which i s currently hindering Casamance's economic
         development
     o support for communities' efforts to jumpstart their local social infrastructure, as well as support
         for individuals and groups o f persons willing to initiate small business activities and thus revive
         local economies.
Preparatory studies must also be made to assess the root causes o f the conflict and to lay the groundwork
for Casamance's future development prospects, by means o f data-gathering studies needed to generate
informationon regional strengths and weaknesses.

3.1    PR4ESC'S GENERAL OBJECTIVES

PRAESC's general objectives are to (1) facilitate the quick restoration o f a beneficial economic and social
environment in Casamance, similar to that existing in the rest o f Senegal; and (2) lay the groundwork for
sustainable long-term development inthe region, while fully respecting its specificities.

3.2    SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

The Mine Clearance (MC) program aims at minimizing as much as possible the risks linked to the
presence o f mines in some areas, to permit economic recovery and a return to normal life for refugees.
This program is a prerequisite to all other interventions, and involves at the very least the immediate
identification and marking o f potentially mine-infested areas. However, it i s estimated that complete mine
clearing o f the region may take up to five years. The program, through other donors, will launch
immediate activities to reach, as quickly as possible, a level o f security high enough to allow economic
and social recovery inhigh-priority, heavilypopulated areas.
The Demobilization, Reinsertion, and Reintegration (DRR) program aims to enable ex-combatants and
groups directly affected by the conflict make the transition to a stable civilian life. This program will
support those men and women and their families until they return to socially and economically stable
civilian positions.

Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                                  13


The Local Development (LD) program complements the DRR program. The Business Initiative Support
 (BIS) subprogram aims at facilitating individual or group for-profit activities. Although this subprogram
will be open to everyone in Casamance, ex-combatants are expected to be its first beneficiaries. The
 Community Infrastructure        (CI) subprogram will re-start community investment in local social
infrastructure, thus increasing community access to social services, as well as access to water through the
construction or rehabilitation of village water points..
The Supra-Community Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (SCIRR) programwill allow the
resumption o f full operations o f primary and secondary infrastructure that sustained direct or indirect
damage from the conflict. The objective i s the resumption o f sustainable operation, which implies that
permanent budgetary and administrative resources for the maintenance and operation o f the
infrastructures to be rebuilt will be a prerequisite for investments.
While the aforementioned activities address urgent, short-term needs, they do not deal with the root
causes o f the conflict. To prepare more ambitious future development activities, the PRAESC will launch
studies and consultations with the actors involved for the preparation o f a long-term development project.
The PRAESC has identified the following issues as critical in terms o f addressing the causes o f the
conflict:
          Transport link between Casamance and Dakar, Senegal's political and economic capital.
         Difficulties in reaching Dakar from the Casamance heartland are a major hindrance to
         Casamance's development, preventing this region from sending its products to Dakar's markets
         and from getting the political and economic attention it deserves. Since bypassing The Gambia by
         means o f inland road transport is both time-consuming and costly, two other alternatives have to
         be developed and improved: the sea link from Ziguinchor to Dakar and land transport through
         The Gambia.
         Improved access to speciJiczones in the CasamanceRiver delta, where much o f the population
         suffers from physical isolation from the rest o f the region.
         The development of tourism. Casamance i s famous for its scenic beauty, which has always drawn
         many tourists. The future o f tourism needs to be carefully studied to maximize its benefits for
         Casamance's population.
         Water resources. Despite a heavy rainy season, access to potable water i s a problem for several
         reasons. In the Ziguinchor region, sea water has infiltrated ground water supplies and ground
         water levels have fallen due to insufficient rains over the past 30 years. The Kolda region lacks
         adequate water supply facilities. Despite its definite potential, irrigated agriculture i s also inpoor
         condition due to mismanagement.
         Natural resources are alsojeopardized by the conflict. Forests, includingthose that are classified,
         have been under intense pressure.15 Mangroves are also under attack and must be properly
         managed if they are to be preserved. According to some estimates, fishing resources are being
         over-exploited and the fisheries sector i s in need o f a general reorganization. Similarly, the
         forestry and arboriculture sector mustbe revitalized so that it can achieve its full potential.
         Finally, the land tenure issue requires in-depth study. This question is central, and many assert
         that it is largely responsible for the eruption o f violence. Although it took a dramatic turn in
         Casamance, the land issue i s not specific to Casamance, however, and must be studied
         comprehensively and nationally if a solution satisfactory to all parties is to be found.




l5Class6 means that no one may alter the object - be it a forest, monument or house -- without prior governmental
consent. The concept is similar to that o f official preservation, patrimony, or heritage status inother venues.

 3.3     PRAESCPRINCIPLES AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

 The design o f the PRAESC i s based on the fundamental principle o f avoiding duplication o f effort. The
 PRAESC's design favors the use o f existing or upcoming operational projects to implement certain parts
 o f the program, rather than the creation o f new projects. Inaddition to avoiding duplication o f effort, this
 principle will permit speedy implementation, since the project's structures are already operational.
 However, the weakness of this strategy i s that it may hamper ongoing activities. For example, many pre-
 existing projects were not designed with post-conflict recovery in mind, and they may require some
 modification in order to be able to carry out activities corresponding to the PRAESC's objectives and
 methodologies. Inaddition, the implementation o f a given activity using different approaches can create
 divergences among the various regions, which can in turn cause problems. This potential source o f
 difficulty can be avoided through effective coordination inthe field.
 In response to the urgent need, identified during preparation o f the PRAESC, for a focal point for
 coordination, the Government has created ANRAC, an administrative entity under the authority o f the
 Prime Minister, which will implement the PRAESC.

The Oversight Council, chaired by a representative of the President o f the Republic and composed of
representatives o f the various ministerial departments involved in economic and social recovery activities
in Casamance, guides ANRAC activities and approves documents submitted to it for approval (e.g.,
activity programs, budgets, financial accounts, procedures manuals, etc.). It generates synergy and
promotes coordination between the State, local collectivities, NGOs, local populations, development
partners and other technical and financial partners.

3.4     P W S C COST ESTIMATE

The estimated cost o f the PRAESC as o f March 2003 was CFAF 58.0 billion, to be spent over 5 years.
Costs break down as follows:

    ProgramManagement and Support Units                                          4 323 805 000 FCFA

Almost half o f the program's costs are related to mine clearance (MC). This figure i s approximate since
there i s no reliable estimate o f the extent o f landmines inCasamance.

3.5     INTERNATIONAL RESPONSEAND COORDINATIONMECHANISMS IN
        PLACE

The Casamance conflict has been low inintensity and the Casamance regionhas received donor attention
and many projects are ongoing, albeit with some difficulties. Moreover, some donors have been directly
involved in peace-building efforts. For instance, following the 1991 and 1993 peace agreements with the
MFDC's Front Nord (Northern wing), then the movement's most important faction, a demobilization
program for young Front Nord combatants was launched in 1992 with EU funding. This program was
quite innovative in terms o f its methodology o f reinserting ex-combatants either into their original

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                          16


 villages or at least into their ethnic gr0~ps.l~  Other donors such as USAID or UNICEF are involved in
 similar peace-building and tension-abating efforts.
 Given these ongoing activities and new developments inthe negotiation process, the GoS has emphasized
 the need for all donors to work ina collaborative, integratedfashion. The donors have readily adopted this
 recommendation, and been supportive o f the approach. The EUand UNDP have been assigned the role o f
 coordinating the activities o f the government's developmentpartners.
 This coordination has ledto numerousjoint meetingsbetween all donors and GoS representatives, with a
 view to harmonizing activities, clarifying themes and defining the intervention process. In2000, a core
 group o f donors including the EU, the UNDP, the World Bank, and USAID worked closely with the
 Ministry of Finance to draw up terms of reference that described the framework and implementation
 details to revive development activities in Casamance. This core group o f donors joined the GoS' Groupe
 de Travail sur la Casamanceto supervise preparation o f the PRAESC. The donors share a willingness to
 avoid duplication and maximize their outputs to support the peace process. The active support o f most o f
 them during the PRAESC preparation, and their mobilization o f resources and time to ensure its success,
 demonstrate their commitment to full participation inpeacefullong-term solutions to Casamance's issues.
 Moreover, the PRAESC document was the basis for a United Nations (UN) document drawn up in
 preparation for a roundtable that was scheduled for mid-2001 but was cancelled due to the negotiation
 stalemate. As o f March 2004, donor commitment to the PRAESC i s strong, and many are willing to share
 its cost. We are confident that the Program will be fully funded.

                   4.       SECTIONC: BANK'S RESPONSEAND STRATEGY


4.1     OBJECTIVES, RATIONALEAND STRATEGY

4.1.1 CurrentWorld BankInvolvementin Senegal
The project was prepared in the context o f the CAS presented to the Board in April 2003. Of the 18
credits in the portfolio in various sectors, the rural infrastructures and social development fund APLs
would be particularly usedinBank's response to the Casamance's conflict.
4.1.2 Rationalefor WorldBankinvolvementinCasamance
Although the political situation in Casamance i s not completely stabilized, since the different factions o f
the MFDC are giving contradictory signals, peace i s now regarded as inevitable. Violence has virtually
ceased and the rare incidents are o f a criminal nature. There i s sufficient progress towards peace.
The Casamancepopulationnow wants to reap the benefits o f this restoration o fpeace. The GoS intends to
meet this demand and encourage all its partners to quickly increase their involvement in Casamance, in
order to support the population inpersuading the few last holdouts to resume a peaceful civilian life.
A significant presence of the World Bank, a major partner o f the GoS, will send a strong signal to the
Casamance population that Senegal's partners are willing to support this region's development. Indeed,
the Bank's absence could be perceived as lack o f confidence or, worse, indifference to the fate o f
Casamance. Such a signal could retard the restoration o f peace and provoke frustrations that could lead to
renewed violence.
As noted above, the WorldBank will not be alone inthis approach. Manypartners have already increased
their presence inthe field. This presence lacks overall coordination, however, and certain needs are either

not beingmet or are beingonly partially met. Quick implementation o f a programmatic approach, such as
the PRAESC, is therefore required. Through the launch of the PRAESC, the World Bank will strongly
 signal to Senegal's other partners its support for field-level cooperation and coordination, thus
 encouraging operational dialogue among them, and will help leverage other resources.
4.1.3    World BankObjectivesin Casamance
The World Bank will support the PRAESC, a program designed by the GoS for the economic recovery o f
Casamance. It will finance parts o f the identified activities as well as coordination activities through
ANRAC.. Thus, the World Bank supports the PRAESC's general objectives.
4.1.4    WorldBankStrategyin Casamance
4.1.4.1    Implementationof a CasamanceEmergencyReconstructionSupport Project(CERSP)
The CERSP will be the World Bank's primary vehicle in Casamance. As an emergency project, it will
follow the World Bank's special procedures. By definition, it only includes short-term activities. This
project i s expected to be implemented over a periodo f three (3)years.
The purpose o f this project i s to fund activities not covered by the current portfolio in Senegal. As
detailed in Section D on page 18, in addition to the participation in the establishment o f ANRAC, the
CERSP will also finance the DRR, a portion o f reconstmction and rehabilitation investments, as well as
other activities such as long-term development studies, conflict early waming and prevention,
information, monitoringand evaluation, environmental activities, etc..
4.1.4.2    Other donors' involvement inthe PR4ESC
The PRAESC i s ambitious and costly and the involvement o f all Senegal's partners i s required to
implement it fully. As described in paragraph 2.5 on page 5, many donors are willing to commit
themselves and some have already begun their activities. Therefore, PRAESC financing is, it i s hoped,
largely inplace.
Nevertheless, the mine clearance issue i s critical. UNDP has asserted its leadership in this area and the
European Union i s expected to commit a substantial amount to this component, with support from some
other bi-lateral donors.17However, it i s not clear that the mine clearing needs identifiedby the PRAESC
will be covered. Still, this should not compromise World Bank activities in Casamance, because only 5
percent o fareas will be affected.
The various PRAESC missions have clearly identified five mined zones in which the accident risk
issignificant, although limited, owing to the low density o f the mines observed so far. Although mine
clearing i s needed inthese zones prior to any development activities, they are small relative to Casamance
as a whole (3.8 percent o f the total area). Moreover, the estimate o f the potentially mined area should
decrease significant1yl8once the quick light surveys have been carried out.

4.2    LESSONSLEARNEDFROMPASTEXPERIENCES

After the 1991 and 1993 peace accords, a program to demobilize young resistance fighters was carried out
beginning in 1992 with EUfinancing, and involved inparticular the MFDC's Northern Front, which was
at the time its largest contingent. The program, under the neutral and fairly modest label o f "micro-
projects", incorporated some innovative methodologies for the reinsertion o f ex-combatants (not
necessarily into their home villages but withintheir ethnic group.)
Lessons learnedfrom experiences inother regions are the following:

      place o fresidence.

 0    There is a need for rapid creation o f a database o f combatants to be demobilized, so that they can be
      monitored over the monthdyears following their reintegration. These people, who have lived with
      violence for prolonged periods, expect the reintegration programto help them handle their day-to-day
      problems. It i s important to teach them to live as civilians again. This re-learning process is
      impossible unless their identities and whereabouts are precisely known. The ideal i s to register them
      upon their first contact with the demobilization program, i.e., when they are disarmed.

0     It is important to limit as much as possible the duration o f the affected people's stay in temporary
      encampments. Apart from health and logistical issues, prolonged stays bring about behavioral
      changes in beneficiaries, including anger and passivity, making their economic and social
     reintegration and the relearning o f autonomy all the more difficult.

0     Support for ex-combatants must be geared to their specific needs, and must at the same time avoid
      generating a feeling o f unfairness on the part o f non-combatants. It i s important that the benefits of
     peace be perceived as being equitably bestowed upon all. Differential treatment must be limited and
     great efforts mustbe made to support the receiving communities, interms o f both local infrastructures
     and income-generating activities.

0    Quick restoration o f infrastructures is vital to the resumption o f economic activity and increased
     employment inthe region.
Since 1999, the OIM has, with World Bank financing, been operating a demobilization program in
Guinea-Bissau (including the Senegalesemilitary intervention dubbed "Operation Gabou") inthe wake o f
that country's civil war. The interconnections between events occurring in Guinea-Bissau and the
situation in Casamance will require close coordination o f post-conflict activities carried out on both sides
o f the border. For example, if the re-insertion and reintegration o f those demobilized i s done poorly,
demobilization in Casamance could spur a re-mobilization o f ex-combatants in the ranks o f resistance
fighters on the Guinea-Bissau side, assuming that the precarious political and military situation in the
border region persists.

5.1     PROJECTOBJECTIVES

The objective o f the PRAESC is the rapid reintegration of the entire population of Casamance into a
favorable economic and social environment and the establishment o f a foundation for long-term
sustainable development that takes the region's specificities into account.
The overall objectives o f the CERSP are to enable the PRAESC to be implemented through its
coordination and supervisory functions and to helpthe Government o f Senegal to:
1. demobilize and reinsert 2,300 combatants and other direct victims of the conflict as well as their
     families;
2. ensure the social and economic reintegration o f ex-combatants, their families and other persons
    directly affected by the conflict;
3.  rebuildor rehabilitate major social and economic public infrashuctures in Casamance inthree major
    sectors: transport, health and education;

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                      19


 4. prepare a long-term development program aimed at bringing the level o f development in Casamance
     up to the average level of other regions in Senegal, while addressing the original causes of the
      conflict.

 5.2     PROJECT SCOPE AND IMPLEMENTATIONPERIOD

 The CERSP will be the World Bank's primary vehicle in Casamance. This is an emergency project that
 will therefore follow the Bank's special procedures. By definition, it may contain only short-term
 activities. The project will be implemented over a periodo fthree (3) years.

 5.3     PROJECT COSTSAND FINANCING

 The total cost o f the CERSP shouldnot exceed US$20 million for the entire periodunder consideration.

5.4    RATIONALE FOR THE CERSP

An Emergency Recovery Credit under the Bank's OP/BP 8.50 guidelines is considered the most
appropriate instrument to support the critical transition process inCasamance because it enables the Bank
to quickly respond to the GoS request for support. The CERSP's objectives are to quickly restore
economic activities and social services in key sectors, with targeted spending priorities drawn up by
central andregional Senegaleseauthorities. The credit would total US$20 millionequivalent.

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergencyReconstruction SupportProject - MOP TechnicalAnnex                           20


 The proposed project will have a high economic and humanitarian impact since its objectives are to
 (i) restorenormalsocialandeconomicactivitiestoareasdevastatedbywar; and(ii)
    quickly                                                                                       prepare for
 future regular development activities in Casamance. Indeed, the project will support the demobilization
 and reintegration o f a few thousand ex-combatants and direct victims o f the conflict and their families,
 and restoration o f important local social and economic infrastructures. These emergency actions should
 therefore contribute to a more sustainable environment in the region by reducing the scope for conflict
 generated by economic and social disparities.

 5.5   OVERALL INSTITUTIONAL AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
       ARRANGEMENTS

 Structureofthe CERSP
 The CERSP will be implemented by ANRAC, a Senegalese administrative structure created by the
 Government to ensure smooth execution o f the PRAESC.
 Inorder to satisfy the World Bank's fiduciary requirements for implementation, however, the following
 changes will need to be made to the structure o f ANRAC.
 Organizationalset-up ofANRAC

 ANRAC will have a Program Coordinator who will be based in Ziguinchor and will be responsible for
 implementing operational activities at the field level. Inaccordance with the decree creating ANRAC, the
 Directeur Gdndral o f ANRAC will delegate the necessary powers to the Program Coordinator. Like all
 ANRAC personnel, the Program Coordinator is under the direct authority o f the DG-ANRAC and is
 boundby the terms o f a contract signed with the DG-ANRACacting on behalfo f the Government.
 Oversight Council
An Oversight Council will handle strategic coordination at the national level o f all interventions
 associated with the economic and social recovery o f Casamance.
 SteeringCommittee
A PRAESC Steering Committee will be established by decree o f the Prime Minister to translate themes
defined by the Oversight Council into programs, and particularly to supervise the implementation of the
PRAESC. This committee, which will be headed by a representative o f the Prime Minister, will be
composed o f representatives o f the relevant administrations, parties to the reconciliation process, civil
society, the private sector and local elected officials. The DG-ANRAC, or his representative, will serve as
the Secretary o fthis Committee.
The Steering Committee will examine and approve annual work programs and budgets as well as the
activity and financial reports o f the PRAESC. It will convene meetings at least twice yearly, alternating
betweenZiguinchor and Kolda. The secretariat o f the PRAESC Steering Committee will be carried out by
the DG-ANRAC or hisrepresentative.
The World Bank will help finance the revised structure so that it can carry out the CERSP. In addition,
the CERSP will finance:
     0   most o f the activities included under the Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (DRR)
         Component;
     0   a large portion o f the Infrastructure ReconstructiodRehabilitation (IRR) Component;
     0   preparation o f a long-term development program for Casamance ;
     0   activities associated with conflict early warning, conflict prevention, and social mobilization.
Finally, a budget line will be earmarked under the CERSP to finance certain activities resulting from the
implementation o f environmental protection and social policies.

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                             21


 5.5.1 Operationalactivitiesfor the implementationof the PRAESC
 The primary role o f the ANRAC i s to harmonize all reconstruction and development activities initiated by
 all partners in Casamance. This function will be supported by cross-sectoral activities implemented by
 specialized staff.
 5.5.1.1    Monitoring and Evaluation
 Monitoring o f field activities (CERSP's as well as others') will be the responsibility o f the Cellule
Information, Suivi et Evaluation (CISE).
 Standard monitoring modalities will be integrated into the CERSP's Procedures Manual in order to
 facilitate the monitoring and analysis o f the situation. These modalities will also incorporate objectively
verifiable indicators on the CERSP's performance so as to facilitate comparison. The CISE Officer will
prepare a monthly implementation monitoring report. This report will be incorporated by the Program
 Coordinator (PC) into the monthly Implementation Technical Monitoring and Financial report which i s
 also transmitted to the Director General (DG) on a monthly basis. Each quarter, the DG will prepare an
 in-depth analysis o f the situation, which will be submitted to the ANRAC Oversight Committee
 (ANRAC-OC), to the PRAESC Steering Committee and to the relevant donors.
These M&E activities will be based on a comprehensive and nimble IT system o f field data collection,
local inputtingand centralization at the ANRAC level, allowing nearly real-time analysis o f activities and
identification o f needs and o f beneficiaries (especially those fiom the DRR component who will receive
IDcards inthe interest ofpreventing gaps incoverage ofthe DRRprocess.) ThisIT systemwill include a
Geographic Information System (GIS) that will, for example, quickly identify gaps in PRAESC
implementation
An evaluation o fprogram implementation will be undertaken one to three months after completion of each
phase o f each component. Each evaluation, conducted by an independent consultant or NGO, will address:
(i) resultsofprogramimplementation;(ii) impactonthose demobilized, theirfamilies, displaced
    the                                          the
persons, refugees and their receiving communities; and (iii)   the adequacy o f institutional and administrative
mechanisms.
All the evaluations shallbebasedon: (i) ITsystem andthe financial monitoringreports; and(ii)survey
                                          the                                                         a
o f beneficiaries' and communities' reactions in order to gauge the impact in the field by means o f direct
observation and interviews (e.g., with key informants, ex-combatants, community leaders and members o f
the community).
5.5.1.2    Conflict early warning and prevention and activities
Activities implemented by the Cellule d'Alerte et de Pre`vention des Conflits(CAPC) will aim to mitigate
and prevent the triggering o f social conflicts in Casamance, and to lay the groundwork for sustainable
regional development at the community andregional levels.
The more specific objectives are: (i)    to make the population aware o f PRAESC activities in order to
create a consensus around its objectives and approaches; (ii)        to monitor current or potential conflict
triggers and mobilize the population and stakeholders around conflict early waming, mitigation, and
resolution instruments; (iii)to support advocacy on the part o f local actors (e.g., civil society, community
radio stations, etc.) for peace and reconstruction initiatives; (iv) to promote participatory formulation o f a
sustainable development program that will take into account potential conflict triggers and related
mitigationactivities.
The CAPC will implement a conflict early warning and mitigation system based on prior analysis, with
the relevant actors, of current and potential conflict triggers, as well as informationgathering and periodic
updating o f this analysis. Data will be collected by stakeholders belonging to the support network as well
as by AD representatives.

Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                         22


When (current or potential) conflicts are identified at or above the community level, stakeholders will be
assigned to find appropriate solutions or to dispatch representatives o f the parties involved to the
appropriate institutions. Mobilization campaigns will be launched, in a preventive as well as reactive
manner, on sensitive issues (conflict triggers) or activities proposed under the PR4ESC. An action plan
for social mobilization activities will be updated on a regular basis.
Studies and other analytical activities aimed at formulating a long term sustainable development plan for
Casamance will be documented on the basis o f the conflict early warning and prevention system and
social mobilizationactivities.
5.5.1.3    Environmental and Socialactivities


5.5.1.3.1    Social and Environmental Impact
By restoring a stable and productive economic and social life, for a direct impact on 30,000-to 40,000
people and an indirect impact on all 1.2 million inhabitants o f Casamance, the PRAESC will have a social
impact at the regional, national, and international levels. Restoration o f Casamance's optimal economic
growth potential will have very strong social repercussions on the immediate environment, including all
o f The Gambia and the northernpart o f Guinea-Bissau.
The component involving Reconstruction and Rehabilitation o f Non-Community Infrastructures should
also have minimal negative impacts since it will confine itselfto the restorationo f existing infrastructures.
On the contrary: if this work is done properly, it will correct previously existing defects in those
infrastructures. For each o f these major infrastructures, the Procedures Manual will determine the
environmental studies to be carried out prior to any intervention.
A Regional Environmental Assessment (REA) covering all o f Casamance was carried out before the start
o f the program inorder to point up potential problems. The topics covered are the following:
         0    Management o fnatural resources, and particularly ground and surface water resources;
         0    The problem o f inland infiltration o f salt water;
         0    Protection o f mangroves;
         0   Exploitation and conservation o f fisheries resources;
         0   Exploitation and conservation o f forests (whether classified or not) and o f other protected
             areas.
The main conclusions o fthe REA are the following:
     (i>Both     environmentally and socially, the Mine Clearance component will have a major positive
           impact as it will allow for better management o f natural resources and prevent further
           accidents.
     (ii)The socialimpact oftheDemobilization, ReinsertionandReintegrationcomponent, ifwell
           managed, is self-evident and may well transcend the regional context. The Community
           Development component i s expected to have limitednegative impacts because o f the small size
           o f the infrastructures involved. The component will have a definite positive impact in cases
           where the interventions have a clear environmental protection objective, such as anti-
           salinization dams and measures against soil degradation. The component dealing with the
           Reconstruction and Rehabilitation o f Non-Community Infrastructures may have major negative
           impacts, even if these are limited to existing structures. On the other hand, this component
           couldhave a distinct positive impact incases where it corrects existing infrastructure problems.
     (iii)TheREAincludesaEnvironmentalandSocialManagementFrameworkofPRAESC.This
          plan (PCGES) identifies the Casamance context in terms o f regional priorities for
          environmental and social management, specifically for the two regions o f Ziguinchor and
          Kolda, and in terms o f the options allowed under the SafeguardPolicies. The PRAESC triggers

          five safeguard policies, as indicated in the table below. In response to the requirements o f
          Safeguard Policy OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement, a special Resettlement Policy
         Framework was prepared for PRAESC and issued as a separate document. In view o f the
          several international waterways in the Casamance region, and the possible use o f these waters
         under the PRAESC program, Safeguard policy OP 7.50 requires that neighboring states and/or
         OMVGbe informed.

5.6     COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

5.6.1 Program of Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (PDRR)
5.6.1.1   Objectives
The objective o f the PDRR i s to meet the most acute needs o f groups directly affected by the conflict in
Casamance and to help them resume a stable and sustainable economic and social life. The DRR
component will be divided into two sub-components, each having specific objectives.

0 Sub-component1:Demobilization, Reinsertion andReintegration (DRR) of Ex-Combatants
The objective o f this sub-component is to support the demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration o f ex-
combatants o f various groups (i.e., irregular forces) involved inthe Casamance conflict in order to allow
them to attain a socio-economic level comparable to that o f the majority o f the rural population o f the
region. This will consolidate the end o f the Casamance conflict, thus reducing insecurity inthe region and
allowing economic and social development to resume.

0 Sub-Component 2:Supportfor Reintegration of Groupsdirectlyaffected by theConflict (Appui ii
     la Rbintkgration des GroupesdirectementAffect& par le Conflit -ARGA)
The main objective o f this sub-component is to provide ad hoc support for the reintegration of groups
directly affected by the conflict (e.g., widows o f combatants, orphans, disabled ex-combatants, women
recruited forcibly) into a stable economic and social life, as an accompaniment to initiatives already
proposedby other parties active inthe field.

 +    Sub-component 1:Demobilization,ReinsertionandReintegration(DRR)of Ex-Combatants
   + Demobi!i?ed.~erS~Qns
 The target groups must include all active combatants irrespective o f their affiliation with the various
 military fronts or factions. Every demobilized person must be defined as a "vulnerable ex-combatant".
 The beneficiary i s to choose the assistance he/she needs. In order to bring this about, the Program o f
 Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (PDRR) must offer a wide range o fbenefits. The details o f
 these benefits remainto be specified.
 Regarding combatants to be demobilized, the PDRR o f the PRAESC concerns active military forces
 consisting o f some 2,000 combatants. To the extent that each family includes about 8 individuals, this
 sub-component, the PDRR, would directly affect nearly 16,000 people.
 The criteria for selecting persons eligible to benefit from the demobilization and reinsertion program must
 be transparent, so as to prevent any discrimination on the basis o f ethnicity, region or gender. However,
 the identification o f combatants to be demobilized may pose problems. Inthe likely event that the MFDC
 does not have any troop rosters, the receipts issued to ex-combatants at the time they tum in their
 weapons will serve as a baseline reference. Finally, the ex-combatants may be grouped into billets for
 purposes o f determiningtheir numbers and characteristics.
 The characteristics o f every ex-combatant must be recorded with precision. Combatants will receive
 assurances that, in allowing themselves to be counted, they will not be risking any reprisals or legal
proceedings.
The liberation o f ex-combatants has important consequences for their families and communities. If the
 spouses and children are to enjoy beneficiary status, ex-combatants must declare them prior to their
liberation, at the time when data needed for monitoring i s being collected. They must also declare the
 specific location o fre-settlement, so that collectivities that mightneed specific support under the program
can be identified. Thus, complementarity between Community Development activities and activities
associated with the Reintegration o f Ex-Combatants is a fundamental aspect o f the CERSP.
 +   Sub-component 2: Support for the Reintegrationof GroupsDirectlyAffectedby the Conflict
     (ARGA)
  +   .Gr!?K?s.direCtlY.affected.by.the.c.Qni!ict
This sub-component will benefit groups directly affected by the conflict, i.e., the widows o f ex-
combatants, women who were forcibly pressed into service, handicapped ex-combatants and orphans.
Estimated numbers o f people to benefit from the activities proposed under this component are roughly
300 persons.
Ifthe ex-combatants include childsoldiers (irregular forces) andifthere arenospecializedagenciesinthe
fieldto handle their reinsertion, they will be coveredbythis sub-component.




l9All figures provided inthis paragraph are preliminary and are to be refmed at a later date byMFDCauthorities.

 (ii) Id.ent~ficatio.n.._slf.need~..and.o~~_sl~~t~es
 Ifthe PDRRis to be adaptedto needs, those needsmustbe identified. Informationto be gatheredwill be
 o f three types:
     0   Beneficiaries' characteristics, needs and aspirations;
     0   Opportunities and constraints that will emerge when beneficiaries enter the labor market as salaried
         workers or self-employed persons; and
     0  The civilian context inwhich the beneficiaries will be living.

 Itis therefore crucial to carry out preliminarystudies. These mustcover the beneficiaries' socio-economic
 profile, opportunity structure, the social patrimony o f the community and the institutional and
 organizational structures neededto implement the PDRRprogram.
 Essential data includes demographic and health data, level o f education, access to resources (e.g., land,
 capital and other means o f production), work experience, place o f origin, desired resettlement locale and
 type o f work envisaged after the demobilization. On the basis o f the data gathered, a socio-economic
 profile o f the beneficiaries will be drawn up.
 The profile obtained will be usedto classify ex-combatants into the following categories: rural and urban
 mode o f subsistence, female ex-combatants, child soldiers, disabled ex-combatants, ex-combatants with
 many years o f service, retirees and particularly vulnerable ex-combatants (e.g., those belonging to ethnic
minorities). Those who joined up or who served only for short periods may not require any particular
 assistanceto re-integrate themselves, butwill still need some help with the transition.
Large-scale studies will take time. It will therefore be useful: (i)  to establish a preliminary profile based
 on informationobtained inthe context o f a billeting operation, through interviews with discussiongroups,
cross-referenced with general informationon the economic development o f the region; and (ii)      to perform
a summary qualitative evaluation o f collectivities and organizational structures. The latter i s best done
with the collaboration o fprojects and organizations that have been inCasamance for a long time and that
possess a large amount o f valuable baseline data.

(iii) Deve~o~-mento.f.an..effective..~.arge~ln~-me.~han~Sm
Once identified, ex-combatants will need valid, non-transferable and un-falsifiable identity documents. A
certzjicate of liberation providing personal information (including a photo and signature or fingerprint)
and a section detailing the benefits entitlement may be the best way for ex-combatants to exercise their
rights. If the benefits are transferable, e.g., in the event o f the bearer's death, the document must also
include a section pertaining to reversion, including the entitlements o f close relatives. This certificate
shall be designed to be durable and portable. Documents concerningparticular target sub-groups may also
be issued: e.g., identity cards for disabled ex-combatants (cartes d'invaliditk) and (for family members)
certificates o f community residence (attestations de la collectivitk).
These identity documents fulfill two functions: (i) enable every qualified ex-combatant to exercise
                                                      they
his rights; and (ii) exclude those who are not ex-combatants (except spouses and children), i.e., they
                    they
prevent fraud. For this purpose, a clear procedure must also be established for the re-issuance o f
documents in the event of loss or theft. The issuance o f these documents will be computerized and each
individual affected will thus be entered into the SGI's database.
It will be crucial that such a system be developed inharmony with the systems and techniques used in
Guinea-Bissau for counting demobilized persons under its demobilization program.

(iv) Re~nt.egra~l-on-.needs
Casamance i s still a rural society, with over 75 percent o f its population in rural areas. Most ex-
combatants are from agricultural milieus and will need access to land to undertake agricultural activity in

 Seneaal- CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                                 27


 the event o f their demobilization. Overall, however, the main requirement o f combatants' families during
 the critical transition period will probably be money, since basic needs (ie., food, housing, clothing) are
 not beingmet. Poor households are also characterized by the absence o f basic social services. Finally, the
 beneficiaries, and particularly former combatants, will need help finding employment.
 Economic and social reintegration may pose a great challenge for ex-combatants. The PDRR can hope
 that many ex-combatants will be perceived by the receiving communities as community members. This
 will be reinforced if socio-cultural reinsertion measures (especially including traditional rituals often
 performed by female shamans) are well organized."

 0 Phases of thePDRR
 The PDRR o f the PRAESC will be drawn up on the basis o f the results of the socio-economic profile of
 MFDC combatants and other beneficiaries, other preparatory work done duringthe demobilization, and
 the prior analysis o f opportunities for economic reinsertion. It i s also critical to address the need for a
 reliable mechanism for identifyingbeneficiaries inorder to ensure the program's efficacy.
 The PDRRtherefore includes four phasesneeded for a global and complete approach, namely:
 (i)headcount (military identity); (ii)  demobilization (civilian identity); (iii)reinsertion (safety net); and
 (iv) reintegration (sustainable livelihood) as shown inthe table below.

The CERSP will only finance reintegration activities and those selected by the individual from
among those indicated with an asterisk (*). Other actors are expected to participate inthe program in
the form o f logistical support (e.g., transportation supplied by the Senegalese Armed Forces), assistance
in kind (e.g., food aid for ex-combatants) and complementary activities essential to the smooth
implementation o f the program(e.g., support for housing construction for ex-combatants).




20 In the context of projects aimed at education for peace and peace promotion, some intemational projects (e.g.,
GTZ-PAARZ, CRS, WFD), with their local partners (e.g., NGOs) have already developed such strategies and
approaches. A program involving a group o ftraditional female shamans seems particularly noteworthy.

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                             28

 +   Phase 1: Headcountand disarmament
 An adequate system o f identification i s necessary to avoid delays in implementation o f the PDRR. The
 Direction de la Ddmobilisation, la Rdinsertion et la Re`inte`gration (DDRR). will begin a process o f
 identification and counting o f all MFDC combatants in order to computerize them. Demobilization
 criteria must be defined clearly and precisely by the MFDC. Vulnerability criteria must also be defined
 without ambiguity by civil authorities after consultation with civil society. An exhaustive headcount o f
 the target group will allow the PDRRto direct resources to persons who were actually combatants.
 All combatants will be identified, registered and issued secure identity papers prior to the first phase of
 demobilization. Data will be processed and entered into a database that will be the basis for the
 organization o f the demobilizationprocess.
 This headcount phase is expected to occur during the disarmament process. Combatants will appear
 before a Disarmament Committee composed o f high-ranking representatives o f the MFDC and
 Senegalese Army, and by a neutral (non-Senegalese) third party. The combatant will be identified as
 subject to demobilization and entered into the database. The individual will then trade his weapon for an
 identity document. Arms will be collected by the weapons-disposal team," which will tally the weapons
 in the database before destroying them on a daily basis.       22 It has been decided that the disarmament
team(s) will be mobile so as to limit the need for groups o f armed men to move about.
The DDRR will be charged with the operational implementation o f this phase, with support and advice
from the Office o f Demobilization.
 +   Phase2: Demobilization
The DDRR will participate in the organization o f start-up procedures and will coordinate them with the
Office o f Demobilization. These procedures will integrate planning (including schedules, locations,
number o f persons involved, etc.),          administration (e.g.,    validation o f combatants'      identities,
documentation, departure certificates and databases) and transportation logistics (including security
measures). The first o f three disbursements from the amount provisionally earmarked for safety net
allowances will also occur duringthis period and will be organized and managedby the DDRR.

From a practical standpoint, a database on individual combatants to be demobilized will need to be
developedby the DDRR, with the help o f the CGI, on the basis o f lists suppliedby the MFDC and survey
forms. An identification (ID) system with a code to be used for the database will also need to be
developed and implemented, along with accompanying files containing basic information about the
demobilized individual and the composition o f his family, hisprofession and/or training, final destination,
and demobilization benefits to which he i s entitled. This general data file o f the PDRR will be used for the
subsequent stages (i.e., reinsertion and reintegration) and updated on an ongoing basis with the needed
information.
The DDDR, on the basis o f information from the MFDC, will need to develop the demobilization plan
and calendar. In theory, several options may be examined.
The assumption used in the present document is, a priori, that demobilization will occur in "wave~",2~
with the most vulnerable groups having priority. This option would allow for demobilization by locality
and by group. It i s theoretically recommended, once the combatants to be demobilized have been


21Made up o fANS personnel.
22The method of weapons disposal (via explosives or other means) needs to be chosen so as to ensure daily
destruction without any stockpiling. Senegalese laws pertaining to the transportation of explosives and weapons
must also be respected.
23To the extent that events permit this.

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                        29


 identified, that the receiving zones (i.e., the camps) be emptied as quickly as possible so as to avoid the
 burdeno f managingthese groups (housing, food, medical assistance, etc.) and possible trouble that could
 emerge over time due to uncertaintiesabout their future.
 The demobilization plan and calendar must also be analyzed in relation to the subsequent stages and
 especially inrelationto the schedule for preparation o f the PRAESC structures.
 During the period in which candidates for demobilization are being assembled, specific food aid
 programs, as well as medical assistance and prescreening, will need to be provided. A campaign o f civic
 education and introduction to the PDRR and to the sequential steps inthe process o f reinsertion (benefits
 and safety net services; eligibility criteria) and reintegration (economic reintegration services and
 opportunities; eligibility criteria by category) will need to be implemented. The DDRR will be
 responsible for developing all the documents and procedures manuals relative to the above-mentioned
points and for training the staffo f the implementing agencies responsible for the activities.
  + Medica!.examination
 Medical exams will be an important part o f the departure process. Their objective will be to identify
 serious ailments or disabilities that could affect ex-combatants' future ability to achieve economic and
 social reinsertion. They will also make it possible to identify specific needs in terms o f various lunds o f
rehabilitation. Medical examinations will be conducted using the technical resources available on-site.
Financial concerns preclude more sophisticated procedures such as blood tests or x-rays.
The questionnaire will include questions on the patient's socio-economic characteristics, general health,
injuries and main traumatic experiences, previous operations and hospitalizations, as well as known
ailments. The list o f symptoms will include, among others: cough, chronic diarrhea, fever, symptoms o f
venereal disease, alcohol consumption, psychiatric symptoms associated with previous traumas, and
symptoms o f epilepsy. The examination will also include visible injuries, missing limbs, seriously
diminished sight or hearing, paralysis and signs indicative o f substance abuse.
The local team in charge o f medical examinations will receive a brief preparatory training. The data
obtained will be processed and computerized in the context o f the PRAESC's monitoring system.
Relevant results o f these examinations will be noted on the departure certificates in order to entitle the
bearer to specific services. These results will be conveyed quickly to the medical authorities and NGOs
active inthis area.
  + Pre&?a!?!-K!?. c!i!?ntation
The responsibility o f the DDRR, supported by the Conflict Early Warning (CAPC) Unit, in terms o f
advising combatants, takes effect from the time the combatants are at the Demobilization Center.
Informationwill be supplied on the PRAESC's PDRR, indemnities, rights and obligations o f combatants
as well as on the role and functions o f the Decentralized Branches o f the PRAESC and the authorities.
Advice concerning the proper utilization o f the help provided and codes o f civilian conduct will be an
integral part o fthe pre-departure orientation.
The orientation program will be implemented in modules, each dealing with one o f the aforementioned
themes. Methods will be developed to encourage demobilized persons (as well as their spouses, if they
were present at the demobilization center) to participate actively in the PDRR program, and joint
participation o f men and women wiI1be encouraged wherever possible. A consultant and an NGO will be
recruited to develop and implement the pre-departure orientation program. Total cost o f the pre-departure
orientationprogram is estimated at CFAF 16.8million, or CFAF 5,600 per demobilized individual.

 Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                            30


     + .TranX?ortation
 Physical settlement will be handled by the centralized organization responsible for transporting
 demobilized combatants and their familiesz4fiom the Demobilization Center to the chosen destination.
 Two guidingprinciples underlie the centralization o f the provision o f means o f transportation. One i s the
 large number and concentration of persons needing transportation as well as security considerations. The
 other i s that, if transport i s facilitated, people are more likely to actually arrive where they say they want
 to go, instead o f remaining in the vicinity o f the departure centers. Transport will not be funded by the
 CERSP. It i s expected that the Senegalesearmy will provide the required means o f transport.
    + Counselingx???l        KriYa!
 Local authorities and communities will be made aware o f the needs of combatants' families prior to the
 implementation o f the PDRR o f the PRAESC. Inaddition, local administrative structures will be charged
 with receivingand counseling demobilized combatants and their families ifnecessary. Counseling will be
 organized shortly after the ex-combatants have arrived intheir respective communes or villages, and will
 deal with most o f the issues already touched upon in the pre-departure orientation program. This work
 will beperformedbythe ReintegrationCounselors o fthe AD.
 +     Phase3: Reinsertion
Any delay inthe demobilization process makes the reinsertion assistance to demobilized persons all the
more crucial.
The period between the demobilization and the start o f the economic reintegration process must be the
focus o f particular attention on the part o f the DG-ANRAC. In planning its programs, it will aim to
develop an approach adapted to the social, economic and cultural context. The duration o f this stage, as
well as the benefits (which may be differentiated by category of demobilized person), the modalities and
schedule o f their distribution must also be the subject o f an in-depthanalysis.
The primary target o f the reintegration assistance i s not only the ex-combatant himself, but his household
as well. Duringthe first few months, the household o f the ex-combatant is very vulnerable: basic needs
such as shelter and a minimumof food security must be met immediately upon arrival inthe receiving
community. Shelter and food are not enough, however, to allow the demobilized combatant and his
family to establish themselves as a viable economic and social unit. Additional support is needed to
ensure that the family's health expenditures for non-chronic illnesses are covered at a level similar to that
o f the neighbors. In addition, support i s needed to pay the urgent costs o f resettlement until the ex-
combatant's household begins to produce its ownrevenues.
   + Calculatlon.ofbaslc-needs
The regions of Casamance (i.e., Kolda and Ziguinchor), which are among the most disadvantaged, have
the largest number o f households living below the poverty level: 69 and 51 percent, respectively,
according to poverty indicators (UNDP Human Development Report, 1998) calculated on the basis o f
health, education and access to basic services.
The PDRR o f the PRAESC will provide families o f ex-combatants with temporary relocation funds
intendedto facilitate the most difficult phase o freintegration into civilian life. This fundallocation willbe
divided into two parts intendedto : (i)       cover the food needs o f an entire family for one yea?5; and (ii)a
direct financial allowance for investment in housing (lodging and furnishings) and the non-food




24 If they are living with the combatants.
25 i.e., one metric ton for an %personhousehold.

 consumption (e.g., clothing, health care, education and local transportation). The CERSP will only
 finance the second part o fthe resettlement allowance, for a total o f CFAF 192,500 per household.
 Since the safety nets are calculated on the basis o f the needs o f ex-combatants' households, their rationale
 and utilization should be explained during the pre-departure orientation. Ongoing counseling in the
 receiving communities should help ensure proper use o f these funds.
   + Mo&!ities .OfJ?w?"
 The relocation expenses will be paid in cash in order to allow ex-combatants to exercise some options.
 This mechanismalso responds to the need, generally expressed by ex-combatants, for cash at the time of
 their departure. Payinga monetary equivalent of essential goods also reduces transaction costs that could
 be generated by the provision, transportation, storage and preservation o f goods. This also has the
 advantage o f introducing purchasing power into the bottom o f the system, i.e., the village, thereby
 stimulating the production o f localproviders o f goods and services, and energizing the local economy.
 The temporary relocation allowance will be paid inthree equal installments: the first upon departure, the
 second about 3 or 4 months later and the third about 6 to 8 months after departure.
 The first payment will be administered by the DDRR upon the combatants' departure from the
 Demobilization Center, as will the second and thirdpayments.
 +   Phase4: Reintegration
 Inorder to respondto needs expressed by the target groups (i.e., ex-combatants, their dependants as well
 as other beneficiaries), the PDRR o f the PRAESC includes support to allow the most rapid possible
 resumption o f stable and sustainable economic activity.
 Inthe interestofbothefficiency andsocialjustice, there willbenofunds, apart fromthe safetynetfunds,
 specifically provided for the financing o f economic or social activities undertaken by the beneficiaries.
 Beneficiaries will therefore be encouraged to avail themselves o f opportunities offered under the other
 PRAESC components, and particularly the Local Development (LD) component, the purpose o f which i s
 to support all communities and individuals inCasamance wishingto invest intheir own initiatives.
 However, since vulnerability i s the main characteristic o f the target groups, certain specific support
 activities will be undertaken.
   +   hdividua!ized.monitolingofeachbeneficiKYby.Re.ktegG!tior?. GO-WSE1-0IS
 The programprovides for enough reintegration counselors so that each beneficiary can meet with one on
 a regular basis (e.g., monthly), at home if possible. The counselors will inform beneficiaries o f their
rights, point out local activities likely to be o f interest to them and relevant to their personal aspirations,
and direct them to locally availablejobs26and training that mightprepare them for a stable and adequately
remuneratedjob. They will also listen to their grievances and, if necessary, serve as mediators vis-a-vis
groups or agencies that pose problems. Finally, they will help beneficiaries to assemble the dossiers
requiredby the development and financing agencies to which they may wishto submit applications.
This latter work is identical to that which is to be done by the economic promotion agents (Agents de
Coordination pour la Promotion des Activitis Economiques, AC-PAE). Inthe interest o f coherence and
continuity, it i s thus proposed that these two positions be merged. The function o f supporting retumees'
reintegration i s impermanent by nature and PAE activities should move to the forefront within a few
months.




26 Itshould be noted that the Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction component will encourage labor-
intensive construction methods, thereby fostering localjob creation.

This work of informing, counseling and orientation will be supportedby communication and information
plans established by the CAF'C (CelluleAlerte et PrPvention des Confits) at the central level. The CAPC
will develop communication and informationtools inits work with beneficiaries.
   + specific.traininggearedloIes~ml?tiQn!?f.M?rk
Following the preliminary study on the opportunity structure, a number o f economic opportunities that
may lead to beneficiary employment will be identified.
The DDRR will facilitate training adapted both to beneficiaries' current capacities and to the economic
opportunities that may be open to them. This training will, to the extent possible, be dispensed by
agencies already present in Casamance (e.g., projects, NGOs or others). The goal is still the same: i.e.,
avoiding redundancy andmaximizingthe use o f locally available expertise.
The CERSP will finance such activities to an amount o f CFAF 137,500 perbeneficiary.
  + specific.targetgo.up3
Apart from the support detailed above, specific target groups will benefit from targeted support measures.
Disabled ex-combatants, victims o f combat and land mines, female soldiers and child soldiers will be
offered appropriate counseling, medical rehabilitation and support for reintegration through specialized
NGOs.
Those medical costs will not be financed by the CERSP.
Widows o f ex-combatants, orphans, and forcibly recruited women will also receive appropriate
counseling. The CESRP will finance job training similar to those given to ex-combatants at
CFAF 137,500 par beneficiary. These groups will also have privileged access to community reinsertion
funds.
The ANRAC will collaborate closely with the ministries relevant to disabled ex-combatants, widows, the
chronically illand victims o f war.
5.6.1.3   InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements
A Joint Commission for the Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration o f Ex-Combatants, made up
of parties to the conflict (i.e., the GoS and the various factions o f the MFDC), will be formed for purposes
o f discussing the content o f the DDR program, the criteria for beneficiary identification and all
preparatory action needed to establishthe program.
The Direction de la Dkmobilisation, Rkinsertion et Rkintkgration (DDRR)is the technical agency o f the
ANRAC chargedwith setting upthe PDRR.The DDRRhas the following responsibilities:
    0   Demobilize andreinsert all persons eligible for this program;
    0   Ensure the return o f demobilized combatants, displacedpersons and refugees to their homes;
    0   Facilitate the reinsertion o f vulnerable groups through personalized monitoring o f eligible
        individuals and families.
Within each Local Branch, the DDRR will be represented by Reintegration Counselors in direct contact
with beneficiaries.
A Demobilization Bureau will be established to manage the military aspects o f the PDRR o f the
PRAESC.
An implementation manualwill beprepared for the PDRRprior its execution.
5.6.1.4  ImplementationRisks

5.6.2    Infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction
5.6.2.1    Objectives
0 Transportationsector
Regardingroads, the PRAESC aims to address the specific accessibility issues o f Casamance vis-a-vis the
rest o f Senegal. Casamance's longer rainy season, the greater degree o f danger for the populace, its
geographic location on a national border and the imperatives o f re-starting economic and social activity
couldnot be addressedunder the PAST or the PST2.

 Interms of internal andborder access improvement, the programtherefore aims to enhance access for as
 many rural communities as possible. As for external access improvement, including the option o f going
 eastward around The Gambia, the program i s engaged in rehabilitating all national and regional roads
 serving the main towns o f departments, and is therefore inharmony with the objectives o f the PST2.
 0 Educationandhealthsectors
 Inorder to encourage the return ofdisplaced populations andretain those that haveremained, the PRRI
 will aim, in the sectors o f education and health, to rehabilitate staff to existing school and healthcare
 infrastructuresrehabilitated by local communities, thereby puttingthem back into operation.
 5.6.2.2    Description
 The program concerns the rehabilitation or reconstruction o f infrastructures damaged in the conflict. It
 covers healthcare, educational and transport infrastructures.The electricity sector i s addressedby the rural
 electrification component o f the ASER, particularly inthe departments o f Kolda and VClingara.
 5.6.2.2.1     Needs identified by the PRAESC
 The PRAESC document lists a set o f infrastructures in the areas o f transportation, health and education
 that require refurbishment so that economic and social activity can resume. These infrastructures have
beenranked, according to a methodology specific to each sector, inorder o f the urgency o f their repair.

 0 Transportationsector
Inthe areaoftransportation, the PRAESChasidentified works valued at CFAF 11,063 million, directly
relating to periodic maintenance, rehabilitation or reconstruction o f roads inCasamance and some bridges
and works, includingtwo access bridges inthe town o f Kolda.

(0E.~te-~al.access..~rz~~.~ement
Regarding external access, i.e., the linkage between Casamance and the rest o f Senegal, including the
option o f going eastward around The Gambia, the rehabilitation o f all national roads i s required, as i s that
o f the regional roads serving the main towns of departments.
Inthe area of maritime transport, the rehabilitation ofthe piers at the port of Ziguinchor may be deemed
sufficient for the short-term, pendingthe reconstruction o f the port with AFD financing, with the goal o f
attracting private investment for the acquisition o f additional vessels and the privatization o f the
management o f the vessel that i s to replace the capsized ferry the `Diola'. These investments are
essentially covered by ongoing national, bilateral or multilateral financing operations.

(ii) Inte-~.al.acces.s..!~o.~ement
Improved internal access is a matter o f connections between and within communities. Interms o f roads,
the main towns o f rural communities need to be made accessible; the program also involves the
rehabilitation o f feeder roads incertain pilot villages.

(iii).Enhanced..access.i~l~.O~.~s~~.ated.-~e.a~
Roads serving rural border areas are to be rehabilitated in order to prevent these areas from being
exclusively geared to the production and consumption o f goods and services from neighboring countries,
and also to promote community transportation services using traditional pirogues and to foster improved
organization and safety o f services providing accessto the islands o f Basse Casamance.
Inthis connection, 6 woodenpontoonbridges are tobebuiltin6 islandvillages ofBasse Casamance(4
inthe Carones islands and 2 inthe Bandial area). The construction costs ofthese basic infiastructures are

 covered under the PRAESC with a view to attracting private sector interest in the acquisition o f one or
 several river ferries.

 0 Educationsector
 Inthe education sector, 138 classrooms have beenidentifiedas needingreconstruction. These classrooms
 are to be rebuilt over a three-year period. A margin o f 12 classrooms to be built was added to
 accommodate eventual changes in population density resulting from migrations due to the conflict. The
 estimated total cost is CFAF 750 million for the entire PRAESC, or CFAF 250 million each year for years
 1through 3.

 0 Health sector
 Total investment under the PRAESC in the area o f health in Casamance totals CFAF 1,126 million,
 distributed equally over years 1through 3 of the PRAESC program. This sum corresponds to about 50
 healthposts, 3 matemity clinics and the rehabilitation o f the psychiatric center inKCnia.
 5.6.2.3   InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements
 5.6.2.3.1 Implementationstrategy of the InfrastructureReconstructionandRehabilitation
            Program(ProgrammedeReconstructionet deRihabilitation desInfrastructures, PRRI)
The PRAESC will not be directly involved in carrying out investment programs. On the contrary, it will
rely on the whole array o f programs supporting infrastructure investment that are already active in the
area, or even on delegated implementing agencies that are already operational.
 0 Transportsector
The program should be implemented within the framework o f convention between the Road Agency
(AATR) and the Ministries of Highways and Finance. For investment expenditures, includingthe CERSP
roads component, the agreement to be signed will either be for delegated works oversight or an
implementing agency contract, botho f which are provided for inthe future procedures manual.
0 Health andeducationsector
The CERSP will establish conventions or memoranda o f understanding with the Ministries o f Health and
Education, to which they will hand over the reconstructed or rehabilitated works. CERSP will delegate
works oversight to AGETIP which has an office inZiguinchor .
These reconstructions and rehabilitations will be contingent upon the actual availability o f teaching or
health staff for each o f them. The works will be requestedjointly by the health or education services and
beneficiary representatives. Contract management will then be contracted out to the regional office o f
AGETIF'.
Contracting for works oversight will be done locally. Labor-intensive techniques will be favored to
maximize positive impact on local populations.
5.6.2.3.2   Implementationstructure of the PRRI
The Direction de la Rkhabilitation des infrastructures (DRI)) will be responsible for developing
investment plans, establishing contracts for delegated implementing agencies and then for ensuring their
smooth implementation. In addition, the DRIwill rely on the joint services o f ANRAC, particularly for
procurement.
5.6.2.4   ImplementationRisks
Risksare of three types:
        Renewedinsecurity in the affected rural communities;

         landresources;
     0   Premature deterioration o f road infrastructures due to flooding, submersion or acidification o f
         landresulting from inadequate technical studies or improper construction;
 Measures to be envisaged:
     0   Prevention and early warning mechanism;
     0   Establishment o f resource planning and management tools and training o f the local population's
         representatives intheir use;
     0   Thorough technical studies and rigorous works oversight;
 5.6.3   Preparation of the Long-Term RegionalDevelopment Program
 5.6.3.1   Objectives
 The objectives o f these activities are to identify, and then to study in depth, the future sustainable
 development themes speciJic to Casamance. This work should result in concrete proposals for the
 government of Senegal and its development partnersregarding interventions to be carried out.
 5.6.3.2  Description
 The selected areas o f investigation meet two simple criteria:
     0   They are crucial to sustainable development inCasamance;
     0   They are not an outgrowth o fnational sectoral policies and can be resolved by interventions at the
         level o f the natural region.
This latter point is important since Casamance suffers fiom problems common to all of Senegal. These
must be resolved at the countrywide level. The function o f the PRAESC is not to address these national
problems, muchless to launch activities aimed at resolving them inCasamance.
The specific areas are the following:
     0  enhancing accessibility o f Casamance;
        tourism;
        private sector promotion;
     0  environment and naturalresource management;
     0  hydraulics;
     0  landtenure.
5.6.3.3   InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements
The start-up of studies and other analytical activities for the formulation o f a sustainable development
program in Casamance must be supported by useful information gathered in connection with the system
o f early waming, and conflict-prevention. Activities will be carried out by the CEDLT under the
supervision o f the ProgramCoordinator.
5.6.3.4   ProcurementArrangements andActionPlan
Procurement will be handled by the CPM o f the ANRAC according to the manual o f administrative
procedure. Studies will be launched during the first year o f the CERSP so that they can be presented by
the DG-ANRAC to Senegal's development partners, who may then put together the recommended
programs at the end o f the thirdyear o f the CERSP.

                  6.       SECTIONE: STUDIESAND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

  The structure of the ANRAC is predicated on a strong technical assistance base with the hiring o f
  international experts to implement post-conflict activities. Those experts will remain inpost for the entire
  duration o f the activities they supervise. The Terms o f Reference for each activity will be finalized by the
  ANRAC, once it is operational. Studies required to implement the activities are described under each
  component description. TORSfor these studies will be finalized by the managers o f the relevant
  components, once they are operational.

                     7.        SECTIONF:PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS


  7.1    GENERAL

  Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
  "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines for
  the Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the
  provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. A general description o f the various procurements i s
  provided below under their respective expenditure categories. For each contract to be financed by the
  Credit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification,
  estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time fkame are agreed between the Borrower and the
  Bank project team inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as
  required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.
  Procurement of Works:Works procured under this project would include: constructionhehabilitation o f
  roads and bridges, classrooms, health posts and matemity clinics, and a psychiatric center. The

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                         40


 procurement will be done using the Bank's Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB and National
 SBD agreedwith (or satisfactory to) theBank.
 Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include: Vehicles, motorcycles, office
 equipment, and computers. Procurement will be conducted using the Bank's SBD for all ICB and
National SBD as agreed with the Bank.
 Selectionof Consultants: Consultant services under the project would includepreparatory studies for the
 long-term development program for Casamance, DRR and conflict early waming, environmental
management, works preparatory studies and audits. Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost
less than US$lOO,OOO      equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in
 accordance with the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 o fthe Consultant Guidelines.
 OperationalCosts: operating costs covered under the Project would be financed inaccordance withthe
procedures o f ANRAC, which are satisfactory to the Bank.

7.2    ASSESSMENT OFTHE IMPLEMENTINGAGENCY'S CAPACITY TO
       CONDUCT PROCUREMENT

7.2.1 Procurement arrangements
Procurement activities would be handled by the Program Coordinator under the supervision o f a
Procurement specialist (SPM), including: (i)    preparation o f the General Procurement Notice and its
annual update; (ii) preparation o f the specific procurement notices; (iii)    preparation and update o f the
half-yearly procurement plans; (iv) drafting bidding documents and requests for proposals; (v) awarding
o f contracts and requests for IDA'Snon-objection when required; and (vi) drafting o f contracts and
ensuring that contracts are implemented properly.
Since ANRAC has no experience with World Bank procurement procedures, the project i s considered
highrisk.Consequently, agreement was reached on the following measures prior to Credit Effectiveness:
(i)recruitment o f a consultant to prepare the Project's administrative, accounting and financial
procedures; and (ii) recruitment o f the procurement specialist. These activities would be financed under
the Project PreparationFacility (PPF). The adoption o f a procedures manual satisfactory to IDA would be
a condition o f Credit effectiveness.
7.2.2   Assessment of the procurementunit
Because ANRAC staff has not yet beenrecruited, it was not possible to fully assesstheir capacities.
As soon as all the staff have been recruited, ANRAC will be evaluated to determine whether all
conditions are inplace to carry out procurement in accordance with World Bank procedures. The staff at
the ANRAC would include a Procurement Specialist familiar with World Bank procurement procedures
who would: (a) prepare and update the procurement plan for the project; (b) monitor the progress of
procurement; (c) assist the implementing agencies in the preparation o f bidding documents and bidding
announcements for goods and works contracts and requests for consultants' services; and (d) be
responsible for bid opening and evaluation. The Procurement Specialist will also advise the implementing
agencies on procedural matters. These conditions will be an important part o f the specialist's TOR and
contract, which i s to be drawn up with the assistance o f the World Bank's procurement team in
Washington and Dakar.
The overall project risk for procurement i s rated high until there i s sufficient evidence that procurement
has beenhandled satisfactorily.

 7.3    PROCUREMENTPLAN

 A Procurement Plan setting out the basics o f the procurement methods has been providedto IDA. It will
 be available inthe Project's database and on the Bank's external website. It will be updated in agreement
 with the World Bank annually or as required to reflect actual project implementation needs and
 improvements ininstitutional capacity.

 7.4    FREQUENCYOF PROCUREMENTSUPERVISION

 Inadditiontothepriorreviewsupervisiontobecarriedout fromBankoffices, the capacity assessmentof
 the Implementing Agency has recommended twice-yearly field supervision missions to carry out post-
 review o fprocurement actions.

            8.      SECTIONG: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS


 8.1    GENERALREMARKS

 The project's financial management arrangements are based on World Bank guidelines in this area, and
 particularly on "Guidelines: Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank"
 and "Guidelines for SimplifiedProcurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments". They
 also take into account the fiduciary arrangements o f World Bank projects inSenegal.
 Financial management o f the Project will be handled by the Director General o f ANRAC, who will
 delegate expenditure authorization functions to the Program Coordinator (Coordonnateur des
programmes, CP) based inZiguinchor. Accounting functions under the Project will be performed by the
Administration, Personnel and Finance Department (Service Administration, Personnel et Finances,
 SAPF) .
 Since this team i s not yet operational, the assessment o f financial management capacities consisted o f
defining the logistics o f implementing the financial management plan. This assessment therefore covered:
(i) resources; (ii)
    human                    accounting and financial procedures and periodic reporting; (iii)       audits;
(iv) disbursements; and (v) other specific arrangements giventhe nature ofthe project.

8.2    ARRANGEMENTS FORFINANCIALAND ACCOUNTS MANAGEMENT

8.2.1    Human resources
Interms of human resources, management of project accounts and finances will rely primarily on the
Administration, Personnel and Finance Department (SAPF). Terms o f reference for the head o f the SAPF
have been drawn up and recruitment o f this administrative and financial officer i s in progress. This
individualwill, like the team, be based inZiguinchor. He will be assisted by an accountant. One year after
project effectiveness, the work load will be evaluated in order to determine what reinforcement i s needed
at the central accounting and regional office levels.
Possible financing needs for activities in Dakar will be handled by the Directorate for Debt and
Investment (DDI) of the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF), which will be responsible for
managingthe Special Account (see paragraph 8.2.4.1 on disbursement arrangements).
8.2.2   Accounting and financial management procedures and computerized management
         information system
A procedures manual now being developed will provide all the required details on accounting and
financial procedures. It will set out inparticular the flow o f accounting and financial informationbetween

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergencyReconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                         42


 the General Directorate o f ANRAC and project beneficiaries, as well as the modalities and formats o f
 periodic reports. An overview o f funding flows and cash management mechanisms i s provided in the
 paragraphon disbursements.
 Interms ofbudgets, eachyear the CP will, after consultation withthe other operationaldirectors, draw up
 a detailed budget for activities to be carried out under the CERSP. This budget, after its validation by the
 DG-ANRAC in a meeting o f the management committee, will be submitted to the World Bank for
 analysis and then to the CP-PRAESC for approval. It will then be incorporated into the general State
 budget submitted to the National Assembly for approval.
 The budget will be executed by the CP under the supervision of the DG-ANRAC. Thus, with regard to
 activities under the CERSP, the DG-ANRAC will delegate the relevant powers to the CP for the
 execution o f all activities approvedbythe CP-ANRAC. A monthly activity report will be producedby the
 CP and conveyed to the DG-ANRAC. This report will inparticular summarize the status o f financial and
 technical execution and the volume o fprocurement for the monthended, and will also contain forecasts.
 Every quarter, a Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) will be produced by the CP, validated by the DG-
 ANRAC, and conveyedto the WorldBank.
 Inthe area ofreporting, the CP will also be required to produce, no later than March 31 of the following
 fiscal year, annual statements o f accounting and financial execution. These financial statements will be
 subject to periodic audits (see paragraph on audits). Formats for the FMRs and financial statements will
be defined inthe procedures manual.
 The computerized information systemwill be set up in such a way as to furnish all o f the above data, in
 addition to providing analytical accounting for purposes o f monitoring beneficiaries, and particularly ex-
 combatants and target groups.
8.2.3    Audits
An annual audit o f ANRAC, including activities under the CERSP, and particularly those carried out by
the CP, will be conducted.
This audit will, on the one hand, be ofnormal scope interms o fproviding an opinion on annual financial
statements, and its scope will also be broadenedto cover the specific risks enumeratedbelow:
     (i)theactivitydescribedunderPhase3 (i.e., reinsertion) concerningthepaymentofatemporary
         safety net allowance. The auditor will be required to ensure that the payment procedures
         described inthe procedures manual have been observed and that the duly identified beneficiaries
         have received the funds to which they are entitled. The auditor will express a special opinion on
         this point;
     (ii)theactivitydescribedunderPhase4(i.e., reintegration)concerningspecifictrainingforre-entry
         into the workforce. The auditor will be required to express a special opinion on the training
         dispensed by the selected entities (NGOs or others), so that its effectiveness may be assessed.
Finally, it should be noted that the auditor will furnish, as an annex to ANRAC's financial statements, a
report on the implementation status o f activities under the CERSP that will in particular detail, by
category, funds receivedas well as executed and verified expenditures.
The audit report for the fiscal year ended must be submitted no later than June 30 following the end o f
that fiscal year.

8.2.4    Proposeddisbursement arrangements
8.2.4.1    Disbursement methodand SpecialAccounts
The project will use the traditional disbursement method based on Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs).
This method will be used for an 18-month period, during which time the project will produce quarterly
FMRs.After 18 months, capacities will be assessed inorder to determine whether disbursements can be
basedupon FMRs.
 0 SpecialAccount:
A Special Account will be opened and management primarily by the Borrowers' designated
representative, who i s the main authorizer (ordonnateur) o f capital expenditures inSenegal.
The total allocation o fthis Special Account will be US$2 million equivalent and will cover approximately
four months o f expenditures. Upon credit effectiveness, the World Bank will deposit in this account an
advance representing 50 percent o f the initial allocation, or US$1million equivalent. The balance o f the
advance will be deposited when total expenditures plus special commitments are equal to SDR 3,000,000.
The Special Account will be used for all expenditures equivalent to less than 20 percent o f the authorized
allocation, and requests for reimbursement will be submitted monthly. Reimbursements deposited by the
Bank into this Special Account will be made against these requests supported by appropriate
documentation.
0 90-day advanceaccount:
Out o f this account, a documented 90-day advance not to exceed CFAF 50,000,000 will be deposited in
an account held by the CP o f the CERSP inZiguinchor. This 90-day advance account will be managed by
the CP, who will be the primary authorizer o f expenditures f?om it, and by the CSAPF, its accountant.
The CSAPF and CP will be the joint signers on this account. The 90-day advance account will be
reconciled on a monthly basis.
0 Useof Statementsof Expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursements for all expenditures will be made by the Bank against full documentation, with the
following exceptions: (a) contracts for works in an amount not exceeding US$500,000; (b) contracts for
goods in an amount not exceeding US$150,000; (c) consulting contracts in an amount not exceeding
US$lOO,OOO;    (d) contracts for individualconsultants inan amount not exceedingUS$50,000; and (e) cash
payments, training and operating costs, which will be reimbursed on the basis o f SOEs.
All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained at ANRAC and must be made available for
review by periodic WorldBank review missions and external auditors.
The schema o f funding flows will be describedinthe procedures manual and appended to the MOP as an
annex; it will also specify the various modes o f disbursement.
0 Disbursementsby category:
The table below sets out the expenditure categories to be financed out of the Credit proceeds. The
allocations for each expenditurecategory are the following:

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                       44




 8.2.4.2   Counterpartfunds
 The Government must make all arrangements necessary to ensure the timely mobilization o f the
 counterpart funds needed for project implementation, and particularly for the operating and equipment
 expenditures o f the DG-ANRAC. An account will be opened inthe books o f the General Directorate for
 Public Accounts and Treasury to receive the counterpart funds. The DG-ANRAC will administer the
 Government's counterpart funds.
 The DG-ANRAC will open a regional account inZiguinchor to cover petty expenditures associated with
ProgramCoordination.
8.2.4.3    Other disbursement arrangements
The new Country Financing Parameters for Senegal (OP 600) adopted inJuly 30,2004 allows the funding
o f :
     0    the relocation expensesto the ex-combatants,
     0   the increase o f the disbursement percentage for the Operating Cost Category.
Regarding the second point, it has been stated that Counterpart Funds are not an issue in Senegal for Bank
funded operation. However, the mobilization o f counterpart funds for small expenditures and at the
decentralized level i s constraining. Thus the Bank agreed to increase the disbursement percentage for this
category up to 100%.Furthermore, the Counterpart Funds was increased accordingly to match the 10%.
8.2.5    Other financialmanagementarrangements
8.2.5.1    Relocationexpenseallowance for ex-combatants
A relocation expenses allowance is to be paid to ex-combatants (see description o f Phase 3 inparagraph
5.6.1.2), o f which CFAF 192,500 i s to be borne by the project. This amount will be paid out inthree equal
installments: the first at the time o f departure from the Demobilization Center, the second 3 to 4 months
later and the last 6 to 8 months after the departure.
Regarding the financial management arrangements, the CSAPFwill, after identification o f ex-combatants,
establish for each one a file, both electronic and physical, for payment and monitoring purposes. These
files must in particular contain the relevant identification papers and all documentary evidence o f
payments. Payments will be made through a commercial bank or through any other acceptable financial
intermediary (e.g., a funds transfer company or a micro-financing institution such as a cooperative,
savings bank or credit union.)

Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                        45


The CSAPF, in agreement with the CP, will identify the financial intermediaries closest to the project
areas and will proceed to assign ex-combatants to them for direct payment o f this expense allowance. An
agreement will be signed with these financial intermediaries specifying: (i) list o f beneficiaries as well
                                                                               the
as the required identity documents; (ii)   the modalities o f payment; (iii) modalities and deadlines for
                                                                            the
reporting on the execution o f payments.
The CSAPF will check the list of ex-combatants on aregular basis against the payment receipts. A report
will be prepared on this basis after each tranche and submittedto the World Bank. The validation o f this
report by the Project Officer will trigger the disbursement o f future tranches.
The Credit Agreement will include a `Grant' category to cover these payments. Expenditures under this
category will bereimbursed on a 100percent basis.
8.2.5.2   Supportfor reintegration
Support for reintegration will be provided during project implementation (see description o f Phase 4 in
paragraph 5.6.1.2). This support will be provided in accordance with the "Guidelines for Simplified
Procurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments". This support will be provided
through subprojects and will include training and capacity-building activities for reinsertion. It will
include the occasional purchase o f small equipment.
A detailed description will be provided inthe administrative, accountingand financial procedures manual.

              9.        SECTION H:FINANCIALAND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION

   Inthe absenceofreliable data onthe impact ofthe conflict onthe economies of Senegal and Casamance,
   it is currently impossible to calculate any economic rate of return for the PRAESC. It is obvious,
   however, that the development o f Casamance would be seriously compromised without such a program.
   The lack o f aid for the demobilization o f MFDC combatants would, inthe best case, cause some o f them
   to resort to banditry and civil violence, and at worst could re-ignite aspirations to achieve independence
   byviolent means.
   Similarly, failure to conduct mine clearance activities would amount to allowing a large part o f the land
   area o f Casamance's two regions to remain devoid of human presence, whereas these areas were an
   important source o frevenue for the population prior to the conflict.
   Finally, a minimum o f upgrading o f essential infrastructures, at the community level as well as at the
   higher levels, i s essential for economy recovery.
   Inorder to have an exact ideaofthese opportunity costs, anin-depth study wouldberequired.
   Itis also important to point out that unless this local conflict is resolved, the neighboring countries ofThe
   Gambia and Guinea-Bissau couldbecome even more unstable than they already are.
