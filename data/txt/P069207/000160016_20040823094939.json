To achieve\n            its objectives, the project will have three components: (1)\n            demobilization and reinsertion of combatants and other\n            conflict victims; (2) infrastructure reconstruction and\n            rehabilitation; and (3) technical support for the\n            preparation o f a long-term development program. In\n            addition, the National Agency for the Recovery o f Social\n            and Economic Activities in Casamance (ANRAC) will directly\n            implement other cross-cutting activities, such as\n            instituting a management information system. The project\n            will benefit Senegal as a whole and the Casamance region in\n            particular. All ex-combatants and their families will be\n            offered opportunities to resume normal civilian lives with\n            appropriate economic activities. Approximately 30,000\n            displaced persons will be supported in their return to\n            normal life in their original homes. After project\n            completion, Casamance is expected to be an exporter of\n            agricultural products abroad and a supplier to the local\n            Senegalese market. Significant foreign direct investment in\n            the tourism sector should also occur once regional stability\n            is secured. External risks to the project include: 1. A\n            full-scale rebellion because of disagreements between the\n            Rebellion Movement in Casamance (MFDC) and the Government;\n            and repeated attacks staged by gangs of former combatants.\n            Project risks comprise the following: 1) Poor coordination\n            among the various efforts taking place in Casamance; 2) Lack\n            of collaboration/trust between the administration and the\n            beneficiaries.; 3) Slowness of implementation and\n            disbursement; and 4) Inability of displaced persons to\n            return to their original homes."}, "docdt": "2004-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
