Lessons learned include: the\n            Casamance experience confirms that while a demobilization\n            and reintegration program is important it needs to be\n            complemented with broader development and social\n            mobilization efforts that can sustain peace. Building trust,\n            rebuilding social capital, and finding areas of common\n            ground between all stakeholders in parallel with formal\n            negotiations are key to achieving sustainable results in\n            fragile conditions. Project implementation shows that in\n            post conflict situations it is essential to first identify\n            and then address the causes of conflict. Before the Mid-term\n            Review (MTR) restructuring, it became clear that the peace\n            benefits from infrastructure rehabilitation were significant\n            despite the interruption in the negotiations and further\n            postponement of demobilization. It is clear from the\n            experience of the project that peace cannot be achieved\n            through negotiations alone, but requires a minimal\n            functional basic socio economic infrastructure. The project\n            unit in Ziguinchor realized that it had to obtain agreements\n            from all stakeholders, as well as from local MFDC (Mouvement\n            des Forces Democratiques de la Casamance - rebellion\n            movement in Casamance) representatives, on which\n            infrastructure to rehabilitate. The implementation unit in\n            Ziguinchor was only able to attract staff from the region\n            when it was established. Staff from other parts of Senegal\n            was not inclined to come and or bring their families in view\n            of the uncertain security situation prevailing at the start\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
