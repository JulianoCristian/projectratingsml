The objectives of the loan were to\n            accelerate growth and reduce poverty by assisting the\n            Government in: (i) implementing debt and debt service\n            reduction; (ii) consolidating fiscal balance and structural\n            reforms; and (iii) normalizing relations with commercial\n            creditors and re establishing creditworthines. Bank's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (i) the success of the operation  depends\n            principally on the credibility of the country's\n            economic reform program; (ii) the concerted, menu-based\n            approach to debt reduction provides significant cost savings\n            to the debtor country compared to market-based debt\n            reduction; (iii) creditor banks also improve their financial\n            position; (iv) the inclusion of a new money option is not\n            essential for securing both full participation of creditors\n            and substantial cost savings; and (v) net benefits are\n            higher when DDSR is backed financially by the International\n            Financial Institutions."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
