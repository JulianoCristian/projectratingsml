implementing debt and debt service\n            reduction; 2) consolidating fiscal balance and structural\n            reforms; and 3) normalizing relations with commercial\n            creditors, reestablishing creditworthiness, and accelerating\n            growth and development. DDSR will substantially enhance the\n            effectiveness of the reform program in accelerating growth\n            to potential by: 1) substantially reducing market\n            uncertainty over Panama's ability and willingness to\n            fully service its external debt, and the sizable distortions\n            and costs this uncertainty entails; 2) offsetting the\n            adverse effect on the investment climate and flows deriving\n            from the disengagement of the U.S. from the Canal and former\n            Canal Zone; and 3) reducing the debt overhang and the\n            associated \"tax\" on future output. The project\n            consists of the following components: 1) an exchange of\n            original principal for par bonds, discount bonds,\n            front-loaded interest reduction bonds (FLIRB) or debt\n            conversion bonds; and 2) normalization of past due interest\n            (PDI) through partial forgiveness, PDI payments prior to\n            closing, a down payment on PDI at closing, and a PDI bond."}, "docdt": "1996-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
