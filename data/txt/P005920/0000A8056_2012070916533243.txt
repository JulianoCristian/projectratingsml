                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation of the project has been satisfactory in that the targets for ODS reduction have been met. The project has supported, inter alia, the following activities: (i)
                         reconversion of Frio Industrias Argentinas - FIASA (before the project was the largest producer of CFCs in the country) which has now concluded; (ii) implementation of a
                         demonstrative Methyl Bromide program for the cotton and citrus industries (which has been recently cancelled by the Ministry of Industry); (iii) development of a chillers program, and
                         updating the market data and assess industries willing to switch technologies to reduce CFCs; (iv) elimination of CFCs at a refrigerator plant (Neba S.A.); (v) the national halon
                         management program to help eliminate the use of halon-1301 in new applications and to manage recovered halon-1301 (now closed); and (vi) phase-out of CFC consumption in the

                         undertakes research to test the use of isobutene, develop and secure approval of the technology by Argentina’s Federal Drug Administration Agency (ANMAT). Two other labs are
                         also involved, Denver Farma and Raffo. This subproject aims to eliminate approximately 130 MT of CFCs in the MDI sector. Currently there are ongoing discussions with GoA to
                         prepare a new phase of Montreal Protocol activities in Argentina.
