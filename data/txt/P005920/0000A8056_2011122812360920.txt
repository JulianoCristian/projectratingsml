                         The objective of the project is: (a) to support Argentina's program to phase out ODS consumption through the provision of technical and technological
                         assistance; and (b) to strengthen the institutional framework in Argentina to better identify, prepare, evaluate, and administrate subprojects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation of the project has been satisfactory in that the targets for ODS reduction have been met. The project has supported, inter alia, the following activities: (i)
                         reconversion of Frio Industrias Argentinas - FIASA (before the project was the largest producer of CFCs in the country) which has now concluded; (ii) implementation of a
                         demonstrative Methyl Bromide program for the cotton and citrus industries; (iii) development of a chillers program, and updating the market data and assess industries willing to
                         switch technologies to reduce CFCs; (iv) elimination of CFCs at a refrigerator plant (Neba S.A.); (v) the national halon management programme to help eliminate the use of
                         halon-1301 in new applications and to manage recovered halon-1301 (now closed); and (vi) phase-out of CFC consumption in the manufacture of aerosol Metered-Dose Inhalers

                         The recent subproject to phase-out CFC consumption in the manufacture of MDIs was approved at the 56th Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for
                         Implementation of the Montreal Protocol for an amount of U$S 2,806,874. This specific activity was endorsed by the Bank on November 2010and countersigned by the Minister of

                         Economy and Finance on February 10, 2011. This subproject is being carried out by several labs, like the Laboratorio Pablo Cassara, the major MDI producer in Argentina, which
                         undertakes research to test the use of isobutene, develop and secure approval of the technology by Argentina’s Federal Drug Administration Agency (ANMAT). Two other labs are
                         also involved, Denver Farma and Raffo. This subproject aims to eliminate approximately 130 MT of CFCs in the MDI sector. Currently there are ongoing discussions with GoA to
                         prepare a new phase of Montreal Protocol activities in Argentina.
