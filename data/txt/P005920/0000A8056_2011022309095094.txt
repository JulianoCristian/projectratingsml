                         The objective of the project is: (a) to support Argentina's program to phase out ODS consumption through the provision of technical and technological
                         assistance; and (b) to strengthen the institutional framework in Argentina to better identify, prepare, evaluate, and administrate subprojects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation of the project has been satisfactory in that the targets for ODS reduction have been met. The project has supported, inter alia, the following activities: (i)
                         reconversion of Frio Industrias Argentinas - FIASA (before the project was the largest producer of CFCs in the country); (ii) implementation of a demonstrative Methyl Bromide
                         program for the cotton and citrus industries; (iii) development of a chillers program, and updating the market data and assess industries willing to switch technologies to reduce CFCs;
                         (iv) elimination of CFCs at a refrigerator plant (Neba S.A.).

                         On November 2010, the World Bank approved a request from GoA for an amendment to the Grant Agreement, in order to reflect an expansion to the project to include a new project
                         to phase-out of CFC consumption in the manufacture of Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDI). The subproject would be carried out by the Laboratorio Pablo Cassará, the major MDI

                         Agency (ANMAT). This project was approved at the 56th Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, for a total of U$S
                         2,806,874. This subproject aims to eliminate approximately 130 MT of CFCs in the MDI sector.
