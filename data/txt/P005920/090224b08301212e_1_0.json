Reduction of Ozone\n            Depleting Substances Project for Argentina were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the recipient\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the umbrella project modality, established\n            through World Bank policy on Montreal Protocol operations\n            facilitated the substantial achievement of ODS phase-out\n            when unforeseen events arose such as the financial crisis\n            and during the extended MP-mandated phase-down steps. As a\n            result of the flexibility and simple design, the project\n            could respond to phase-out needs by incorporating new\n            subprojects to replace those cancelled. The decisions,\n            policies and procedures of the MP and the MLF shaped the\n            project and had a positive influence on outcomes in terms of\n            phase-out targets and prioritization, environmental and\n            safety requirements on alternative technologies, monitoring\n            and reporting requirements, pressures for cancellation of\n            inactive projects, and sustainability measures. These\n            guiding parameters drove subproject implementation progress\n            including in periods when supervision, MP technical\n            capacity, and monitoring and reporting by the Bank and UEPRO\n            were lacking. The majority of project disbursement and\n            phase-out was achieved by the 2010 MP phase-out target. The\n            final restructuring made a good case for GA extension, but\n            the period of extension was not used to its full potential\n            to close out remaining subproject balances and to focus\n            technical and administrative capacity on the MDI strategy\n            and chiller replacement subprojects. The final period of\n            little outputs overshadowed the positive results achieved\n            prior to 2010."}, "docdt": "2015-06-30T01:38:03Z"}
