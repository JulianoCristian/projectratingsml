Implementation Status and Key Decisions

The Project closes on December 30, 2014. It has met and slightly exceeded its environmental target of reducing/eliminating consumption of ozone
depleting substances (ODS). Beyond the Montreal Protocol (MP) mandated ozone layer protection, the Project also contributed to climate change
mitigation, taken the CFCs’ high global warming potentials. Further, subprojects provided critical value added to the beneficiary companies through
technology transfer and consequent improvements in production efficiency and end product quality.

The Project has supported a total of 23 subprojects, the beneficiaries including 27 private enterprises and two public institutions (INTA, the National
Institute of Agricultural Technology and INTI, the National Institute of Industrial Technology). Examples of the subprojects are: (i) accelerated CFC
production phaseout at Frio Industrias Argentinas - FIASA, the only CFC producer in the country; (ii) phaseout of CFC consumption in the
manufacture of aerosol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs); (iii) phaseout of CFC-11 in the manufacture of rigid polyurethane foam in panels for thermal
insulation; and (iv) demonstrative project for testing methyl bromide alternatives in cotton and citrus.

Since the 1999 consumption freeze per the MP, Argentina completed a phased process of eliminating consumption of the first major group of ODS
(CFCs, halon and CTC) by January 1, 2010 for non-essential/critical uses. Said phaseout was in time with the MP schedule and due to a
remarkable contribution by the Project. Further, the Project achieved elimination of the national CFC production in 2007; two years ahead of the
required MP schedule.

The Project Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is being prepared together with the responsible Government agencies and will be published
by June 30, 2015.

               Comments
               It is to be noted that the end target for the ODS phaseout should be 3944 instead of 1612 metric tons reflected in the results framework.
               1612 metric tons is the original upper-end target set for the GEO; the end target has not been revised to reflect funding included under the
               Project for new subprojects in 2008 and 2010. Further, actual phaseout at project completion is slightly higher than past reported because
               the phaseout of non-CFC substances had not been officially included in the count by the PCU (i.e. from the halon bank and solvent
               subprojects). It is to be noted that the baseline value of this indicator was adjusted a couple of times over the Project life without formal
               processing and approval.

               Originally, the Project was to reflect its impact against the national 1992 ODS consumption, 4,440 tons of ODS, captured in the MLF financed
               “country program” and prepared with the Bank, and the end target was a 20 to 40% reduction of the same. Over the years, retaining this
               type of baseline and target setting became complicated, as there were factors impacting the level of national ODS consumption, the most
               important being that 1992 precedes any MP-mandated controls, namely the baseline level for developing countries (1995-1997 average
               consumption) and the freeze in consumption at baseline levels in 1999 (followed by stepped reductions up to 2010). The Project has opted
               for a 0 baseline as intended from the start, meaning that under a business as usual scenario, no ODS would have been phased out, and the
               end target became the ODS phaseout associated with the Multilateral Fund (MLF) approved subprojects.

               Regarding the ozone layer protection, Argentina has enacted a comprehensive legal and institutional framework for the implementation of
               the MP starting in mid-90s when OPROZ, the national Ozone Office was created (a condition of the Project). The SAyDS hosts the office of
               the national Ozone Focal Point, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs being two other key agencies comprising the
               OPROZ. The legal and policy framework for MP implementation and ozone protection is the responsibility of the Ozone Focal

               Point. Argentina assumed responsibilities for and obligations of implementing measures to eliminate the first major group of ODS (CFCs,
               halon, CTC) and convert industrial sectors that produced or used these substances by the agreed timeframe; with the final aim of meeting
               compliance targets under the MP (complete elimination of the import + production of CFC, halon and CTC by Jan. 1, 2010 for non-
               essential/critical uses). Given that GoA has a functioning ODS regulatory and policy framework, including a robust licensing and quota
               system implemented with Customs, the GoA has not only sustained project phaseout results that were achieved through this project and
               others, but has created the enabling environment for addressing the next set of ODS subject to phaseout (HCFCs).
