                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is: (a) to support Argentina's program to phase out ODS consumption through the provision of technical and technological assistance; and
                         (b) to strengthen the institutional framework in Argentina to better identify, prepare, evaluate, and administrate subprojects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall project implementation has been satisfactory and the targets for ODS reduction have been met and exceeded. The project has supported, inter alia, the following
                         activities: (i) CFC phase-out at Frio Industrias Argentinas - FIASA, the largest CFC producer in the country; (ii) CFC phase-out at the Ikala S.A. refrigerator plant (previously Neba S.
                         A.); and (iii) development of a national halon management program to help eliminate the use of halon-1301 in new applications and to manage recovered halon-1301 (the program
                         has already closed). A pilot program for chiller conversions with chiller owners willing to switch to CFC-free and more energy efficient technologies is still on-going until December

                         conversion from the CFC substitute HFA to isobutane has been completed.
