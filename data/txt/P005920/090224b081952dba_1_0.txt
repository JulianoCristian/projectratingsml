                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is: (a) to support Argentina's program to phase out ODS consumption through the provision of technical and technological assistance; and
                         (b) to strengthen the institutional framework in Argentina to better identify, prepare, evaluate, and administrate subprojects.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation of the project has been satisfactory in that the targets for ODS reduction have been met. The project has supported, inter alia, the following activities: (i)
                         reconversion of Frio Industrias Argentinas - FIASA (before the project was the largest producer of CFCs in the country) which has now concluded; (ii) development of a chillers
                         program, and updating the market data and assess industries willing to switch technologies to reduce CFCs; (iii) elimination of CFCs at a refrigerator plant (Neba S.A.); (iv) develop
                         the national halon management program to help eliminate the use of halon-1301 in new applications and to manage recovered halon-1301 (now closed); and (vi) phase-out of CFC
                         consumption in the manufacture of aerosol Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs).
