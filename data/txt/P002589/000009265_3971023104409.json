  rehabilitation of estates and their associated factories and\n            strengthen the Borrower's management of the sugar\n            sector.

Also included in the project is; (iii)\n            a phased program of institutional and financial\n            re-adjustments which will establish proper production\n            arrangements and incentives; (vi) research facilities to\n            find more suitable cane varieties; and (v) training in\n            technical, management and accounting skills."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
