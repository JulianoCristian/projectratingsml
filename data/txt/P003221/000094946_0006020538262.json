Most project components were either transferred\n            to other new projects or substantially modified during the\n            course of implementation. In terms of sustainability of the\n            limited activities carried out by the project, it is likely\n            that most will be sustainable. Overall World Bank\n            performance has been partially satisfactory and would have\n            been rated deficient had it not been for IDA's\n            pro-activity in designing and implementing new and\n            comprehensive programs in some areas, its achievements in\n            introducing policy reform measures, and the relatively\n            satisfactory work done in the few areas where the project\n            was implemented. The main lessons drawn include the\n            following: The lack of an inter-ministerial coordinating\n            body in which all of the implementing agencies are\n            represented was one of the main causes for the\n            project's poor implementation. Unilateral closing of a\n            project component as experienced with the line of credit is\n            not advisable since it tends to cause participating\n            commercial banks and Borrowers alike to lose confidence in\n            institutions. The project also suffered from unsatisfactory\n            management on the part of the ministries involved and lacked\n            continuity in project management and supervision on the part\n            of the Bank. Neglect in setting up the monitoring and\n            evaluation system as envisaged resulted in poor assessment\n            of implementation progress and hindered impact assessment."}, "docdt": "2000-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
