                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making moderately satisfactory progress toward the objective of contributing to minimizing the threat of avian flu. The number of villages that have adopted two or more
                         disease prevention measures recommended by the project has reached the end-of-project target of 30 villages, representing over 1440 households. Evidence of improved
                         effectiveness of participating animal and human health services in responding to the risk of avian flu include improved speed of response time to suspected outbreaks in poultry and
                         humans. Still, poultry disease reporting at the local level is insufficient and possible flu cases in humans are not being identified quickly enough locally to save lives, although there

                         disease suspected of being avian influenza were reported in the first three quarters of 2013 and all of them were investigated within 24 hours. Samples from all cases that were
                         consistent with avian influenza after field investigations (91% of cases investigated) were collected and transported to the National Animal Veterinary Research Institute (NaVRI) for
                         testing for avian influenza and Newcastle disease.

                         To prepare for, control and respond to a human influenza pandemic, a pandemic preparedness plan was developed and a desk-top exercise was implemented. To foster inter-
                         ministerial cooperation for pandemic preparedness, terms of reference for the National Committee for Disaster management (NCDM) have been modified to include inter-ministerial
                         cooperation. A Pandemic Preparedness, Response and Recovery Program (PPRRP) has been prepared and tested. A NCDM emergency management information system and
                         monitoring and evaluation systems have been designed, developed and established, and staff trained appropriately.
