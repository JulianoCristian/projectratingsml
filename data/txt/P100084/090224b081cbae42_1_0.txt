                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains a priority for the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), and the three implementing agencies have continued further advancing
                         project activities, which have been aimed at contributing to the PDO and thus increasing its likelihood to be achieved by the extended closing date of June 30, 2013. The project has
                         been successful in achieving its PDO, and nearly all of the project intermediate results indicators have been fully achieved or exceeded. Eighteen of the 24 agreed actions of the July/
                         August 2012 mission were completed, another five were partially completed, and one is still pending under Ministry of Health (MoH). Despite this clear success in achieving the

                         project stated objectives, the H5N1 avian influenza virus has not been eradicated from Cambodia, Cambodia accounted for more than half of the world human H5N1 cases in 2013,
                         and Cambodia human H5N1 fatality rate is well above the world average. Therefore the Government and the international community should find some means of actively supporting
                         the good work of the project beyond the June 30, 2013 closing date. Ministry of Economic and Finance (MEF) in a letter dated June 13, 2013, requested reallocation of grant
                         proceeds and extension of closing date from June 30, 2013 to April 30, 2014 for IDA and PHRD Grant and from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013 for AHIF. This proposed

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been restructured and RGC has requested that the project closing date be extended to April 30, 2014. The purpose of restructuring and the closing date extension is
                         to allow the consolidation of major activities aimed at reducing the risk of avian influenza in poultry and humans, and to undertake active surveillance for H5N1 and H7N9 avian
                         influenza.
