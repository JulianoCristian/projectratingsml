for the Avian and Human\n            Influenza Control and Preparedness Emergency Project for\n            Cambodia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: there is also an issue with\n            attribution when dealing with changes in the number of\n            cases. For example, one of the initial key indicators in\n            this project (the number of cases of avian influenza in\n            peri-urban commercial poultry) had to be dropped because no\n            new cases were detected in this sector during the course of\n            the project. This was coincidental and not attributable to\n            gains from project activities. Procurement and financial\n            management arrangements for the engagement of the UN\n            agencies in an emergency disease response project should be\n            clearly established at the corporate level in advance. One\n            of the crucial issues that remains to be addressed in\n            Cambodia but for which some background work has been\n            conducted (such as improved legislation and training in\n            biosecurity for villages) is the weak control over poultry\n            movements. Until such time as there is better control of\n            movement of poultry within Cambodia and across borders\n            disease outbreaks will recur. Limited controls on movement\n            of other types of livestock also threaten the health status\n            of livestock in the country. Detailed case investigations\n            and monitoring provide opportunities to reduce the\n            probability of emergence of a pandemic agent. The work\n            undertaken by officers in Health Departments following\n            detection of human cases provided the best possible chance\n            of detecting any evidence of human to human transmission of\n            the virus therefore allowing measures to be implemented to\n            prevent its spread."}, "docdt": "2014-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
