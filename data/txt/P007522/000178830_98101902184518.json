problems: the balance of payments deficit,\n            industrial inefficiency, and the lack of long-term\n            industrial finance discussed above. The project's main\n            objectives are to promote industrial efficiency and expand\n            industrial capacity by providing long-term loans based on\n            strict project appraisal to a wide range of medium-size\n            enterprises with growth and export potential. In accordance\n            with its objective of promoting industrial investment with a\n            positive influence on the balance of payments, FONEI would\n            finance: (a) export projects, (b) import substitution\n            projects and (c) feasibility studies for such projects."}, "docdt": "1972-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
