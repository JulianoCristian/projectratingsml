this Cotton\n            Sector Adjustment Program Project support the\n            Government's adjustment program for the cotton sector\n            which aims at reducing the inefficiencies of the cotton\n            industry and paving the way for a broader based agricultural\n            development strategy in heretofore cotton areas.  The\n            program hopes to attain improved efficiency by implementing\n            reforms in the incentive and institutional framework for\n            cotton production.  The reform of the incentive system\n            provides for the cotton processing industry to operate\n            within a schedule of pre-determined margins for the\n            elimination of input subsidies for the introduction of a\n            more flexible producer pricing system for the payment of an\n            export subsidy and for the creation of a Cotton Fund managed\n            by the cotton industry.  The institutional reform, on the\n            other hand, aims at strengthening the capacity of support\n            services to alleviate productivity bottlenecks at farm level\n            and identify crop diversification possibilities.  The\n            adjustment program will extend over three years and be\n            supported by follow-up adjustment credits."}, "docdt": "1987-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
