Experience with these\n            projects highlights the following lessons: 1) Especially in\n            poor, drought-stricken regions like Ceara, water resource\n            infrastructure investments need to be sensitive to demand in\n            order to be efficient in boosting development. 2) Economic\n            Rate of Returns (ERRS) provide useful measures of efficiency\n            and indicators of demand when using actual cost and benefit\n            data that are calibrated with the real constraints of the\n            local economy and the capacities o f local agencies. 3) Bank\n            assistance can help nurture a culture of self-evaluation by\n            borrowers and implementing agencies, and stimulate them to\n            continuously monitor results. 4) Project upgrading of low\n            income urban areas can bring significant improvements to the\n            living conditions of the poor even in remote cities of the interior."}, "docdt": "2006-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
