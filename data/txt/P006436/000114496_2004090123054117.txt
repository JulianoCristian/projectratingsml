Re:

Seventh Amendment to Loan Agreement
Dear Governor Alcântara: 
 
Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated December 16, 1994, between the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the State of 
Ceará (the Borrower) for the above referenced Project, as amended, and to the 
Borrower’s request for an increase of the disbursement percentage in categories (1), (9) 
and (10) of the Project, and the reallocation of funds among the ten (10) disbursement 
categories. 
 
We agree with such request, and propose to amend the table in Schedule 1 
to the Loan Agreement, to reflect the increase in the disbursement percentage in respect 
of expenditures under Categories (1), (9) and (10) thereof and the reallocation of funds.  
The revised table shall read as set forth in the Annex to this letter. 
 
If you agree with the foregoing amendment, please sign and date the two copies 
of this Letter in the space provided below, and return one copy to us.  This amendment 
letter will become effective as of January 1, 2003, upon receipt by the Bank of a copy of 
this letter countersigned by you. 
 
Please disregard our previous letter on the same subject, which was sent to you on 
September 11, 2003. 
 
Sincerely yours,
