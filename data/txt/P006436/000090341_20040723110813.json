Resources Management Project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that well\n            designed water resources management systems are not\n            sufficient to ensure that they will be used effectively.\n            Investment decision for the construction of reservoirs and\n            conveyance systems were made without using proper economic\n            evaluation techniques. The participation of civil society,\n            from the planning of the investment, the process of\n            resettlement and works execution, is essential for reducing\n            stakeholder conflicts, and for ensuring real stakeholder\n            buy-in to the proposed project. A well developed\n            institutional development policy is essential for promoting\n            decentralization and strengthening municipal management and\n            governance capacity. Linking improved municipal management\n            and governance performance should be a prerequisite for\n            obtaining access to funds for infrastructure investments.\n            Any program that devolves project development, works, and\n            supervision to the municipal level, must include a component\n            to strengthen local capacity in these functions. Programs\n            that finance infrastructure works, should include a manual\n            for procedures to follow in assessing the feasibility of\n            projects and a minimum threshold for going forward."}, "docdt": "2004-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
