 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsandactivitiesof theWorld Bankfortwo purposes:
 first, to ensurethe Integrityofthe Bank'sself-evaluation procsssandto verifythat the Bank'swork Is producingthe
 expected results,andsecond,to helpdevelopImproveddirections,policies,and proceduresthroughthe
 disseminationof lessonsdrawnfromexperience.As partofthiswork, IEGannuallyassessesabout25 percentofthe
 Bank'slendingoperations. Inselecting operationsfor assessment,preferenceisgivento thosethat are innovative,
 large,or complex;thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor countryevaluations:thoseforwhich Executive
 Directorsor Bankmanagementhaverequestedassessments;andthosethat areilkelyto generateImportantlessons.
 The projects,topics, andanalyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupportlargerevaluationstudies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report(PPAR) Is basedon a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluationbythe responsibleBankdepartment)and fieldwork conducted by IEG.To prepare
 PPARs, IEGstaff examineprojectfiles and otherdocuments, Interviewoperationalstaff, and in mostcases visit
 the borrowingcountryfor onsite discussionswith projectstaffand beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
 validateand augment the Informationprovidedinthe ICR,aswe11as examineissuesof specialinterest to broader
 IEGstudies.
       EachPPARissubject to a peer review processand IEG managementapproval.Once clearedinternally,the
 PPARis reviewed bythe responsible Bankdepartmentand amended as necessary.The completed PPAR isthen
 sent tothe borrowerfor review;the borrowers'commentsareattachedto the documentthat issent to the Bank's
 Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessmentreporthas beensent to the Board, it Isdisclosedto the public.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the following urban
development andwater resourceprojects inBrazil:

    Cearsl UrbanDevelopmentand Water ResourcesManagement Project (Ln3789-
    BR), for whichthe WorldBankapprovedaloanofUS$140milliononSeptember6,
    1994. The loanwas closedonDecember31,2003, three years later thanplanned,
    whenUS$3.8 millionundisbursedwere cancelled.

    Cearsl Water Resources Management Pilot Project (Ln4190-BR), for which the
    Bank approved a loan o f US$9.6 million on June 12, 1997. The loanwas closed on
    June 30,2002, two years later thanplanned.

The report isbasedon areview ofproject documents, including Implementation
CompletionReports, StaffAppraisal Reports, Memorandato the President, legal
documents andproject files, andondiscussionswith Bankstaffinvolvedinthe projects.
An IEGmission visitedBrazilinNovember2005 to review projectresults andmet with
50personsincluding federal, Cearii state andmunicipal officials, as well as
representativeso fagencies involved inproject implementation. IEGfieldvisits,
accompaniedby localproject staff, were madeto project sites in5 municipalities across
the state o fCearii. These visits gavethe IEGmissionthe opportunity to meet directly
withthe intendedbeneficiaries ofthe operationsunderreview. We gratefilly
acknowledgethe courtesies andattention givenbythese inferlocutors as well as the
excellent logistical support providedbythe Cearhstate Secretariatso fLocal and
RegionalDevelopment ando fWater ResourcesinFortaleza.

FollowingstandardIEGprocedures, copies o fthe drafPPARwere sent to government
officials andagencies for their review andcomments. Their comments are included as

 C d ' s economyweakenedandpovertyworsenedduringtheimplementationo ftheseprojects.
 Cearh's modernizing administrations from 1988appearedpoised, however, to take the state
 forward, and it becameborrower for these two loans. The state's 184municipalities, too, were
 obvious partners for the Bank, butwere still weak. By addressingbothpoor livingconditions in
 cities andrecurrent droughts inthe countryside the Bank supportedCearh's policy ontwo fronts.

 PROURB's largest urbancomponent was the upgrading o fpoor urbanareas withbasic services
 andinfrastructure. PROURB's mainwater resourcecomponentsinvolvedbuildingdams and
 fillingreservoirscalled `aqudes' inCead, primarilyto supply water to cities. Monitoringand
evaluation o fproject outcomeswould havebeen stronger with explicit tracking o fpoor
beneficiaries andclear indicators o f efficiency o fwater use.
The Pilot-PROGERIRH's first objective was to preparea follow-on project, butonly one thirdo f
estimatedexpenditureswere earmarkedfor that purpose. The remainder was to finance studies
unnecessaryfor preparingthe follow-on. Someremainedunfinished at project completion.
P R O W implementationfacedtwo severe, yet quite differentchallengesin2000-first                    Brazil's
FederalFiscal Responsibility Law that haltedproject lendingto municipalities, andthenavery
severe drought. Still, urbanupgrading componentswere completedin49 municipalities, and 16
damswere builtincompliance withBankenvironmental andinvoluntarysettlement safeguards.
The implementation o fthe Pilot-PROGERIRH also proceededmoreslowly than expected.
Demandfor its h d swasweakenedbythe substantialtechnical assistance(TA) resources
already available throughPROURB.
PROURBhadmixedresults instrengtheningmunicipalities. Across Cearii as a whole, municipal
ownrevenuesgrew faster than stateandfederal transfers, butefforts bymunicipalities visitedby
the IEGmission to collect their own taxeswere still meager. Cearii's water resource agenciesare
strongerthanks to PROURB, butthe hoped-for market for bulkwater hasyet to evolve.
Inspite ofincreasingpoverty, statewide datashow improvements inlivingconditions ofthe
urbanpoor inCeadover the lifeofthe PROURBproject. The shareofurbanhouseholdsserved
bywater rose from 74.3 percent in 1997to 87.0 percentin2003. PROURBinvestments
introduced water andother basic servicesto 89 poor urbanareas. A self-help approach, called

 1. Cearh'sAdverseConditionsfor Development Background               -
 1.1     Poverty anddrought were andremainenormous challengesfor the North-eastern
state o fCearh, one o fBrazil's poorest. Cearh's per capita GDP is currentlyjust 41
percento fBrazil's-down fiom 47 percentin 1997, and46 percent o fhouseholdsinthe
state currently live on lessthan oneminimumsalary-up        fiom 35 percent in1997. These
worsening trends contrast sharplywith the optimistic assessments o f Cearh's economic
growth andsocialprogressreportedinthe PROURB SAR in1994. In2003,71 percent o f
Cearb'spopulation o fnearly 8.0 millionlivedinurbanareas, up from 62 percent in1997.
Although not a largepopulation for an areathe size o fEnglandandWales, eking out a
livinginmost ofthis semi-arid stateisthe best that mostpoor families cando, whether as
migrants to the cities or as subsistencefarmers inruralareas.

1.2     Localmunicipal administration is weak throughout most o fthe state. Evenso,
Ceargs 184municipalities, like thoseelsewhereinBrazil, accumulatedmore revenue,
especially federal andstatetransfers sincethe 1988Constitution, makingthempotentially
moreimportant for Cearh's development, andobvious partnersfor Bank support.
PROURB wisely incorporatedthem as key stakeholders.

1.3     Physical conditions inCearhare tough. Although the state's annual rainfall aver-
ages 800millimeters, precipitation is highlyvariable over time andacross the state.
Severe droughts, worsenedby crystalline formations o fsub-soils that do not holdground
water, playhavoc with agriculturalproductionthat, insome years may fall by one fifth,
yet recoverbyas muchinothers. Thehot sunnyclimate meansthat upto 40 percento f
surfacewater is lost throughevaporation. Rivers areintermittent.Collecting water from
them duringrainyperiods inlarge reservoirs called apdes for use duringdryperiods has
beenpracticedinCearhfor a century sincethe creation o fthe first apde inthe city o f
Quixadh in1906 andthe establishment in1909o fthe federal droughtmitigatingagency
DNOCS (DepartamentoNacional de Obrascontra as Secas), stillheadquarteredtoday in
Cearh's capital, Fortaleza.

1.4     Cearh's responseinthe early 1990sto these conditions was to set up a Water
ResourceManagementCompany, COGEW, to managewater resourcesinCearh.
COGERH operateshalfthe states 123 aqudes-smaller ones that store 20 percent o f
Cearh's water resources. DNOCS owns andoperatesthe other halfthat stores 80percent
o fthe state's water resources. The state's water planPLANEMfollows a Frenchmodel
o fwater resourcemanagementbyriverbasin(Teixeira 2004 p. 13). Onlymuchlater, in
2000, was a similar approachadoptedat the federal levelwith the creation o fthe National
Water AgencyANA inBrasilia. As the federal government's advisory andregulatory
agencyfor allBrazil's water resources, 80percent o fwhich lie inthe Amazon basin,
ANA'Smandatesometimesoverlapswiththat o fthe environment, suchas when dealing
withpollutingeffluents. Evenso, the top priorityinwater resourcemanagementremains
water supply for humanconsumption, traditionally the responsibility o f state sanitation
companiesinBrazil.

1.5    Acute poverty anddroughtindeedmadeup a challenging context for Bank
assistance for Cearb's development. After decadesofmisgovernment andcorruption,
however, Cearhseemedpoisedto move forward with a series o fmodemizing

administrations inthe State government from 1988 onwardsthat the Bank could support.

 2.2         Despite the priority for urbanuse, the same cities were not necessarilytargetedto
 benefit from bothPROURB's urbanimprovements andwater resourceinvestments.
 Furthermore, water for irrigated agriculture was important, accounting for one thirdof
 estimatedbenefits ofthe dams. Butthere was no agronomist onthe Bankappraisalteam.

                                             3


 Officials inCearhalso informed the IEGmissionthat the Bankhaddeployed too few
 water sector expertstoo, untiltowards the very endo fproject implementation. Even
 though the project fell underthe remit o ftwo distinct stateprograms, eachwith its
 separate lines o fcommand, the design nominally assignedoverallproject responsibility
 to the urbanside only. Somehow, the water componentswouldbe "coordinated" bythe
 urbanauthorities. WithintheBankitself, several voices arguedinvainagainst including
 the water resourcecomponentwithinthe project. Later, the water side o fP R O W
 assertedits autonomy, leadingto a schismbetweenthe urbanandwater parts. Indeed,
 IEG'sownevaluation ofP R O Wbecameas ifitwere anassessmentoftwo parallel
 andwconnected operations. Inhindsight, thePROURB designhadto makethe bestof
 anawkwardbundlingoftwo partsunconnectedbypolicy, administrationor concept.

 2.3     Byfar the largest componentofthe urbanpartofPROURBwas theupgradingof
 selectedlow-income areas inselectedcities, byinstallingbasic urbanserviceswithin
 them, usingthe community contributions andparticipation, knownas rnutirh inBrazil.
 Additional fundingthrough advantageousexchangerate movements made larger urban
 investmentspossibleinso-called "structural works" for the selectedcities. A component
 to install water metersinselectedcities cameunder the urbanparto fthe project, since
the state sanitation company responsible, CAGECE,reportedto the state's urban
 authorities. PROURB also provided technical assistanceto strengthenmunicipal
government administrations especially infinancial planningandmanagementandproject
evaluation.

2.4      PROURB's urbanpartforesaw that project finance would be on-lent to
municipalities through a stateUrbanDevelopment Fund(FDU), specially createdfor this
purposeandadministeredbythe statedevelopmentbank, BEC. Similar arrangements
wereusedinotherBank-financedmunicipal developmentprojects inBrazil, butFDUdid
suffer fkoma design weakness. The maturity ofFDUloanswas countedfiomthe date of
signingthe sub-loanagreement, butthe graceperiodwas counted fiomthe date o fthe
first disbursement.When the first disbursementwas delayedbecauseo fthe slow start-up
o fworks, municipalities found themselveshavingto fullypay off a loanat the end ofa
graceperiodthat sometimes coincided withthe endo fthe loanterm itself

2.5     The designo fthe water partof PROURB soughtto improve water resource
managementwithinthe fiamework o fCearh's 11natural river basins. This meant
dammingthe state's intermittent riversso that water couldbecollectedinthe qudes
duringthe rainyperiod, for useduringthe dry season, Cearh's traditionalpractice as has
alreadybeenmentioned. Water resourcemanagementinthese circumstancesinvolved
reconciling conflicting demands for humanuse incities, andfor irrigationandhydro-
power. However, urbanusewas PROURB's priority as itwas inboththe state and
federal water resourceplans. The gradual development o f amarket for bulkwater was,
according to PROURB, the best way to reconcile conflicting uses. Among the criteria for
choosing damlocations were severeshortage ofwater, topography, remotenessfiom
Fortaleza(considered to bealreadywell-served) andabsenceo flarge scaleDNOCS
agudes. The water part o fP R O W also includedtechnical assistanceto strengthenwater
resourceagencies, particularly the newlycreated StateSecretariatfor Water Resources
(SRH) andthe implementing agencyCOGERH.

                                             4


2.6     MonitoringandEvaluation (M&E) to verifythe achievement o fproject objectives
was weak withrespectto boththe urbanandwater partso fPROURB. Onthe urbanside,
the project design didnot make clear, for instance, how manypoor people were targeted
to benefit from the intendedimprovements to urbanlivingconditions andsafer sourceso f
water. Onthe water resourcesside, the project design didnot include indicators that
would spell out clearly how the greater efficiency inwater usewouldbemeasured.

2.7     The Pilot-PROGERIRH design was more complex thanneededjust to preparea
follow-on operation-for   which only one thirdo fthe appraisedexpenditureswere
eannarked. The remainingtwo-thirds sought to finance studies andsupport the
consolidation o fthe Cearbstatewater resourcessecretariat (SRH).They evenincluded
fundingfor physicalworks that were later dropped. The `pilot' designationwas unusual
for anoperationthat pursued activities coveredalreadybyaPROURB project into its
thirdyear ofimplementationwhenthePilot-PROGERIRHwas appraised.

2.8     Forbothloans, the State o f Cearbitselfwas borrower-ne      o fthe first state-level
borrowers inBrazil's poorer Northeast-while a guarantee agreementwas signedwith
the Federal Government. Improvedfinancial managementsince 1988made Cearbone o f
Brazil's most credit worthy states. Cearbofficials toldthe IEGmissionthat they often felt
underpressureto borrow morebecauseo fthis. At this writing, the statehasalready
repaid65 percentofthe PROURB loanand22 percentofthePilot-PROGERIRH loan.


3. One ChallengeafterAnother -ImplementationExperience
3.1     PROURB was successfully implementedeventhoughit facedchallengesat every
turn, slowingdisbursementsandconstruction. Clarifyingandimplementingthe autonomy
o fthe water part occupiedthe first two years after loaneffectiveness. Bythen, only 15
percent (insteado fthe expected 51percent) oFthe loanhadbeendisbursed. SRHbecame
fully functional by 1997whenPROURBwas effectively divided intotwo separate
operations. Furtherdisruption came in1999with the liquidation o fthe Cearbstatelow-
income housingcompany C O H . ,executing agency for PROURB's upgrading
component. But2000 was an evenmore difficult year for the project. The first bigblow
inthat yearto theP R O Wmodeloffinancingmunicipalities (andto allsimilar
operations elsewhere inthe country) was Brazil's Law o fFiscalResponsibility, enacted
inMay2000tohelpstabilizethecountry's notoriouslyvolatilepublic finances. The law
forbadenewborrowingbymunicipalities fkom the state, not only inCearb, but
throughout Brazil. FDUlendingtherefore ceased. Disbursementscontinued, but as grants
rather thanloans, underminingthe long-term sustainability o fthe PROURB operation.
Measures are urgentlyneededto dealwiththe rumpo fthe FDUthat still receivesloan
repaymentsfrom municipalities, while PROURB stillhas to payadministrative fees
leviedbyCearB's StateBankBEC.

3.2     Bythe original closingdateofMarch2000,70 percent ofthePROURBloanhad
beendisbursed. The so-called "structural works" componentswere incorporatedby
formal amendment approvedbythe Boardto accelerateUS$disbursements, slowed in
partbythe devaluationo fthe Brazilianreal. Altogether, 17suchworks were financed,
the largest (US$13 million) being a commercial center andpublic meetingplazainthe

                                              5


 city o fJuazeiro do Norte. The IEGmissionvisitedthree smaller works: atourism-cultural
 corridor (US5.4 million) inthe city o fQuixennobim (pop. 59,000); completion o f a
 section o fMaracana~'sringroadlocatedwithinthe metropolitanregiono fFortaleza
 (US4.5 million); andlandscapingandpaving (US$3.5 million) aroundthe mainagudeo f
 the city o f Quixadi(pop. 70,000). All works visited were well built andintensively used.

 3.3     Urbanupgradingcomponentswere implementedin49 municipalities throughout
 the state, always usingthe community participationapproach, called mutiriio inBrazil.
 Also widespreadwas the introduction of 176,000water metersthroughout the state,
 whichhelpedreduceunaccountedfor water significantly.

 3.4     The constructiono fthe dams by SOHIDRA (the state Superintendencyo fWater
 Works and SRH's contracting arm) was relatively trouble-fi-ee, although many changes
 were madeinthiB component. Fewerbut largerdamswere built-only 16insteado fthe
 35 planned, buttheir storagecapacity was still 87 percento fthe appraisal target (using35
 dams). Theirprocurement, contractingandconstructionwent smoothly. Therewas no
 shortage o fconstructionmaterial or labor to buildthe dams andrelatedworks.

 3.5     Implementation o fthe Pilot-PROGERIRH was slower thanexpected. The loan
becameeffective six months later thanplannedandonly 37 percent hadbeendisbursed
bythe original closingdate, that hadto beextendedtwo years. Evenso, anunused
US$1.2millionstill hadto becancelledat the later closing date. Clearly, resourcesfor
technical assistancethrough these two projects were abundant inCearh, withPROURB's
ownUS36.7 millionininstitutional developmentandthe Pilot-PROGERIRH's US$9.6
million. Pilot PROGERIRHmoneywas usedto prepareextensive anddetailed studies
anddesigns for fbture water sector investmentsinCearii, andto ensurethe continuing
functioning o fthe water resource agenciesuntilthe new PROGERIRHproject came on
board. Despitethe plentifblresources, six studies begununderthe Pilot-PROGERIRH
including one onbulk water pricing, Statewater resourceplanupdate andmanagementof
groundwater inFortaleza, remainedunfinished.

3.6      Since 75 percent ofPilot-PROGERIRH disbursementswere made to SRHthat
hadalreadyreceivedsignificant fundingthroughPROURB, theIEGmissiontogether
with SRHofficials carefilly reviewedhow SRHhadusedthe additional Pilot-
PROGERIRHfunding. Fromthis review, IEGhasno reasonto doubt that considerable
work resulted fi-om this expenditure. Pilot-PROGERIRH efforts didhelpto assessthe
appropriateness o fthe institutional fiamework for water resourcemanagementas
intended. Onthe other hand, theproject objective ofpreparingthe follow-on operation
couldhavebeenachievedmore efficiently hadgreaterusemade o fthe PROURB
resourcesalreadyavailable+some       o fwhichwere later cancelled.

3.7     Bothprojects were implemented incompliancewith keyBank safeguardpolicies.
PROURB's damcomponent requiredthe resettlemento f 1,374 families displacedbythe
encroachingreservoir, a relatively smallnumbergiven the sparse population o fthe
extensiveareas flooded. Ofthese, 420 families werere-housedin13 specially built
`agrovilas', 531were movedto higher locationswithintheir partiallyaffected farms, and
393 choseto moveto anew locality altogether. Allwere consulted about the necessary
moves andallwere compensatedincompliance withBank safeguards, resulting ina total

expenditure o fUS$17 million financed bythe state. Longerprocessingandhigher costs
were incurred thananticipated, however, contributing to implementation delays. But
PROURB managementofresettlementimprovedduringimplementation, beingmost
effectively handledinthe Jeritnumdam case. Residentsresettledinthe agrovila o fItauna
toldthe IEGmission that they hadbeenconsulted andadequately compensated.
PROURBpaidcareful attentionto environmental safeguardstoo. All completed dam
projects andconstructionwere approvedbythe State environmental authorities in
SEMACE (the StateEnvironment Superintendency). Infact, five dams originally planned
that didnot meet environmental safeguardswere notbuiltat all. SEMACE's
superintendent assuredthe IEGmissionthat the completed dams andreservoirsposedno
environmental threat. While there was considerablepublic protest against the flooding
causedbydams inCearh, it was mainlydirected at the muchlarger Castanhiio apde built
bythe federal DNOCS outsidethe PROURBproject.


4. SomeImprovements to a Weak Base-ProjectResults

STRONGERMUNICIPALITIES C E A a IN

4.1     Throughtheir direct participation ininvestmentso fPROURB's urban
components, 49 municipalities learned how to handlecompetitive procurement, manyfor
the first time. The experiencealso ledthemto tightentheir accounting andreporting
procedures. Inaddition, 44 municipalities receiveddirect technical assistancethrough the
project that aimedat improvingrevenuecollection, rationalizing spendingfor better
financial management. The ICRreportedthat the 27 bestperformingmunicipalities
assistedbyPROURBincreasedtheir ownrevenuesby 449 percent over the 1994-2001
period, higher thanthe 342 percent growthreported for sevencontrol municipalities
chosenfor comparison. IEGwouldhavebeenwilling to use these results as evidencehad
the representativenesso f the 27 experimental and7 controlmunicipalities been fully
explainedandhadat-test result demonstratingthe statistical significance ofthe
difference o fmeans beenreported. Other evidence, however, does point to apositive
trendofmunicipal finance as awhole inCearh. Totalrevenuefor allmunicipalities inthe
staterose fiom R$2.9 billionin2001 to R$3.9 billionin2003, growing faster than state
andfederal transfers over the sameperiod.

4.2     Despite this improvement, the financial baseandmanagementcapability o flocal
municipalities still needs strengthening.The IEGmissionobservedcontinuing
weaknesses inmunicipalities itvisited. Inthe municipalities o f Quixadh, Quixeramobim
andMaracanad, allhostingPROURB urbaninvestments, localpropertytax collection has
fallen inrecent years. InQuixadh, 40 percento fthe tax due hadnot beenpaid. PROURB
technical assistanceincomputerized accounting methods hadobviously not improvedtax
performance. InQuixeramobim, 80 percento f localtaxpayers are not up to datewith
their property tax payments.Maracanad, although amuchwealthier city, informedthe
IEGmissionofa similarrateofdelinquency. PROURBtechnical assistanceaerial

 4.3       PROURBhelpedstrengthenCearB'swater resourceagencies, some o fwhich
 were barelyoperational at the time o fproject appraisal. SRH, for instance, didnot even
 qualifl for a leadroleinthe project at that time. Later, it assumedfull responsibility for
 the implementationofthe water resourcecomponents.Thus, the groundwork for SRH
 was laidbefore the Pilot-PROGERIRH project. At the time ofthe IEGvisit, SRHwas
 fullyoperational.

 4.4       COGERH, too, grew significantly under PROURB. Itnow has a staffo f420, and
 i s currently responsiblefor the oversight andmanagemento f 64 dams andreservoirs
 (agudes) throughout the state o f Cearh, 16o fwhich were builtunder PROURB. Evenso,
 COGERH is stillthejunior partner inwater resources inthe state. The federal DNOCS'
 remit is much larger, owning andmanaging59 dams that hold 80 percent o fthe CearB's
 water, including the largest Castanhzo. DNOCS' facilities together store 14.1billion
 cubic meterso fwater, against COGERH's storage of0.9 billioncubic meters.
 Nevertheless, COGERHwas fully consolidatedprior to the Pilot-PROGERIRH project.

 4.5       Since 1996, however, COGERHhasbeenresponsiblefor the bulk supply o fwater
 for the metropolitanregiono fFortaleza, the sourceo f 90 percent o fits revenuesand
 demand. In2004,91 percentofCOGERH's annualproductionof305 millioncubic
 metersofbulkwater is soldto CAGECE, the water supply operator for Fortaleza and
most other cities inCearB.' For CAGECE, COGERHis the principal supplier. The direct
 dealingbetweenthesetwo agencies accountsfor nearlyallthe `market' for bulkwater
that PROURBhopedto develop inCearB. Infact, the periodic priceandsupply
 agreements are the outcome o fbilateral negotiations betweenamonopolybuyer and
 seller-not    acompetitive market. In2004, COGERHreceivedR$O.O5/m3 for bulkurban
water andR$O.O1/m3 for irrigationwater, givingthe company a clear incentive to
concentrateuponthe urbanwater side o fitsbusiness. This explains why only 2.5 percent
o fthe volume ofCOGERH's productionwas destinedto irrigation, accordingto its 2004
annualreport figures. Withthe demandfor urbanwater rising, COGERH's ownrevenues
haverisen inrecentyears, enablingthe agencyto report a smallprofit in2004, after
severalyears o flosses. Whether COGERH anditswater resourcemanagementmodel
represent amodel for Brazil, as the IEGmission was fi-equentlytold, still hasto standthe
test o ftime. At this writing, no other state inBrazilhas adopted a similar approachto
Cearh's    .
4.6       PROURB investment indamshelpedbuildupthe State Superintendency ofWater
Works SOHIDRA. SOHIDRA handleditswork program effectively, andmajor works
were completed, albeit with delays. On finishingthe works, SOHIDRA hands over the
inflastructure to COGERH. SOHIDRAstaffinformedthat project works ondamswere
relatively straightforwardwith readilyavailable materials andlabor andwere well

the agency's annualreport.

a result representsa significant institutional development ina statewithnearlya century
o f experienceinbuildingandoperating dams andreservoirs mustbeopen to question,
however. Priorto SOHIDRA andSRH, capability for executing suchworks inCearb
existed inthe state Secretariato fPublic Works.

4.7     The state water andsanitation company, CAGECEwas cast as anurban
executing agency under PROURB, reporting as it does to the state's urbandevelopment
authorities. Thanks to its extensiveprogram ofinstalling water meters, supportedby
PROURB, CAGECE significantly loweredunaccountedfor water from 44.3 percent o f
the total in 1994to 26.7 percentin2003. The ICBprocurement o fthe water meters was
an important learningexperience for CAGECE. Evidentlywith the development o f
CAGERH, CAGECEhasretreatedfrom bulk water production, concentrating almost
exclusively uponwater distribution to consumersinurbanareas. Today CAGECE
supplies 5.7 millionpeople (up fiom 2.4 millionin1993) in81percent ofCearb's
municipalities, including the metropolitanregion o fthe capital Fortaleza. Ithadclose to

BETTERLMNGCONDITIONSFORTHEURBAN POOR

4.8     Cearbstate-wide datademonstrateimprovements inurbanlivingconditions
duringthe 1997-2003periodinwhichthe PROURBproject was implemented; despite
the income indicators cited earlier that pointto increasedpoverty over the sameperiod.
Duringthis time, the share ofurbanhouseholdsservedbymainswater rosefiom 74.3
percent to 87.0 percent, while those connectedto a seweragesystemrose from 41.1
percent o fthe total to 53.6 percent. Typically lacking these services, low income
householdswere the mainbeneficiaries oftheseimprovements. PROURBitself
contributed to this result, especially through the upgradingcomponentthat improved 89
low income areas in49 municipalities, includingwater andsanitation service extensions.
Usingthe ICR's estimatethat this benefited 100,000 people, wouldmeanthat the
PROURB effort accountedfor about 10percent o fthe overall improvement reportedfor
the state duringthis period.

4.9     Fieldvisits bythe IEGmissionto severalparts o fthe statebrought out evidence
o fthe improvements reported. Intwo cities inCeari's poor CentralSertcoregion,
Quixadb andQuixeramobim, the missioncouldobserve considerableimprovements to
low-income areas resulting from the PROURB interventions. Inbothtowns, precarious
informal settlements with people livinginshacks hadbeentransformed into consolidated
neighborhoods, withbasic infrastructure andcommunity services. Intwo cases in
Quixeramobim, residentsneverthelesscomplained to the IEGmission about the
unreliable water supply that often left taps dry inthe afternoonsespecially, something
that the localauthorities were reluctant to recognize, eventhough their officials heardthe
complaints together withthe IEGmission. Community centersandhealthpostsprovided
andoperatedbythe respectivemunicipalitieswere infull operation andstaffedby
medicalpersonnelonthe dayo fthe IEGvisit; normalactivity accordingto users
questionedbythe IEGmission. The SAR estimatesthat the ERRfrom these investments
wouldbe 14percent. Hadthe ICRre-estimatedthe ERRat completion-auseful input

                                               9


 into the evaluation-it  would likelyhavebeenhigh, ifdemandfor these urban
 improvements was as buoyant as itwas inthe cities visitedbyIEG.

 4.10   Localand state oficials mademucho fthe selfhelp or rnutiriio approachto these
improvements andits contribution to a feeling o fownership ofthe project improvements
bythe beneficiaries. WhenaskedbyIEG,thesebeneficiaries confirmed their intensive
involvement inthe works. They generally expressedtheir satisfactionwith the results
obtained andthe professionaltrainingthat they hadgleanedfiom the building
 experiences. Particularlynotablewas the largeparticipation bywomen inthese local
works. Fromthe point o fview o fthe authorities, mutirio hadthe advantageo fbeing
lower cost, although the same authorities recognizedthat implementationwas inevitably
 slower when more community memberswere involved. The SDLR's enthusiasmfor
mutirio transpirednot only fiom their repeatedreferencesto it duringthe IEGmission,
butalso fiomtheir (incorrectiy) citingthe achievement ofcommunity participation as
itself an explicit objective o fthe P R O W project, which itwas not. Community
participationwas keyto PROURB %urban        upgrading,butitwas aninstrument for helping
achievethe project objective o fimprovedlivingconditions for the urbanpoor, andnot as
anendinitself. The same canbe saidabout "recovering localpride" also elevatedto
become aproject `objective" inthe eyes o f SDLR.

4.11 Finally, underbetter livingconditions for the urbanpoor, it isworth recordingthe
experienceofthe smalltowno fBarroquinho(pop. 14,000 65 percent urban), and
                                                             -
beneficiaryo fthe ItahadambuiltbyPROURB inthe north-west o fthe state. The local
mayor andher team told the IEGmission that the PROURB investment hadgiventhe
town anew lease o flife. Populationdecline hadbeenreversedandcholera, that hadonce
plaguedpoor areas o fthe city, was no longer aproblem. The placehadbecome
`emancipated' as anewmunicipality, where morethan70 percent o fthe taxpayers are up
to datewith their propertytax dues, the highest rate observedbythe IEGmission.

MOREEFFICIENT WATERUSEINCEARA

4.12    PROURB helpedmakewater use significantly more efficient through the
installationo f 176,000 water meters byCAGECE, exceedingthe appraisal target of
116,000. Inaddition, the Inter-American DevelopmentBank (IDB)financed another
300,000. Water meter coverage inCearProse from 18.7 percent to 80.5 percent over the
1994-2003 period. This helped CAGECE's reduceunaccounted-for water sharply, as
alreadymentioned. PROURB's contribution to this was aninvestment o fUS$4.8 million
through its urban infrastructure component.

4.13    Evidence that PROURB's muchlargerinvestment-US$110.4            million-in   water
resourceinfhstructure o fdams andmainwater lines madewater use more efficient is not
convincing, at least as far as the efficiency o fthe investmentsthemselves i s concerned.
While the ICRreportedanoverall 13percent economic rate o freturn (ERR) k mthese
investmentsinthe 16dams (against an appraisalERRof 17percent for 40 dams) IEG's
reassessmentpoints to amuchlowerERRo f8.7 percent. The lower estimateresults fiom
accounting for all costs reportedinthe ICRcost tables, as well as includingthose
resultingfiom thenecessaryinvestments inurbanwater distributionnot consideredby
the ICRestimate(details inAnnex A). For IEGan ERRsignificantly below the

                                                  10


  opportunity cost o f capital is aninputinto anunsatisfactory outcome. Forratingthe
  project outcome as awhole, however, IEG's considersPROURB's other stronger
  outcomes-notably better livingconditions for the urbanpoor-that               help lift the overall
  project rating into thepositive, satisfactoryrange.

  4.14    Itis likelythat the majorityofthe 16PROURB dams didnot meetthe 12percent
  ERRminimumthat PROURBrequiredofeachone(PROURB SARpara. 7.5j.O
  Extracting the bestperformingone, `Sitios Novos' with 29 percent ERR, leavesthe
  remaining15damswithanaverage6.3 percentERRonly, mosttherefore unlikelyto
  meet PROURB's ownminimumrequirement o fefficiency (details Tables A.3a andA.3b
  inAnnex A,). SitiosNovos' outstandingperformancecomes, asborrower commentson
  this report point out, fiom its supplyingwater to the new Pec6mport andindustrial
  complex near Fortalezathat alone accounts for 77 percent o fthe total incrementalwater
  consumptionresultingfiom PROURB. The other 15 dams, locatedinthe state's sparsely

. populatedinterior (as PROURB intended), couldnotmatch such aperformance. But
  PROURB's initial design didrequire andpromise, appropriately given the highcosts
  involved, a good individualpdormanceby eachandevery dam. For not reportingdam-
  level results, the ICR couldnot confirmthis, a significant shortcominginthe self-
  assessment o f aproject seekinggreater efficiency ofwater use through all o fitswater
  resource investments.

  4.15    IEGconcernsaboutthe efficiency o ftheseinvestmentsarosefiom itsreview of
  the cost-benefit analysis reportedinthe ICR. IEGfound that raisingthe ICR cost
  benefit's component cost o fUS$62.3 millionto bringit inlinewith reportedICRcosts of
  US$110.4 million, andfactoring inthe investment costs o fwater distribution to the final
  urbanbeneficiaries-not includedinthe ICRcostbenefit estimates-lowers the overall
  project ERRtojust 8.7 percent (Annex A. Table A.4), belowthe opportunity cost o f
  capital.

  4.16     A meaningfblassessment ofthe efficiency o fthese daminvestmentsdepends
  upondatathat accurately reflects the scale andoperationso fthe localwater supplysector
  andthe market for water inthe cities ofCearh. Thisis especially important for a
  componentthat supposedlyreceivedmorethantwo thirds o fitsbenefits fiom incremental
  urbanwater con~umption.~Suchinvestments as these cannotbejustified onbasisofthe
  consumption o fbulkwater alone. Evenifas muchas halfCOGERH's R$19.1 million
  bulkwater sales in2004 couldbeattributedto PROURB-an                    unlikelyprospect since
  most COGERHrevenuecomes fiom sales to Fortaleza-the resultingbenefits wouldbe
  less thanthe project costs, yielding no net benefit andno calculable ERRat all.

  4.17     According to the ICRERR, 28 percentofthe net benefits o fthe 16dams came
  fiom irrigated agriculture. Forthis to happen, there wouldhavebeensomeUS$50million


    The heavydependenceofthe P R O W project'sperformanceuponthe sale ofwater for industrialuse
  was not foreseenat appraisal, andrepresentsa major shift ofthe projectfocus away fiom improvingthe
  livingconditions ofthe poor andprovidingthemwithreliableandsafe water, which were keyproject
  objectives.

  suchprojects. (Margulis 2002 p.16).

 withanannualyieldworthUS$16millionby2006 andgrowing thereafter. Rather than
 usingdatafkomprojections for the Fa6dam-implemented after PROURBunder the
 PROGERlRHproject-the            ICRERRshouldhavepresenteddata on actual investments
 made, actual areairrigated andactualincreasedyields using the latest data available to
 the cost benefit analyst. While projections are unavoidable at the appraisal stage, ex-post
 ERRestimatesshouldbaseduponempirical dataofthe project experienceupto the time
 o fthe analysis. Experienceinirrigated semi-arid zones outside the PROURBproject in
 the Lower JaguaribeRivervalley inthe east o fthe state found that local (subsistence)
 farmers didnot increaseproductivity onthe necessaryscale, andwere not adept at
 shiftingto higher value-addedproduction suchas exotic h i t s for export, for example.
 The same study also found that a viable landmarket, that could have facilitated the fair
 resaleo ff m s from subsistencefanners to moreproductive users, didnot exist (Valdes
 et al. 2004). Moreempirical evidenceis neededto demonstratethe actual economic costs
 andbenefits o ftheirrigationexperienceso fPROURB.

 4.18    IEG's concernsabout possible inefficiency o fPROURBwater resource
 investmentsfirst arose fkom IEG's mission fieldvisit to the Itahadaminthe north-west
 o fthe state. Completed in2000 at a cost o fUS$3.8 million', this damledto formation of
 areservoir covering 1,800 hectaresthat could store upto 77.5 millioncubic meterso f
 water. Itwas inaremote location with sparseurbanandruralpopulations and
 consequentlylimiteddemandfor water resources. Since only 17.800urbandwellers live
near this reservoif, revenues fkom the sale o fwater for urbanuse couldnot, by
themselves, generateapositive net benefit stream, so that agricultural benefits would be
most important. Onits site visit there, the IEGmissionwas able to verify the very small
scaleo fwater taken fkom the reservoir for urbanuse. Thus, thejustificationo fthe dam
relieduponbuoyant agriculturalproduction o fUS$5-6 millionperannum, or about
US$3,250per eacho fthe 1,700 rural (mostly subsistence) households livinginthis area.
Butthe IEGmissiondidnotfindevidenceo fthereportedUS$2.5millioninvestmentin
irrigation infkastructurefor 950hectares necessaryto generatethesebenefits. Again, the
empirical evidenceis thin.

4.19     Insummary, PROURB's waterresourceinfkastructureinvestments didnotappear
to yieldthe hopedfor benefits. More attention needsto begiven inCearhandbythe
Bankto rigorous assessmentso fthe efficiency o fthesekindso fprojects. Animportant
step too wouldbeto encourageamore thoroughunderstandingo fthe demand for these
investmentsandthe methods (with good quality data) for evaluating their performance.
Inthe caseofPROURB, the relevant costbenefit analyseswere notreadilyavailable to
the project team inSRH, is thus unlikelyto havebenefited fromthe self-evaluation
experience. IEGandSRHhadto makeconsiderable efforts duringthe missionto

RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE       AND SAFEWATER FORTHEURBAN POOR

4.20    This was largely achievedthrough PROURB's urbanupgrading components, but
there were some shortcomings. Du'singfield visits to the Mutirtlo Boqueirtloupgraded
site inQuixeramobim, the IEGmissionheardcomplaints from residentsabout frequent
interruptions to their water supply, as mentionedearlier. Low-income residentsdid
codinnthat their water bills were affordable. Havingheardassurancesfrom CAGECE
about the highquality o fwater inthe state andhearingno reports o f any sickness arising
fiom contamination o fanykind, IEGhasno reasonto doubt that water supply through
PROURB was safe. Curiously, the IEGmissionalso found anotherunreliable water
supply whenit visited the agrovila o fthe Itahadam. Residentstold IEGthat theyhad
beenwithout water for five days. SRH engineersaccompanyingthe IEGmission soon
found the cause; the poor installation o fthe mainwater pipe that hadblocked the flow,
that they promised fix expeditiously. Nevertheless, it is indeedironic that there shouldbe
a shortageo fwater next to one o fthe largestaqudes financed byPROURB. Furthennore,
spokesmenfor the community toldthe IEGmissionthat they wantedmuchmorewater,
to allow themto raise largeherdso fcattle, anunlikelyprospectinsuch an aridarea as
this. With proposals like this, SRHcando more to inform final users about the
constraints ina semi-arid region as this, to ensurethat water is usedefficiently as
PROURB intended.

COMENT~OSDO GOVERNO DOESTADO DO CEARA SOBRE o
RELATdRIODEAVALIACAODOSRESULTADOSDOPROJETO PPAR                           -
PARA0 PROURB(Loan3789-BR) e PROGERIRH-PILOT0(Loan4190-BR)


1. 0 Estado do Cearh congratula-se com a iniciativa do Banco Mundial, por
intemddio do EG, em proceder avaliaGbes dos programas e atividades financiadas
pel0 Banco, atrav6s de m6todos que oferecem rigor e que s k devidamente flexlveis
para se adaptarem ao instrumento de emprkstimo, tipo de projeto ou abordagem
setorial.

2. Entende o Estado do Cearh que avaliagbes isentas proporcionam informq5es
preciosas para os dirigentes phblicos responshveis pelos projetos e pelas pollticas
phblicas, proporcionando elementos que podem fundamentar novas tomadas de
decisbes.

3. Para garantir a consecuqilo do PPAR, o Estado do Cearh concedeu o necesshrio
apoio logistico e acompanhoua missilo do IEG, que visitou o Estado, em novembro
de 2005, com o objetivo de avaliar osprojetos PROURB e PROGERTRH-PILOTO.

4. 0 Estado do Cearh concorda com o m6todo preconizado pel0 Banco que "busca
garantir uniformidade e homogeneidadenas avaliq6es". No entanto, considera que o
PPAR cometeu alguns equlvocos de interpretqilo ou utilizou infonnqbes
incompletas, quenecessitamser esclarecidos.



I.SOBRE0PROURB


5. No entendimento do Govern0 do Cearh, o PROURB foi um projeto que
proporcionou grande ContribuiGilo para mitigar a pobreza urbana e iniciar a
estruturqk de uma rede de cidades no interior do Estado, para racionalizar o
aproveitamento e ampliar a oferta de hgua, que 6 umrecurso escasso e de importiincia
bhicaparao bemestar dapopula@io      e para o desenvolvimento econ6mico. 0Projeto
representa um marc0 hist6rico no Cearh para o planejamento urban0 e para a gestilo
de recursos hidricos. 0 sistema estadualde gestilo de recursos hidricos, fundamental
para convivhcia com a irregularidade do regime de chuvas no semi-hrido, teve sua
implanta@io  iniciada pel0 PROURB e vem sendo complementadae aperfeigoada com
o apoio do PROGERTRH.

As Classifica@esdoPPAR

6. Entende-seque algumas das classificaG6esde desempenhodo Projeto estabelecidas
no item 5 - ClassificaqBes e Ligbes, merecem algumas reflexbes que silo feitas a
seguir:
Efichcia - Apesar do relat6rio reconhecer que o PROURB conseguiu melhorar as
condiGbes de vida da populqilo urbanapobre, supri-la de hgua e reduzir as perdas de

                                                    29


hgua, utiliza um chlculo de retorno econ6mico para considerar a efichcia apenas
Modesta. A utilizqiio do retorno econ6mico para reduzir essa classificaqb nao
parece ser coerente. Isto tambh parece nil0 estar de acordo com o sistema de
classificqb do IEG, descrito napagina `5"do relathrio, onde diz "EtlcBc\a: At6 onde os
objetivos do pmjeto foram atingidos ou deverSo ser atingldos, levando em conta sua importancia reiativa.
fossiveis c/assifca@es:Alta, Substanclal,Modesta, Insignificante".Assh, em h q 8 0 dos objetivos
do Projeto terem sido alcanqados, o Estado continua considerandoque a classificqao
do ICR (SUBSTANCIAL) 6mais adequada.
EficiCncia    - A efici8ncia teve seu conceito considerado Modesto em hgsLo de um
valor menor da taxa econ6mica de retorno (ERR) encontrada atraves de chlculos
reformulados         pel0 IEG. Entendemos que para alterar os chlculos de retorno
econ6mico apresentados no ICR, seriam necesshios maiores estudos e levantamento
de dados sobreos beneficios do Projetog.
Impact0 sobre o Desenvolvimento Institucional Embora o PPAR afirme que os
                                                                 -
6rgiios urbanos, inclusive a l p s municipios, tenham comeqado a usar os recursos
com mais eficihcia, consideraque esses ganhos foram superadospel0 us0 ineficiente
dos recursos do lado dos recursoshidricos do projeto, combasenataxa econ6micade
retorno (ERR) recalculada pel0 IEG. 0 pr6prio relat6rio reconhece grandes avanqos
das instituiqaes de recursos hidrico e prefeituras no planejamento e gestao de seus
setores. Assim, o conceito considerado pel0 PPAR nao se apresenta como pertinente
com o crit6rio de avaliaqb estabelecido na phgina `Y do Relat6rio "/mpacfo sobre o
DesenvohrimentoInstitutional: At6 ondede pmjeto melhoraa capacidade de urn pals ou regia0de fazer

previstos e imprevistos de um projeto. fossiveis classif7capSe.s:Alta, Substancial, Modesta, Insignificante".
E sempre importante ressaltarque o sistemade gestiio de recursos hidricos do Ceari
foi implantado pel0 PROURB,se tornou refer8ncia nacional e internacional e tem sido
considerado um case de grande avanqo institucional no setor de recursos hidricos do
Brasil.       Desta forma, o Estado considera que a classificqiio do ICR
(SUBSTANCIAL) 6 mais adequada aos avanqos institucionais proporcionados pel0
Projeto.
Resultado -Diante do exposto nos itens acima e pelos conceitos obtidos nos demais
itens, a classificaqb do resultado geral necessita ser reavaliada, podendo ser
considerado SATISFAT6RIO. Ressalta-se que essa opinizLo 6 reforqada pel0 pr6prio
Relat6rio do IEG, que em muitos trechos ressalta os bons resultados da implantqEio
do Projeto (ex: Item "3.1 0 PROW. foi implementado com sucesso, muito embora tenha
enfrentado desafios em cada momento ...").

finalidade.

8. Reconhece tambhn que ainda hb muito o que ser feito nas Areas do
desenvolvimento urban0 e de recursos hidricos, mas deve ser enaltecido que o

Comenthrios em Rela@o ao Item 1- Condiq8es Adversas para o Desenvolvimento
do Cearb-Antecedentes

9. No Item 1.1o relat6rio trata das condig8es de pobreza e seca no Cearb e conclui
que hb uma tendhcia de agravamento ocorrida entre 1997 e o momento atual, com
base em 2 indicadores estatisticos a saber, PIB per Capita e Renda Familiar.
Esclarece-se que os indicadores de renda da popula@o sofieram distorG6es pel0
lanpmento do plan0 de ajuste econ6mico feito no Brasil em 1994 (Plan0 Real). A
utilizaq5o das estatisticas dos anos anteriores a 1994, a l h de solucionar esse
problema, permite comparar indicadores em momentos anteriores e posteriores a
implantaqiio do Projeto. Tomando-se os anos de 1992 e 2004 para a l p s indicadores,
os resultados sgo diferentes daqueles apresentados no relathio, conforme pode ser
observadosa seguir.

Comenthrios em RelaqBo ao Item 4 - Algumas Melhorias numa Base Fraca -
Resultadosdos Projetos

10  -Em   relaqgo a0 exposto no item 4.4 (tamb6m retratado no item 1.4), quando se
refere que a gerhcia de 80% da bgua do Ceard 6 feita pel0 DNOCS, cabendo 2i
COGERH somente 20% ,esclarece-se que o Estado, atrav6s da SRH e da COGERH,
organiza e coordena a gestgo da totalidade dos recursos hidricos do estado, incluindo
ai toda dgua armazenada nos qudes administrados pel0 DNOCS. N b h& nas
compethcias e atribuic8es do DNOCS, o exercicio da totalidade das h c 8 e s de
gerenciamento de recursos hldricos. restringindo-se sua acgo h operacb fisica e
manutencb das infia-estruturas. Um convhio h a d o entre a COGERH e DNOCS
estabelece a parceria entre as instituiqaes para a gestb dos recursos hidricos
armazenadosnos reservat6rios federais. Assim, a COGERH exerce o monitoramento
destes apdes, efetuando a alocagb da bgua conforme decis5o dos comites de bacias
e das comiss8es de usuhrios. Logo, 2i COGERH e a Secretariade Recursos Hidricos
do Estado do Cearh, sob a 6gide do Conselho Estadual de RecursosHidricos e com a

                                               31


participaqao dos comitgs de bacia, cabem o exercicio das fimq8es de planejamento,
administraqilo e regulamentqh
A fonnaqao dos comitgs de bacias, o suporte a atuaqilo desses comitgs, bemcomo a
realizqgo dos estudos de apoio e manutenqao do sistema de informaqges sZio q8es
do Estado efetuadas atravks da COGERH e da SRH, com o apoio da FUNCEME
(Fundagao Cearense de Meteorologia). Ressalta-se, contudo, que o DNOCS, mesmo
atuando mais diretamente em obras e administraqi%odos aqudes, 6 um parceiro
importante no sistemade gestk.

 11. No item4.5 do PPARfoi mencionado que "A dependincia que a COGERHtem da iigua
urbana aumentou quando elaperdeu seus clientes industriais em 1998." Esclarecemos que isto
                                                                    .
foi um equlvoco da interpretaqao das infonnaq8es recebidas. Em 1998 a CAGECE
repassoupara a COGERH os clientes industriais. Atualmente, os clientes industriais
respondempor 53,4% do faturamentoda COGERH.

12. No item 4.5 do PPAR foi mencionado ainda que "Sea COGERHcom seu modelo de
gestc?o de recursos hidricos representa um modelo para o Brasil, como foi ffeqilentemente dit0 ci
miss60 do IEG, ela ainda precisa passar no teste do tempo. Neste momento, nenhum outro Estado
brasileiro adotou um sistema similar ao do Cearii." Neste sentido, 0 Estado do Ceah, de
fato, tem se preocupado em validar o modelo institucional definido          para a politica de
recursos hidricos e isto tem sido objeto de inconthveis discussges nos mais variados
f 6 m s em todo o Brasil e o Modelo adotado pel0 Cearh tem sido fiequentemente
citado como referbcia na gestao de recursos hidricos. Por outro lado, poucos
modelos form, de fato, implementados no pds. Destes, podemos verificar, que
Estados como Silo Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Bahia ou Rio Grande do
Norte, que se encontram num esthgio pr6ximo ao do Cearh, nao alcanqaram a
sustentabilidade financeira da gestao dos recursos hidricos. Vale ressaltar que a
COGERH C considerada a primeira e, at6 este momento, h i c o 6rgb gestor de hgua
do Brasil, com autonomia financeira, ensejando, atravb da cobranqa pela oferta
hidrica, a sustentabilidadeoperacional da Sa-estrutura hidrhulica e o gerenciamento
integrado,descentralizadoeparticipativo dos mananciais.

13. No item 4.6 do PPAR, a0 tratar da questgo inerente ao desenvolvimento
institucional do 6rgao estadual responshvel pela implantqtio das infia-estruturas
hidricas, em especial as barragens, questiona-se o resultado. "Todavia, se esse resultado
representa um desenvolvimento institucional significativo num Estado com quase um sbculo de
experiincia em construpio e operacionalizaqiiode barragens e apdes deve$car aberto aperguntas.
Antes da SOHIDRA e da SRH, quem tinha capacidadepara executar tais obras no Cearii era a
Secretaria Estadual de Obras Ptiblicas". A grande infia-estrutura hidrhulica do Estado foi
concebida e implantada, a0 longo de mais de 80 anos (1906 - 1992) pel0 Governo
Federal. Com a criqtio da SRH e da SOHIDRA, em 1987, o Governo do Estado deu
o primeiro passo no sentido de estruturar um setor de recursos hidricos corn
competkhcia para desenvolver grandes programas nesta kea. 0 Plan0 Estadual de
Recursos Hfdricos, concluido em 1991, e a instituiqao daPolfticaEstadual, atraves da
Lei 11.996 de 1992, credenciaram o Estado a obter um emprbtimo do Banco
Mundialparaaimplementqaodo PROURB-RH. Somenteapartirde 1993,dispondo
do apoio financeiro, tCcnico e institucional do Banco Mundial, atravks do PROURB,
a SRH e a SOHIDRA entraramnumprocess0de melhoria continua para desenvolver

                                         32


projetos de infka-estrutura hidrica, tais como os implantados no h b i t o daquele
programaoumesmo dentro do PROGERIRH.

14. No item 4.15 do PPAR foi descrito que no Relat6rio de Coriclusiio da
Implementa@o - ICR havia sido consideradoum consumo de 437 litros de hguapor
pessoa dia, quando na avaliaqb inicial foram considerados 150 litros por pessoadia.
0 Estado do Cearh informa que isto d o aconteceu. As informaqBes constantes
indicam que o consumo incremental anual equivalente a 41.138.362 m3, dos quais,
31S36.000 m3 referiam-se   a0 consumo do Complexo IndustrialPortuhio do Pec6me
apenas 9.602.362 m3 referem-se a0 consumo de uma populaqb incremental de
257.920 habitantes. Isto posto, o consumo considerado foi de t b somente 102 litros
de hguapor pessoapor dia.

15. Demais Aspectos sobre a Anhlise Econdmica abordados nos itens de 4.13 a 4.19.
A anhlise econdmica apresentadano ICR foi realizada namesmabase metodol6gica
do SAR, acordadaentre o Banco e o Estadonaocasiilo. Essametodologia niio incluiu
alguns custos citados, bem como outros beneficios dos investimentos hidricos, tais
como a reduqb dos gastos corn abastecimento de hgua altemativo (cano-pipa),
custos evitados com a redugh da migraqiio, custos evitado com sa~deetc. Assim
sendo, o Estado considera que qualquer alteraqiio na anhlise econdmica apresentada
no ICRdeveria ser feita de forma mais completa, incluindo o levantamento de dados
empiricos bemcomo a agrega@o de outros itens de custos e beneficios. Considera-se
os ajustesefetuadoscomo parciais e cornpossibilidade de estar cometendo equivocos,
de forma que n b sa0 seguros os resultados de retorno econdmico (ERR)
apresentadosno PPAR.



11.SOBRE0PROGERIRH-PILOTO

16.0 Estadodo Cearhconcorda que poderiam ter sido utilizados recursos do pr6prio
P R O W para a elaboraqiio do PROGERIRH, no entanto informaque estes recursos
estavam destinados e comprometidos com as aqbes do componente Urban0 do
PROURB.

17. Finalmente, o Estado do Cearhconsidera que, se foi atingido o principal objetivo
do Projeto PROGERIRH-Piloto, o seu resultado global deveria ser classificado como
satisfatbrioe niio como moderadamente satisfatbrio.

         COMMENTS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF C E a ON
THEPROJECTPERFORMANCEASSESSMENTREPORT PPAR FORPROURB                          -           -
(Loan3789-BR) andPROGERIRH-PILOTO(Loan 4190-BR).


         1.        The State o f Cearb derives great satisfaction from the initiative takenby the
World Bank,through the IEG FdependentEvaluation Group], to evaluate the programs and
activities financed by the Bank, using methods that are sound and appropriately flexible for
adaptingto type o floan, type o fproject, or sectoralapproach.
         2.        The State o f Cearb believes that impartial evaluations provide information
that is extremely valuable to the public sector leaders who areresponsible for the projects and
for public policies, by furnishing elements that can be used as the basis for further decision
making.
         3.        To ensure that the PPAR was completed, the State o f Cearb made available
the neededlogistical support andaccompanied the IEGmissionduringits visit to the state in
November 2005. The purpose o fthe visit was to appraise the P R O W [urban Development
and Water Resources Management Project] and PROGERIRH-PILOTO [ C e d Integrated
Water ResourcesManagement PilotProject] projects.
         4.        The State o f Cearb agrees with the method advocated by the Bank, which
"attempts to ensure uniformity and homogeneity in the evaluations." However, it believes
that the PPAR made some mistakes in interpretation, or used incomplete data, things that
needto be clarified.


         I ABOUTPROURB
         5.        In the opinion of the Government of Cab, PROURB made a major
contribution to the mitigation o f urban poverty and the initial structuring o f a network o f
cities inthe interior o f the state to rationalize water use and increase the supply. Water is a
scarceresourcethat i s vital to the well-being o fthe population andto economic development.
The Project represented an historical landmark in urban planning and water resources
management inC e d . PROURBlaunched a statewater managementsystem, a systemthat is
essentialifwe are to live with the irregularity o frainfall inthis semi-arid region. Itswork has
been supplemented and perfected with the support o f [the later on-going] PROGERIRH
[project (Loan 453l), evaluated bythis PPAR].
                         not


         ThePPARRatings
item 5 -6.Ratings andLessonsLearned, deserve some comments, as follows:
                   We believe that some o f the ratings o f Project performance established in

         Efficacv           Although the report acknowledges that PROURB succeeded in
improving the living conditions o f the poor urban population by supplying it with water and
reducing water loss, it uses a calculation o f economic return to rate the efficacy as only
Modest. The use o f the economic returnto lower that rating does not seemto be coherent. It
also doesnot seemto be inaccord withthe IEGratingsystem, as described onpage "i"o fthe
report, whichreads: `%fuaq: The extent to which aproject's objectives were achieved, or expectedto be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
And so, interms ofthe project objectiveshavingbeenachieved, the Statecontinues tobelieve
that the ICR [Implementation Completion Report] rating o f (SUBSTANTIAL) is more
appropriate.

           Efficiencv:         The rating for efficiency was Modest because a lower value o f the
 economic rate o f return (ERR) was found when the calculations reformulated by IEG were
 used. We believe that in order to change the economic return calculations presented in the
 ICR, further studyandagathering ofdataonthebenefits ofthe Project isnecessary."
           Institutional DeveloDmentImDact Although the PPAR statesthat urbanagencies,
                                                      -
 including some municipalities, have begun to use the resources more efficiently, it finds that
 those gains were cancelled out by the inefficient use o f resources fiom the water resources
 side o fthe project, basedonthe economic rate ofreturnrecalculatedbyIEG.The reportitself
 acknowledges that significant progress was made by the water resources institutions andcity
 governments inplanningandmanagingtheir sectors. And so the definition usedby the PPAR
 does not seem to pertain to the evaluation criterion established in page `5`' o f the Report:
 "Znstitutional DevdopmerrtImpact: The extentto which aproject improvesthe ability of a country or regionto
 make moreefficient,equitableand sustainableuseofitshuman, financial, andnaturalresourcesthrough: (a) better
definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, dpredictabilityofinstitutional`arrangements andor @) better
 alignment ofthe mission and capacity of an organizationwith itsmandate, which derives from these institutional
 arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a project.
Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible" It is always important to emphasize that
Ceark's water resources management system was installed by PROURB, has become a
national andinternational standardo freference, andhasbeen considered an instance o fmajor
institutionalprogress inBrazil's water resources sector. Therefore, the state believes that the
ICR rating (SUBSTANTIAL) is more appropriate, given the institutional progress made
,possibleby the Project.
           Results - In light o f the foregoing, and based on the ratings obtained on the other
items, the rating o f the overall results needs to be reassessed, and can be considered as
SATISFACTORY. We emphasize that this opinion is bolstered by the IEG's report itself,
which in many passages points to the good results o f the implantation o f the Project. For
example: "3.1 PROURBwas successfullyimplemented,eventhough itfacedchallengesateveryturn...").

Objective - Sustainability - Bank Performance - and Borrower Performance. However, it
          The State believes that the grades given the following items are consistent -

a f f m its interest andcommitment to continue working andreceiving assistance to improve
its ownperformance.
          7.         We emphasize that the State acknowledges the need to do a better job o f
monitoringand evaluating the economic efficiency o fwater resourceinvestments. Itwill seek
the assistance o f the Bank inthe development o f a methodology and system to achieve that
purpose.
          8.         The state also acknowledges that much remains to be done inthe fields of
urbandevelopment andwater resources,butitisthe fact thatPROURBmarks abigchangein
the effort bythe State inthose two sectorsthat should be lauded.


          Comments on Item 1- Ceard'sAdverse Conditionsfor Development- Background
          9.         Under Item 1.1, the report discusses poverty and drought in C e d and
concludes that the situation has worsened between 1997 andthe present. Itbases this finding
on two statistical indicators: per capita GDP and family income. We should explain that the
income indicators for the population as a whole were distorted by the launching o f the
economic adjustment plan in Brazil in 1994 (The Red Plan). Use o f statistics from years

priorto 1994would not only solve that problem, butmake itpossible to compare indicators
for years prior to and after the implantation o f the Project. Using 1992 and 2004 for certain
indicators, the results are differentthanthose presentedinthe report, as can be seen from the
following table:

           Comments onItem 4        -SomeImprovements            to a WeakBase -Project Results
           10.      Withrespect to the findings initem4.4 (also portrayed initem 1.4), when it
is saidthat 80 percent o fthe water inC e dis managedbythe DNOCS [National Department
for Anti-Drought Projects], and that the COGERH [Cearh Water Resources Management
Company] manages only 20 percent, we should explain that the State, working through the
SRH [Secretariat for Water Resources] and the COGERH, organizes and coordinates
management o f the entirety o f the state's water resources, including all the water stored in
reservoirs that are administered by the DNOCS. The authority and duties assigned to the
DNOCS do not include the exercise o f all managerial functions relating to water resources.
Its action is restricted to the uhvsical oueration and maintenance o f the infrastructures. An
agreement signed by COGERH and DNOCS establishes a partnership between these
institutions to manage the water resources that are stored in federal reservoirs. And so,
COGERH handles the management o f these reservoirs and allocates the water according to
decisions by the basin committees anduser committees. COGERHandthe Water Resources
Secretariat of the State o f Cearh, under the aegis o f the State Water Resources Council and
with participation by the basin committees, are tasked with planning, administration, and
regulation.
           The formation o f the basin committees and support o f their activities, as well as the
conduct o f studies to support and maintainthe data system, are actions taken by the State
through the COGERH andthe SRH, with assistance from m M C E M E (Cearh Meteorological
Foundation). We stress, however, that the DNOCS, even when it acts more directly on
construction projects andreservoir administration, is an important partner inthe management
system.
           11.      Underitem4.5 ofthe PPAR, itwas saidthat "TheCOGERH'sdependenceonurban
water increased when it lost its industrial customers in 1998." This was a misinterpretation o f the
informationreceived. In1998, the CAGECE [Cearii Water and Sewer Company] passedthe
industrial customers on to COGERH. Industrial customers are now responsible for 53.4
percent o fCOGERH's sales.
           12.      Under item4.5 o f the PPAR, it was also said that `rrftheCOGERHwith its water
resources management model represents a modelfor Brazil, as the IEG mission was often told, it hasyet topass
the test of time. Sofar, no other Brazilian state has adopted a system similar to that of Cearri." this point,
the State o f C e d has indeed been anxious to validate the institutional model that was
designedfor water resources policy, andthis has been the subject o f countless discussions in
a wide variety o f farums throughout Brazil.The model adoptedby Cearhhas frequently been

                                                       37


 mentioned as a reference in water resources management. On the other hand, very few
models have actually been implemented inBrazil. Ofthese, we would observe that that states
 like Silo Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Bahia, or Rio Grande do Norte, whose
 stage of progress in this field resembles that o f C e d , have not achieved financial
 sustainability inwater resources management. COGERH i s considered to be the first and, at
this point the only, water management agency inBrazil that is financially autonomous, This
 suggests that charging for the water supply leads to operational sustainability o f the water
infiastructure and an integrated, decentralized, and participatory management o f the water
sources.
          13.       Under item 4.6 o f the PPAR, in a discussion o f the issue inherent in the
institutional development o f the state agency that is responsible for installing basic water
infrastructures, especially dams, the results are questioned. "Still, if that result represents a
significantinstitutional development in a State that has almost a century of experience in building and operating
damsand reservoirs,then this isopentoquestion.Before that SOHIDRA [CearhHydraulicsWorks Company] and
the S W , it was the State Public Works Department that had the ability to execute these worksprojects." The
major hydraulic infrastructure inthe State was designed and installed over a period.of more
than 80 years (1906-1992) by the federal government. With the creation o f the SRH and
SOHlDU in 1987, the state government took the first step toward structuring a water
resources sector that wouldbe able to carry out major programs inthis area. The State Water
Resources Plan, completed in 1991, and the institution of state policy under Law 11,996 o f
 1992, enabled the State to obtain a loan fromthe World Bankto implement PROURB-RH. It
was not until 1993, when it had financial, technical, and institutional assistance from the
World Bank through P R O W , that the SRH and SOHIDU embarked on a process of
continuous improvement in order to carry out water infrastructure projects such as those
installedunderthat program, or even as parto f PROGERIRH.

Completion Report- ICR, the assumption was adopted that per capita water consumption i s
         14.        Under item 4.15 of the PPAR, it was said that in the Implementation

437 liters per day, butthat duringthe initial appraisal, the figure used was 150 liters per day.
The State o f Cearh wishes to say that this didnot happen. The data inthe record put annual
incremental consumption at the equivalent o f 41,138,362 cubic meters, o f which 31,536,000
cubic meters are believed to refer to consumption by the P e c h Port Industrial Complex and
only 9,602,362 cubic meters to consumptionbya populationincrement o f 257,920 residents.
Therefore, the consumptionfigure usedwas only 102liters ofwater per capita, per day.
         15.        Other aspects of the Economic Analysis are addressedinitems 4.13 to 4.19.
The economic analysis presented inthe ICRwas conducted on the same methodological basis
as the SAR, and this was agreed to by the Bank and the State at the time. That methodology
did not include some o f the costs mentioned, or other benefits from the water-related
investments, such as a reduction in expenditures for alternative means of supplying water
(tanker trucks), costs avoided because of a reduction inmigration, health costs avoided, etc.
And so the State believes that any change in the economic analysis presented in the ICR
should be made ina more complete fashion, including a survey of empirical data, as well as
the aggregation of other cost and benefit items. It considers the adjustments already made to
be partial and lendingthemselves to mistakes, which makes the results of the economic rate
o freturn presentedinthe PPARunreliable.

       II. THEPILOTPROGERIRH
        16.    The State of Cearh agrees that resourcesof PROURB itself couldhave been
used to prepare the PROGERIRH; however, it reports that these funds were earmarked and
committedto activitiesunderthe urbancomponentofPROURB.
        17.    Lastly, the State of Cead believes that if the main objective of the Pilot
PROGERIRHProjectwas achieved, its overallresults shouldbe rated as satisfactory rather
thanmoderatelysatisfactory.
