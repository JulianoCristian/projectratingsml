The overall\n            objective of the PSAC was to support policy measures to\n            stimulate the supply response of the private sector. To\n            achieve this goal, the PSACincluded a reform program, which\n            aimed to: (a) complete the liberalization of domestic and\n            external trade; (b) improve the export and investment\n            incentive regimes; (c) eliminate rigidities in the labor\n            market; and (d) reduce maritime transportation costs. Most\n            of the PSAC reforms to promote competition in domestic and\n            external trade and to promote exports are likely to be\n            sustainable. However, the impacts of the revised free trade\n            regime and the temporaryimport system are yet to be\n            determined. The bank's and borrower's performance\n            was highly satisfactory overall. Three major lessons can be\n            drawn from implementation of the PSAC: (a) Participation of\n            stakeholdersin the project In\n            preparingadjustmentoperations,the Bank should emphasizethe\n            identification of needed reforms by national stakeholders,\n            and not propose its own program. In the case of the PSAC,\n            the participation of various stakeholders in discussions and\n            their proposals of reform measures ensured a broad support\n            for the project and also reinforced the Government's\n            commitmentto proceed; (b) Commitmentof the Borrower The\n            Borrower needs to give clear signals of its commitment to\n            carry out the proposed reforms early on in the project\n            preparation. In the case of the PSAC, the Bank was able to\n            assess thoroughly the Borrower's commitment by asking\n            the GOS to implement concrete measures before seeking Board\n            approval. In addition, the changes in the political economic\n            environment brought about by the CFAF devaluationmade\n            iteasier for the GOS to take decisions that would otherwise\n            have been difficult to implement; and (c)Consultation with\n            the private sector for deepening the reforms: The PSAC\n            helped to lift certain, but not all barriers to private\n            sector development. To further deepen the reforms initiated\n            by the PSAC, the GOS should ensure a continuing dialogue\n            with all the stakeholders to identify remaining constraints,\n            and design and implement appropriate reform measures."}, "docdt": "1996-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
