proposed project would consist of:\n            (a) a maintenance study, including a review of sector policy\n            and maintenance organization, road investment financing, and\n            construction materials; (b) engineering studies for\n            reinforcement and rehabiliation of the Rosso-Akjoujt road\n            (450 km) and for partial improvement of the\n            Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema road (1,150 km); (c) consultant\n            services and contractors to carry out engineering and\n            construction of drainage structures for the Boghe-Kaedi and\n            Atar-Oued Seguelil roads; and (d) equipment, materials,\n            supplies, and personnel training for urgent maintenance\n            works on the Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema road. The completion of\n            the Third Highway Project's betterment works would\n            assure that, with a relatively small expenditure, the full\n            benefits of this important investment are realized. The\n            maintenance study would: (i) develop a road maintenance\n            policy in accordance with the country's present\n            financial and institutional limitations; and (ii) lay the\n            groundwork for establishing a more effective maintenance\n            organization taking into account Government's recent\n            decision to employ contractors for periodic maintenance. The\n            engineering studies would prepare the badly needed\n            rehabilitation of the country's two major paved road axes."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
