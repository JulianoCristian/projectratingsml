  Project for Senegal were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: large investment programs can attract more bidders\n            and the increased competition can generate cost savings that\n            may be used to reinforce the impact of the project. The\n            technical quality of reforms that are designed to match\n            improvement of services with the financial efforts required\n            from beneficiaries strengthens their social acceptability\n            and prevents to a large extent political interference in\n            their implementation. Effective targeting of the poor can be\n            reached by using a simple eligibility criterion based on the\n            location of households. Whenever country conditions cannot\n            allow identifying robust income criteria at household level,\n            targeting low-income neighborhoods is a good proxy. Project\n            Coordination Units (PCUs) should not be assimilated to\n            Project Implementation Units (PIUs). PCUs do not act as\n            substitutes to Government departments or agencies and do not\n            hamper capacity building; they are simply a very effective\n            tool for coordinating multi-agency, multi-ministries,\n            multi-donors programs."}, "docdt": "2001-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
