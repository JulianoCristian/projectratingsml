Long-Term Water Sector Project for\n            Senegal aims to achieve sustainable improvements in\n            delivering urban water and sanitation services in\n            underserved and low-income areas of Dakar and secondary\n            cities. There are seven project components. The first\n            improves the reliability, quality, quantity, and coverage of\n            water supply services by increasing production capacity to\n            meet demand, increasing the number of connections,\n            restructuring and balancing water distribution, and\n            increasing storage capacity. The second component expands\n            and reinforces drinking water networks. The third component\n            increases the number of households connected to sewer\n            networks, improves demand management and reduces wastewater\n            and septic pollution, and limits severity and duration of\n            flooding. the fourth component targets peri-urban and\n            low-income settlements so as to improve sanitary conditions\n            of households. This component includes an investment program\n            and a capacity building and demand generation program. The\n            fifth component improves the role of the executing agency in\n            regulating water resources and develops an action plan for\n            integrated management. The sixth component incorporates\n            environmental concerns in the project to increase quality,\n            and to follow safeguard policies and national regulations.\n            The seventh component increases the efficiency of public\n            entities involved in the water and sewerage sector by\n            strengthening their capacity and the capacity of small\n            private and community enterprises."}, "docdt": "2001-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
