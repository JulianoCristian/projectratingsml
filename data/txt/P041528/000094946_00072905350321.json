Mitigating measures include: 1) Although\n            underground effluents will progressively diminish,\n            benefiting the Lake Guiers surface waters, measures suggest\n            monitoring and evaluation of the underground effluents in\n            Dakar and the Northern region, following the temporary\n            exploitation phase, and, establish formal control\n            procedures, building management capacity to better service\n            water resources. 2) Concerning surface waters, the creation\n            of a local authority is recommended, to manage the lake\n            water resources, and, establish legal, and regulatory\n            frameworks to control water pollution, through an\n            operational management plan, which should include costs,\n            financial management, and taxation systems. 3) Waste\n            disposal should be addressed in the technical specifications\n            of procurement documents, emphasizing environmental\n            management as it concerns, industrial pollution,\n            agricultural land, and, noise, and air pollution control. 4)\n            To avoid potential controversies, community consultations\n            should be established, to include financial compensation for\n            land losses, and, public health issues should also be\n            integrated in the procurement documents."}, "docdt": "1999-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
