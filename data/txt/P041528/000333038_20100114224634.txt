F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project was to assist the Borrower in achieving sustainable
improvements in the delivery of urban water and sanitation services in unserved and low-
income areas of Dakar and secondary cities by: (a) supporting further institutional and
regulatory reforms and policy enhancements, thus consolidating and building on
achievements of the ongoing Water Sector Project; (b) removing major water production


                                                 ii
and distribution capacity constraints with the help of private sector financing; (c)
supporting rehabilitation of sewerage networks and increasing waste water treatment
capacity; (d) implementing a community-based program for developing on-site and semi-
collective sanitation services; and (e) supporting capacity development of sector
agencies, communities and households.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Sector Background
Senegal ha d i mplemented s ince 1996 a c omprehensive ur ban w ater a nd sanitation r eform
program aiming at ensuring the viability of the sector and developing access to services. In
the ur ban water s ub-sector, a s tate a sset-holding company ( Société Nationale des Eaux du
Sénégal, SONES) w as c reated, a nd ope rations w ere c ontracted out t o a pr ivate ope rating
company ( Sénégalaise des Eaux, SDE), u nder a 1 0-year enhanced l ease a greement
(affermage) p rocured t hrough ICB. T he G overnment al so cr eated t he National O ffice o f
Urban S anitation ( ONAS) a s a n a utonomous p ublic a gency i n c harge of ope rating a nd
managing u rban s anitation a nd dr ainage.          After f our years o f r eform, s ignificant
improvements had been m ade i n t he quality of w ater s ervice delivery and t he efficiency of
operations, and in progressing towards the financial equilibrium of the sub-sector, with a cost
recovery pol icy of a nnual s ocially-acceptable t ariff i ncreases ba sed on t he f indings of a
financial model.

The sector was still facing important challenges. F irst, the metropolitan area of Dakar, the
capital city (with a population of more than 2.2 m illion) experienced recurrent and seasonal
water s hortages t hat r equired l arge i nvestments i n w ater pr oduction a nd t ransmission
capacity. A t t he s ame t ime, w ater ac cess rates, albeit h igh b y regional s tandards, r equired
substantial increases to meet population growth and to improve connection rates that ensured
better quality and quantity of safe water in Dakar and other urban centers. Second, access to
improved s anitation s ervices w as l agging be hind w ater, w hich l ed t o t he di sposal of
wastewater in o pen s paces o r s ensitive ma ritime e nvironment. 64 percent o f t he D akar's
households w ere not s atisfied w ith t heir s anitation f acilities, but c onventional s ewerage ( to
which 3 1 p ercent o f t hem w ere co nnected) w as not t echnically o r eco nomically f easible i n
the m ajor p art of t he city, which called for t he development of a dequate on- site s olutions.
Third, water resources tapped for supplying water to Dakar were either nearby aquifers that
were exploited b eyond t heir s ustainable yields o r r emote s urface w ater ( Guiers Lake) t hat
had to be managed carefully, with substantial social, health and environmental implications.

Government Strategy
In its F ebruary 2 000 Letter o f S ector D evelopment P olicy, th e G overnment r eiterated its
commitment to the reforms and to the operational and financial autonomy of the sector. The
urban w ater s ub-sector was e xpected t o r each financial e quilibrium i n 2003, w hile t he
financial viability of ONAS had to be strengthened. An institutional study was to be carried
out t o i mprove t he l egal a nd r egulatory framework a nd ascertain t he op tions f or a f urther
reform at t he end o f t he contractual arrangements s cheduled i n 2006. A s regards t o s ector
challenges, the Government acknowledged the need to address the growing water deficit in
Dakar, a nd t he pr ivate sector w as i nvited t o p articipate t o t he f inancing of pr oduction
facilities. T he G overnment a lso in itiated th e development o f a n ational u rban s anitation
strategy i nvolving all s takeholders, w hich emphasized: ( i) de mand-responsive and
participatory approaches to the delivery of services that would reach peri-urban households;



                                                  1
(ii) ma intaining th e actual c apacity o f th e s ewerage s ystem b y r ehabilitating th e f acilities;
(iii) i ncreasing t he c onnection r ate; a nd (iv) r educing pol lution l oads b y e xpanding w aste
water and s eptage t reatment cap acity. Finally, t he G overnment emphasized t he n eed t o
deepen the integrated management of water resources, to provide the department in charge,
SGPRE, with adequate financial and organizational means and to improve the environmental
sustainability of t he s ector. The G overnment r equested donor s' s upport t o i mplement t his
sectoral strategy through a new operation.

Rationale for Bank Assistance
The new project was consistent with the sector strategy and with the Bank Group's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved in January 1998. The central objective of the CAS was
to r educe pove rty and t o i mprove t he l iving c onditions of t he popul ation, i ncluding t he
creation of gainful employment opportunities. T his was based on a two-pronged approach:
(i) s upporting pol icies a nd pr ograms a imed at more r apid and s ustained g rowth; a nd ( ii)
ensuring s ocial s ustainability of t he pr ograms. T he ne w pr oject w ould follow t he C AS b y
removing a key infrastructure bottleneck (Dakar's unmet water demand), and by ensuring the
social s ustainability of b asic s ervices i n ur ban, peri-urban and s mall t own a reas t hrough a
demand-responsive approach and a socially-acceptable cost recovery policy.

The B ank ha d b een t he l eading pa rtner, t ogether w ith s everal donor s, i n s upporting t he
formulation and implementation of sector reforms through the previous Water Sector Project
(Projet Sectoriel Eau, PSE, Cr. 2758-SE). The quality of the sectoral dialogue and the trust it
had generated were key factors in the decision to continue and expand the Bank's support to
the sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The obj ective of t he Project w as t o a ssist t he B orrower i n a chieving s ustainable

1.6 Revised Components
The project components were not revised. However, the scope of some sub-components was
modified, a s a r esult of project s avings and of t he a ctual a vailability of c o-financing ( see

1.7 Other significant changes
Substantial savings accrued from the efficient procurement of works and services under the
Urban W ater component. In addition, t he f inancing s ource of s everal a ctivities ha d t o be

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project preparation was satisfactory, as: (i) an experienced team with the required skills was
in charge of project preparation; (ii) the design of the project was based on detailed reviews
of alternatives, including their impact on tariffs, and on lessons learned from similar projects,
(iii) implementation arrangements were based on assessments of capacities; (iv) major risks
and th eir mitig ation w ere c learly id entified; ( v) a n a dequate mo nitoring s ystem a nd
regulatory tools were available; and (vi) safeguards issues were properly covered based on an
appropriate participatory process and full disclosure.

The project was carefully designed by taking into account lessons from earlier operations
and implementation capacities, and by bringing consensus on controversial aspects. The
design of the project drew heavily on lessons learned from the implementation of the sector
reforms s ince 1996 a nd of t he pr evious op eration ( PSE) a nd f rom t he l essons of t he B ank
(including t he W ater a nd S anitation P rogram) e xperience i n de veloping a ccess t o ur ban
sanitation. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design included: (i) the proven record
of t he a sset-holding c ompany, S ONES, t o e fficiently i mplement i nvestments a nd of t he
private p artner, S DE t o e fficiently deliver w ater s ervices w ith p roper i ncentives a nd
penalties; (ii) the strong commitment of the Government to the reforms and the importance of
Government p laying b y th e r ules a nd p aying its w ater b ills; ( iii) the u se o f th e f inancial
model as a regulatory tool, not only for setting tariffs, but also to optimize investments and




                                                  4
financing; ( iv) t he s uccessful ex perience u nder t he P SE o f s ocial water connections1
programs; and (v) the strong potential of on-site sanitation and of condominial sewerage, as
demonstrated i n t he s ub-region a nd i n t he L atin A merica a nd C aribbean R egion ( LCR), t o
provide adequate responses to households' demand.

Project pr eparation t ook a lso i n c onsideration t he i nherent complexity of t he pr oject, with
multiple implementation agencies (SONES, ONAS, and MEH). The use of a small Project
Coordinating U nit ( PCU) i n c harge o f pr oject m onitoring, r eporting a nd f inancial
management, w hich pr oved t o be e fficient unde r t he P SE, w as e xtended unde r t he ne w
project, with an additional mission to provide quality control of the procurement by relatively
inexperienced departments of MEH. I n addition, the implementation of the challenging on-
site sanitation program, which entailed procuring and managing hundreds of contracts, was
delegated to a co ntract m anagement a gency ( AGETIP), with adequate ex perience in small
urban works.

Finally, o ne k ey element o f p roject d esign w as th e s election o f th e o ptimal s olution f or
addressing D akar's w ater s hortages, w hich ha d a l ong hi story o f c ontroversial vi ews a nd
conflicts inside and outside Senegal. IFC was called in for a strategic review of alternatives,
either t echnical ( the Canal du Cayor opt ion vs . a pi pe opt ion) or financial (particularly t he
possibilities of private s ector financing). The review, i ncluding a t horough examination of
the imp act o f th e v arious a lternatives o n th e water ta riffs a nd th e s ector's in stitutional
framework, recommended the pipe option, together with the recourse to a design, build and
finance (DBF) contract f or t he n ew w ater t reatment f acilities. T he G overnment co ncurred
with these recommendations.

Risks and mitigation
The p roject's ma jor r isks a nd th eir mit igation w ere c orrectly id entified a t th e p roject
preparation s tage, i ncluding t he f ollowing: ( i) whether t he G overnment w ould a pply t he
agreed tariff policy and regularly pay its water bills; (ii) whether consensus would be timely
reached i n d eepening t he r eforms; ( iii) w hether O NAS an d s mall-scale co ntractors w ould
efficiently implement sanitation investments; and (iv) whether there was an effective demand
for on-site sanitation facilities.

Through a c areful i mplementation of m itigation m easures, a ll t hese r isks ha ve be en
eventually ev aded: ( i) t ariff i ncreases w ere t o be s ocially-acceptable a nd r esult f rom a
transparent us e o f t he f inancial m odel, w hereas a n a ction pl an w as de signed t o l imit
Government's water consumption; (ii) institutional studies were scheduled well in advance of
the c ontractual de adlines; ( iii) a n e xperienced c ontract m anagement a gency w ould a ssist
ONAS in imp lementing on-site s anitation p rograms; a nd ( iv) th e la tter p rograms w ould b e
implemented under a demand-driven approach involving NGOs.

  Social water connections are provided free of charge to the beneficiary who has to make a security deposit of
CFAF 19, 000 (US$38 equivalent) i nstead of pa ying t he standard c onnection fee of C FAF 100, 000 (US$200
equivalent). T he eligibility criteria of social connections are discussed below in Section 3.5(a). The programs
do not entail any Government subsidy, as the costs are cross-subsidized by the water sales, particularly by users
in the highest consumption tranches.

Government's commitment and participatory process
As m entioned above, the Government's commitment t o bot h t he r eform process and t o t he
project objective had been amply demonstrated since the inception of the reforms and during
project preparation.

The i nvolvement of s takeholders a nd t he pa rticipatory pr ocess i n pr oject pr eparation w as
strong in the design of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and in the design of the
activities related to the i ncrease of access to services. T he EMP included detailed plans to
improve t he s ocio-economic c onditions of t he popul ation a round t he G uiers Lake and ha d
been e xtensively di scussed a nd di sclosed. T he s trategy for i mproved w ater a nd s anitation

assessments. N GOs, C BOs, c ommunities a nd be neficiaries w ere t o pa rticipate t hroughout
the subproject cycle to execute the peri-urban sanitation component under a demand-driven
approach.

2.2 Implementation

Restructuring
The project was not restructured and was never at risk.

Mid-term review
The B ank a nd t he B orrower c arried out a m id-term r eview ( MTR) i n J anuary 2005 a nd
concluded that the project was on t rack for achieving its development objective. Based on
the findings the Bank team made recommendations for the second phase of implementation,
including: ( i) th e n eed to r e-allocate p roject s avings; a nd ( ii) th e imp lementation o f th e
agreements reached as a result of the institutional studies, particularly the five-year extension
of the lease contract ("affermage contract") and the generalization of performance contracts
to SONES and ONAS.

Factors that contributed to successful implementation
· The size of the project (large by sub-regional standards) generated an unusual degree of
   competition i n t enders, which, c ombined w ith t he e fficiency of S ONES' pr ocurement,
   resulted in substantial project savings;
· The P CU's efficiency f acilitated implementation by helping the ministerial departments
   to c oordinate a ctions, by providing t imely f eedback on i ssues a nd b y improving t he
   quality of procurement documentation;
· The flexibility and trust shared by the Bank team and the Borrower's team facilitated the
   resolution of i mplementation i ssues, a s bot h pa rties w ere ope n t o f ind s olutions, w hich
   were most of the time discussed with stakeholders;
· Donors' coordination was greatly facilitated by the presence in the field of one of the co-
   TTLs of the operation.




                                                  6
Factors that gave rise to problems in implementation
· The surge in energy prices after 2005 had a substantial impact on the operating costs and
   the financial equilibrium of the urban water supply sub-sector; the issue was settled in the
   negotiations of the extension of the lease contract.
· The completion of the financing and procurement of additional pumping station designed
   to accommodate the increased flow of water stemming from the doubling of the treatment
   plant took longer than expected, which prevented reducing the abstraction of groundwater

· The peri-urban sanitation component faced serious start-up problems due to the fact that

   peri-urban sanitation program and the implementation of the EMP.
·     Annual reviews of the outcome of the financial model of the urban water supply sub-
   sector, carried out jointly by MEH, SONES and the Bank, in view of assessing the annual
   tariff increases.

The J une 2009 f inal assessment of t he execution of t he E MP found t hat t he m itigation
measures have been, to a large extent, satisfactorily carried out and that the social safeguards
have been complied with. The provision of the water supply facilities for the riparians of the

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objective of the project is highly relevant as well as the design of the
project and its implementation. The pr oject obj ective i s c onsistent w ith t he c ountry's
primary priorities, including the sustainable provision of safe water and adequate sanitation
while improving the viability of the urban water and sanitation sector. The project objective
was also (and still is) in line with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy.

The project design was consistent with country conditions and reflected the lessons learned
in successful water and sanitation operations in Senegal, West Africa and other regions. The
project a ddressed c ritical b ottlenecks to s ustainability th rough p hysical in vestments to
increase w ater pr oduction c apacity and pr ovided a dequate s olutions t o boos t s ervices
coverage, i ncluding t he pr ovision of a ffordable a nd a dapted s anitation f acilities. T he
implementation arrangements were carefully tailored to actual capacities.

The replication by the Government in its National Water and Sanitation Millennium Program
(PEPAM), which is being actively supported by donors, of the project's objective, design and
implementation arrangements, highlights their continued relevance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The ach ievement o f t he p roject o bjective i s r ated as highly satisfactory as ev idenced b y
development impact indicators that have been fully achieved or exceeded.

Access to water services has improved well above expectations as a result of the project,
particularly through private connections that warrant better quality and quantity of water.
The n umber o f p eople w ith acces s t o w ater s ervice i ncreased i n ei ght y ears b y m ore t han
1,410,000 people, representing 141 percent of the end-of-project target (EOPT)2. Most (96.5
percent) of t hose additional pe ople ha ving access t o t he s ervice a re s upplied b y p rivate
connections. T he l evel of ach ievement i s l ower i n D akar ( 91 p ercent) b ecause t he P AD's
forecasts ove restimated the popul ation's g rowth a nd t he E OPT c ould not be ph ysically
achieved (the co nnection r ate i n D akar i s already close t o 9 0 p ercent). This i s m ore t han
compensated b y t he i mpressive pe rformance of t he P roject i n t he ot her ur ban c enters ( 345
percent of the EOPT), which was facilitated by the reallocation of project savings.

Thanks t o t he p roject, S enegal h as al ready achieved M DGs f or u rban w ater an d t he u rban
population be nefits f rom a n a lmost uni versal water s ervice w ith a global ( all s ources of
supply) access rate of 98 percent and a household connection rate of 76 percent in 2008, to be
compared with rates of 90 percent and 69 pe rcent, respectively at project i nception (2001).
Senegal a ccentuated i ts l eading pos ition i n s ub-Saharan Africa, w here t he hous ehold
connection rate (50 percent) has been stagnant since 20003.

Access to sanitation services also improved markedly, particularly in peri-urban areas that
were previously out of reach of Government's interventions. The nu mber of a dditional
people ha ving a ccess t o s ewerage s ervice i ncreased b y 144,000, i .e. 1 03 pe rcent o f t he
EOPT, with similar results in Dakar (102 percent of the EOPT) and in the other urban centers
(103 percent of the EOPT). The performance of the peri-urban sanitation component is even
better w ith a t otal o f 58 3,000 a dditional pe ople having a ccess t o i mproved s anitation ( 146
percent of t he E OPT), e ither t hrough on- site f acilities ( 526,000 pe ople) or t hrough
condominial systems (57,000 people).

 The calculation takes into account the social connections constructed under the Project (97,700) and the new
ordinary connections that were made possible by the Project's investments in production capacity and network
extensions ( 38,700). These n ew c onnections pr ovide a ccess t o 1, 360,000 pe ople while 50, 000 a dditional
people are served by the 167 standpipes constructed under the Project

Other outcome indicators have generally reached or exceeded the targets:
· The financial equilibrium of the urban water supply sub-sector was reached, as expected,
   at the end of 2003 and maintain afterwards;
· The financial viability of ONAS was strengthened as the operating revenues covered, as
   expected, at t he end of 2003, i ts cash operating expenditures for s ewerage s ervices and

· The ad ditional v olume o f s ewage co llected and t reated i n p roject ar eas i ncreased b y
   11,745 m3/d, i .e. 117 pe rcent of t he E OPT. The pr oject also pr ovided a s ustainable
   disposal s olution for t he effluents collected from s eptic t anks with t he construction and
   successful operation of septage treatment plants;
· The m anagement p lan o f t he G uiers Lake h as b een p repared t ogether w ith a s pecific

   the Lake's m anagement b ody (Office de Gestion du Lac), a s m entioned a bove, i s
   expected to be approved by the Parliament before end of December 2009.

The a bove a chievements m easured b y t he ke y o utcome i ndicators of t he P DO ( sustainable
access to services) are confirmed by the key output indicators measuring the number of social
water a nd s ewerage c onnections a nd of on- site sanitation f acilities c onstructed unde r t he
Project (see Annex 2 for the detailed output indicators per component).

In addition, the specific goals underpinning the achievement of the PDO have been fulfilled
as follows:
(a) supporting f urther i nstitutional a nd r egulatory r eforms a nd pol icy e nhancements, t hus
    consolidating a nd bui lding on a chievements of the ong oing W ater S ector P roject: t he
    Project has been instrumental in providing inputs for the reform enhancements consisting
    of: ( i) a n ew l egal framework w ith t he a doption of t he W ater and S anitation P ublic
    Service Act; (ii) an improved regulatory framework with the application of Performance
    Contracts t o S ONES a nd O NAS; a nd ( iii) t he successful ne gotiations of a f ive-year
    extension of the lease contract;
(b) removing m ajor water p roduction a nd di stribution c apacity c onstraints w ith t he he lp o f

    improved their hygienic practices.

3.3 Efficiency

An e x-post e conomic a nalysis ( see A nnex 3) ha s be en c arried out , us ing a di fferent
methodology from the one used in the PAD. The PAD included a costs-benefits analysis of
the water and sanitation components (92 percent of the total project costs) that relied partly
on a not ional assessment of s ubstantial he alth be nefits, w hich c annot be r eplicated i n t he
absence o f a ba seline. For t his r eason t he e x-post a nalysis f ollowed i nstead t he s tandard
sector m ethodology: ( i) t he w ater s upply c omponents ( from a ll f inancing s ources,
representing 53 pe rcent of t he t otal pr oject c osts), f or w hich qua ntifiable be nefits c an b e
measured ( incremental water s ales an d co nsumer s urplus) ar e s ubject t o a co sts-benefits
analysis; and (ii) the sanitation components (38 percent of the total project costs) are subject
to a cost-effectiveness analysis.

The r esults of t he costs-benefits a nalysis of t he w ater c omponents a re a s f ollows: t he
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 12.1 p ercent and the net present value (with a 10
percent discount rate) is US$24.7 million. The ex-post EIRR is similar to the PAD estimate
without health benefits, which was 12.6 percent.

The c ost-effectiveness analysis of t he s anitation c omponents, c arried ou t on t he ba sis of
average investments per capita shows that: (i) the strategic choice made by the Government
to develop alternatives to sewerage is the right one as the full cost of developing condominial
systems a nd o n-site s anitation is mu ch lo wer th an th e o ne o f s ewerage; w hereas ( ii) th e
densification of t he e xisting s ewerage n etwork, t hrough s ewerage c onnections pr ograms, i s
also economically justified.

These results show that the project achieved substantial economic efficiency.

The financial analysis of the PAD focused on the linkage between the water tariff increases,
the f inancing c onditions of t he pr oject ( particularly t he on- lending c onditions) a nd t he
financial e quilibrium o f S ONES a nd O NAS. T he f inancial o utcome o f th e p roject is
summarized i n T ables 2 a nd 3 of A nnex 3, w hich s how ho w S ONES w as a ble t o a chieve
financial e quilibrium i n 2 003 a nd to ma intain it afterwards, while ONAS a chieved
equilibrium in 2003-2004 and restored it in 2008.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The ove rall out come of t he pr oject i s r ated highly satisfactory s ince ( i) t he p roject
development o bjective, its d esign and imp lementation a re h ighly relevant; ( ii) a ll k ey
indicators related to the development objective have largely exceeded their targets, as well as
most of t he ot her out come a nd out put i ndicators, w hich de monstrates a hi gh e fficacy; and
(iii) the project has achieved a substantial level of efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty Impact. The project replicated the experience of the PSE, which demonstrated that
providing l ow-cost connections w as c ritical f or i ncreasing di rect a ccess t o pi ped w ater b y
low i ncome f amilies. T hrough t he s ocial c onnection pr ogram f inanced under t he pr oject,
qualifying hous eholds obt ained a c onnection f ree of c harge a gainst t he pa yment of a
refundable deposit equivalent to US$38 representing less than 20 pe rcent of the connection
cost, on a first-come first-served basis, The only criterion used for assessing eligibility is the
geographical location5 but areas planned for network densification get priority. H ouseholds
located in Dakar's low-income neighborhoods and all households located in secondary urban
centers w ere e ligible f or a s ocial c onnection. B etween 2001 a nd 2008, a bout 98,000
household connections have been constructed under the project in peri-urban areas of Dakar
and secondary centers.

A similar pr ogram w as developed f or s ewerage connections b y O NAS; m ore t han 14,000
such c onnections ha ve been bui lt i n t he s ame period. T he pe ri-urban s anitation pr ogram
(PAQPUD) also ta rgeted lo w-income c ommunities th at h ad b een entirely neglected b y th e
development of the sewerage network. The social impact study of the PAQPUD showed that
the beneficiaries were significantly poorer than the average population of Dakar.

The s ocial c onnection pr ogram ha d also a pos itive i mpact on hous ehold's w ater bud gets.
The s urvey carried out i n t he 2009 w illingness-to-pay s tudy f ound that unc onnected
households belonging to the lowest income quintile spend about 3 percent of their budget for
water, whereas the water expenditures of recently connected households amount to only 1.3
percent. T his out come, a s w ell a s t he facilitation of a ccess a nd t he i mprovement of t he
continuity of services strengthened the social acceptability of tariff increases.

Gender Aspects. The s urvey a lso e vidences t he time s avings a ccruing t o w omen a nd girls
that benefit from water connections. A bout 25 pe rcent of households spend 30 m inutes per
day in fetching water when they are not connected, which is significant in urban areas. In
addition, w omen pl ayed a n a ctive role i n t he pe ri-urban s anitation pr ogram a s t he pr imary
interlocutors of CBOs in the identification of demand for services and as resource persons in
the hygiene education programs.

  Eligibility criteria to e nsure better targeting of the poor were thoroughly debated in the design of the social
connections p rogram, which c oncluded that t he current country c onditions c ould no t warrant t he us e o f
individual household criteria and that a poverty ranking of urban neighborhoods would be an acceptable proxy.
A specific study of the targeting of the programs was carried out at the end of the project to check whether the
approach was va lid and whether other c riteria m ight be a dopted i n t he f uture. The study concluded that t he
approach was r ealistic: the water connection rate in the targeted neighborhoods was at the end o f the p roject,
much closer to the city average. The study also proposed individual criteria for future programs (particularly to
consider the monthly el ectricity b ill as a r evenue i ndicator). S ONES a nd S DE are r eviewing t he
recommendations that they intend to discuss with representatives of the civil society.

In addition t o t he i mproved i mplementation c apacities, t he pr oject e xecution de monstrated
the c apacity o f t he publ ic s takeholders ( the M inistry i n c harge of W ater, S ONES a nd t he
PCU) t o take ove r t he de epening of t he r eform pr ocess, a s t hey i mplemented t he
recommendations of the institutional studies financed by the Credit. The negotiations of the
five-year extension of the affermage contract were satisfactorily carried out without external
assistance and with extensive use of the updated financial model of the urban water supply
sub-sector. In a ddition, t he pr oject he lped publ ic s takeholders t o de sign t he N ational
Program (PEPAM 2006-2015) for reaching the MDGs, which encompasses rural as well as
urban a reas. T he pos itive e xperience of t he P CU i n c oordinating f our different e xecuting
agencies and managing funds from multiple donors, has been recognized at the outset of the
PEPAM by the Government, which decided to officially establish this body as the Program
Coordination Unit of the PEPAM and of all related projects and subprograms, regardless of
their funding source.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The Bank performance was highly satisfactory in all aspects related to the Quality at Entry.
The Project was highly relevant to the country priorities and the CAS and build on sectoral
reforms and pol icies t hat ha ve be en s uccessfully t ested t o promote e fficiency i n t he
development a nd de livery of s ervices. T he Bank t eam c overed i n-depth s ocial a nd
environmental aspects while properly designing technical and financial aspects of the project.
The Bank team, with the assistance of other parts of the Bank Group, notably IFC and WSP,
deployed c ommendable e fforts t o br ing consensus on c ontroversial (Dakar's s ource of
supply) and innovative (the on-site sanitation program) features of the Project. B y ensuring

The budget devoted to preparation (US$904,900 and several trust funds) was commensurate
with the scope and the complexity of the operation and reflects the level of support provided
by the sector and country management.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
Supervision m issions, a s w itnessed b y t he a ide-memoires, w ere m ainly focused on t he
project impact and its progress toward achieving its development objectives, by assessing: (i)
the execution of the action plans attached to the Letter of Sector Policy; (ii) the levels of key

financial model of the sector and the application of the tariff policy; (v) the execution of the
covenants of the DCA; and (vi) the implementation of the EMP. As noted above, the quality
of the relationship between the Bank and the Borrower's teams allowed to rapidly address the
implementation i ssues. The ha ndling of t he pr oblems m et i n t he s tart-up of t he pe ri-urban
sanitation c omponent ( only 600 f acilities out o f a n e xpected t otal of 60,000 ha d b een
executed after eighteen months of implementation) evidences the team's capacity to put the
project o n th e r ight tr ack to a chieve its d evelopment o bjective. S imilarly th e te am
demonstrated f lexibility in th e tr eatment o f p roject s avings to r einforce th e p roject imp act.
The pr oject t eam w as a lso a vailable t o pa rticipate, dur ing s upervision m issions or be tween

missions, reviewed the PMR and followed up on audit reports. A senior safeguard specialist,
familiar with the project areas and particularly the Senegal River Delta, monitored the EMP
and the environmental studies and ensured proper coordination with DEEC.

The project team conducted 19 s upervision missions in eight years, in line with the Bank's
standard average of two missions per year, but this does not account for the fact that the TTL
resided i n D akar be tween 2002 a nd 2006, w hich a llowed pe rmanent i nteraction w ith t he

team included two senior staff specifically in charge of the sanitation components, which was
actually equivalent to a medium-sized Bank operation (US$43 M). The supervision missions
were s ystematically coordinated with other donors and planned to coincide with the annual
reviews. Aide-memoires and ISRs were produced and candidly reported on implementation,
while providing detailed assessments and recommendations. DO and IP were conservatively
rated as s atisfactory t hroughout t he pr oject a nd w ere up graded a t t he e nd, onc e f inal
indicators and outcomes gave unequivocal evidence of a HS rating. ISRs were commented
on by the sector manager and the country director on a timely basis.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
In vi ew of t he a bove ratings of qua lity at e ntry and of s upervision, the ove rall B ank
performance is rated as highly satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                  16
The project was high on the Government's priority list and the Government provided strong
leadership during project preparation. Its commitment to the development objective and to
the c ontinuation of t he reform w as unque stionable a nd t he G overnment pe rformance was
highly s atisfactory du ring pr eparation. T he Government's commitment and l eadership was
essential in ensuring the unusually broad participation of donors to this operation.

During implementation, the Government demonstrated its commitment by timely approval of
the ta riff in creases and th e r evisions o f th e ta riff s tructure u ntil th e s ector a chieved its
financial equilibrium at the end of 2003. T he Government, throughout the project provided
counterpart f unds on a timely ba sis ( and even provided t hree t imes a s m uch f unding as
expected b y t aking ov er t he f inancing of t he drainage c omponent, which w as j udged
inseparable f rom an on going ur ban t ransport o peration), contributed t o t he r esolution of
issues a nd i mplemented t he r ecommendations of t he i nstitutional s tudies a s di scussed a nd
endorsed b y t he s ector's s takeholders. T hese achievements w ould ha ve justified a hi ghly
satisfactory rating, save for two shortcomings that are mentioned below.

First, th e mu ltiple min isterial r eshuffles d id n ot f acilitate th e c oordination b etween w ater
supply, sanitation and water resources management, by dispersing the oversight in different
ministries and creating instability in the leadership of executing agencies. There is no doubt
that the Office du Lac de Guiers would have been operational sooner if one single ministry
would have been in charge of the entire sector, as this was the case at project inception.

Second, t he G overnment pe rformance i n t imely pa yments f or i ts w ater c onsumption w as
exemplary unt il 2007 ( as ha d be en t he c ase dur ing t he P SE) but c ould not be m aintained
afterwards. T he G overnment e ncountered di fficulties i n f ulfilling t he budge tary
consequences of i ts de cision t o c harge t he f ull i mpact of t he ne cessary tariff i ncreases on
administrative consumption, even though the cost of this decision was much lower than the
one of the subsidies granted to alleviate electricity and energy prices

In view of the above, the Government performance is rated as satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The i mplementing agencies pa rticipated a ctively in pr oject pr eparation a nd c ontributed
substantially to the quality at entry of the operation. T heir implementation performance has
to be assessed separately.

The i mplementation pe rformance of S ONES a nd of t he P CU was highly satisfactory.
Physical implementation of the water supply components by SONES was swift and efficient,
as w ell a s pr ocurement and c ontract m anagement, w hich l ed t o s ubstantial s avings ( about
US$25 m illion, i ncluding contracts not f inanced b y IDA). T he p artnership w ith S DE
functioned satisfactorily. As noted above, the instability of SONES' senior management had
no i mpact on t he a gency's pe rformance a s i t w as c ompensated b y t he stability of a c ore
technical and financial team.




                                                  17
The P CU car ried o ut v ery s atisfactorily i ts co ordinating r ole, w hich b ecame cr ucial w hen
sector responsibilities were divided between different ministries. The PCU was instrumental
in the dissemination of studies and in organizing workshops to discuss policy options and to
gather the views of all stakeholders, including the civil society. In addition, the PCU carried
out effectively its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, and its fiduciary responsibilities,
including the quality control of procurement.

The implementation performance of ONAS and DGPRE was satisfactory. ONAS correctly
implemented th e s ewerage c omponent, a lthough with d elays attributable to th e la ck o f f ull
autonomy o f t he agency. ONAS' s enior s taff s uffered f rom a hi gh t urnover r ate, w hich
hampered the capitalization of experience. T he turnover was particularly damaging for the
improvement of t he a gency's f inancial s ystem, which r esulted i n a di sclaimer of opi nion
from the auditors on t he 2007 a ccounts. A n experienced financial manager recruited in the
private s ector r emedied t he s ituation a nd obt ained a n unqua lified opi nion i n 2008. T he
operating performance, particularly for the treatment plants, has been adequate.

The i mplementation a rrangements f or t he pe ri-urban s anitation c omponent w orked a s
expected. AGETIP delivered a highly satisfactory performance for a very reasonable fee (less
than 4 pe rcent of t he c ost of t he w orks) a nd i s largely accountable f or t he s uccess of t he
program.

DGPRE's le adership in water r esource ma nagement imp roved w ith its transformation in a
full ministerial directorate and was clearly committed to improving the sustainability and the
monitoring of w ater resources. DGPRE w orked e ffectively w ith D EEC t o e stablish t he
monitoring of t he w ater qua lity of t he G uiers Lake and w ith t he P CU t o i mprove i ts
procurement performance.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
In vi ew of t he G overnment`s a nd of t he i mplementing a gencies pe rformance, t he ove rall
Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

·   Large in vestment p rograms c an attract mo re b idders a nd th e in creased c ompetition c an
    generate cost savings that may be used to reinforce the impact of the project.
·   Successful w ater r eforms r equire s ubstantial r esources an d s uccess i s cl early co ntingent
    on a l ong-term i nvolvement i n t he s ector. T he c ontrast be tween t he out come a nd
    sustainability of the Senegal water sector reform and the ones of projects where the Bank
    limited its involvement to the design and the completion of a PPP transaction speaks for
    itself. T he lo ng-term c ommitment o f IDA in Senegal w as a ma jor f actor o f s uccess
    through: (i) its catalytic role in leveraging investment funding from other donors; (ii) its
    role i n s moothing f rictions a nd br inging a c ooperative s pirit; and ( iii) i ts c ontinuous
    support to the full execution of contractual and regulatory obligations.
·   The technical quality of reforms that are designed to match improvement of services with
    the financial efforts required from beneficiaries strengthens their social acceptability and
    prevents to a large extent political interference in their implementation.


                                                 18
·   Free social water connections are the solution to really improve access in urban areas of
    SSA. Private connections provide a better service and all other alternative sources of safe
    water, particularly standpipes, are costlier for the end user. An efficiently-managed water
    sector, w ith r ealistic ta riff p olicies ( like S enegal, C ôte d 'Ivoire o r B urkina F aso) is
    perfectly able to afford extensive free social connections programs without Government
    subsidies. At the same time, the modest security deposit required of new users provides a
    good t est of t heir a bility a nd w illingness t o pa y for w ater s ervices, c ontributing t o t he
    high bill collection rate.
·   Effective targeting of the poor can be reached by using a simple eligibility criterion based
    on t he l ocation of hous eholds. W henever c ountry c onditions c annot a llow i dentifying
    robust income criteria at household level, targeting low-income neighborhoods is a good
    proxy.
·   Scaling up an on-site sanitation program from scratch is feasible, and requires excellent
    implementation cap acities ( preferably a c ontract m anagement agency w ith
    comprehensive implementation responsibilities) and a high degree of flexibility from the
    promoters of the program. Prior to the project, Senegal had little experience with on-site
    sanitation programs, but successful references were at hand, particularly in Burkina Faso.
    Instead of f ollowing t he us ual a pproach of s uccessive pi lot a nd de monstration pr ojects,
    ONAS an d t he Bank t eam o pted f or an i mmediate f ull-scale p rogram (the l argest ever
    implemented i n W est A frica) a nd c oncentrated on de signing t he most e fficient
    implementation framework suitable to the country context.
·   PCUs should not be assimilated to PIUs. P CUs do not act as substitutes to Government
    departments or a gencies a nd do not ha mper c apacity bui lding; t hey a re simply a ve ry
    effective tool for coordinating multi-agency, multi-ministries, multi-donors programs.

Economic Analysis

1.      The pr oject w as s ubmitted t o a n e x-post a nalysis. T he m ethodology used i n t his
analysis a nd i ts s cope s ensibly di ffers f rom t he one us ed i n t he P AD, w hich c ould not b e
replicated for various reasons which are explained below.

2.       PAD methodology. The PAD provided a costs-benefits analysis of the water supply
and s anitation c omponents of t he pr oject ( 92 pe rcent of t otal pr oject c osts), t aking i nto
account as benefits: (i) the incremental sales of water; (ii) the incremental revenues from the
sanitation s urcharge; ( iii) c osts s avings r esulting f rom a n i mproved una ccounted-for w ater
rate; a nd ( iv) qua ntified he alth be nefits s temming f rom t he r eduction of m orbidity a nd
mortality f or d iarrheal d iseases and ma laria. On th is b asis th e P AD f ound h igh e conomic
internal r ates of r eturn ( EIRR) for bot h t he water s upply c omponent (32 pe rcent) a nd t he
sanitation c omponent ( 34 pe rcent). T he c ontribution of t he he alth be nefits t o t hese r esults
was substantial. Without these health benefits, the EIRR of the water component would have
been estimated at 12.6 pe rcent, while no E IRR could have been calculated for the sanitation
component.

3.      The c omputation of t he he alth be nefits i n t he ex-ante a nalysis w ere b ased on a
notional assumption that, using country data of the prevalence of the diseases: (i) morbidity
would be reduced b y 20 percent and 30 pe rcent, respectively for m alaria and di arrhea; and
(ii) mortality from diarrhea would be reduced by 25 percent.

4. E     x-post Analysis Methodology. The he alth be nefits c annot be calculated e x-post
because there is no ba seline to sustain the ex-post analysis in the project areas; even in the
presence of a baseline, it is a hazardous exercise to ascertain accurately the health impact of a
project, w hen mu ltiple e xternal f actors are a t p lay. It ma y also b e argued th at ta king in to
account both health benefits and payments for water can be construed as double counting as
consumers ar e w illing t o p ay f or s afe w ater p recisely b ecause t hey p erceive t hese h ealth
benefits. T herefore t he e x-post c osts-benefits a nalysis can onl y c over t he w ater s upply
components ( 53 pe rcent of t otal pr oject c osts), f or w hich qua ntifiable be nefits m ay be
measured, whereas the sanitation components are subject to a cost-effectiveness analysis.

5.      Costs-Benefits Analysis of Water Components. The analysis is carried out by using a
standard me thodology for w ater p rojects, th at ta kes in to a ccount: ( i) in cremental s ales; ( ii)
the consumer surplus resulting from the increased water consumption of the newly connected
users w ho w ere pr eviously s upplied b y s tandpipes or w ater ve ndors; (iii) i nvestment c osts
(deflated and n et o f t axes); an d ( iv) i ncremental o perating co sts. T he water i nvestments
considered i n t he a nalysis a mount t o a bout U S$136 m illion. Incremental ope rating c osts
have b een cal culated u sing t he en ergy, chemicals, co mmercial and maintenance co sts
observed in the current operations of SDE. The detailed assumptions used in the analysis can
be found in the Project Files; main assumptions and sources of data are summarized below:




                                                  31
        Review period: 2003­ 2034
        Investment costs: SONES actual data for all financing sources, deflated by 2 percent
        per year
        Water c onsumption: 2 003-2008: S DE a ctual da ta 2003 -2008; 200 9-2018 ( full
        utilization of additional production capacity): financial model forecasts
        Operating costs (SDE data):
            · Energy: Dakar : CFAF 80/m3 over 2005-2011 CFAF100/m3 afterwards; other
                urban centers: CFAF 40/m3
            · Chemicals: Dakar: CFAF 16.7/m3 for Dakar; other urban centers: CFAF 6/m3
            · Staff c osts: 1 a dditional a gent ( annual cost : C FAF 9.7 m illion) pe r 1, 000
                additional customers
            · Maintenance costs: 0.5 percent of investment costs
        Water rates:
            · Dakar: CFAF 403/m3 for all additional consumption
            · Other ur ban c enters: C FAF 403/ m3 for or dinary c onnections; C FAF 280 /m3
                for social connections
        Consumer surplus:
            · Ordinary connections: CFAF 14,000 per additional connection per year
            · Social connections: CFAF 10,000 per additional connection per year

        The results of the ex-post analysis are as follows:
        EIRR: 12.1 percent
        NPV (with a 10 percent discount rate): US$24.7 million
        Long-Term Marginal Cost (LTMC): CFAF 371/m3 (2003 prices)

        Using the standard methodology (i.e. without taking into account the health benefits),
        the e x-post E IRR is s imilar to th e P AD e stimate f or th e w ater c omponent a nd
        evidences that the project achieved economic efficiency. T he LTMC is close to the
        average water tariff.

6.      Cost-Effectiveness of Sanitation Investments. The s anitation c omponents of t he
project utilized the full range of sanitation services, namely sewerage, condominial services
and on-site sanitation. T he three options offered similar benefits to the households in terms
of i mprovement of di sposal of bot h e xcreta and w astewater. T he on- site f acilities,
particularly, w ere n ot limite d to la trines, b ut included w ashing f acilities ( shower, la undry)
associated with soakaway pits. T he effective use of these facilities, which was encouraged
by ex tensive h ygiene e ducation p rograms, l ed t o ef fective b ehavior changes an d b etter
hygienic practices. The social impact study found that 85 percent of households reported an
improvement of the cleanliness of their immediate environment and the absence of stagnating
wastewater in the streets.

7.      Therefore, the economic analysis of the sanitation components is based on the cost-

8.    The comparison of the costs of the three types of sanitation services may be made in
two ways:

    (a) To compare the full cost of each type of service (assuming that no pr ior investments
         have b een m ade): s ewerage i s cl early t he co stliest o ptions at U S$ 2 73 p er cap ita;
         condominial and on-site sanitation are barely similar;
    (b) To compare the incremental investment costs, as executed under the project: then the
         unit costs of the sewerage connection programs (US$103 per capita) are equivalent
         to the ones of the condominial s ystems (which had to be established from scratch);
         on-site s anitation i s c heaper when hous eholds a re a lready equipped w ith a l atrine
         (which is the most frequent case).

9.      Those c omparisons a mply j ustify t he c hoices m ade b y t he G overnment to de velop
alternatives to sewerage, whereas the densification of the existing sewerage network is also
economically justified.

Financial Analysis

10.     PAD's Financial Analysis. The financial analysis of the PAD focused on the linkage
between the water tariff increases, the financing conditions of the project (particularly the on-
lending c onditions) a nd t he f inancial e quilibrium of S ONES a nd O NAS. T he f inancial
equilibrium of SONES was deemed to be reached when the net cash at the beginning of the
year plus the net cash flow of the year (net cash generated by operations minus the sum of the
variation of working capital requirements, the debt service and the amount of investments not


                                                 33
 financed by external sources) would be positive. The financial equilibrium of ONAS would
 be r eached w hen O NAS' ope rating revenues w ould c over t he s um of i ts c ash ope rating
 expenditures and of the renewal expenditures of its equipment with a lifespan of less than 15
 years. The PAD analysis concluded that (i) SONES' financial equilibrium could be reached
 by 2003 t hrough annual tariff increases of about 3.9 percent from 2001 t o 2003, which were
 deemed to be socially acceptable; and (ii) ONAS' financial equilibrium could be reached in
 2003.

 11.     Financial Equilibrium of SONES. The t able be low pr ovides ke y f inancial da ta a nd
 indicators of SONES over the project period. T hey show that the financial equilibrium was
 reached as ex pected i n 2003 an d m aintained af terwards. S ONES generated a p ositive n et
 income f rom 2003 onw ards. T he ne gative ne t c ash f low obs erved i n 2008 r esults f rom

The C redit A greement No. 3470 S E be tween the W orld B ank and t he G overnment of
Senegal on t he Long T erm W ater S ector P roject ( PLT) w as s igned i n M ay 2001 i n t he
amount of SDR 98 million. The PLT, launched in 2002, is an extension of the Water Sector
Project (PSE) and i nstitutional reform process of t he urban w ater and s anitation s ector t hat
took pl ace i n 1996 and l ed t o t he c reation of the N ational W ater C ompany of S enegal
(SONES), th e S enegalese W ater U tility ( SDE), a nd th e N ational S anitation A gency o f
Senegal (ONAS).

I.      PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND START UP
1.1     Background

1.1.1 Political Context. In 2000, Senegal had just experienced its first democratic transfer of
power a nd, i n s o doi ng, t he c ountry s trengthened i ts po sition a mong t he f ew S ub-Saharan
African countries t o h ave a d emocratic regime c haracterized b y a m ulti-party system, t he
organization of free and fair elections, and freedom of the press.
1.1.2 Economic and Social Situation. In 2002, the Senegalese population was estimated at
9,956,202 with a growth rate of 2.4 percent between 1988 and 2002. In 2002, the population
was very unevenly distributed among the 11 r egions of the country. D akar, which accounts
for 0.3 p ercent of the surface area, was home to close to 22 p ercent of the total population
and w as t he m ost de nsely popul ated r egion, w ith 4,147 i nhabitants pe r km 2. The ur ban
population grew rapidly, rising from 23 percent of the total population in 1960 to 41 percent
in 2002 ( in 1970, i t stood at 30 pe rcent, in 1988, at 39 pe rcent, and in 1999, a t 43 pe rcent).
Dakar's ur ban " macrocephaly," t hat i s, t he dom inant r ole of t he c apital c ity i n t he ur ban
environment, r emained very m arked. In f act, 5 4 pe rcent of t he ur ban popul ation l ived i n
Dakar.

In 2002, t he S enegalese G overnment w as pr eparing i ts f irst P overty R eduction S trategy
Paper ( PRSP I) for t he 2003-2005 pe riod. In o rder t o a chieve a s ubstantial r eduction i n
poverty, the main objectives sought were broken down into three priority areas: (i) doubling
per capita income by 2015 in the context of strong, balanced, and better distributed growth;
(ii) providing broad access to essential social services by putting basic infrastructure in place
more quickly, with a view to strengthening human capital before 2010; and (iii) eradicating
all f orms of e xclusion i n t he c ountry and i ntroducing gender e quality particularly at t he
primary and secondary school levels by 2015.

1.1.3 Situation in the urban water and sanitation sector and major problems. The P RSP
indicated that the PSE had greatly contributed to safe water access in the metropolitan area of
Dakar. The findings of the QUID (2001) revealed that more than 87.9 percent of households
surveyed spent less than 15 m inutes to obtain water. These findings were validated b y the
Survey on the Perception of Poverty in Senegal [Enquête sur la perception de la pauvreté au
Sénégal, E PPS], w hich i ndicates an access r ate t o w ater (less t han o ne k ilometer) o f 9 5.6



                                                 40
percent. T hese findings reflected the vision of the Government of Senegal which, in 1995,
outlined a sectoral policy having the following main areas:
    · In t he ur ban w ater s ub-sector: ( i) i mproved m aintenance a nd b etter s ervicing of
       equipment; ( ii) i ncreased w ater pr oduction f or t he m etropolitan a rea of Dakar; a nd
       (iii) in stitutional a nd f inancial s trengthening o f th e s ub-sector w ith a v iew to
       achieving its equilibrium;
    ·   In t he s anitation s ub-sector: ( i) c ontinued pr ovision of s anitation i nfrastructure t o
        urban centers based on s trategic plans; (ii) wastewater treatment and r euse; (iii) and
        more household sewerage connections and the promotion of on-site sanitation; and
    ·   Lastly, w ith r espect t o t he m anagement o f w ater r esources, t he a reas i dentified
        revolved around: (i) better knowledge and effective protection of water resources; and
        (ii) th e e stablishment o f a n a ppropriate in stitutional f ramework f or jo int action a nd
        decision m aking w ith a vi ew t o t he ove rall a nd c onsistent m anagement of w ater
        resources.
The PSE has been the centerpiece of this policy which combines, in a coordinated manner,
institutional r eforms w ith ma jor in vestments a imed a t p utting in p lace w ater s upply a nd
sanitation i nfrastructure in urban areas. W ith an i nvestment of C FAF 12 0 bi llion, t he PSE
facilitated, inter alia, the r eduction o f th e w ater d eficit in th e me tropolitan a rea o f D akar,
beginning i n 1999. In fact, w ater pr oduction for t he m etropolitan area of D akar r egion
increased b y 60,000 m 3/d a s a r esult of t he r ehabilitation a nd e xpansion of t he N gnith
processing pl ant, t he establishment of 11 bor eholes i n Littoral Nord, and t he l aying of 150
kilometers of large diameter cast iron pipes between Guéoul and Dakar.
However, de spite t he i mpressive r esults pr oduced b y t he r eform and t he s cope of t he
investments approved i n t he P SE, t he s ector faced t he following constraints i n t he m edium
and long term:
         - An ongoing water deficit in Dakar, where the level was expected to reach 59,000
             m3/d i n 2003 dur ing p eak pe riod, ba sed on t he 1999 l ong-term water demand
             study;

        -   Average to mediocre sanitation service levels, particularly in the peri-urban areas
            of Dakar, with the attendant environmental and population health risks;

        -   Financial viability of ONAS, whose resources are derived from sanitation charges
            that d id n ot a llow it to c over its o perating c osts, le t a lone in frastructure
            replacement;

        -   Continuing pr essure on t he m ain s ource o f w ater on w hich t he c ity o f D akar i s
            expected to rely in the future (Guiers Lake), taking into account potential multiple
            uses of t his r esource a s w ell a s e nvironmental r isks ( pollution, de gradation of
            protective dikes, etc.);

        -   Lack o f al ternative resources (raw w ater from G uiers Lake and/or t reated
            wastewater) to the safe water used for irrigation, the result being that safe water
            will c ontinue t o be s upplied t o ve getable p roducers i n t he Dakar r egion a t
            preferential tariffs; and



                                                  41
        -   Environmental risks resulting from groundwater depletion at Cap Vert.

For t his r eason, t he G overnment of S enegal l aunched t he P LT pr eparatory pr ocess in 1999, w ith
assistance from the World Bank and other donors, in order to insert its policies and strategies into a
medium- and long-term investment program.

1.3     Project Components

The project consists of the following components:
Component A ­ Water Production: In order to meet water demand in the metropolitan area
of Dakar through 2015, the Government of Senegal decided to extend the PSE transmission
pipe between Guéoul and Keur Momar Sarr (70 kilometers) and to build a treatment plant in
two s tages in K eur M omar S arr. T he tr eatment p lant w as to h ave an in itial c apacity o f
65,000 m 3/d i n 2003, w hich w as p rojected t o i ncrease t o 130,000 m 3/d be tween 2006 a nd
2007. It w as t o be bui lt a nd f inanced b y t he pr ivate s ector unde r a D esign-Build-Finance
(DBF) contract, with operations being turned over to SDE under the current lease agreement.

Component B ­ Water Distribution: This component involves actions to: (i) increase service
coverage rates in the metropolitan area of Dakar, secondary centers, and the rural centers to
be t ransferred b y e xtending t ertiary di stribution ne tworks a nd pr oviding social c onnections
and standpipes; and (ii) restructure and rehabilitate distribution networks.

Component C ­ Wastewater and Drainage Networks: This component targets achievement
of a hi gher num ber of connections t o s ewerage systems i n c enters with sanitation s ervices
(Dakar, S aint-Louis, L ouga, a nd K aolack), an i ncrease i n t he vol ume of w astewater
collection and treatment in project zones, and updating of network mapping by establishing a
geographic information system. To this end, the following work was planned: (i) building of
two water purification plants in peri-urban areas with a capacity to meet the needs of 12,500
inhabitants (875 m 3/day for Niayes) and for Cité SHS, a capacity to meet the needs of 8,500
inhabitants (595 m 3/day); (ii) doubl ing of t he c apacity of t he C ambérène purification plant;
(iii) r estructuring o f th e n etworks in th e p arts o f D akar w ith s anitation s ervices; (iv)

2.2       Project Coordination and Management

2.2.1 Responsibilities of the Coordinator

      ·   Day-to-day coordination of the project activities and components implemented by the
          various executing agencies;

      ·   Coordination of r elations w ith donor s ( preparation of m eetings w ith don ors a nd t he
          different e valuation a nd s upervision m issions) a nd m onitoring of f inancing
          agreements ( including t he m onitoring, on a r egular ba sis, of c ommitments m ade b y
          the Government under the project agreements through each executing agency);

      ·   On-site t echnical a nd f inancial m onitoring of t he pr oject a nd m onitoring of t he
          activities related to all components;

      ·   Preparation of a nnual p roject bud gets a nd m onitoring of t heir e xecution b y t he
          executing agencies;

      ·   Preparation of and participation in the different workshops provided for in the project;

      ·   Monitoring of t rends i n pe rformance i ndicators w ith e ach e xecuting a gency i n
          question;

      ·   Preparation o f a s emi-annual s ummary p rogress r eport c ontaining, i n particular,

          financial situation, and trends in monitoring indicators;

      ·   Centralization and coordination of the training and capacity-building needs of project
          staff and executing agencies; and

      ·   Coordination of communication and information activities.

2.2.2 Relations between the Project Coordinator and Policymakers (all relevant entities).
These relations proved to be very good over the course of project implementation. In view of
the c lose l inks be tween t he pr oject a nd t he i mplementation of s ector r eform, t he pr oject
coordinator played an increasingly important role that went beyond his terms of reference, as
he w as a ppointed t echnical a dvisor t o t he m inisters w ith r esponsibility f or w ater, and a
member o f t he co mmittee t asked w ith m onitoring t he co ncession an d l ease ag reements. H e
also pl ayed a ke y r ole i n c oordinating t he pr eparation of t he P LT ( 1997-2001). H e

simultaneously coordinated t he P SE and the P LT between 2001 a nd 2004. T he coordinator
also enjoyed excellent relations with the Water and Sanitation Director, and benefited from
the t rust pl aced i n hi m by t he pol icymakers f or t he pr eparation of t he s econd ge neration
reform in 2005 and the consecutive negotiations with the private operator to extend the lease
agreement from 2006 to 2011.

2.2.3 Relations between the Project Coordinator and Managers of the Various
Components. These r elations ar e considered e xcellent. T he ex ecuting a gencies cl early
understood and accepted the role of the Unit, which was not established to replace them, but
to provide support and build their capacities with a view to ensuring sound project execution

maintained.

2.3.   Project Impact on Implementation of the National Poverty Reduction and Social
Protection Policy
a) Access to water services. In t he p roject areas, 1, 415,000 a dditional i ndividuals g ained
   access t o w ater s ervices ( 725,000 i n D akar and 690,000 i n i nterior a reas), t hat i s, 141
   percent of the initial target of one million additional persons. The level of achievement is
   much higher in secondary cities (362 percent of the target), while in the capital, it is 91
   percent. As the overall connection rate in Dakar already stands at 98 p ercent, the initial
   target c ould not be a chieved be cause i t w as b ased on a n e xtremely h igh popul ation
   growth projection. The overall access rate also shows that populations in unserved areas
   have, t o a l arge extent, benefited from t he project, i n accordance with t he development
   objective.
b) Access to sanitation services. The level of achievement was 103 percent of the target for
   collective sanitation (144,500 persons connected compared to the target of 140,000), and
   146 percent for on-site and semi-collective sanitation (583,000 persons served compared
   to t he t arget of 400,000 ). T he pr oject's obj ectives w ith r espect t o c ommunity ( public
   lavatories) and s chool sanitation facilities and h ygiene education w ere largely m et with
   the implementation of a mechanism to generate and manage demand for on-site sanitation
   services, which will be replicated in new programs under PEPAM.

III. ASSESSMENT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE WORLD BANK AND THE
GOVERNMENT, AND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

3.1       Assessment of the Activities of the World Bank during Project Execution

3.1.1 Main Decisions that Favored Project Execution
      -    The conclusion of the PLT credit agreement in May 2001 with substantial financing
           (US$125 million) and on-lending of a significant portion of the loan to SONES in the
           form of equity in order to mitigate the impact on water rates;
      - The r egular hol ding of s upervision m issions f ostered on going c onsultation a nd
           ensured that the stakeholders remained cognizant of their obligations;
      - The effective assignment of roles among the team leader and the other team officials,
           which m ade i t pos sible to obt ain no obj ections within a r easonable t imeframe a nd
           monitor files;
      - The ong oing di alogue w ith t he G overnment on m ajor i ssues r elated t o t he
           development of the sector and its financial equilibrium, in particular during decisions
           pertaining to the means of financing for urban water investments and the procurement
           method for the construction of a 70 ki lometer transmission pipe (1200 mm) between
           Keur Momar Sarr and Guéoul;
-     The decision to reduce the number of beneficiaries of individual sanitation facilities from
      50 percent to 25 pe rcent made it possible to expedite implementation of this component,
      which ha d c ome t o a s tandstill, de spite c ommunication a nd a wareness c ampaigns
      conducted by ONAS and AGETIP; and
-     The decision to re-allocate the substantial savings generated from the invitation to tender
      for the transmission pipe (CFAF 10 billion in savings) in order to begin doubling capacity
      at t he K eur M omar S ARR t reatment s tation, w hich w as not i ncluded i n t he pr oject's
      initial description.

3.1.2. Main Decisions that Impeded Project Execution: None

3.1.3. Project Monitoring by the World Bank. Monitoring missions were held on a regular
basis (every six months) and were very useful. They led to enhanced coordination with other
donors and the Government. They were carried out in a consensual and participatory manner,
as evidenced by the fact that the Ministry of Finance co-signed all the aide-mémoires of the
World Bank as well as the absence of any obvious divergence of views between the World
Bank and the Government on the progress of the project and the results of the reform effort.

3.1.4 Main Lessons Learned
-     The quality of the dialogue between the donor and the Government is crucial before and
      after project execution in order to ensure achievement of the objectives;
-     The stability of both teams fosters mutual respect and trust, in particular with respect to
      the sharing of common views regarding the sector's institutional development; and
-     The regular supervision missions, which focused on m onitoring and evaluation, are very
      useful i n i dentifying di fficulties a nd r eadjusting a pproaches i n or der t o a void pr oject
      stagnation.




                                                   47
3.2       Assessment of the Government's Activities during Project Execution

3.2.1 Main Decisions Favoring Project Execution
              The Government observed the action plan for the timely payment of its bills;
              The G overnment a djusted w ater r ates on a r egular ba sis t o e nsure t he f inancial
              equilibrium of SONES and ONAS;
              The Government respected the decision-making autonomy of SONES and ONAS
              and di d not g et i nvolved i n i nternal pr ocurement pr ocedures or i n f inancial
              management; and
              The G overnment de cided t o us e i ts ow n f unds t o f inance d rainage w orks a t
              Triangle Sud by s ignificantly in creasing its c ontribution, f ollowing th e IDA-
              financed study.

3.2.2 Main Decisions (or Absence of Decisions) that Impeded Project Execution: None

3.2.3 Cash Flow and Counterpart Problems faced by the Government. No pr oblem w as
noted i n t his r egard. C ounterpart e xpenses, i n p articular f or O NAS w ork a nd e quipment
financed by IDA, were met regularly.

3.2.4 Project Monitoring by the Line Ministry and/or the Executing Agency. This
monitoring is r ated a s very s atisfactory given th e genuine commitment o f th e v arious
ministers to implement the recommendations set forth in the aide-mémoires, increase water
rates, and monitor the timely payment of Government bills.

3.2.5 Change(s) in Government, if Any, and Impact on the Project. The various changes in
ministers or ministerial oversight did not have a negative impact on the project, owing to the
effectiveness of t he pr oject's i nstitutional a rrangements, w ith t he c onclusion of pr oject
agreements w ith S ONES a nd O NAS a nd c ontinuity p rovided b y t he C oordinating U nit.
Successive governments have honored commitments, including with respect to annual water
rate adjustments.

3.2.6 Main Lessons Learned
-     A strong sense of ownership of the reform and the project, which is key at the level of the
      Government, in particular the Ministry of Finance. The Government viewed this reform
      as i ts ow n a nd a s t he f irst publ ic-private pa rtnership, a nd di d e verything pos sible t o
      ensure i ts co mplete s uccess b y granting t he act ors t he n ecessary autonomy and
      monitoring delivery on its commitments;
-     The i mportance of t he a ction pl an i n t he Letter of S ector P olicy for monitoring t he
      Government's commitments, in particular with respect to the Government's bills; and
-     The importance of a coordinating unit that is involved not only in the implementation and
      financial monitoring of the project, but also in monitoring reform in close collaboration
      with the Government.

3.3   Evaluation of the Effectiveness and Quality of Relations between the World
Bank and the Government during Project Execution




                                                    48
These r elations w ere characterized b y m utual t rust an d t he d esire for t he s uccess o f t he
reform effort and the project, which have been heralded as models in the sub-region. Regular
consultations and ongoing contact on all issues made it possible to overcome any difficulties
that could have impeded the success of the project.

3.4    Evaluation of the Performance of the Various Institutions, Consulting Firms,
and Consultants who Participated in Project Activities (Costs, Benefits)
In general, c onsulting f irms di d s atisfactory w ork, ow ing t o s tringent s election m ethods.

4.1.2 Value and Level of Recovery of Counterpart Funds from the Government. During the
2002-2008 pe riod, t otal S tate c ounterpart f unds pr ogrammed f or t he implementation of
project activities s tood at C FAF 2.185 bi llion. A t otal of C FAF 1.973 bi llion was actually
mobilized, r epresenting a f inancial execution r ate of 90.3 pe rcent of t he counterpart f unds.
Compared to the rates achieved by other sector projects, this rate is considered exceptional.

The pr ogramming pr epared i n 2009 ( CFAF 7 1 million) f ollowing t he e xtension of t he
project, as w ell as for 2 010 (CFAF 125 m illion), m ust be added t o t his amount i n order t o
guarantee counterpart funds for p roject works for which credit could not be m obilized. All


                                                 49
told, the contribution from the State amounted to CFAF 2.133 bi llion. If the drainage works
at Triangle Sud, which are being fully funded by the State in the amount of CFAF 2 bi llion,
are included, total mobilized counterpart funds would be on the order of CFAF 4 billion. It is
important t o poi nt out t hat t he c ontract a mount s et f orth i n t he credit agreement s tood a t
US$1.96 million, that is, approximately CFAF 1.05 billion (calculated at an exchange rate of
US$1 = C FAF 535) . T he t otal a mount of t he c ounterpart f unds compared t o t he c ontract
amount shows that the State quadrupled its commitments.
The Public Treasury did not encounter any difficulties in paying counterpart expenses.

4.2     Recurrent Costs Generated by the Project and Impacting the State Budget

Before 2007, the project did not generate any recurrent costs that impact public finance. In
the case o f water, companies that were established as a r esult of the reform effort (SONES
and SDE) achieved their financial equilibrium in 2003 and recurrent costs were subsequently
covered through sector revenues and efficiency gains despite inflation. This was also the case
for O NAS, w hich di d not r eceive any Government s ubsidies be fore 2006 t o c over i ts
operating costs. The costs generated by the PCU are linked to the project and will be phased
out when the project is closed.

However, s ince 2007, efficiency gains h ave no t m ade i t pos sible t o ensure t he s ector's
financial equilibrium, and the State, not wanting to make households and manufacturers bear
the a dditional c osts, a ssumed r esponsibility f or all of t he r ate i ncreases i n i ts budg et b y
increasing Government r ates a nd di rect s ubsidies t o O NAS. T he s ize of t he G overnment's
bills has therefore increased substantially and the impact of the project on publ ic finances is
greater than expected. This situation could nevertheless be reversed if the Government once
again de cides t o a dopt t he pr evious a rrangement, w ith a m ore e quitable distribution of t he
rate increases across all categories of consumers.

4.3    Foreseeable Consequences of the Conclusion of the Project on the Institutional
Structures Established in the Context of the Project

SONES, which has a 30-year concession agreement, is a model asset-holding company that
has demonstrated its capacity to manage major projects. It achieved financial equilibrium in
2003 a s e xpected, a s a r esult of t he f inancial e quilibrium m odel e stablished s ince t he
beginning of t he r eform pr ocess, w hich h as pr oved t o be a pow erful t ool f or t he f inancial

servicing with respect to donors. It demonstrated its capacity to mobilize additional financing
even before the conclusion of the project by securing CFAF 41 million during the first phase
of PEPAM.
SDE, w hose c ontract e xpires i n 2011, i s pa id o n t he ba sis of an ope rator's pr ice t hat i s

contractual obligations.
ONAS is meeting its current costs related to operations and the r eplacement of equipment,
the lifespan of which does not exceed 15 years.

The P CU w as r etained and pe rforms t he s ame functions unde r P EPAM, w hich i t h elped
prepare using IDA funds from the PLT. The trust placed in it by the other donors, particularly
the AfDB, to coordinate their projects under PEPAM is a testimony to the unit's successful
capacity-building efforts over the course of the PLT.
In conclusion, t he e nd o f t he pr oject w ill not ha ve a ne gative i mpact on t hese i nstitutions,
given that the project was designed in such a way as to ensure their financial viability during
its execution.

4.4     Main Lessons Learned

    (iv) agreeing to on-lend a substantial portion of IDA funding to SONES, in the form of
    equity in the company;
(2) The performance contract between SONES and SDE resulted in adherence to the sector's
    main indicators. In this regard, SDE, which received ISO 9001 version 2000 certification
    in 2002, he lped t he water s ector i mprove i ts pe rformance, i n t erms of w ater qua lity on
