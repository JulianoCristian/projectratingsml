The water sector project resulted in\n            significantly better services and financial health for the\n            sector. Approximately one million extra people got water\n            supply services. Social connections, changed billing\n            practices, and more stand posts ensured the poor benefited\n            from service expansion. Existing customers got more water of\n            better quality. In addition, the utility is better run, with\n            lower water losses and higher bill recovery. Keys to success\n            were strong leadership and political will combined with an\n            innovative institutional structure."}, "docdt": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
