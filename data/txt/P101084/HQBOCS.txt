Re: BOLIVIA: Credit No. 4396-BO (Investing in Children and Youth Project)
Second Amendment to the Financing Agreement
Excellency,
Please refer to the Financing Agreement between the Plurinational State of Bolivia
(formerly known as the Republic of Bolivia) (The Recipient) and the International Development
Association (The Association), dated July 31, 2008, as amended on January 13, 2011, for the
Investing in Children and Youth Project (Project), and to your letter dated November 12, 2013
requesting the Association to extend the closing date, reallocate resources among disbursement
categories and cancel a specific amount provided for under the Financing Agreement.
I am pleased to inform you that the Association has established December 31, 2014 as the
later date for purposes of Section IV.B.4 of Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement.
We also refer to your request for a cancellation of unused funds of the Financing
Agreement. In view of the foregoing, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.01 of the
General Conditions for Credits applicable to the Financing Agreement, the Association hereby
cancels, as of November 13, 2013, the amount of SDR 2,496,437 originally allocated to
Categories 1(a) and (b) of the table on Section IV.A.2 of Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement.
In addition, we also refer to your request for a reallocation of proceeds allocated to the
Categories set forth in Section IV.A.2 of Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement, as follows: an
amount equal to SDR 1,323,000 from Category 1 (a) and (b) to Category 2 (SDR 1.1 million) and
Category 3 (SDR 0.223 million).
The table in Section IV.A.2 of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement is amended to: (i)
reflect the cancellation by the Recipient of SDR 2,496,437; and (ii) reallocate Loan proceeds.
Consequently, the revised table is hereby replaced to read as set forth in the Annex to this
Amendment Letter.


﻿The commitment charges on the amount cancelled cease to accrue from November 13,
2013.
The Amortization Schedule is being revised by the Bank as a result of the cancellation,
and, if applicable, the revised figures will be sent to you shortly.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and dating this
Amendment Letter in the spaces provided below. All other provisions of the Financing
Agreement except as amended through this Amendment Letter shall remain in full force and
effect. This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two (2) counterparts each of which shall be
an original.
The provisions set forth in this Amendment Letter shall become effective as of the date
above-written, upon receipt by the Association of one fully executed original of this Amendment
Letter.
Please also note that the approved Restructuring Paper dated December 26, 2013 will be
disclosed on the Association's external website.
