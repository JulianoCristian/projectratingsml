Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The proposed Project seeks to assist the Government of Bolivia in strengthening the effectiveness of its social protection system by supporting the
 design, financing and implementation of two flagship interventions of the social protection network strategy, while enhancing its capacity to
 coordinate and monitor programs that are part of the social protection network. In this context, the development objectives of the proposed Project
 are to: (i) contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children ages 0-2 years old living in the most vulnerable rural areas of
 the country; (ii) improve the management and operation of a skills development program for low income youth to enhance its effectiveness in
 increasing their ability to find and maintain a good quality job; and (iii) improve Government capacity to design and manage a coherent, measurable,
 and effective social protection network in the medium term.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This is the last ISR before Project closing. It includes findings from three support to implementation missions held from December 8-12, 2014, March 23-
 26, 2015 and June 15-19, 2015, and one technical visit held from February 9-11, 2015. Overall Project Development Objective achievement is
 considered moderately unsatisfactory, mainly due to the inability to attribute the reduction of chronic malnutrition in children ages 0-2 years living in
 rural areas to Project interventions and the relatively high importance of this first PDO objective in terms of Project resources compared to the other
 PDO objectives. In this regard, however, it is important to note that there has been substantial decrease in malnutrition rates among children age 0-2 in
 participating municipalities, although causality between the Project and this decrease could not be established under the Impact Evaluation conducted in
 2012. Conversely, the Project has achieved its objectives of enhancing the employability of youth participating in skills development programs (PDO
 objective 2) as shown by the results of a survey tracking employment among trainees one year after graduating from the program. Likewise, the Project
 has achieved the objective of enhancing the Government’s capacity to design and manage an effective social protection network (PDO objective 3), as
 evidenced by substantial improvements in its ability to monitor and evaluate social programs.

 Overall Comments
 In this ISR, the team included all the indicators in the portal, action that was not mandatory at the time of launching the portal. PDO and
 intermediate indicators have been tracked in each supervision mission, including a description of the trends in those indicators and providing the
 likelihood of reaching target at the end of the project. A detailed annex in the attached Aide Memoire tracks the Result Framework of the Project.
 Project Development Objective Indicators number 1, 2 and 4 and Intermediate Result Indicator number 7 (Component 1) will not be updated at
 the end of the Project as the source of information is the Impact Evaluation that was conducted at the end of 2012. , it is important to note that
 there has been substantial decrease in malnutrition rates among children age 0-2 in participating municipalities (PDO indicator #1), although
 causality between the Project and this decrease could not be established under the Impact Evaluation conducted in 2012.
 Intermediate Result Indicators number 10, 11 and 12 of Component 1 are unlikely to have information by the end of the Project, as the Borrower
 did not implement a trackable grievance address mechanism to manage complaints about BJA and beneficiary surveys.
