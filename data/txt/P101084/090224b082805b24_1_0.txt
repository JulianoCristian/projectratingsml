                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed Project seeks to assist the Government of Bolivia in strengthening the effectiveness of its social protection system by supporting the design, financing
                         and implementation of two flagship interventions of the social protection network strategy, while enhancing its capacity to coordinate and monitor programs that are
                         part of the social protection network. In this context, the development objectives of the proposed Project are to: (i) contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of chronic
                         malnutrition in children ages 0-2 years old living in the most vulnerable rural areas of the country; (ii) improve the management and operation of a skills development
                         program for low income youth to enhance its effectiveness in increasing their ability to find and maintain a good quality job; and (iii) improve Government capacity to
                         design and manage a coherent, measurable, and effective social protection network in the medium term.

                         amount currently allocated to the Project of SDR 8.4 million (USD 12.46 million), SDR 5.04 million (USD 7.48 million) has been disbursed. There are upcoming reimbursements of
                         pre-financed expenditures under Component 1 in the amount of SDR1.96 million (US$ 2.95 million). Undisbursed funds of Component 2 and 3 are fully committed.

                         The Government recently released results of three evaluations (the impact evaluation of Bono Juana Azurduy Program -BJA-, a process evaluation of the BJA, and a tracking survey

                         of the Mi Primer Empleo Program –MPED-) which provide information for evaluating progress towards attaining the Development Objectives. The findings of these evaluations
                         indicate that five out of seven key development indicators are on track to be achieved, one will not be measured and one will not be achieved by Project’s end.

                         The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor have both strengthened their financial management functions (MoH completed the overdue audit report and restored the FM functions
                         to proceed with the closing of Component 1, and the MoL staffed all the FM positions which allowed to address some of the shortcomings in this area, mostly related to overdue
                         IFRs). Additionally, the MoL has committed almost all of the additional resources allocated after the December 2013 restructuring. Therefore, the Bank team proposes a change in the
                         Project implementation rating from Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory.

                         Government has requested an extension of the Project closing date from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015. This extension would allow completion of the last round of training
                         activities under Component 2, which in turn will allow the Project to achieve the related Development Objective. The restructuring of the Project would also include: (i) a change in the
                         modality of payment of stipends to MPED beneficiaries (which will result in cost savings for Government); (ii) the elimination of the legal requirement to complete a Procurement Audit
                         for Component 3; and (iii) the reallocation of resources between disbursement categories.
