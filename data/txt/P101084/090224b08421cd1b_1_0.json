Some lessons learned included: No project\n            should be started (actually initiated) if some conditions\n            are not present: (a) complete teams of human resources; (b)\n            equipment and infrastructure; and (c) instruments for\n            implementation of the intervention model (Operational\n            Manual, Bidding document, training folders).
