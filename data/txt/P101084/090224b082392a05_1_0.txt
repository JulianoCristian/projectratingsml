                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed Project seeks to assist the Government of Bolivia in strengthening the effectiveness of its social protection system by supporting the design, financing
                         and implementation of two flagship interventions of the social protection network strategy, while enhancing its capacity to coordinate and monitor programs that are
                         part of the social protection network. In this context, the development objectives of the proposed Project are to: (i) contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of chronic
                         malnutrition in children ages 0-2 years old living in the most vulnerable rural areas of the country; (ii) improve the management and operation of a skills development
                         program for low income youth to enhance its effectiveness in increasing their ability to find and maintain a good quality job; and (iii) improve Government capacity to
                         design and manage a coherent, measurable, and effective social protection network in the medium term.
