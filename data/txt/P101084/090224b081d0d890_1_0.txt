                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed Project seeks to assist the Government of Bolivia in strengthening the effectiveness of its social protection system by supporting the design, financing
                         and implementation of two flagship interventions of the social protection network strategy, while enhancing its capacity to coordinate and monitor programs that are
                         part of the social protection network. In this context, the development objectives of the proposed Project are to: (i) contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of chronic
                         malnutrition in children ages 0-2 years old living in the most vulnerable rural areas of the country; (ii) improve the management and operation of a skills development
                         program for low income youth to enhance its effectiveness in increasing their ability to find and maintain a good quality job; and (iii) improve Government capacity to
                         design and manage a coherent, measurable, and effective social protection network in the medium term.

                         third quarter of calendar year 2012, creating delays in remedial actions to increase coverage (number of beneficiaries and compliance with bimonthly health control and expand
                         mobile payments). In the Mid Term Review of December 2012, the Bank and the Government agreed that the Development Objectives of this Component would not be reached by
                         the end of project (December 2013), mainly due the relative low coverage among the pregnant women and children below 2 years old. The MoH has been working on restoring the
                         FM function in terms of having up-to-date accounting records and prepare acceptable financial reports. As of today, the MOH completed the Financial Statements of 2010-2012 that

                         would be subject to a single audit review. The project audit report for Component 1 is overdue since June 30, 2012. Delays in closing these fiduciary issues did not allow increasing
                         the pace of disbursements of the Component 1 of the project.

                         The Mi Primer Empleo Digno Program has executed training activities at a good pace since the end of 2012 (skills development program for low income youth). The MoL is expecting
                         to complete twenty training activities by the end of 2013, representing 600 beneficiaries. Increasing costs of training activities since project appraisal (2008) have reduced the
                         estimated number of beneficiaries under the Component 2 (Improving and expanding a skills development program for low income unemployed youth) to 1110 beneficiaries. ). The
                         job placement rate after internship of the first group of program beneficiaries was higher than 70%, data that will evaluate with a tracking survey that will be conducted by UDAPE in
                         the second semester of 2013. In the Mid Term Review of December 2012, the Bank and the Government agreed that Development Objectives of this Component would be reached
                         by the end of project (December 2013).

                         Component 3 implementing by UDAPE has showed a good implementation since the last ISR. The data collection for the impact evaluation of the BJA was completed and UDAPE
                         informed in the last supervision mission that the first results will be released by the end of July 2013. UDAPE agreed to conduct the tracking survey to Mi Primer Empleo Digno
                         beneficiaries to evaluate job placement rate, level of income, and job conditions. UDAPE also completed the design of a Beneficiary Registry of Social Programs and initiated the use
                         of a new Monitoring System for Social programs. The first reports based on the new monitoring system will be released in the fourth quarter of 2013. In the Mid Term Review of
                         December 2012, the Bank and the Government agreed that Development Objectives of this Component would be reached by the end of project (December 2013).

                         The Government, through a formal agreement from the Minister of Planning Ms. Viviana Caro at the close meeting of the Supervision mission on May 17th, 2013, has agreed to
                         restructure the project in order to improve the use of undisbursed resources.
