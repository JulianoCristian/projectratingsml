Lessons\n            learned from the project: Demand-driven portfolio operations\n            such as the MDP-I and II are effective instruments to\n            promote basic institutional development among municipal\n            governments. Commitment from municipal authorities and\n            personnel is important for the success of municipal\n            strengthening projects. Demand-driven portfolio operations,\n            such as the MDP-I and II, provide great flexibility and risk\n            diversification, but the overall portfolio tends to be\n            rather fragmented. An important role for subnational\n            governments is critical to the success of the project. Keep\n            subproject requirements within reasonable bounds. While the\n            MDP-II operation was not targeted at poverty alleviation,\n            this type of operation offers the opportunity to improve\n            living conditions of the poor. Ensuring technical soundness\n            of individual investments can be challenging in\n            demand-driven operation of such a broad scope as the MDP-I\n            and II. The vertical integration of the basic management\n            tools at the provincial and municipal levels is critical to\n            fully capitalize on their potential fiscal impact and ensure\n            their sustainability over time. Provincial governments need\n            to play a key role in the design and implementation of\n            municipal development strategies. Dissemination has to be\n            considered as an important activity at the onset of a\n            project, and treated as such in terms of inputs, outputs,\n            timetable, and impact. Demand-driven portfolio operations\n            can serve as incubators, fostering the generation of\n            innovative solutions for common problems. Decentralize all\n            review, procurement, and disbursement procedures as much as\n            possible. Do not expect municipal portfolio projects to\n            disburse quickly and easily at first. Field visits to\n            provinces and municipalities are necessary for the effective\n            supervision of municipal projects."}, "docdt": "2005-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
