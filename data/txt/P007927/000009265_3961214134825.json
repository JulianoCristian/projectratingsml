underserved Paraguayan population,\n            particularly women and children. To achieve this objective,\n            the project will: 1) increase the coverage, quality and\n            efficiency of basic maternal and child health services in\n            six underserved departments in Northeastern Paraguay; 2)\n            increase the population's knowledge about adequate\n            health practices; 3) pilot-test a strategy to enhance early\n            child development in Asuncion; and 4) strengthen management\n            capability in support of an eventual decentralization of a\n            public health services in project areas. It is expected that\n            the project will: (a) increase the coverage and quality of\n            institutional deliveries; (b) improve the safety of home\n            deliveries; (c) improve the detection, transport and\n            treatment of obstetric complications; (d) improve access to\n            reproductive health services and information; (e) improve\n            immunization coverage; (f) reduce the incidence of acute\n            respiratory infections and diarrheal disease; (g) improve\n            children's schooling readiness; and (h) increase\n            community involvement in both health and child development\n            activities. The components of the project are as follows: 1)\n            maternal and child health care, including: (i)\n            rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure and\n            equipment; (ii) pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; (iii)\n            information, education and communication; and (iv) training;\n            2) early child development pilot; and 3) strengthening\n            management for the decentralization of health services in\n            project areas."}, "docdt": "1996-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
