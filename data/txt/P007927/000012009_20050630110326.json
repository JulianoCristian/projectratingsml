Likewise, both the Bank\n            and Borrower performances were unsatisfactory. Several\n            lessons outline the following. The experience with the\n            Project shows that leaving behind the definition of the\n            baseline data, and of a realistic set of (targets)\n            monitoring and evaluation based on performance indicators,\n            the actual project implementation becomes highly risky. The\n            planned baseline survey was not carried out, making not only\n            the evaluation of the Project very difficult, but also\n            deprived Project management in the Government, and the Bank\n            of an important tool, which could have had the required\n            corrective action. Moreover, this experience reinforces that\n            to achieve success, concerted efforts to engage key members\n            of the Government, the executing agency, and the targeted\n            communities, should be established at the earliest stages of\n            Project preparation. This will also align Project\n            interventions to existing programs, familiar to those\n            actors, since even a well designed Project, if implemented\n            in isolation, faces the high risk of not succeeding in\n            reaching its objectives. Further lessons suggest that\n            training, and retraining strategies need to be part of a\n            staff development system that considers not only the skill\n            needs by level, but also the adequate methodologies to\n            transmit such skills to different types and levels of\n            personnel, which includes on the job-training; and,\n            implementation arrangements need to be carefully tailored to\n            the institutional capacity of the country, closely monitored\n            during Project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
