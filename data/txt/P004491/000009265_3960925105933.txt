URBAN ENGINEERING PROJECT (LOAnJ 2067-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This report presents the result of a review of the Urban Engineering
Project (UEP), which was financed by a Bank loan of $8.0 million to the
Government of the Philippines (GOP).  The UEP was implemented by the National
Economic Development Authority (NEDA) to assist the Government in furthering
preparation of the Regional Cities Development Project (RCDP) and the Central
Visayas Regional Project II (Urban) (CVRP II).  The loan financed 100% of all
relevant consultants' services required for preparation activities in the
period June 1, 1982 through June 30, 1986. Minor equipment purchases and a
$0.15 million training component were also financed. All local staff and
operaticnal costs were financed separately by the GOP.  The loan was approved
on December 8, 1981, and became effective on May 20, 1982.  The original clos-
ing date of June 30, 1985 was extended to June 30, 1986, due to uncertainties
pertaining to scope, scale and timing of the CVRP II.
At the time *f loan closing, all major prtLject objectives had been
achieved. Actual loa.i disbursements were about $7.3 million. The balance of
about $0.7 million, cau3ed by several peso devaluations, has been cancelled.
Attached is the Project Completior. Report (PCR) prepared by the
Urban and Water Supply Division of the East Asia and Pacific Regional Projects
Department. The PCR is based on the Bank's files and on information supplied
by NEDA. The principal documents used in preparing the report are listed in
Annex 1.
Following normal OED procedures, a copy of the draft PCR was sent
to the Borrower and Executing Agency. Comments received from NEDA have been
reproduced as an Attachment to the report.

PHILIPPINES
URBAN ENCINEERINC PROJECT (LOAN 2067-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
i.        The Urban Engineering Project was designed to assist the Government
of the Philippines to f1xrtrher nreparation of the Regional Cities Development
Project (RCDP) and the Central Visayas Regional Project II (CVRP II):
(a)  In 1979, the Government requested Bank support for RCDP, as its
first major urban intervention outside Metro Manila.  RCDP was
planned as a multi-sectoral project in four regional centers, with
investments concentrated on industrial estates, shelter, urban
infrastructure, and municipal facilities
(b) In 1977, the Government and the Bank agreed to formulate a regional
development project for the Central Visayas (Region VII), which
would be considered for Bank support. The project was divided in
1981 into two separate but related rural and urban projects, the
Central Visayas Regiotual Project I (Rural) and the Central Visayas
Regional Project II (Urban), respectively. CVRP II, which covers
Metre Cebu and two other regional centers, was planned as a multi-
sectoral project focusing on transport, urban services, shelter, and
industry. The project included strengthening of the capacities of
local governments to deliver urban services, improvement of existing
revenue-generating programs, and the provision of related trai. ;ng
activities.
ii.       Preparation of the two projects was under the overall guidance and
direction of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). For RCDP
preparation, the Bank provided $0.5 million under Loan 1647-PH and $4.6
million under Loan 1821-PH. CVRP II preparation was funded with $0.5 million
under Loan 1647-PH. Since no further funding to complete preparation
activities was available from these or other sources, in May 1981 the
Government requested additional Bank assistance under an Urban Engineering
Project (UEP), for which the Board approved an $8 million loan in December
1981.  It was thought that financing the preparation of the RCDP and the CVRP
II under one engineering loan wouldnot only provide the required level of
financing which could not be made available under a Project Preparation
Facility, but would also consolidate project preparation activities, in order
to facilitate overall operational and financial management, and provide a
basis for economies of scale.
iii.      The loan was to finance the cost of consultants' services for
detailed engineering for RCDP priority investments as well as feasibility
studies and detailed engineering for CVRP II priority investments.  The
balance of detailed engineering was to be financed later under the two project
loans.



- iv -
iv.       The project, as appraised, called for the use of local and foreign
consulting firms, under joint venture arrangements as appropriate. The guid-
ing principle for consultants' services was optLimum use of Filipino staff and
consultants. It was recognized, however, that expatriate consultants (about
40X of total consultant man-months) woutd be required to supplement local
skills and provide on-the-job training in certain d'sciplines during the
start-up of feasibility studies and detailed engineering. It was expected
that, as detailed engineering proceeded beyond the scope ot the UEP,
expatriate consultants would he largely replaced by local consultants, and
eventually by local protessional statt.
v.        When the UEP was initiatpd, the- t;t)al cost for the RCDP was
estimated at about $120-150 million, and phvsical implementation was scheduled
to start in early 1983, for completion by December 1986. (The actual RCDP
cost will be about $70 million; implementation began in March 1984 and is
still in progress.) For CVRP fI, the total estimated cost was originally
about $80-100 million, with physical implementation scheduled to start in 1984
for completion by December 1987. (The updated estimated CVRP II cost is about
$40 million. The Government has not yet decided whether to proceed with the
project as designed or redefine its scope).
vi.       Total UEP costs were estimated at about $11.5 million equivalent.
The $8.0 million loan financed 100% of eligible expenditures for consultants'
contracts, and minor equipmeait purchases and training activities. The Govern-
ment financed staff services and maintenance and operating expenditures from
its own budgetary resources; no project expenditures were jointly financed by
the Government and the Bank. NEDA was assigned overall responsibility for
project execution, which was to take place between January 1982 and December
1984.
vii.      The UEP was actually implemented from June 1982 through June 1986.
The implementation period was longer than expected due to uncertainties which
arose regarding the scope, scale and timing of CVRP IT. About $7.33 million
was disbursed, and the $0.67 million balance was cancelled. The disbursement
shortfall was caused by several devaluations of the peso during the project
period, which reduced the dollar amounLs disbursed since 40% of expenditures
were in pesos.
viii.           The UEP was of vital importance for continued preparation of
RCDP and CVRP II, and all major objectives of the project were fulfilled in
quantitative terms. Nonquantitative benefits were also achieved; the policy-
makers and project managers concerned were exposed to issues relating to urban
investment planning and resource management, and project studies generated a
potential in the project cities for improved approaches to infrastructure
maintenance, solid wastes management, and--under CVRP IT--traffic engineering
and management.
ix   .    However, project preparation was more costly than expected, if
measured as a percentage of actual devaluated investment costs. This was
primarily due to the liberal use of expatriate advisors. Their services were
used even for rather unsophisticated engineering and planning tasks, for which
local consulting firms could have been used more extensively, assisted



selectively as appropriate by expatriate advisors. The overall loan-financed
cost of feasibility studies for CVRP II was about 9% of estimated investment
costs, including preparation funds provided under Loan 1647-PH, but
disregarding all local staff and operating costs financed separately by GOP.
This is a high percentage compared to standard planning norms, about 3%. On
the other hand, the corresponding percentage for detailed engineering executed
under the project--mainly for road components--was only about 4%, because of
efficient use of local consultants for this task.
X.        For RCDP, the overall loan-financed cost of feasibility studies was
about 7.5% of estimated investment costs, including preparation funds provided
under Loans 1647-PH and 1821-PH but disregarding all local staff and operating
costs financed separately by GOP. RCDP detailed engineering costs were about
41 of corresponding investment costs, when done by local consultants, which is
a reasonable and acceptable ratio. However, for detailed engineering done in-
house by the cities concerned, the percentage was about 15% without and about
281 with inputs from expatriate consultants. (This latter figure is actually
somewhat lower than 28% since the expatriate consultants also carried out
other project-related activities.)
xi.       In any case, these high ratios reflect the RCDP cities* strategy
under the project of attempting to develop in-house project design talent at
the city level. This Bank supported strategy was not successful, and in
retrospect it would probably have been better to use local consulting firms
through the whole preparation cycle.  Lessons learned under the project
indicate that, in the preparation of future urban-oriented projects in the
Philippines, local consultants should have the lead in most project prepara-
tion contracts, augmented by minimal expatriate expert assistance when
needed. Local government officials should be trained in overall project
management, especially in the areas of contracting out and managing private
sector design and construction services. And finally, the participation of
expatriate assistance in the preparation of urban projects could and should be
substantially reduced.

URBAN ENGINEERING PROJECT (LOAN 2067-PH)
Project Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Urban Engineering Project was designed to assist the Government
of the Philippines to further preparation of two urban development projects,
which evolved as follows. In keeping with the need to develop the country's
principal regional urban centers, the Ministry of Public Works and Highways
(MPWH) undertook Bank-financed studies in 1977 to identify a possible
secondary cities project. These studies led to a proposal in 1979 for the
Regional Cities Development Project (RCDP), as the Government's first major
urban intervention outside Metro Manila. Under the effective control of the
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), the RCDP was planned as a
multi-sectoral project in the cities of Davao, Bacolod, Iloilo and Cagayan de
Oro. Investments were to be concentrated on industrial estates, transport
(roads, traffic management, road maintenance), shelter (sites and services,
slum upgrading) and municipal facilities (solid waste management, sanitation,
markets, fire protection, slaughterhouses).
1.2       In 1977, the Government and the Bank agreed to formulate a regional
development project for the Central Visayas (Region VII). In early 1981, it
was agreed that this project should be processed as two separate, but related,
rural and urban projects known as the Central Visayas Regional Project I
(Rural) and the Central Visayas Regional Project II (Urban). CVRP II includes
Metro Cebu, the country's second largest urban area, as well as the cities of
Dumaguete, capital of Negros Oriental Province, and Tagbilaran, capital of
Bohal Province. Like RCDP, CVRP II was planned as a multi-sectoral proiect,
focusing on transport (rcads, traffic management, maintenance, bus terminals),
urban services (drainage and sanitation, solid waste management, markets),
shelter and livelihood (sites a,nd services, slum upgrading, min: industrial
estates), and industry (industrial development studies, industrial estates).
Tn addition, consultants' services and technical assistance would be provided
to strengthen local governments' urban service delivery, improve existing
revenue-generating programs and provide related training activities.
1.3       The Urban Engineering Project arose in response to a Government
request in May 1981 for Bank assistance in completing preparation of RCDP and
CVRP II. Prior preparation of RCDP, jointly financed by the Government and
the Bank under the overall direction and guidance of NEDA, had included
project identification, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, aerial
photography and mapping, municipal financial management studies, and other
specialized studies. The Bank had financed related consultants' services,
totaling about $5.1 million equivalent, under Loan 1647-PH ($0.5 million) and



-2-
Loan 1821-PH ($4.6 million).!"  Preparation of CVRP II was less advanced.
About $0.5 million had been committed under Loan 1647-PH for aerial photo-
graphy and mapping, project management assistance, and specialized short-term
services for a Project Management Plan, PROMAP. No additional funding for
further project preparation was available under the two above loans or from
other sources, which prompted the Government's request for assistance under an
Urhan Engineering Project (UEP).
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES, DESCRIPTION, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Project Objectives
2.1       The objectives of the UEP were to assist the Government in financing
(a) detailed engineering and related activities for the RCDP during the
period January 1982 through March 1983;
(b) feasibility studies, detailed engineering and related activities for
the CVRP II in the period January 1982 through May 1984; and
(c) a training program to upgrade the quality of government urban trans-
port specialists, and to strengthen the project planning and imple-
mentation capabilities of municipal governments.
B. Project Description, Costs, and Financing
2.2       The UEP was appraised in June/July 1981.  Its scope and scale were
based on the following assumptions:
(a) The RCDP, with a total estimated cost of about $120-150 million (net
of land acquisition) at the time of UEP appraisal, was to be
appraised in April 1982, with physical implementation starting in
early 1983 for completion by December 1986. Detailed engineering
for priority investments to be implemented through 1983 (about 30%
of total investments) would be financed under the UEP; the remainder
of detailed engineering would be financed under the RCDP loan.
1/   The Second and Third Urban Development Projects signed on January 26,
1979 and June 2, 1980, respectively. In addition, preinvestment studies
and detailed engineering for industrial estates and export processing
zones under RCDP were financed under a UNDP grdnt for which the Bank was
the executing agency.
.



-3-
Detailed engineering contracts would be let as soon as preliminary
designs had been review d and agreed between the RCDP Steering
Committee and the Bank.-
F           (b)  The CVRP I1, with a total estimated cost of about $120 million, was
to be appraised in early 1983, with physical implementation starting
in 1984, for completion by December 1987. All feasibility studies/
preliminary engineering and 25% of detailed engineering for invest-
ments to be undertaken through 1984 would be financed under the UEP;
the balance of detailed engineering would be financed u er the
Central Visayas Regional Project I (Rural) and CVRP II._
2.3       The project was presented to the Bank's Board in December 8, 1981,
and the Loan Agreement was signed on February 24, 1982.  The loan became
effective on May 20, 1982.  The $8 million loan for project preparatior was
actually a line of credit made available to the Government to finance 100% of
eligible expenditures for consultants' contracts (and minor equipment
contracts) required to carry out preparatory activities within agreed
objectives. The loan size was determined in relation to the estimated costs
of pri rity investments during the first year of RCDP and CVRP II implementa-
tion.- $200,000 was also included in the loan to finance 100% of the cost of
urban transport and municipal operations training.  The total project cost was
estimated at $11.5 million, including the Government's expenditures for staff
services and maintenance and operating expenses.  The Government and the Bank
did not share the financing of any project expenditures.
C. Key Executing Agencies
2.4       The project was to be implemented between January 1982 and December
1984. NEDA was assigned overall responsibility for project execution.
Executive orders issued in 1980 and 1981 established Project Offices, each.
headed by a Project Director, foT RCDP in Manila, and CVRP in Mandane City,
2/   The RCDP is now under implementation, supported by a $47 million Bank
loan (2257-PH), approved in April 1985. The original loan amount was
$b7 million, but $20 million was cancelled in April 1987 because of
savings caused by several peso devaluations.
3/   Due to GOP indecision about the future of CVRP II, loan negotiations have
been postponed indefinitely.
4/   Costs were estimated as follows:
(a) Feasibility studies/preliminary engineering, about 3% of investment
costs.
(b) Detailed engineering by local consultants, about 4-6% of investment
costs, depending on the type of investment. Additional costs for
detailed engineering by expatriate consultants were estimated
separately.

Metro Cebu. The Project Offices were generally empowered to conduct feasi-
bility studies and detailed engineering, recommend projects feasible for
external financing, and recommend appropriate mechanisms for project implemen-
tation. The Project Offices were also empowered to call upon any ministry or
government corporation required to assist in project preparation. Each RCDP
city also established a city project office tor coordination of city-level
preparation activities and execution of in-house detailed engineering for
selected components.
II.. MAJOR RESULI'S
A. General
3.1       The UEP achieved its main objective to assist in preparation of RCDP
and CVRP TI. Estimated and actual project costs are compared in Table 3.1,
and overviews of the planned and actual outcome of project execution, in terms
of timing, manpower inputs, and loan disbursements are presented in Tables
3.2(a) and (b). Loan closing was originally scheduled for June 30, 1985, but
was extended one year to Juae 30, 1986, due to uncertainties pertaining to the
scope, scale and timing of CVRP 11. Disbursements continued through Decem-
ber 31, 1986, leaving an undisbursed balance in the loan account of about
$0.67 mnillion, which was caniceled.

3.2       The loan balance resulted from successive peso devaluations.
Project execution occurred during a period of economic and financial crisis in
the Philippines, and the peso plunged from about P 7.8 = $1 at appraisal to
about P 20 = $1 in 1985/86. As about 40% of project expenditures were in
pesos, dollar amounts disbursed against contracts denominated in local
currency or with high local currency contents became less than those estimated
at appraisal. NEDA used part of the loan savings to finance additional local
and foreign consultants services for feasiblity studies, and technical
assistance. However, reduction in the scope of both projects resulted in less
use of local consultants for detailed engineering activities. Overall, a
total of 1,585 man-months of consultant services were financed under the
project, a net increase of about 16% over the 1,360 man-months estimated at
appraisal.



- 6 -
B. RCDP Project Preparation
3.3       About 30% of detailed engineering was completed under performance
contracts by local consulting firms, as projected at appraisal. In addition,
about 28% of detailed engineering was completed by in-house staft assisted by
expatriate consultants at NHA and the four city project offices.-   Actual
calendar time spent on these activities was about 24 months, as against 15
months projected at appraisal (see Table 3.2(a)). The delays were caused by a
number of reasons, including elaborate Philippine procedures for short listing
of consulting firms and award of contracts.
3.4       At appraisal and negotiations, optimum use of Filipino staff and
consultants was agreed upon as a guiding principle for project preparation,
and local consulting firms did indeed carry out part of the detailed engineer-
ing for the project. It was recognized, however, that expatriate consultants
would be required to supplement local skills and provide on-the-job training
in certain disciplines during the start-up period. Accordingly, contracts
with the expatriate firms that had executed feasibility studies under perform-
ance contracts were extended under service contracts to guide detailed engi-
neering. This led to libLral use of expatriate services in support of in-
house engineering and planning tasks, some of which could have been executed
under performance contracts by local consulting firms.
3.5       The liberal use of expatriate services greatly increased the cost of
detailed engineering done in-house. Annex 2 shows actual annual loan
disbursements by activities, including contracts for detailed engineering.
Also shown are annual GOP expenditures for staff services and operating and
maintenance expenditures--not financed by the loan--at RCDPO and the four city
offices. Annex 3 shows the peso cost of nivestments for which detailed
engineering (DE) had been substantially completed by June 1986, the closing
date of the loan. The costs are for investments engineered both by local
consultants and by local staff assisted by loan-financed expatriate
advisors. Table 3.3 below, which is based on the two annexes, indicates that
the cost of detailed engineering as a percentage of investment cost is:
(a)  about 4% of corresponding investment costs when done by local
consultants without expatriate inputs, and about 7.5% with
expatriate inputs; and
(b)  about 15% of investment costs when done in-house in the cities
without expatriate inputs, and about 28% with expatriate inputs.
5/   Percentages indicated are the base costs of engineering components,
divided by the total base cost of the RCDP project as revised in June 30,
1986. (Priority one and priority two components).

3.6       While the above percentages are approximate, and the expatriate
consultants performed other tasks in addition to assisting in DE, the implica-
tions are clear. Detailed engineering costs by local consultants, with or
without assistance by expatriate consultants, are reasonable, but those for DE
done in-house are far too high. The cities decided to do part of the
engineering in-house by reason of perceived savings and transfer of technical
skills, but these good intentions were not justified when all cost are
accounted for. (As indicated in Table 3.1, actual costs for RCDP operations--
including those for the four RCDP cities--were also higher than expected, at
about $3.13 million equivalent, ve!-us about $1.67 million equivalent esti-
mated by NEDA at appraisal, or an increase of about 87%.)  In retrospect, it
would have been economically more advantageous to restrict in-house detailed
engineering to a minimum, in favor of optimum use of local consulting firms
and selective use of expatriate consultants.
3.7       Actual total loan disbursements for RCDP preparation were about
$3.63 million, exceeding those projected at appraisal by about $0.33 million,
or about 10%. As indicated in Table 3.2(a), the main reason for this is a 10%
increase in actual man-months used, vis-a-vis appraisal estimates.

C. CVRP II Project Preparation
3.8        Negotiations and Board approval of the CIRP T1  project have been
delayed by about three years compared to the original schedule because of
overall uncertainty pertaining to project timing, scope and scale. Total
project cost, originally estimated at about $80-100 million, is now appraised
at about $42 million, net of land acquisition.
3.9       All feas bility situdies including preliminary engineering were
completed in line with UEP objectives.  Detailed engineering corresponding to
about 40% of the total revised project cost has also been completed, es
against 25% of the original proiect cost envisaged at UEP appraisal.6   The
detailed engineering carried out under the UEf  was mainly for major roads, and
to date only a small amount has been committed for detailing of markets.
Actual calendar time spent on major CVRP II preparation was about 42 months,
versus 36 months envisaged at appraisal.
3.10      A total of about 950 man-months of consultants' services were used
for performance contracts for feasibility studies, detailed engineering,
special studies, and techitical ass.stance (Table 3.2(b)), as against about 800
man-months estimated at appraisal. The proportion of foreign consultants'
man-months is about 25%, as against 35% for RCDP. All detailed engineering so
far has been performed by local consulting firms, at a cost that is about 4%
of corresponding investment costs. The involvement by expatriate consultants
has been minimal, and the remaining detailed engineering will be done in the
same manner. No in-house detailed engineering by the participating cities is
planned.
3.11      Net of equipment costs, actual loan disbursements for CVRP II were
about $3.54 million, or about 20% less than the $4.38 million projected at
appraisal.  The savings are due partly to peso devaluations, and partly to the
relaLively low proportion of foreign consultants' man-months.
D.  Training
3.12      At the time of loan negotiations, it was agreed that the Government
would submit for Bank approval an action program for project training
programs, and the criteria to be used to select program participants.  No such
program was ever submitted. However, 'he loan financed overseas graduate
studies for three government statf in the general area of transport engineer-
ing and planning. Total loan disbursements for this training were about
$118,700. In addition, about $33,100 was disbursed for short-term seminars
attended by four government officials at various institutions in the United
States. Total loan disbursements for training were thus about $152,000, as
against $200,000 projected at appraisal. The savings are due to the lack of
fully developed training programs by the Government.
6/   Percentages indicated are the base cos, of engineered components divided
by the total revised base cost, as tupdated for CVRP II in June, 1986, at
the closing date for the UEP.

E. Procurement, Consultants Performance, and Reporting
3.13      All consultants' contracts were awarded according to procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. Performance by consultants, local and foreign, was
also satisfactory. Reporting requirements were adequately complied with,
particularly by RCDPO.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
4.1       The UEL proved to be of vital importance for continued preparation
of RCDP and CVRP II, and all major objectives were more than fulfilled in
quantitative terms. Nonquantitative benefits also occurred. The policymakers
and project managers concerned were exposed to issues relating to urban
investment planning and resource management. Project studies also generated
in the cities a potential for improved approaches to infrastructure main-
tenance and solid wastes management, and--particularly for CVRP TI--traffic
engineering and management.
4.2       However, project preparation was costly, if measured as a percentage
of investment costs, since economic and political events during the prepara-
tion period necessitated reductions in the scopes of both projects. For
CVRP II, net of detailed engineering, overall Bank-financed preparation costs
were about $3.50 million, including funding provided under Loan 1647-PH
(para. 1.3). In addition, GOP separately financed all local staff and opera-
tional costs, information about which is not available. However, overall
preparation costs are estimated to be at least 10%--and probably more--of the
estimated investment cost, which is high compared to the standard norms, of
about 3%. On the other hand, the corresponding percentage for detailed engi-
neering financed under UEP for CVRP II, about 4% (para. 3.10), is quite
reasonable, because of efficient use of only local consultants for this task.
4.3       Overall Bank-financed preparation cost. for RCDP, net of detailed
engineering costs, but including those financed under Loans 1647-PH and
1821-PH (para. 1.3), are about $5.2 million equivalent, or about 7.5% of
actual investment costs. Additional local staff and operational costs
financed by GOP are not available, but would raise ttLe percentage to at least
about 10%. Again, this is well above standard norms.
4.4       The cost under UEP for in-house detailed engineering of RCDP com-
ponents became too expensive, largely due to the established but inefficient
strategy of attempting to develop project design talent at city level. In
retrospect, city staffs lacked sufficient experience or training to produce
the needed designs, and the use of expatriate consultants to assist them was
far too extensive. The more efficient preparation of CVRP, in which local
design firms (assisted by expatriate consultants) prepared a larger proportion
of the project, tends to support this observation.
4.5       Lessons learned under UEP have important implications for the
preparation of future urban-oriented projects in the Philippines. Considera-



tion ot the following obtectiven fnr rnt ire prrJ3ecrs is suggested.  Ftrst, a
major objective should  et to I urtKr d' velop the pro ject design capabiIities
of the local consultant indusirv, cspecLIaiIy in the identification/feasibi!ity
study phase.  Thi '- cnlii d he accornpldi Thed by giving I ocal consul t ing f i rins the
lead in most project preparat inn coitracts, augmented by minitlmal expatriate
expert assistance where needed, and ensuiring that .he expatriates' Terms of
Reference include trainlnw ot the statf ot local consulting firms.  Second,
priority should be givcn to : ra ni )       oh  (vernment of Iicials in overall
pro ject management, espec 'al ly    t I' aireas of Luntracting out and managing
private sector design and construction services.  It is questionable whether
priority should be gi cn tc  kiop local governmental staff talent in design
functions, given the ri'Imerciu- uth r pri()rit ies of city government , the
difficulty in attracting al:a  ctaining profess onal design talent, and the
presence of a reasonably computetit private sector design industry.  Third,
with the accomplishment of the tirst two ob ectives. the participation of
expatriate assistance i i Lthe prepatraton and management of' urban pro ject s
could and should be slubstanitiallv reduced, The Bank should encourage Lhe
Government to rely fmiore hea;'iIy on Ioca1 consultants and supplement them only
when essential With expatriates.  In tact, a strong movement by governmenit
agencies to rationalize ,he use of eixpatriates has already been noted.
4.6       As for ihe l ,i-tninp Component under the project, a lesson t-o be
drawo from it is the noped for an enfotcement mechanism such as a dated
covenant to ensure its intended implementation.  Although agreed to in the
Minutes of Negotiations and despite several discussions on agreed implementa-
tion of the training program, NEDA /as reluctant to carry out the program in
full accordance wiLh itlS sltaLed cbjectives.
