In order to\n            resolve these constraints the project is composed of several\n            components, including agricultural development, agricultural\n            research, agricultural extension, increasing the\n            availability of improved seeds and seedlings, and plant\n            protection. To improve the project area the project will\n            also contain environmental management, rural water supply,\n            and rural road rehabilitation and maintenance components.\n            Training, studies and technical assistance will be provided\n            to support project implementation. Special emphasis will be\n            given under the project to strengthening key provincial\n            institutions to ensure sustainability of project activities."}, "docdt": "1988-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
