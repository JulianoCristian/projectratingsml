SECOND ARAB POTASH PROJECT
(LOAN 2786-JO)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) Loan 2786-JO in the amount of
US$12 million equivalent for the Second Arab Potash Project (the Project)
was approved on March 10, 1987, signed on March 24, 1987 and became
effective on July 14, 1987. The Loan was fully disbursed on August 28,
1991, 10 months ahead of the original Loan Closing Date. All project
objectives have been met satisfactorily.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Bank's Industry and Energy
Divisions of the EMENA Technical and MN2 Country Departments and the
Borrower, the Arab Potash Company Ltd. (APC). Preparation of this Project
Completion Report (PCR) was initiated in October 1991, and is based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee and Project
Agreements, supervision reports, APC's progress reports and correspondence
between the Bank and APC.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JORDAN
SECOND ARAB POTASH PROJECT
(LOAN 2786-JO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obilectives
To support an increase in the output of APC's existing potash production
facilities to 1.4 million tons per year (mtpy) and provide technical
assistance towards determining future prospects for technology improvement,
cost reduction and expansion, through (a) refinery modifications; (b)
complementary expansion of systems for brine intake, utilities and
downstream refinery processes; (c) consultant studies for future expansion
of solar evaporation/refining capacities optimization of viable schemes and
marketing analysis; and (d) training programs. The project was also
designed to introduce measures to restore APC's financial structure.
Implementation Experience
Due to APC's efficient implementation of the Project, the potash production
target of 1.4 million tpy was achieved in 1990, one year before the
expected Project completion date of December 31, 1991, specified in the
Loan Agreement. All project components (Refinery Modification,
Complementary Expansion, and Technical Assistance) were completed on time;
procurement activity was efficient and smooth; the final disbursement took
place about 10 months before the Loan closing date.
Results
The project met all of its objectives:
* the production target of 1.4 million tpy was achieved ahead of schedule;
* technological improvements to the potash refinery through the
development of a cold crystallization process were successfully achieved
and subsequently provided the basis for the Bank's Dead Sea Industrial
Exports project;
* financial rehabilitation measures to restore APC's financial structure
were implemented and the Company's financial position is currently
sound;
* through its effective sales and marketing strategies, APC established
itself on the world potash market as a reliable supplier to the major
consumers of the world. In 1988-1990, APC was able to sell all of its
production at prices above the international average price, and between
1986 and 1990, actual total quantity of sales was 2.1X higher than the
SAR estimate.

SECOND ARAB POTASH PROJECT
(LOAN 2786-JO)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
I. PROJECT IDENTITY
Name: Second Arab Potash Project
Loan Number:  2786-JO
RVP Unit: MENA Region
Country: Jordan
Sector: Industry (Fertilizer Production)
II. BACKGROUND
2.01           Jordan has limited natural resources, its arable land is
scarce and the economy is strongly service-oriented, with manufacturing and
mining currently accounting for approximately 20Z of GNP. Of this, about
two-thirds of the output is derived from mining phosphate rock and the
production of phosphate and potash fertilizers (all largely for export
sales) and the refining of imported crude oil for the domestic market.
2.02           For the purpose of extracting muriate of potash (KCl) from
the huge mineral reserves of the Dead Sea brine, the Government of Jordan
(GOJ) formed APC in 1956, stemming from earlier small-scale activities for
the recovery of potash by solar evaporation and subsequent processing which
had been abandoned following the 1948 hostilities in the region. On the
basis of consultant studies in 1960, the construction of a 1 million tons
per year (tpy) of potash plant was proposed; this was halted by
hostilities in 1967 and revived in 1974 with an update and expansion of
previous studies leading to a definitive feasibility study in 1978 which
recommended a plant design capacity of 1.2 million tpy. Consequently, GOJ,
the majority shareholder, other Arab governments, institutions and private
local investors holding APC stock, authorized a major capital increase to
establish an adequate equity base for implementing, at the above capacity,
the first Arab Potash Project; the proposed Safi production facilities at
the southern end of the Dead Sea and all other fixed assets and financing
requirements needed for completion of the Project were estimated to cost
US$429 million. For the first Arab Potash Project the Bank approved a
US$35 million loan (1617-JO) to APC with other funding, from various Arab
funds, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and
European governments. The financing requirements for the project at its
completion exceeded the SAR estimate by 7.2X.



2.03           After physical start-up of the facilities in September 1982,
commercial production could not be sustained because carnallite feedstock
from the solar evaporation system (SES) was not available for another year
in the quantity needed to operate the refinery. Thereafter, production
build-up was rapid. During the first five years of operation (1983-1987),
production aggregated at almost 4 million tons of potash. This was
equivalent to 96% of the appraisal estimate and a remarkable achievement,
considering the scale and innovative nature of the operation, its technical
complexity and its construction under very difficult conditions. Any
improvements in plant performance, which became necessary during that
period, were successfully implemented by APC.
2.04           The one major development causing a serious setback to the
viability of the first project, was the collapse of the world potash
market, at the same time the production facilities came on stream. This
required APC to take stringent measures to recover its financial strength.
2.05           The Second Arab Potash Project, whose concept and scope were
derived from studies commissioned during 1985/86, was appraised by the Bank
in 1986, following which the Bank agreed to provide a loan (2786-JO) of
US$12 million. This was drawn-down expeditiously by APC, completing
disbursement during a 50-month period between July 1987 and August 1991.
The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) agreed to provide cofinancing of
US$8.97 million for the Project. The USAID grant offer (US$1.5 million)
for R&D activities and consulting services was subsequently withdrawn.
Whereas the first project was implemented by relying heavily on the full
services of design and engineering contractors and consultants, APC
successfully assumed the project management role in undertaking the
Project, for which construction and modifications of the production process
facilities were essentially completed in early 1989.
III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01           Prolect Obiectives.  Given the considerable fixed investment
already incurred in implementing the first project, and the resulting low
marginal potash production cost, the purpose of the Project was to
incrementally expand output to yield attractive returns even though potash
selling prices at the time were depressed. To obtain maximum benefits, the
Project was designed to:
(i)   improve the level of production at relatively low marginal
investment cost and ensure that the initial 1.2 million tpy
design capacity was reliably reached and then increased to
1.4 million tpy to take full advantage of the potential
carnallite feedstock available in the previously optimized
evaporation ponds -- the Investment Component;
(ii)   devise a long-term program of R&D to assess the potential
output of APC's facilities and study the introduction, in
the event of future expansion, of technological improvements



- 3 -
to the potash refinery through the development of a cold
crystallization process -- the Technical Assistance
Component (TAC); this also included the training of staff to
upgrade their professional skills in selected areas of
production and maintenance; and
(iii)    introduce measures to restore APC's financial structure and
broaden the Company's capital base.
3.02           Proiect Description.  The Investment Component consisted of,
firstly, a lump-sum turnkey contract, costing US$12 million equivalent, for
the potash refinery modifications to improve performance and efficiency by
debottlenecking and changing to a two-stage carnallite decomposition
process. Secondly it contained a complementary expansion program, at a
cost of US$7.5 million equivalent, which was executed in parallel, mainly
to: (i) rationalize the hot-leach section of the refinery and provide more
stand-by process and utility equipment capacity for operational
flexibility; (ii) increase the pumping capacity of the Dead Sea brine
intake and deepen the inlet channel; and (iii) increase the rate of water
supply to the refinery. In addition, APC independently carried out
extensive modifications to the solar evaporation system to increase its
capacity to about 1.8 million tpy equivalent of potassium chloride product.
3.03           To expand potash output and maintain or improve upon APC's
marketing position, the TAC is crucial to the further growth of the potash
operation. Because the existing hot-leach process units are now limiting
output (to little more than the planned 1.4 million tpy rate of production)
and the steam available from the plant's co-generation unit is already
fully utilized, any further expansion would have to provide additional
capacity for process water and steam generation. The alternative was to
develop a new process, Cold Crystallization (CC), that does not require
steam, thereby obtaining considerable economic advantages from savings on
energy. Since a CC plant is much simpler than the existing hot-leach
facilities and requires less equipment, the capital and operating costs per
ton of product would be reduced by about half in comparison with the leach
technology. As a result, APC decided to contract, as part of the TAC, the
services of a process engineering company for the design and equipment
supply of a CC process pilot-plant, plus technical assistance services, to
establish the process operating conditions and conduct an evaluation of the
process variables. In addition, it was necessary to combine the unit with
a pilot-plant based on floatation technology since the carnallite
feedstock from the solar ponds is only about 84% pure, whereas the CC
process requires at least a 95% carnallite feed purity to obtain a
satisfactory potash recovery efficiency. Therefore, the harvested
carnallite had to be purified before processing with CC technology, which
entailed separating the impurities (largely sodium chloride) by a
floatation process using small amounts of chemical reagents to isolate the
unwanted material. This beneficiation treatment allows a CC unit and the
existing hot-leach plant to operate in complete independence from one
another. Since there would be no limitation on the distribution of the
carnallite feed between the two process units, the CC unit could be
designed for whichever output offered the greatest economic advantage. In



- 4 -
April, 1988, APC awarded a contract for this technical assistance to MDPA
Ingenierie (France), a company experienced in floatation technology
appropriate to beneficiation of carnallite, to provide the design,
equipment, reagents, know-how and installation of the pilot-plant at Safi.
Subsequently, the R&D findings of the above optimization activities were
incorporated in the full-scale design of the potash component of the Dead
Sea Industrial Exports Project, for which Loan 3355-JO was approved by the
Bank in 1991.
IV. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
4.01           The Project was technically well-designed and organized.
Following the work related to the removal of technical deficiencies and
constraints on output which emerged from undertaking the first potash
project, and in accordance with its objectives, APC developed early-on a
program to rationalize the process design details of the decomposition
section of the potash refinery, aiming to improve operational performance
and potash recovery efficiency through a two-stage process. The hot-leach
section was strengthened by additional equipment to expand stand-by
capacity and ensure on-stream reliability and flexibility.
4.02           APC is well-managed and its operations are run efficiently
by capable local management and staff. Additional technical staff were
recruited to ensure efficient plant operation of the Second Project. As
mentioned earlier, APC's experience in undertaking the first project
provided it with a sound organization and skilled workforce, of which a
large proportion had previously come from other chemical process industry
projects in the region. The ability and experience of APC's management
have contributed greatly to the success of the two projects APC has
completed.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.01           Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up.  The Bank loan
(2786-JO) for the Project was approved on March 10, 1987, signed on March
24, 1987 and became effective on July 14, 1987; a good beginning given the
complexities of the operation.
5.02            Implementation Schedule.  The main components of the Project
were completed on time and implemented according to the following:
a.    Refinery Modification.  Under the major turnkey contract,
this component was initiated in November 1986, following a two-month
delay. Satisfactory test runs and plant start-up were completed on
schedule by February 1988, and after three months the facilities were
brought on-stream with good control of the required process conditions.



b.    Complementary Expansion.  This program for rationalizing the
refinery's hot-leach section, including modifications to the brine
intake system, utilities supply and dredging services, was completed
according to schedule early in 1989. In addition, numerous individual
process equipment items were procured and installed in a timely manner
throughout the project implementation period, including services (e.g.
pre-feasibility study for expansion). Overall, APC's efficient
implementation of the refinery and expansion components was demonstrated
by the potash production target of 1.4 million tpy being first achieved
during 1990, one year before the expected Project completion date of
December 31, 1991.
c.    Technical Assistance.  The CC pilot-plant was constructed
and commissioned by the first quarter of 1989. By the third quarter,
the unit was operating steadily and producing a satisfactory chemical
product. The salt floatation pilot-plant, to beneficiate carnallite as
feedstock for the CC pilot-plant, was installed in November 1989 and
quickly gave satisfactory performance in beneficiating the raw
carnallite. Following a period of testing and optimization, MDPA's
final report on the successful operation of the pilot-plant was
submitted to APC in November 1990.
d.    Training.  The program envisaged at appraisal to be
undertaken under the Project was subsequently funded from other regional
aid sources and with APC's internal means.
5.03       Procurement.  The distinct classification of the above
components into five sub-projects formed the basis for an effective and
smooth procurement activity which consisted of various items of process
equipment and services, according to the following categories: (i) the
first phase refinery modification, procured as a lump-sum turnkey contract
and awarded in conformity with ICB guidelines, was justified in view of the
specific nature of the works, the particular equipment required and the
unique technology involved, allowing contractual guarantees to be more
easily enforced; (ii) increase of refinery water supply to 22,000 tpd and a
5,000 ton reservoir installation; (iii) the complementary phase of the
refinery, including the solar-pan, utility, carnallite centrifuge, refinery
hot-leach and screening facilities; (iv) expansion of the Dead Sea brine
intake system under three specialized contracts to compensate for a
continuing decline of 0.85 m/year in sea level, and (v) the studies sub-
project, consisting of planning for future expansion of potash production,
based on technological improvement in the potash process, and including R&D
activities, pilot-plant design and supply, and technical assistance.
5.04           In general, the procurement of goods and services was
carried out efficiently by APC through the use of ICB and LIB procedures
and without significant problems. Direct purchases of equipment were also
made to a limited extent for items proprietary to the design of the
process, as well as for small packages. The necessary design, engineering,
technical services and consultants' studies were commissioned by APC from
foreign firms in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. As
with equipment suppliers, APC maintained very good working relationships



with its consultants. This was also the case with the main co-financier,
IsDB, and these aspects contributed substantially to the success of the
Project's procurement and implementation activities. With regard to the
refinery modifications co-financed by the Bank and IsDB, arrangements
between the two lenders and APC were made to identify lists of specific
equipment items to be financed by them according to their respective
conditions for procurement. Procurement was carried out under parallel
financing with prior allocation of packages between the specific
financiers, which did not pose any particular difficulty.
VI. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
6.01            Proiect Cost.  At the time of preparation of the Bank's
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) in December 1986, the currency equivalent of
the Jordanian Dinar (JD) was US$2.92. Although the JD has since weakened
to US$1.50, the Project capital cost estimate in US Dollars equivalent was
not exceeded. The total financing required for the Project was originally
estimated at US$26.7 million, of which US$24.6 million in foreign exchange.
Table I which compares the cost of the Project as estimated in the SAR,
with the actual cost incurred, shows a small overrun (1.5%) on account of
the higher than expected interest during construction.

6.02        Proiect Financing.  As indicated in Table II, the cofinancing
arrangements were slightly different from the SAR plan, since APC and USAID
could not agree on the scope for USAID's contribution. APC compensated for
this shortfall by making available additional foreign currency of US$1.3
million equivalent. Also, IsDB increased its funding by almost US$1 million.

6.03        Disbursement.  The estimated vs. actual disbursements under Loan
2786-JO are presented in Part III, Table 3, showing that disbursements were
considerably accelerated by APC through its efficient preparation of bidding
documents and evaluation of bids. Another major factor contributing to the
high rate of disbursement was the selection of the lumpsum turn-key contract
for the refinery modification financed by IsDB and the Bank, which gave good
central control for implementation of the work. In addition, APC's contractor
fully discharged its duties in good time.
6.04        Loan Allocation.  Part III, Table 4 compares the actual allocation
of the Bank loan to the plan included in the Loan Agreement.

1990               1,400                1,402
7.03        The potash recovery efficiency factor (67% in 1986) was expected
to increase to 80%, and in practice has increased to 82Z. Water consumption
in the plant has been reduced by 150 tons per hour. The two-stage
decomposition process has resulted in an improvement of the product crystal
size; also, the process is now easier to control than before and is resistant
to process interruptions.
7.04        Since becoming fully operational, the CC and the salt floatation
pilot-plants, operating together, have produced a large amount of process
design information to allow the full-scale detailed engineering, permitting
APC and its consultants to design and construct a CC-based commercial potash
plant of 400,000 tpy capacity, providing the basis for the recently approved
Dead Sea Industrial Exports project.
7.05        Training.  Throughout project implementation and during plant
operations, APC has maintained extensive and satisfactory training of its
workforce and management at the Safi training center and at training
institutions in Jordan and abroad.
7.06        Financial Performance.  The earlier problem with APC's financial
structure, caused by the delay in the start-up of production from the first
potash project, an overrun in capital expenditure, and the distressed
international potash price situation over the period in 1986/1987, was solved
with the following measures: (i) increasing GOJ's share holdings through
injection of fresh capital by 15% to 56.76%; (ii) obtaining a local syndicate
loan for the amount of JD 5 million; (iii) issuing bonds in the amount of JD 7
million; (iv) transforming overdraft accounts opened by local banks into the
syndicated loan; (v) transforming GOJ debt of JD 14.5 million into a
subordinated loan; and (vi) obtaining new foreign loans from IsDB and IBRD in
the amounts of US$9 million and US$12 million, respectively. These actions
strengthened APC's financial structure and injected the required liquidity for
completing the Project and complying with financial covenants.
7.07        By 1990, APC had a fully paid-in capital of JD 72.5 million. As a
result of retained prior years' earnings, its total equity at year-end 1990



was JD 105 million. As shown in Table IV, APC's financial position has been
improving steadily; its financial position at the present is sound. APC is
currently in compliance with all financial covenants, namely: (i) long-term
debt to equity ratio below 60:40; (ii) current ratio of no less than 1.4, and
(iii) debt service coverage through 1991 of no less than 1. APC's detailed
Financial Statements are given in Part III, Tables 10, 11 and 12.

7.08        Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return (ERR) at
appraisal was estimated at 98%. The actual ERR for the project was 84%. The
reason for the reduction was that operating expenses (net of depreciation and
amortization) during the Project period (1986-1990) were about 21% higher than
appraisal estimates. The bulk of this increase was in 1989 and 1990, mainly
due to an increase in maintenance and electricity costs. The ERR calculation
and its principal assumptions are described in Part III, Table 5.
7.09        Audits.  APC is required to submit audited reports within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. Satisfactory audit reports, including
on SOEs and the Special Account, have been received
VIII. SUSTAINABILITY
8.01        Experience s'nce Project completion has shown that APC has been
able to maintain operations at a level close to design specifications, with
production and sales for 1991 again reaching nearly 1.4 million tons, and in
early 1992, achieving a similar rate. The Project benefits are expected to be
sustained in the foreseeable future.

IX. BANK PERFORMANCE
9.01        Bank supervision of this project was satisfactory.  Missions were
mounted about once a year, which was sufficient given the smooth
implementation experience of the Project.
X. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
10.01       The Borrower's performance was excellent.  APC successfully
assumed the project management role in undertaking the Project. It is a well
managed organization and the operations are run efficiently by capable local
management and staff. Furthermore, APC's experience in undertaking the first
project provided it with a sound organization and skilled workforce. APC
maintained very good working relationships with its consultants and equipment
suppliers.
XI. CONSULTANTS AND CONTRACTORS' PERFORHANCE
11.01       Performance of consultants and contractors was fully satisfactory.
XII. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
12.01       The original project documentation including legal agreements and
Staff Appraisal Report were adequate for implementation and used as reference
material in the supervision process. Data needed for preparation of this PCR
were readily available.

SECOND ARAB POTASH PROJECT
(LOAN 2786-JO)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE'
a.    General Comments
1.          Information contained in Parts I and III of PCR are adequate and
accurate. Project was completed one year ahead of scheduled time.
Consequently the Loan was fully disbursed on August 28, 1991, one year ahead
of the closing date.
2.          The Loan proceeds were allocated as follows:
Category                                USS (million)
a)    Goods                                         10.57
b)    Consultants Services and Training               .43
c)    Interest                                       1.00
Total         12.00
3.          The actual Project Economic Rate of Return was 84%, as compared to
the 98% as estimated in the Staff Appraisal Report, due to the increase in the
operational costs and the major devaluation of the Jordan dinar.
4.          As detailed further below, studies for solar evaporation system
(SES) expansion and others were carried out successfully and resulted in the
recognition of the appropriate solar pans configuration and the need for
additional pan area to accommodate the planned future expansion of potash
production capacity by 800,000 tons. As far as the results of modification to
solar evaporation system are concerned, the carnallite production capacity of
SES proved to be accurate, both before and after modification. Total planned
carnallite production for the years 1986-1990 was 38.079 million tons,
compared with the actual production of 38.439 million tons.
5.          Pre-feasibility and feasibility studies were carried out and
indicated the economic size and process for increasing production by
additional 800,000 tons in two stages, by using the cold crystallization
process.
6.          APC staff has acquired the knowledge and experience on the
technological and operations aspects of the potash industry.
7.          All financial ratios and other covenants were maintained as
stipulated in the Loan Agreement.

b.    Solar Evaporation System Expansion Studies
8.          Evaluation of solar evaporation system modifications which would
be required to increase muriate of potash production from 1.4 million tpy to
1.8 million tpy, was achieved beginning with the 1989 evaporation season.
These studies also confirmed that expansion of potash production to
2.2 million tpy would require additional salt pan area together with the
construction of carnalite Pan C-4. Preliminary studies by consultants (Gibb)
on the cost of this work was completed and indicated that the economics would
be favorable. More detailed field work (topographical surveys and soil
surveys) was recommended to provide a more accurate economic appraisal. This
field work is in progress at present.
The exploration program for solid potash minerals under the Lisan
Peninsula was completed. The results of this work were not encouraging. No
further drilling is planned at present.
c.    Techno-Economic Evaluation and Definitive Studies for Expansion
9.          Stage 1 studies are completed and show very favorable economics
regarding expansion to 2.2 million tpy of muriate of potash. Stage II studies
concerning the costs of expanding the solar evaporation system are in
progress, as discussed above. Stage III studies will be commenced if the
economic information generated by Stage II is favorable.
10.         The technical description of the project and of events related to
the project is accurate. The objectives of the two-stage decomposition
modification have been accomplished as evidenced by the production rates
achieved since the completion of the project. It could also be said that the
objectives of the cold crystallization pilot plant have now been met since the
design parameter for the commercial plant have been developed and engineering
for this plant is nearing completion.
11.         The implementation of the project was somewhat different from
previous projects in that the principal consultant (Jacobs International,
Inc.) provided only process engineering and preliminary engineering for the
refinery modifications. Detailed engineering and erection was done under lump
sum contract. The contract was supervised almost entirely by APC. All site
supervision for the erection of the new equipment was by APC. Supervision of
the pilot plant contract with Wellman Process Engineering was also by APC.
d.    Other Observations
12.         Information contained in Part I of the SAR is adequate and
accurate. Actual project cost was US$27.1 million compared to US$26.6 million
as estimated in SAR. The actual production and sales volumes were higher than
expected. Actual net profit during the period 1988-1990 was more than the
estimated SAR. The Project increased the potash recovery efficiency to 82%,
decreased water consumption, and improved product quality. Cold
crystallization pilot plant results were encouraging and satisfactory. These
results are now being used in the design of the commercial plant. The
training programs undertaken by APC as part of the Project managed to upgrade
the efficiency of the company's staff. The rehabilitation of the financial
structure was successfully achieved.



- 13 -
13.         The World Bank involvement in the Project provided APC with
valuable and indispensable assistance in the areas of studies, procurement and
the final project evaluation and implementation.
14.         The satisfactory performance of the APC staff in the development
and implementation of the project is demonstrated by the fact that it was
completed ahead of schedule, was essentially on budget and achieved the
anticipated production results.
15.         Details of these achievements are presented accurately in Part I.
This shows that APC has developed the capabilities in its own staff to manage
large projects. This demonstrated capability is now being utilized in other
projects, including the Dead Sea Industrial Exports Project (Loan 3355-JO).
16.         The success of this project, from the standpoint of production
rate improvement, has also shown that proper expenditures for increases in
process efficiency and process control can result in significant improvements
in plant production. APC has continued with smaller process improvement
projects such as sylvinite screening and muriate product cooling, which are in
progress. All of these projects demonstrate APC's commitment to continually
search for profitable ways to improve plant performance.
17.         The excellent relationship between APC and the Bank's staff were
among the main reasons for the smoothness and effectiveness of the evolution
and the implementation of the project.
18.         APC and the Islamic Development Bank (co-financiers) maintained a
good working relation which also contributed to the effectiveness of the
implementation of the project.

Estimate               Actual
Economic Rate of Return            98%                    84%
Assumptions at Appraisal
-   Revenues, both in economic and financial terms, are based on actual potash
prices FOB, net marketing commissions; projected sales volumes are based
on the increment over 1986.
-   Prices are expressed in constant 1986 terms and expected to decline from
their 1986 level of US$77/ton to US$70/ton in 1990 and to reach US$72/ton
in 1995.
-   Given the limited distortions in the economy, with the notable exception
of energy inputs, economic and financial costs are identical. The cost of
taxes is excluded from the economic analysis.
-   Fuel and diesel oil are valued at local official prices, substantially
higher than international prices at the time.
Current Assumptions
-   Like in the SAR, revenue is based on the sales volume increase over 1986,
the last year before project implementation. The actual decrease in
revenue in 1987 was due to a sharp drop in prices in that year, which
affected APC's revenues for its existing production more than could be
made up from incremental production resulting from the Project.
-   Assumptions are the same as those used for the Dead Sea Industrial Exports
Project (Loan 3355-JO approved in FY91).
-   Prices expressed in 1990 constant terms have increased from a level of US$
86/ton in 1986 to US$93/ton in 1990. From 1991 onwards they are projected
to decrease from a level of US$ 91/ton in 1991 to US$ 87/ton in 1995 and
US$ 71/ton in the year 2000.
-   Economic costs are identical with financial costs except for the exclusion
of export and other taxes.
-   Fuel and diesel oil have been valued at international levels which are
higher than local prices.
The attached Exhibit shows the respective cost and benefit streams underlying
the actual rate of return calculation.

TABLE 6:   STUDIES
The following studies were conducted during implementation of the Project.
Solar Evaporation System Expansion Studies
Purpose: (i) Technology transfer to APC for evaluating various configurations
of the SES, corresponding to planned expansion of potash refinery capacity
from 1.4 million tpy up to 2.2 million tpy potash, and study of mechanical
seals for carnallite harvester pumps; (ii) Consultants' preliminary field
evaluation of SES expansion/pan modifications and engineering services; and
(iii) Exploration program for solid potash minerals in the Lisan Peninsula
area of the Dead Sea to supplement future carnallite production.
Market and Marketing Study
Purpose:   to review historic consumption of potash fertilizers in the
potential markets for Jordan potash exports; analysis of global and country
demand/supply long-term situations; prepare import/export matrices on
international potash-trade; review potash pricing information and production
costs from competitive sources; compare landed prices of Jordan potash with
those of competitors; consider marketing organization, product handling and
distribution, sales strategies and product quality requirement.
Techno-Economic Evaluation and Definitive Studies for expansion
Purpose: (i) a Stage 1 Pre-Feasibility Study for future capacity expansion to
develop capital and operating costs upon which to identify possible process
design alternatives, including review of the infrastructure and utilities
requirements, preparatory to optimizing selected viable schemes on the basis
of findings from the R&D work; (ii) A Stage 2 study to confirm the
preliminary evaluation for expansion of the Solar Evaporation System (SES),
including field studies of site conditions to allow design and costing of new
pan areas and dikes; and (iii) a Stage 3 final feasibility study and outline
design to determine the optimal potash expansion scheme covering the SES,
refinery, utilities and infrastructure.
