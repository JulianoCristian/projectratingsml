Included in this project are\n            investment and technical assistance components.  The\n            investment component will help improve the efficiency of the\n            decomposition and hot leach sections of the refinery and\n            expand overall standby capacity.  The technical assistance\n            component will help determine future prospects for\n            technology improvement, cost reduction and growth.  The\n            project is expected to generate critically needed foreign\n            exchange earnings. All of APC's (Arab Potash Company)\n            production will be used for exports."}, "docdt": "1986-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
