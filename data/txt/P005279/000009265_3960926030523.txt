JORDAN
SECOND ARAB POTASH PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Arab Potash Company (APC) has requested the World Bank,
through the Government of Jordan (GOJ), to finance a project including
optimization investments at the Dead Sea potash extraction and refinery
complex, aimed a.t ensuring reliable plant operation, increasing output, and
enhancing the Company's long-term competitiveness through development work
for technology improvement, production cost reduction and business growth.
The proposed project, which, including contingencies and interest during
construction, has an estimated cost of US$26.7 million equivalent, consists
of (i) an Investment component, with corrective and optimization measures
to allow an output increase of 15% over the initial design capacity of 1.2
million tons per year; and (ii) a Technical Assistance component, which
consists of research and development studies to assess the potential and
feasibility for future project expansion, and which, in addition provides
for staff training. The Project also entails a financial rehabilitation
plan to strengthen the financial structure of the Company, put it on thei
path to profitability following the losses incurred in the initial operat-
ing years, and open the way for broadening its capital base to new, private
sector, interests. APC is a Bank borrower which implemented the 1978
project to exploit the potash-rich Dead Sea brines.
1.02      The Project would be in line with the Bank's industrial sector
strategy for Jordan in supporting domestic resource based activities,
transferring new technology into the country, and promoting exports. The
Project would have an attractive economic return, and a positive impact on
APC's profitability and finances. The risks associated with the Project
are moderate, while the provision for training, and the transfer of
know-how and demonstration effects associated with the Technical Assistance
component will enhance APC's capability towards efficient plant operation,
and strengthen its competitive edge.
1.03      This report presents the main findings and recommendations of
Bank missions which visited APC in the course of the implementation of, and
follow-up on, the initial Arab Potash Project. The proposed project--the
concept and scope of which draw largely on a set of consultancy studies
commissioned by APC in the past two years to improve plant reliability--was
appraised in March 1986. The report recommends a Bank loan in an amount of
US$12 million towards the financing of the proposed project.

I I.  JORDAN'8 INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Background
2.01      Jordan's econouy Is based on free enterprise, yet in a system
characterized by an intensive promotional involvement on the part of the
Government. Due to paucity in natural resources and arable land, the
economy has a narrow commodity-producing base.  From the early 1970s
through 1982, however, a favorable regional environment combined with
political stability allowed Jordan to achieve a good economic performance.
Helped by substantial inflows of workers' remittances and transfers from
neighboring oil producing countries, investment, income and employment grew
rapidly, and significant progress was achieved in modernizing and
diversifying industry. Since 1982 however, the economic slowdown in the
neighboring countries has affected the Jordanian economy in many ways,
leading to a decline of domestic activity and a reduction in the inflow of
external transfers. The economic growth rate slowed to about 4.2X in 1983,
and declined further to about 32 in 1984 and 1985.
2.02      The F±ve-Yet.r Plan (1981-85) aimed at maintanintg the growth
owentum of the economy experienced during t.'e 1970's, with further
diversification in favor of the commodity-producing sectors. Assuming a
continuation of the favorable trends of the past decade, the Plan called
for ambitious capital investments (jD 3.3 billion or US$9.5 billion
equivalent) aiming at an annual GDP growth rate of 11 percent led by the
mid ing and manufactuiring sector (18 percent). Actual performance through
1985 however, fell short of these targets. As a consequence of financial
constraints, investment expenditures were 802 below the planned levels.
Expenditures in bousing and transportation sectors exceeded the planned
amounts while there were large shortfalls in all other sectors. As a
result, the average annual rate of real GDP growth during 1981-85 fell
below 62. In exter-nal trade, the Plan put heavy reliance on merchandise
exports with a growing contribution from the domestic natural
resource-based large industries sponsored by the Government (phosphate
miming and fertilizer, potash and cement). However, the disproportionatQ
slze of imports in relation to exports led to large, although
declining,trade deficits of US$2.4 billion in 1983, US$2 billion In 1984,
and an estimated US$1.9 billion for 1985. By the end of 1985, Jordan's
external public debt service payments amounted to 10 of total exports of
goods and services (including workers remittances).
2.03      Manufacturing grew at 5.22, broadly in line with the GDP during
the period 1980-85, and accounted for 232 of GDP. The 1981-85 industrial
investment program allocated 232 of overall investments, or JD 760 million
(US$2.2 billion equivalent) to the manufacturing and mining sectors. Of
this, about 752 was allocated to the large projects (phosphate mining and
fertilizer, potash, cement and oil refining), 72 for mineral (including
energy) exploration and industrial estates, 72 for medium-sized projects,
and the rest for other investments in the private sector. Mining pro-
duction, essentially phosphate rock, grew rapidly, whi1.e manuf..cturing
scttivites also progressed, with large increases in chemicals production,



-3-
food, beverages and tobacco. The large industrial projects which are now
in the production stage accounted for over half of the increase in mining
and manufacturing output, and for almost two thirds of the increase in
industrial exports.  The overall industrial structure is dominated by these
few large enterprises although there are numerous small private sector
firms engaged in food processing and the production of textiles,
detergents, furniture, and building materials. The small and medium scale
industry has promising growth potentials, given existiag workers skills,
pref rential access to neighboring Arab markets, and available support in
terms of development finance and industrial estates. There is, however, a
widely diverging productivity performance in the various subsectors, and on
the whole, industrial productivity is still low, reflecting diseconomias of
scale and the scarcity of managerial/technical know-how.
2.04      Rapid expansion and diversification oi industrial production and
growing regional demand for products have enabled Jorian to sustain a
strong export performance in manufacturing. The mining and manufacturing
industries accounted for about thrce quarters of exports during the period
1980-85. Although starting from a low level, manufacturing exports
recorded a sixfold 'lncrease in value between 1975 and 1980, with chemicals
(mainly detergents ard soap) accounting for the bulk of exports (11 per-
cent), followed by wood products and cigarettes. Since 1980 however, the
rate of export growth slowed considerably. With a few exceptions, the main
manufactured exports have a high import content. However, some of the
large export projects (potash and cement) have more favorable balance of
payments effects.
B. Industrial Strategy Issues
2.05      In the industrial sector, the 1981-85 Plan outlined specific
objectives notably: (i) forward integration of the mining sector, with
special emphasis on phosphate and potash derivatives; (ii) encouragement of
the development of competitive export industries; (iii) intensified explor-
ation of the country's energy and mineral resources; and (iv) creation of
new geographical growth centers with a view to relieving industrial conges-
tion in the Amman area, and fostering regiondl development. The Plan also
highlighted the need for a broader introduction of up-to-date technologies
and management methods, particularly through the large, key projects.
2.06      By 1986 industrial output was expected to have benefited from
important contributions by the large projects, notably in potash, phosphate
fertilizers and cement, However, these large new industries, because of
falling international prices and excess world capacity, declined in 1985
(with the exception of Potash) and may not contribute much toward restor-
ing a healthy rate of growth beyond 1987. Therefore, identifying sources
for industrial growth is a major concern, since Jordan may no longer be
favored by a low cost of capital (grants and concessionary landing).
Instead, it must seek to develop a comprehensive advantage in skills, tech-
nology and productivity.
2.07      In the long run, because of the small size of Jordan's domestic
market, industrial growth depends heavily upon the development of exports.



-4-
Aside from balance of payments criteria, only exports can provide the
market necessary for adequate economies of scale, employment generation,
and meaningful industrial integration. There is a considerable potential
for manufacturing exports to neighboring countries9 resulting from Jordan's
favorable geographic location and links within the region, as well as a
relatively good position as regards labor skills and industrial finance.
Excessive reliance, however, upon these few markets could, and has, become
a constraint to sustaining industrial growth and maintaining a good export
performance. Industries in which Jordan is currently competitive In the
region include cement, glass and bricks, for.which transportation costs are
an important factor. Exports of manufactured products to industrialized
market economies are negligible. Only in targeting segments of the world
markets particularly responsive to its resource endowment and industrial
potential (including potash and derivatives), can Jordan partly overcome
dependence on limited nearby markets, and alleviate the risk of a changing
regional situation.
2.08      Moreover, regional development in the Jordanian context implies
the creation of new development poles outside the Amman area. Towards this
end, a major new industrial estate has been developed about 30 km south of
Amman, and a similar estate is planned for the main city of Irbid in the
North. Development of the Safi Dead Sea pole, through growth of the potash
operation, would further serve this objective.
2.09      In summary, given the changed situation and outlook in the neigh-
boring oil producing countries (declining revenues, draw-down on reserves,
scaling down of investment programs and cut-down on foreign aid), continued
growth in Jordan at the rates projected under the 1981-85 Plan appears no
longer feasible in the medium-term. A GDP real growth rate closer to 5
percent p.a. is forecast through 1990, which inter-alia, reflects a reduc-
tion in the exceptionally high level of investments achieved during the
early 1980s as a result, mainly, of the implementation of the major new
industrial projects.  The industrial sector is nonetheless expected to take
the lead in the growth of GDP, with the new industries contributing nearly
one fourth of incremental GDP during 1986-90, with total industrial output
(including construction) projected to grow at an annual rate of about 5.7
percent. The construction industry is forecast to grow at a modest annual
rate of 3.5 percent during 1987-90. Thus, industrial growth through the
1990's, which assumes an expansion of phosphate mining and cement
production, will have, also, to rely strongly on the development of a
competitive higher technology mediumr-scale manufacturing industry, largely
for exports. Using to a greater extent the Dead Sea mineral resources
becomes, in this context, even more critical.  In the long run, because of
a small domestic market, dynamic industrial growth depends largely upon the
development of exports, which calls for the identification of investment
opportunities aiming at broadening Jordan's export base in building upon
the country's comparative advantages in factor endowment, access to mar-
kets, and competitiveness of specific industries. A high rate of growth in
export-based industries is indispensable not only to reduce the external
deficit and enhance the country's creditworthiness, but also to stimulate
employment, promote new technologies and improve quality of domestic pro-
duction. In this context, a potential expansion of the Dead Sea Potash pro-



- 5 -
duction would be fully warranted, particularly if accompanied, as is the
objective under the proposed Bank loan, by an optimization of production
process, overall reduction in production costs and hence, enhanced competi-
tiveness.
C. Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy
2.10      Jordan's last two development plans aimed at restructuring the
economy to achieve a wider manufacturing base, reduce dependence on exter-
nal grants, and spread development among different regions. The Bank's
assistance to Jordan has been designed to support these objectives, and in
particular help the Government: (i) diversify the country's economic base
and promote exports; (ii) alleviate manpower and infrastructure constraints
in the productive sectors; and (iii) encourage more balanced growth among
regions. The macroeconomic framework to assess the long-term potential for
Jordan's export-oriented industrial growth has been provided under the
Bank's review of the 1981-85 Five Year Plan (Report No. 4179-JO of 1'ay
1983), and further recommendations in this regard were formulated in the
study on Export Strategy and Promotion in Manufacturing Industries (Report
No. 4170-JO of June 1983). A manpower development study discussing strate-
gies for employment and growth in the context of a weakening regional
demand for Jordanian labor, was also carried out by the Bank (Report
No. 5117-JO of June 1984).
2.11      Bank assistance in the industrial sector has thus been directed
at fostering Jordan's comparative advantages based on domestic resource
endowment and manpower skills, and contributing towards the establishment
of a broader export-oriented industrial base. Hitherto, Bank involvement
in the sector consisted of a credit to the Industrial Development Bank of
Jordan (1974) including financial and technical assistance to the small and
medium scale industries, a pilot engineering credit (1975) to help prepare
the Arab Potash Dead Sea project, for which a loan for the full scale
project was approved in 1978. An Energy Development Project in 1983
included financing and measures for improving and promoting energy effi-
ciency in industry. Technical assistance is currently being provided to
devise and implement a master plan for the phosphate mining industry.
IFC's investments in Jordan have been geared to the production of ceramic
tiles, aluminum fluoride, phosphate fertilizers and bricks, and to the
development of the Amman capital market. Finally, Bank's involvement in
the optimization of APC's activities, will be within the continued strategy
of enhancing Jordan's ability to fully develop its export industries.
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement in the Project
2.12      A key element of the Bank strategy in Jordan is to support
resource-based export industries. Under the present economic situation,
these industries play a crucial role in reducing the foreign exchange
constraints arising from falling remittances and grants. Gross foreign
exchange earning.s from potash exports exceeded US$82 million (about 10 per-
cent of all merchlandise exports) in 1985, and by 1990, following inter-alia
the improvements under the proposed project, APC's revenues would increase
by about one-third, with a highly attractive yield on the incremental
investment.



-6-
2.13      Bank support for the project would involve essential technical
advice to APC on a relatively sophisticated technology, rzrticularly the
evaluation of a new "cold crystallization" process for potash refining. It
also involves reinforcing the middle level operational staff, streamlining
responsibilities in the production and maintenance areas, as well as
training and appropriate deployment of technical assistance. On a
different front, the financial difficulties of the "mixed" enterprises have
extinguished private interest in, and demand for, participation in such
ventures and derailed government plans for increasing private ownership in
mixed companies. If APC is able, as expected, to return to a profitable
position in 1988, this would open the way tevards boosting private
participation, no doubt with positive impact on ottoer industries as well.
III. THE WORLD POTASH INDUSTRY AND TRADE
3.01      Potassium is a common element in the earth's crust but, due to
its high reactivity and affinity for other elements, does not exist in the
elemental form. It is found both in igneous rocks such as silicates and
feldspars, and in sedimentary deposits formed by evaporation of sea water.
Economic recovery of potassium salt3 is almost entirely limited to those
from sedimentary deposits. Potassium is an essential element for animal
and plant growth, and with nitrogen and phosphorous, is one of the three
main macronutrients for agricultural production. About 90% of potassium
salts produced are used as fertilizers, generally referred to as potash.
Potassium content is expressed on a (K20) equivalent basis, In which world
potassium demand and reserves are usually expressed. Potassium salts were
first mined commercially around 1860 after their value as a fertilizer had
been demonstratede In the beginning of this century, about 0.2 million
tons per year of (K20) were being produced, reaching 4 million tons by 1950
and 31.0 million tons in 1985.
A. World Potassium Reserves
3.02      Estimates of potassium deposits vary widely, depending on the
definition of "reserves" as opposed to "resources." 'Reserves" are de-
scribad as ores that can be recovered at, or near, current mareet prices,
whereas wresources' are potentially mineable ores which, because of cost or
other constraints, might not necessarily be recovered. Economic recovery
costs vary significantly from one deposit to another depending, inter alia,
on transport costs to markets. World total figures for reserves and
resources derived from agreed data regarding location and geological nature
of deposits, place known reserves at 17 billion tons (K20) and estimated
resources at 150 billion tons. The breakdown of reserves and resources on
a country basis is available in the Project File (Ref. A). More than 80%
of these reserves and resources occur in Canada and the USSR. The Dead Sea
deposits, being exploited by Jordan and Israel, translate into reserves of
0.2 billion tons (K20) and resources estimated at 1 billion tons.

B.   World Potash Supply and Demand
a.   Historical Capacity and Production Growth
3.03      World potash production has grown by about 5.9% over the period
1980/81-1984/85, while world capacity utilization averaged 81%. The
1984/85 supply cspability was 31.5 million tons K20, with Western Europe,
North America, the USSR and the German Democratic Republic accounting for
about 94X of world capacity, as the two last European countries and Canada
have substantially increased their capacity in the recent past.
3.04      World potash capacity for the year 1984/85 was as follows:
Million Tons K20       Percent
USSR                                              13.3                36
German Democratic Republic (GDR)                  3.5                 10
Canada                                            9.5                 26
USA                                               2.0                  5
Western Europe                                    6.0                 16

World Total                                  36.6                100
World potash actual supply capability in 1984/85, taking into account the
phasing in of new mines and capacity utilization rates was as follows:
Million tons K20       Percent

3.06      Potash is produced in relatively few locations, but its extensive
use throughout the world entails transportation over considerable
distances, so that location relative to market is important to assessing
market competitiveness. Additional future production is likely to take
place in those few countries where major potassium reserves are located.
The main capacity increases are planned to occur in Canada and the USSR,
while production in the USA and Europe is expected to remain static or
slightly decline. Although plans for new capacity in Canada have been
delayed because demand during the past three years was low, supply capacity
is expected to increase from about 8.4 million tons (K20) in 1984/85 to
12.4 million tons (K20) in 1990/91. The USSR, the world's largest
producing country with about 10.7 million tons (K20) of supply capability
in 1984/85, has plans for marginal expansion of its industry. Besides
Canada, there are no other major developments foreseen that could
significantly change the current structure of the potash industry or have a
major impact on world trade before 1990/91. A potash mine, with a capacity
of about2O.5 million tons per year of (K20) came on stream in 1985 in
Sergipe, Brazil. Possibilities for new mines are being examined in Mexico,
Tunisia, Chile, Peru, Brazil and China, most of which would be relatively
small and unlikely to have an impact on the overall world scene during the
remainder of the 1980Js and early 1990s. Under these assumptions, the
proposed marginal expansion of APC's capacity would come on stream in a



- 9 -
fairly stable world potash market, as well as under a situation of growing
demand in APC's main markets (East of Suez). Increasing APC's output to
1.4 million tpy of product (0.84 million tpy K20) would keep APC's share of
world market below 3%. A detailed country-by-country review of planned
potash production facilities is available in the Project File (Ref. B).
b.   Historical Consumption and Demand Growth
3.07      Potash fertilizers are used mainly in Europe, the USSR, North
America, Oceania and Japan which, together, account for about 90% of all
agricultural potash use. About 5X is used in Latin America, and the
remainder in Asia and Africa, Potash consumption in developing countries
is low, being only 7 kg/ha in Latin America and 3 kg/ha in Asia, as
compared with an average of 48 kg/ha in Western Europe. Also, the
Nitrogen/Phosphorous/Potassium (N:P:K) ratio in 1977 was 100:62:57 for
developed countries, against 100:43:23 for developing countries. Rising
potash deficit in the soil could have serious consequences insofasr as it
could limit the efficiency of nitrogen applied, to the detriment of the
yield and quality of crops.
3.08      World demand of potash in 1985 totalled around 27.7 million tons
of K120, out of which the US market accounted for 5.5 million tons, Eastern
Europe for 3.9 million tons, the USSR for about 6.6 million tons, Western
Europe for 5.9 million tons, and the rest of the world for about 5.8
million tons. World fertilizer potash consumption from 1980/81 through
1984/85, broken down by main region is provided in Table-IT.

rates of 61 witnessed between 1956 and 1976, yet higher than the 2.21 rate
between 1977 and 1984. Growth rate will be about 1S in developed
countries, 4.81 in developing countries, and 4.11 in the centrally planned
economies.
3.10      The 1984/85-90/91 regional and world supply/demand balances,
shown in Table-III, are based on capacity figures calculated on a mine by
mine basis (World Bank/FAO/UNIDO/Industry Fertilizer Working Group).  The
detailed breakdown for supply and demand is available .'n the Project File
(Ref. C).  Supply capacity takes into account the phasing-in of new mines,
average country utilization rates, and distribution losses.  Capacity
utilization rates and distribution losses for the main producing regions
are provided in Annex 1-1. The balances show a steadily declining surplus
over the next five years.

C. Potash Trade
3.11      Due to the lUnited number of supplying countries, a large part of
the potash output ti traded in the international market. Of the 28.2
million tons K20 produced in 1985, about 16.2 million tons, or 57%, was
traded internationally as shown In Annex 2-1, which provides the
distribution of market shares for main supplying regions in 1985. Canada's
export share of world trade represents about 352, East Germany represents
12S, while West Germany, Israel's Dead Sea Works and France combined
account for 252. Finally the USSR accounts for 10X. Among the major
import markets, except for India which is forecast to increase its imports
by 400,000 tonnes K20 between 1986 and 1990, and China by 200,000 tonnes
K20 during this period, comparatively law growth is envisaged in other
potash import markets.
3.12      The old co-existence between the long-establisbed producers in
North America and Europe is being increasingly challenged by more
recently-established producers (Israel, Jordan, and New Brunswick/Canada),
which are actively seeking markets, although the share of the latter.
remains smnll, with an aggregate production of 1.66 million tons K20 in
1984 representing a world market share of 5.6%. The new producers have
been aggressive in establishing niches for their products: New Brunswick in
the US Eastern Seaboard and Latin America; Jordan in India and the East,
and Israel in Western Europe and the USA. The drive for sales by the tiw
producers, and the response of the established producers to preserve their
market shares, partly acted as a depressant on \prices since the beginning
of 1985. Although Israel, Jordan and New Brunswick will account for only
8.5% of world potash capacity in 1989/90, the significance of this new
production arises from its appearance at a time of relatively stagnant
demand. World potash exports, broken down by main exporters for 1984 and
1985 are provided in the Graph-I.

Do   Potash Prices
(a) Historical Prices
3.13       Despite the emergence of new producers (Israel, Jordan and New
Brunswick), Canada and the USSR remain the only two countries that can sub-
stantially increase production, with Saskatchewan expected to remain the
most economic large-scale potash source.  FOB Vancouver prices are used as
reference due to the leadership role of Canada--the world's largest export-
er and second major producer (next to the USSR)--with delivery prices prin-
cipally determined by Canadian producers. Annex 2-2 shows the hititorical
development of Potash prices in current dollars since 1960. Although
prices of potash from 1960 onwards showed a tendency to increase overall,
there were, for different reasons, strong fluctuations over short spans of
2-3 years. Thus, in 1973, the surge in potash prices accompanied hyper-
inflationary commodity price increases after the 1973 oil crisis. In 1980,
the rise in price was mainly associated with production and logistics dif-
ficulties in Canada and the USSR, while in 1984, the price drop was inter
alia caused by depressed US farm economies and, consequently, falling
demand.
(b) Price Forecasts
3.14      Several sets of potash price projections are available.  The
projection of potash prices by APC, on the basis of a linear regression
analysis yields a 5% average annual increase in real terms, from the 1986
prevailing levels. Linear regressions however, only provide overall
trends, and cannot reflect localised year-to-year fluctuations, resulting
inter-alia from supply-demand balances. The medium-term outlook for the
KCL market -- as viewed by APC -- indicates that consumption in the major
US market will be stagnant, reducing thus the average world growth rate of
ootash consumption. Therefore, due to low prevailing prices, production
cuts in North America, and the existence of high inventories, prices which
are expected to be in the levels of US$70/ton (FOB Vancouver) throughout
1986, will remain low in the near term.
3.15      The economic and financial analyses for the proposed project
(para 8.01), assuTAe conservative potash prices which in real terms decline
from their present 1986 depressed FOB Aqaba level (US$77/ton) to US$75/ton
in 1987, US$73/ton in 1988, US$72/ton in 1989 and US$70/ton in 1990. By
1995, prices would still be at the US$72/ton level (in 1986 terms).
Adjusted on an FOB Vancouver basis allowing for freight differential, these
prices, as derived, translate into levels lower than APC's projections.
IV. MARKET AND MARKETING OF JORDANIAN POTASH
A. APC's Market and Competitive Position
4.01      Jordan's Arab Potash Company began production in late 1982 and
the first exports were made to Iraq in the same year. In 1983, production



- 13 -
was 280,000 tons XcAl (170,000 tons (K20) equivalent out of which 128,000
tons were exported). In 1984 production amounted to 487,000 tons Xcl
(295,000 tons 120 equivalent, of wlich exports totalled 273,000 tons),
while in 1985 producti n reached 910,000 tons Rcl (545,000 tons K20
equivalent with exports of 560,000 ,ons). Although the steady erosion of
freight rates has affected the pattern of world potash trade in reducing
the price differentials between potash from different sources, APC remains
nonetheless from a logistical viewpoint, in a favourable position regarding
a number of markets, and since starting operations, has diversified it
outlets to cover more than 20 markets worldwide.   Furthermore, the Red Sea
being an area of net imports, #essels are available for return cargoes,
which provides APC with an edge in freight which extends to Korea in the
East and includes India, Malaysia, as well as Indonesia. APC has, relative
to Canada, afi equal freight position vis-a-vis Japan, China and Brazil,.
while APC is at a slight freight disadvantage versus Israel vis-a-vis Italy
and South of France. Potash freight rates from Aqaba to selected
destinations are provided in Annex 3-1. Average net FOB Aqaba potash
prices for 1985, are given in Table-IV.

Brazil                                            70.0
Venezuela                                         67.0
4.02      APC's output represents a small share (less than 2%) of world
capacity, and can therefore be accommodated within the projected world
demand. APC has so far been able to export the bulk of its output
(para 4.01), without major marketing problems. The catchment area for APC
production, which excludes some ports of Western Europe (UK and Germany),
North America and countries with centrally planned economies, represented
in 1985, over 10 million tons 120, equivalent to about 16 million tons of
KC1 product. Out of this market, APC production (about 1.0 million tons
KC1) accounted for 6-7%. APC, which has marketed 0.95 million tons of KC1
in 1985, expects to market 1.25 million tons in 1988 and 1.4 million tons
as of 1990, (equivalent to 840,000 tons of kO). It has concentrated its
marketing efforts in the South Asia, East Asia, and Pacific regions where
it enjoys a comparative location and freight advantage. The Arab countries
in the Middle East and Africa also constitute natural potential, although
small, markets.



- 14 -
4.03      Regarding international trade of commodities, the competitive
position of producers is determined by landed costs (CIF price levels),
which confers considerable weight to locational factor-, first in terms of
inland transportation (from production facilities to export harbors), and
second, in terms of sea freight to export markets. Inland transportation
costs, for instance for one of the main producers and market leaders
(Saskatchewan/Canada), account for close to one third of landed prices,
which as a consequence, provides a notable edge in selected markets to
competitors (including APC) more closely located from export harbors.
Thus, whereas Canada's largest potash mining facilities--Saskatchewan-are
deep inland at a considerable distance (2400 km) from the main export
harbor of Vancouver (which translates into rail freight charges of about
US$30/ton), APC's facility at SAFI is at 200 km from Aqaba harbor with
associated inland transport charges of less than US$10/ton.  APC has
directed its marketing efforts into areas where its trading position is
further enhanced by the effect of sea freight advantage. This is the case
of the growing potentially large markets East of Suez, particularly the
Indian sub-continent where APC's prospects to increase its sales are
promising. Furthermore, because West Europe is a net importer of potash,
and given Jordan's relative proximity, APC-although at a disadvantage
vis-a-vis Israeli exports from Mediterranean harbors-is expected to remain
a steady source of supply to this active market. Finally, Brazil, because
of its potential market size will need to diversify its sources of supplies
and maintain a share of imports from Jordan. Because of location however,
the return to APC from its Brazilian sales will remain amongst the lowest
of all APC's sales.
4.64      India constitutes for APC one of its principal target markets in
view of Jordan's freight-favorable location compared to other major
suppliers. In 1984/85, India consumed about 1.41 million tons of potassium
chloride (0.85 million tons K20) all of which was imported, and the Indian
Government anticipates potash consumption to continue to increase at a
steady rate.   The imported potash requirements of other countries in South
Asia-Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Burma-are modest,
aggregating less than 150,000 tpy of [20 in 1984/85, and represent limited
sales potential, although APC enjoys a measurable freight advantage in
these countries also.
4.05      In the Far East and Southeast Asia, Japan is a major potash
consumer (631,000 tons of K20 in 1985), followed by Malaysia (229,000), the
Republic of Korea (195,000), Indonesia (151,000), Thailand (87,900) and the
Philippines (38,600). In most of these countries the freight advantage
enjoyed by APC vis-a-vis Canada is negligible. With a combined consumption
of about 1.33 million tons of K20 in 1985, these markets represent
nonetheless an important target for APC.
4.06      The Arab countries consume limited amounts of potash, with the
exception of Iraq, Morocco and Algeria, which import measurable
quantities. Most of the other Arab countries, which currently consume
modest quantities have saline soils, and the bulk of their potash
fertilizer use is in the form of potassium sulphate, rather than potassium
chloride. Therefore they have not and are not expected to play an
important role in the consumption of APC potash.



- 15 -
4.07      The United States (the Midwest and Southeast) is the world's
largest consumer and tmporter of potash. Canada is the major supplier
although, since the aid 70's, the USSR and the German Democratic Republic
have also entered the US market. APC potash could be sold in the Southeast
areas of the US at competitive prices, since Canadian potash (excludlag the
New Brunswick mines) Is shipped through Vancouver and California ports at
high transportation and trans-shipment costs.
4.08      A brief description of APC's position and objectives in the main
three markets of India, Prance and Brazil is provided in this paragraph.
(i) India. Since beginning operations, APC has aimed particularly at
consolidating its market position in India. It has thus increased its
share gradually to around 20X of the Indian market in 1983, with a target
of about 251 in 1986. Yet APC has failed to sign a long-term contract with
India although the Indian side has indicated preparedness to do so for
quantities of around 400,000 tons per year (271) if Jordan agrees on a
countertrade basis to purchase from India goods equivalent to 501 of APC
sales to India. APC is unable to do so singularly - but talks are taking
place to get the Jordanian government to agree to some of the trade
proposals. Although no long-term contract has been signed, both APC and
India have an understanding to continue with the yearly contracts now
standing at the 400,000 tons level. The main incentive for India is that,
on a landed cost basis, APC potash price is slightly lower than that from
other sources,whereas the advantage for APC is that, as a result of
proximity, sales to India translate into a sale price (FOB Aqaba) about $10
above average APC sale prices.
(ii) France. APC's association with Entreprise Miniere et Chimique
(EMC) as agents for Europe and Africa has secured for APC an important
share of 100-120,000 tons per year in the French market. INC enjoys a
monopolistic position as the sole importer of potash into France, and APC
intends to maintain the INC arrangement to secure the present level of
access into the French market.
(iii) Brazil. APC is aiming at a supply of around 150,000 tons to
Brazil. This will be done through local agents who are themeelves large
potash buyers (80 - 85,000 tons/Year), have excellent country connections
and are establishing long-term arrangements with major Brazilian custom-
ers.
B. APC Marketing Arrangements and Policies
4.09      In order to secure outlets for its products, APC entered during
the pre-production phase into marketing agreements, with specialized
marketing and fertilizer companies. The following three main marketing
agreements were reached,
(i) Marketing agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) covering
East of Suez and Oceania, excluding Turkey and the Asian Arabic
countries. This agreement with MC is essentially a take-or-pay



- 16 -
contract. The initial target for MC, to purchase and sell 50% of
APC's total annual production, was later modified to cover 702 of
production. The agreement expires by December 31, 1987.
In addition, Mitsubishi's commlssion was revised downwards to
0.5% for India and China (with the option for APC to directly
handle these markets), 3% for Indonesia, and 2% for other mar-
kets. APC has been considering opening, jointly with Jordanian
Fertilizer Industries, resident offices in India, APC's major
client with about 25> of market share.
(ii)  Marketing agreement with Woodward and Dickerson for North and
South American Markets with the original target to cover 25% of
APC annual production.   The agreement was recently modified to
cover only 15% of annual production. This agreement expires by
December 31, 1986.
(iii)  Marketing agreement with Entreprise Miniere et Chimique (EMC) for
West Europe. Originally aimed at covering 251 of APC production,
the agreement was recently modified to cover only 151 of APC's
annual output.
4.10      In addition APC had entered into a marketing agreement with IMIC
(Switzerland) to market 25,000 tons K20 equivalent annually in the East
European market. However, difficulties to implement this agreement have
arisen due to coverage of that market by the USSR and East Germany pro-
ducts. APC is noneth-eless endeavoring to market given quantities in that
area, especially to Romania and Yugoslavia, in the frame of official trade
agreements between Jordan and other governments.
4.11      For the past two years, APC has successfully aimed at market
sharing with other producers who have made way for APC as a new-comer.
APC is now considered a reliable long terri supplier with a good position in
numerous markets. In view of its relative insignificant size in the mar-
ket, APC will be a price follower to the leader (Canada). The Canadian
International Development Agency has made concessionary funds  available to
Indonesia, Sri-Lanka, Bangladesh, and various other countries to pay for
potash purchases from Canada. These markets, as a result were closed to
competition, and have generally yielded attractive prices to Canadian
producers. To follow the Canadian example, APC aims at using where rele-
vant, privileged relations to further (potash) countertrade on a case-by-
case basis and offer where feasible competitive financing through agents
who are Deing encouraged to buy products from APC customers.
C.   Impact of Proposed Capacity Increase on APC Market Position
4.12      The proposed project will bring gradually, by 1990, APC's annual
output to the level of 1.4 million tons of KC1, an addition of 350,000 tons
over the 1986 level, yet only 200,000 tons over the design capacity for
which APC had initially set up its marketing and representation network,
entered into specific marketing agreements, and designed its shipping and
sales policies. The marketing vecord of APC, although short, has nonethe-
less been impressive, as APC has, with little difficulty, been able to



- 17 -
capture a market share close to 1 million tons in a span of 3 years. The
risk that APC will be unable to market, through 1990, annual average incre-
ments of 70,000 tons, is thus moderate.  Moreover, the extension, beyond
their respective expiration dates of the existing main three marketing
agreements--which APC should be encouraged to do--would further ensure that
APC will be able--at no risk--to fully place its incremental output.
4.13      APC's projections through 1990, as regards this expanded output
have been prepared on a country-by-country basis, taking into account the
experience of the recent past, specific relations with the country
involved, the potential for conclusion of long-term contracts, the position
of APC agents in the respective areas and, where relevant, APC's competi-
tive edge vis-a-vis the country. The 1984 and 1985 actual sales, and sales
estimates on a country-by-country basis, through 1990, are provided in
Annex 4-1 and for the main markets, given in Table-V.

V. THE ARAB POTASH COMPANY
5.01      The borrower, and Project implementing agency, is the Arab Potash
Company (APC), a corporate entity registered under Jordanian law, and
founded in 1956 to commercially exploit the minerals contained in the Dead
Sea brines. In 1958, the Government of Jordan granted a 100 year
concessicn to APC with exclusive rights for the extraction of these
minerals, together with fiscal and other incentives. APC's initially
authorized capital was JD 4.5 million (US$12.9 million equivalent). In
1978, APC's shareholders authorized a major capital increase to provide
adequate equity base for the existing project, a large integrated potash
extraction and refinery complex at GROR-SAPI (IBRD MAP 19875R). The
current subscribed capital of APC amounts to JD 72.5 million (US$207
million equivalent) of which JD 65.4 million (US$188 million equivalent)
have been paid in.
5.02      Although majority (51%) owned by the Government of Jordan, APC
enjoys a special status in Jordan as an inter-Arab venture of a regional,
rather than local, dimension. This is due particularly to its capital
structure involving the Arab Mining Company (25%), the Islamic Development
Bank (62) and direct equity holdings by the Governments of Kuwait and Iraq



- 18 -
as well as by the Lybian Arab Foreign Investment Company. APC's
shareholding structure is presently as follows:

Iraq 20X, and Fgypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and other Arab States
(2-32 each).
5.03      APC financial statements as of December 31, 1985 are summarized

A.   Board of Directors
5.04      APC's statutes give its board of directors extensive powers to
oversee the Company's affairs and provide policy directions, approve capi-
tal and operating budgets, and set guidelines on compensation policies.
The Company's board has fifteen members, representing the various sharehol-
ders. The chairman along with seven mmbers are appointed by the majority



- 19 -
shareholder (GOJ), while the deputy chairman represents the second largest
shareholder (AMC). The Board includes members with a broad spectrum of
expertise, from government institutions, as well as from the business and
banking communities. The board has been closely involved in the decisions
aiming at plant o;'imization and financial restructuring.
B. Management and Information System
5.05      APC's present Managing Director,  r. MAli Ensour--in his position
since mid-1984--had previously held the posts of General Manager of the
Jordan Electricity Authority--which he had been instrumental in setting up
and organizing--and of the Jordan Phosphate Mines Co. He is a highly expe-
rienced and competent manager, well known to the Bank.
5.06      APC has a sound management information system.  Reliable informa-
tion and monitoring systems have been developed in the marketing and
personnel areas, as well as for stores and inventories. In finance and
accounting, a good computerized system integrates both financial accounts
and production control. Long term financial projections are now prepared
also periodically. The maintenance activities have so far had to cope with
a long series of plant modifications and adjustments, due to the pecularity
of the process and tt-e unique chemical characteristics of the Dead Sea
briles. However, a good preventive maintenance planning scheme is now
being devised. The establishment within APC's organization of a research
and development unit is also being considered.
C.   Staff and Organization
5.07      APC staff of about 1,320 employees, includes 1,177 Jordanian
nationals. The balance consists of a core of foreign experts and over 125
foreign daily laborers. 156 persons are employed at the Safi township and
68 at the Aqaba port terminal. A number of additional technical staff have
recently been recruited to ensure efficient plant operation.
5.08      Until the end of 1982, APC was largely devoted to the execution
of the pilot and, subsequently, the full scale initial project, including
follow-up on the construction of the facility, and the recruitment and
training of staff. During the implementation of the initial Bank financed
project, a special focus was put on institution building. In that context
several groups of consulting firms provided assistance to APC in the design
and implementation of its financial control and accounting system, and the
organizational structure for project operations.
5.09      An essential component of the institution building, aiming at
strengthening operations management, was provided under a long-term
contract with an Operations Management Team (OMT) from Jacobs Engineering
Group which started in 1980 and extended through May 1986. The contract,
in an initial amount of US$16 million, at its peak obtained for APC a team
of up to 25 foreign experts, including technical and financial staff. The
OUT has been involved in developing pre-production plans and setting APC's



- 20 -
operations into motion and has played a special role In first diagnosing
deficiencies in the plant design, and assisting successive teams of
independent consultants in devising solutions and modifications to plant
design and operating processeso The OMT has also provided on-the-job
training to the counterpart Jordanian staff slated to progressively take
over the responsibility for plant operation. As the OMT contract expired
in May 1986, APC decided to retain a core of four experts out of the
original team (including the technical, works and logistics managers), to
pursue assistance to APC at least until full design capacity in the plant
is reached. Such an arrangement will be further enhanced with the T.A.
provided for under the project.
5.10      The Bank appraisal reviewed the organization and procedures of
APC and, for enhanced operational effectiveness, agreed with APC on
strengthening certain operational areas namely through: (i) reorganization
measures pertaining to streamlining responsibilities in production and
maintenance; and (ii) retaining/hiring experienced staff given in-line
responsibilities in key middle level managerisal and craftsman positions.
Measures pertaining to the reorganization of the operational functions are
outlined in para 5.14, while staffing measures consisted of recruiting/
retaining experienced professionals including Works Manager, Technical
Manager, Logistics Manager, Maintenance Planning Supervisor, Workshop
Supervisor, and Craftsmen (mechanical fitters, fabricators, and mechanics
for vehicles). These measures have been carried out by APC. Furthermore,
in the context of the proposed research and development program that APC
will be embarking upon, the arrangements for consultancy and technical
services aim, inter-alia, at ensuring further transfer of technology and
know-how to APC. In this respect the demonstration and training aspects of
the R&D program will be an essential focus of the consultancy services to
be provided.
D.   Reorsanization of the Operations Function
5.11      APC is organized along functional lines in twelve departments.
The finance, marketing, administration and supplies functions report tto the
the mana6ing director (M.D.) through a Deputy General Manager cum Finance
Manager.
5.12      Following the initial period of operations, APC's Marketing
Department has been reorganized along three geographical areas--East of
Suez; Europe and Africa; and America (mainly Brazil)--and strengthened
through recruitment of additional university graduates with background in
chemical engineering, agriculture and business. Marketing operations at
APC are governed by 3 main agreements signed in 1979-80 when the project
was still in the construction phase (para 4.09).
5.13      With regard to the Finance Department, recruitment of additional
professionals-some of whom already identified-at the level of Division
Head, is planned, particularly to strengthen the financial planning and
accounting functions. In due course, the treasury function at APC would
also have to be strengthened.



- 21 -
5.14      The operational functions--Production, Maintenance, Engineering
and Works, and Research and Development--were initially under the direct
control of the Plants and Operations Manager through whom they reported to
the M.D. Under such organizational structure, the production complex
included over ten functions reporting directly to the plants manager, and
created undue overload on the time and capacity of the latter who had
direct supervision over the activities related to maintenance, solar pan
system, refinery, power plant/utilities, safety and security, technical
department, transport, power facilities, vehicle repair shop and training.
It was agreed with APC that a works manager, reporting to the plants
manager should group and coordinate the functions of maintenance,
production and utilities and ensure smooth information flow among
operational areas. Improvement in the procurement procedures was also
agreed with APC to ensure better coordination between operational
departments and warehouses, and hence optimal techno-economic decisions.
During negotiations, APC presented its revised organizational chart (APC
Staff Organization and Training, December 1986, Project File (Ref. D))
showing the organizational structure recently adopted by APC. Important
features of the new structure are the grouping of production and
maintenance departments only under a Works Manager to better coordinate
production and maintenance, and the reporting of the Safety Manager
directly to the plants and operations manager. The Bank is satisfied that
the organizational structure is appropriate to APC operations. APC's new
organizational chart as recently modified by APC is provided In Annex 5-1.
E.   Training
5.15      APC's in-house training unit includes a manager, four engineers,
and video technicians. The unit objective is to upgrade employees skills,
with focus on operators, craftsmen, e'pecially maintenance technicians, and
new recruits. Trair.ing is also provided on an ad-hoc basis to university
students and local community personnel. Furthermore, APC arranges training
in specific areas for various categories of staff with specialized
Jordanian institutions, such as the Institute for Labor Education, the
Royal Scientific Society, the Public Administration Institute, Jordan
University, and the Vocational Training Association. Finally, APC arranges
for staff training abroad, where currently 1O-l' people are following
courses in Holland (Center for Professional Advancement), England (Institu-
tions for Training) and the USA (high management courses at IFDC for main-
tenance, etc.). Specific courses in the training center are conducted by
APC personnel. These training activities have a strong emphasis on the
theoretical side. The plant; however needs xit this stage increased focus on
the on-the-job training carried out by experienced operators concerned
strictly with operational issues; to this purpose, and to broaden the scope
of staff training, the proposed project prov_ides for a training program by
outside consultants/specialists, with a focus on middle-level and craftsman
levels. In addition, fellowships for training abroad would be provided
under the loan for selected staff in middle managerial level positions.
However, the bulk of the program will consist of on-the-job training
activities as well as specialized courses, mainly in the maintenance area,
by outside specialists. Topics to be treated in priority will comprise:
rotating machine maintenance, mechanical fitting, welding techniques for



22 -
special alloys, fabrication, and materials inspection, and aim at achieving
higher operetional reliability. The training program as proposed with its
emphasis on in-service training as well as the selection of target groups
would es'ult in an adequate mix of training instruments available In APC.
The thre'4: year training program agreed with APC is further detailed in the
Proejct Rsile (Ref. D).
VI. THE PROJECT
A.  Background
6.01      In 1978, the Bank approved a US$35 million loan for the construc-
tion of a US$460 million potash production facility on the Southern shore
of the Dead Sea to exploit one of the few large physical resources avail-
able to Jordan--the Dead Sea brines--which are rich in minerals and salts
(SAR-NO/ 1922-JO of August 1978). The project thus built and operated by
the Arab Potash Company is amongst the largest industrial undertakings in
Jordan.  Designed to produce 1.2 million tons per year (mtpy) of potash in
the form of potassium chloride (KC), the project started operation in
1983. Its total production is exported. Few similar plants exist in the
world, the most relevant being the Dead Sea Works (Israel) and the Great
Salt Lake (USA) facilities.  Each of these plants is one-of-a-kind, and
required the build-up of considerable operational experience to finally
prove reliable. Als. at APC, the facility has been going through a slow
production build-up period, and reached an output level of 910,000 tons in
1985, or about 75Z of deslgn capacity.  The production process of KC1 at
APC consists in obtaining carnallite by solar evaporation of Dead Sea
brines in a network of ponds, and refining carnallite by hot leaching and
crystallization into fertilizer grade potash. Since production came on
stream, output has been constrained by bottlenecks, and production targets
could not be achieved. Design shortfalls and technological problems have
mainly been responsible for the slow build-up of production, which amounted
to 280,00b tons of KMI in 1983, 490,000 tons in 1984, and 910,000 tons in
1985, well bel*w projected levels. This slow build-up, together with
depressed potash pticee, have reduced APC's operating income and partly
depleted equity. APC asked the Bank in 1984 to review the status of the
project in otder to develop a plan of action to overcome the production
bottlenecks eud the resulting financial problems. Based on independent
consultancy studies, which the Bank reviewed, technical and operational
measures were implemented by the company in 1985/86.  In a first stage,
thus, of improvment in the; solar evaporation and refining processes,
modifications were carried out to upgrade production. The corrective
meaeuras implemented througb 1985 in the solar bond network have already
yielded sattisactory results, bringing the solar pon1 network potential
capacity over its nominal design.  The remaining bottleneck, yet to be
corrected, ti attributed to deficiencies in the refinery where a low
conversion efficiency rate results in excessive recycling to the ponds.
The improvements in the solar ponds have now eliinated the constraint to
carnallite availability and, subject to corresponding improvements in the
refinery (the proposed project), production level is expected to reach and



- 23 -
surpass the design capacity at a possible 1.4 mtpy. In the last three
years the Company has accumulated a significant knowledge and experience on
the process and technological aspects of potash operations based on Dead
Sea brines, and appears now able to master the technical complexity of such
a unique operation. However, because of previous design deficiencies, the
likely sustainable refinery output without the proposed project, will be
about 1.05 mtpy. Additional background on the project situation and tech-
nical status is given in Annex 6-1. Detailed information on the project's
execution and operation is provided in the May 1986 completion report sub-
mitted by APC. The completion report concluded that the chemical and
physical quality of the potash produced by APC was excellent since startup
and this helped in gaining early acceptance of the product in all markets.
The report also noted that satisfactory progress has been achieved in
staffing and training but these efforts should continue in future years.
With reference to plant capacity, separate technical opinions by leading
consultants in this field confirm that the proposed refinery modifications
would raise production to design capacity and that APC would further need
to balance refinery capacity with that of the solar ponds. The proposed
project provides for refinery capacity expansion, taking into account the
existing marketing arrangements and patterns, and addresses staffing and
training needs. A dategUed technical diagnosis of the plant is available
in consultants reports commissionti by APC to review the technical status
of the facility following early indications on capacity constraints. These
reports (Jacobs Engineering Group; Great Salt Lake; and Lukes & Bartlett),
together with an independent review (Saline Processors) commissioned by the
Bank, are available in the Project File (Ref. B).
B.   Project Scope and Description
6.02      The sizeable fixed investment already incurred, which includes
utilities, township and port facilities, results in a high break-even
voint. Given APC's low marginal cost of production, an incremental output
would yield attractive returns, even if potash prices were not to improve
from present (depressed) levels. To build upon this advantage, the pro-
posed przject consists of an optimization program which would allow, under
its (i) Investment Component, to Improve production levels, at a relatively
low marginal investment, and ensure that the initial 1.2 mtpy design capa-
city is first reliably reached, and then, increased to 1.4 mtpy to take
full advantage of the potential carnallite feedstock available in the
already-optimized evaporation ponds; and (ii) Technical Assistance
Component, to devise a long-term program of research and development (R&D)
to assess the ultimate potential of APC's facilities-given natural
resource and topography constraints-and introduce, in the context and
event of an expansion, technological improvements to the refinery through a
cold crystallization process. The Technical Assistance (T.A.) component,
includes also funds earmarked for on-the-job training to upgrade profes-
sional skills in selected areas of production and maintenance. Finally,
the Project includes financial rehabilitation measures which would restore
APC's financial structure and position to healthy standards, and lay the
path for broadening the capital base of the company to new interests, from
the private sector.



- 24 -
6.03 (a) The Investment Component, with an estimated installed cost of
US$19.45 million, of which US$17.83 million would be in foreign exchange,
would be carried out under two separate, yet parallel, programs:
(i)  The first program entails a turn-key contract in an amount
of US$12 million aiming mainly at refinery modifications to
improve performance and efficiency (by removing bottlenecks
in the decomposition section). Indeed, following the
corrective measures implemented in 1985 in the solar ponds
(diversion dike in the salt pan and conversion of
pre-carnallite into carnallite area), it has been
established that the ultimate capacity of the ponds will
exceed the 1.2 million tpy level. The remaining constraints
are inherent to the refinery, where the proposed set of
modifications required to actually reaching that level could
be completed by end-1987. A turn-key contract-awarded In
conformity with Bank guidelines--is justified in view of the
specific nature of the works envisaged and the technology
involved, and allows contractual guarantees to be more
easily enforced.
(ii)  The second program, in an estimated amount of US$7.5 million
aiming mainly at rationalizing the hot leach section of the
refinery and providing increased operational flexibility and
increasing utility supply and brine intake system, would
mainly consist of the acquisition and installation of some
proprietary equipment to be directly procured by APC, to
expand plant stand-by capacity. The capacity of the
refinery could be then increased by over 15%, to 1.4
million,for a marginal capital cost representing about 1% of
the initial Project overall cost. Such an investment would
be well justified given its attractive return, and can now
be committed as APC has gained further experience and
knowledge of the pond system's operation and capacity.
The parallel implementation under this component of the two programs as
described, is justified by two factors: (i) the process knowledge acquired
from the refinery performance throughout the 1985 operating year, now
allows to determine the implications of operational bottlenecks under pro-
duction conditions close to design capacity levels; and (ii) a major modi-
fication to the decomposition process, carried out in December 1985, led to
improved carnallite particle size distribution, hence increasing production
by about 7%. These two factors result in a more reliable forecast of
refinery capacity build-up, and indicate that the concurrent implementation
of the two programs is justified, whereas their implementation in two suc-
cessive phases, as has earlier been alternatively envisaged, would retard
capacity build-up.

6.04 (b) The Technical Assistance Component is essentially a part of APC's
Research and Development Program to assess, given both market position and
resource endowment, the long-term prospects of APC operations with a view
to continued technology improvement, cost reduction and business growth.
The expenditures associated with this component are estimated at US$3.5
million equivalent, of which US$3.2 million would be in foreign exchange.
In addition, an amount of US$0.5 million is allocated for a three-year
training program consisting of on-the-job training, particularly at the
craftsmen level and providing for a number of fellowships. Within this
program, improvement of professional skills in the maintenance area will
receive special attention. The training component is essential to the
success of the investment program.
6.05      Once the corrective and optimization measures have been imple-
mented, APC is looking at the growth prospects of its operations to take,
in the long term, full advantage of the potential of its site and facili-
ties. Further growth of APC's operations should be viewed in the context
of a continued drive towards reduction of average production costs, in con-
junction with the insertion, in the present refining facilities, of a cold
crystallization unit which--through initial screening and separate treat-
ment of the carnallite coarse fraction--could increase total capacity by
about 50% to a level of about 1.8-2.0 million tpy. The expansion itself
would consist of: (i) additional solar ponds for concentrating the brines
and depositing the carnallite; and (ii) a modified and integrated plant for
the chemical processing and extracting of potash. Presently, the overall
cost of such an expansion is broadly estimated by APC at US$100 million
which would result in an incremental capital/output ratio of US$175 to
250/ton capacity for the eventual expansion (from 1.4 million tons to
1.8-2.0 million tpy) as compared to a ratio of US$340/ton capacity for the
initial project, which makes the development prospects a priori promising.
Such a development would call for a thorough set of studies outlined in
para 6.06. The first stage, in a cost of up to US$ 3 million, would
include, inter alia, the analysis of the potential to further expand the
solar pond network capacity, laboratory tests and a pilot unit for an
expanded lower-cost production scheme, and a market analysis to derive and
justify the optimal level of expansion. Should that first stage yield
positive conclusions, a second stage, at a cost of up to US$0.5 million,
would provide the preparation of the basic engineering design, including
technical specifications and bidding documents on the basis of which con-
tractors can be selected and detailed engineering designs prepared.
6.06       Detailed terms of reference for the proposed study have been
jointly prepared by the Bank and APC, and are provided in Annex 7-1. They
include a description of the cold crystallization process and its integra-
tion in the existing facilities, as well as a suggested process study pro-
gram. The study will be carried out by consulting firm(s) qualified in
potash brine evaporation, harvesting and processing, and would include
laboratory and pilot tests. The consulting firm(s) will analyze the impact
on production of existing equipment and facilities and make recommendations
as to the design of the new equipment to achieve an optimal project inte-
gration and expansion. In summary, the study will consist of the execution
of: (i) investigation on the potential for expansion of the solar ponds



- 26 -
network; (iL) laboratory and pilot plant tests to identify alternative
least-cost routes to process the Dead Sea brines into potassium chloride
with a view to expanding production capacity while minimizing Investment
and operating costs; (iii) economic and financial analyses to determine the
recommended route's viability and optimal expansion size with an appropri-
ate plan of exploitation and production, financial projections and related
sensitivity tests; and (iv) should such analyses lead to positive results,
the basic engineering of the expanded plant and its integration in the
existing facilities. With regard to market aspects, the study will: (i)
analyze potash consumption in the potential markets and identify increased
export potential for Jordan potash; (ii) prepare and analyze potash demand
and supply projections on a country-by-country basis; and (iii) assess
likely landed prices of Jordan potash from the project to potential
markets, and compare them with projected Import prices from competitive
sources. The major risks of expansion will also be assessed. Cost esti-
mates and implementation schedules for the Project components are provided
in Annex 8-1.
6.07 (c) The Financial Rehabilitation Program agreed with APC and the GOJ,
entails measures to compensate the effects of past losses, strengthen the
capital structure of APC given its partially depleted equity, and relieve
the liquidity strain resulting from over leverage. The agreed financial
restructuring measures are discussed in paras 9.04-9.07. Their implementa-
tion will pave the way for the broadening of the capital base of APC to
include private sector participation.
VII. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A.  Capital Cost
7.01      The total financing required for the Project, including physical
and price contingencie;s, and Interest during construction, is estimated at
US$26.7 million equivalent, of which US$24.6 million will be in foreign
exchange. Interest during construction through 1989 is estimated at
US$3.2 million. (Additional working capital requirements to reach the 1.4
mtpy output are estimated at US$3 million.) The capital cost breakdown,
given in Annex 8-1, is summarized in Table-VII. The project cost estimates
are derived from several sources.  Estimates for the refinery modifications
(Component A) reflect the final price offer from the firm selected, through
ICB, to carry out under a turn-key contract the modifications proposed.
Estimates for the complementary expansion (Component B) have been prepared
by APC in consultation with Jacobs Engineering Group. Estimates for the
R&D (Component C), in its two phares have been prepared by APC in
consultations with Bank staff and are essentially based on preliminary
proposals received from firms with relevant experience in the field.
Finally, estimates for the training component have been prepared by Bank
staff in consultation with APC. The estimates were prepared in 1986
constant figures, and adjusted for price contingencies. Contingencies were
applied selectively taking into account, where relevant, firm offers



- 27 -
already received. Thus, except for the refinery modifications turn-key
contract subject to a firm price offer, physical contingencies of 10% were
applied to the base cost of all other projeet components, and price
contingencies for local and foreign currency expenditures were projected at
72, as per the estimated average increase of the cost of equipment,
erection and services related to this specific project.

The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), a shareholder of APC, has agreed to
cofinance the project and completed its appraisal. IsDB procedures and
financing instruments permit financing of identifiable equipment under the
refinery modifications contract. USAID has agreed to finance US$1.5
million of the technical asslistance component's R&D program, estimated to
cost about US$3.5 million. _/
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
(a)   Procurement
7.03      The refinery modification (decomposition section) contract
amounting to about US$12 million has been awarded after international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines.
Bank-financed procurement under the above contract and for the remaining
equipment, erection and services consists of (i) ICB for an estimated
amount of US$4.50 million; and (ii) LIB for an estimated amount of US$3.30
million, except for equipment proprietary to the process design estimated
to cost US$0.80 million to be procured through direct purchase, and small
packages estimated to cost less than $200,000 each up to an aggregate of
US$1.50 million which would be procured through international shopping from
no less than 3 qualified suppliers. Packages over US$500,000 each will be
subject to prior Bank review. Peckages below US$500,000 each will be
subject to ex-post review by the Bank. Under ICB procurement, local
qualified suppliers are accorded a preference margin of 15X, or the duty
applicable, whichever is lower. The Bank loan will also be used to finance
cost of engineering, technical services, training, and interest during
construction on the Bank loan. Consultants will be employed in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Funds from co-financing sources (IsDB and USAID),
will be used along the procurement methods of the relevant lending
agencies.
1/ During 1987, APC has to meet additional capital outlays,
including expenditures for dikes raising, covered from internal
resources. The financial rehabilitation measures under the Project
call, separately, for equity injection and for a change in the nature
of APC's liabilities. These are outside the frame of the Project
financing.



- 29 *
1.04      The consulting engineers prepared bid documents for the refinery
modifications main contract, and assisted in issuing the documents and
selecting the contractor in accordance with ICB procedures approved by the
Bank. Althourh this is a turn-key contract on a lump-sum basis,
arrangements were made to identify specific equipment under the contract
which could be financed by the IsDB under lease, or hire-purchase
arrangements. A list of equipment itemized in the tender documents and
which the IsDB will finance, consists of pumps with motors (12), carnallite
and first-stage decomposition thickeners, agitators (2), tanks (4), power
transformer and crystallizer coolant piping system. Given different
procurement procedures, and in the instance, financing instruments, of the
main co-lenders, procurement for the project is being carried out under
parallel rather than joint financing with prior allocation of packages to
the specific financiers. The Bank loan will be used to finance the
categories of items outlined in para 7.05; the lIDB will be financing
equipment out of the List provided in this paragraph; the USAID will be
contributing its (grant) financing to the works associated with the setting
up of the pilot plant and related T.A. services (software) for the cold
crystallization unit. The key allocation of procurement categories to be
followed during project execution is given in Table-IX.

7.05      (b)  Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
The proposed Bank loan of US$12 million would cover about 451 of
the project cost and 49% of its foreign exchange requirements. As has been
the case in the first Arab Potash Project, the loan would be made directly
to APC, on the standard Bank terms for Jordan (with 17 years maturity
including 4 years of grace). APC would bear the foreign exchange and
variable interest rate risks. The loan would be guaranteed by the GOJ
against a guarantee fee of 0.81 to be paid annually by APC to the GOJ on
the principal amount of tire loan withdrawn and outstanding. The allocation
of the Bank loan is reflected in Table-X.

The Bank loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1992, as per
the schedule of Annex 9-1 which is in accordance with the Bank standard
disbursement profiles. Provision is made under the loan for retroactive
financing of up to US$1.2 million for expenditures incurred after June 30,
1986. A special account will be open to cover estimated average
expenditures of 4 months, equivalent to US$0.75 million. Disbursements for
contracts under US$100,000 will be done under the statement of expenditures
(SOE) procedure.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions and Base Case
8.01      The APC project is essentially export oriented.  Revenues, there-
fore, both in economic atnd financial terms, are actual potash prices FOB
Aqaba, netted as relevant by marketing commissions. For the purpose of the
economic analysis on the basis of which the proposed investment has been
justified, prices expressed in constant 1986 terms, are projected to
decline from their 1986 level of 77 US$/ton (FOB Aqaba) to US$70/ton in
1990, and reach US$72/ton in 1995. Given limited distortions in the



- 31 -
economy, with the notable exception of energy inputs, economic and
financial costs are identical. As a conservative measure yet, reelecting
essentially a volatile aituation, fuel and diesel oil have been valued, in
the economic analysis, at local official prices, substantially higher than
current international levels. This translates, under today's structure of
prices, into a cost penalty on APC.
8.02      APC's existing facility at Safi, in the absence of the proposed
investment.already has a projected net benefit stream higher than the
opportunity cost of the plant. The economic analysis of the proposed
project has therefore been carried out on an incremental basis, and shows
that the investment contemplated to bring APC output level to 1.4 mtpy,
yields attractive returns. Without the project, production is forecast to
reach 1.05 mtpy in 1986. The proposed investment will enable production to
slowly build up to 1.15 mtpy in 1987, 1.25 mtpy in 1988, 1.35 mtpy in 1989,
and 1.4 mtpy in 1990. The ultimate addition to capacity, attributable to
the proposed investment would, therefore amount to 350,000 tpy. This
represents, for the proposed investment, a capital output ratio (C/o) of
less than 45 US$/ton of annual capacity compared to the initial C/0 of over
450 US$/ton. As a consequence of APC's low marginal production cost (16
US$/ton delivered Aqaba, at the 1 mtpy output level) the Economic Rate of
Return on the investment would, over a ten-year operating lifetime, be
strikingly high and close to 100% (Annex 10-1).
B.   Sensitivity Analysis
8.03      Sensitivity tests were carried out under the following scenarios:
(i) Assuming that in the situation of reference--sustainable level of
output without further investment-APC facilities are able to
produce 1.15 mtpy, the C/o to achieve 1.4 mtpy of production
would increase to 62 US$/ton, and the IRn would be close to 55%.
(ii)  Assuming that market constraints would prevent APC from selling
more than 1.20 mtpy--for instance under a system of quotas
imposed by major producers--the C/O of the marginal investment
would exceed 100 US$/ton, while the TIR would still be close to
65%.
(iii)  Assuming that the situation of reference is 1.15 mtpy, combined
with a market ceiling of 1.2 mtpy, the C/O ratio would amount to
310 US$/ton, while the IRR would collapse to 10%.
8.04      Switching-Value for Potash Prices.  To net a zero present value
(at 10% discount rate) on the proposed investment, KCl prices, for the
incremental production, could fall to floor levels as low as 20 US$/ton
(respectively 25 US$/ton for 1.15 mtpy reference situation). Such a
considerable price flexibility which APC could afford in the event of
tightening competition, markedly enhances the viability of the proposed
investment, and hence of the entire APC facility, and demonstrates that
APC, given its low marginal production costs, could grant sizeable price
discounts and still generate earnings.



- 32 -
C.   Other Benefits
8.05      Once full operating capacity is reached, the proposed investment
would yield to Jordan incremental gross foreign exchange earnings, as
compared to the 1986 reference situation, of about US$27 million per year
(in 1986 terms). These gross earnings should be netted out by (i) the
annual service of the foreign debt contracted to fund the investment; and
(ii) the annual, direct and indirect, foreign currency expenditures-mainly
fuel and diesel oil--incurred on account of the incremental output. The
resulting net annual foreign exchange earnings, as of 1990, are estimated
at US$20 million equivalent. Thus as a result of the proposed investment,
the export base of the APC project, which now accounts for about 10% of
Jordan's merchandise exports, would be broadened, and Jordan's dependence
on phosphate exports reduced. The assessment of the fiscal impact of. the
investment on Governaent budget is less straightforward, as the export tax
levied on shipments hauled in Aqaba is aimed at partial recovery of the
public investment in infrastructure (mainly the Aqaba terminal) already
incurred on account of the APC project. However, on incremental basis,
additional tonnage in Aqaba will translate into additional, albeit small,
tax levies of about 0.1 million JD/year. Moreover, the proposed investment
which will help APC revert to profitability will allow that dividends, long
overdue, be paid inter-alia on Government equity. The Project will also
have beneficial institution building effects, in adding to the expertise of
APC engineering and operating staff, as the investment component will
induce more efficient operating practices, while the TA component will
allow transfer to APC of up-to-date technology. Finally, the proposed
project will permit efficient use, at relatively low cost, of indigenous
feedstock resources.
IX. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Financial Projections
9.01      Financial projections through 1995 are carried out in current
Jordanian Dinars (JD). Expenditures, and incremental revenues from the
proposed investment, are accounted for as per the implementation schedule
outlined in Annei 8-I.  Starting from the 1985 actual, and 1986 budgeted
figures, the financial projections assume a KCI price increase, in nominal
terms, of 4% in 1987 and 1988, and 5% thereafter, while production costs
were inflated by 7%, which, compared to projected local inflation,
translates into a real fall in KCl prices of about 10% by 1990, and 20% by
1995 from their 1986 levels. Fuel and energy prices, a sizeable share of
APC'production costs, were kept at their end-1985 official levels,
substantially higher than present international prices. Two main sets of
projections were carried out to assess APC's position (i) without the



- 33 -
proposed investment, assuming an optimistic level of production capacity
(1.05 mtpy in 1986, and 1.15 mtpy thereafter); and (ii) with the proposed
investment under a consetrvative schedule of capacity build-up (para 8.02).
The key indicators of cash flow from operations, before and after debt
service, allowing the comparison of the two situations are provided in
Annex 11-1, and show the preference for the proposed investment.
9.02      The financial performance data of APC, incorporating the proposed
project, are summarized in Table-XI.

The projections show that APC's revenues would increase from JD 32.4
million in 1987 to JD 45.2 million in 1990 and JD 57.7 million in 1995.
operating profit would increase from JD 5.0 million in 1987 to JD 17.1
million in 1990 and JD 22.2 million in 1995. From net losses of JD 2.9
million in 1987, APC would be showing a net income of JD 0.9 million in
1988, rising to over JD 12 million in 1990 and JD 20.5 million in 1995.
The production cost structure provided in the income statement is further
detailed in Annex 11-2. The debt service coverage ratio would exceed 1
after 1987, and the debt/equity ratio would fall below 60/40 as of 1987 and
55/45 by 1988.
9.03      The financial rate of return on the marginal investment calculat-
ed in constant 1986 terms, would be equal to the economic rate of return,
as a result of the assumptions on economic and financial prices
(para 8.01).

B. Need for Financial Restructuring
9.04      The projectlons highlight the inadequacy, with and without the
proposed investment, of the financial structure of the Company in terms of
depleted equity, shortage of liquidity, and default In servicing (Govern-
ment) debt. Even In the improved case where the proposed investment ts
implemented, the analysis of the main financial indicators (debt/equity,
debt service coverage and current ratios) emphasize the need for financial
rehabilitation through equity injection and restructuring of debt.
9.05      APC's board, aware of the financial situation of the Company,
called in 1985 for an additional capital subscription of 15% (JD 9.5
million, or US$27 million equivalent) which was decided by the
shareholders. Discussions with the two main shareholders-the GOJ (51%)
and the Arab Mining Company (AMC) (25%)-- indicate that while these two
were prepared to pay in their shares of the capital increase, chances are
slim for the other shareholders to do so at the present time. APC's board
recently called on the shareholders to pay in,by March 1987, the balance of
the capital increase. The GOJ, as the majority shareholder, has confirmed
that it would subscribe and pay, by March 1988 dt the latest, for any
unpaid balance of the capital increase.
9.06      In that context, the question arose-given today's precarious
financial position of APC-as to the timeliness of attracting new partners,
Ideally from the private sector (be it local or foreign Interests). The
present Government in Jordan has a pragmatic approach to increasing private
sector participation into wholly or majority-owned Government commercial
activities. As concrete measures in this context, it has altered the legal
structure of the National Teleco uunications Company, which was converted
into a shareholding entity open for subscription from the public. The
merger of the Phosphate Mining Company (JPMC) and Jordan Fertilizer
Industry (J3I) has also increased, although marginally, non-Government
(AMC, the Arab Petroleum Company, etc.) control over JPMC. Although the
GOJ may be willing, as a matter of policy, to attract private sector
interests into APC, discussions with Government officials revealed the
concern that opening the capital of the Company to new partners would not
be opportune under APC's present unfavorable financial situation, as
existing shares would be sold at a discount. They were of the view that
divesting existing shares or issuing new ones should await the Company's
financial recovery while, at present, implementing alternative measures for
financial restructuring, which over the 1987-89 rehabilitation period would
allow APC to maintain its creditworthiness together with an acceptable
level of liquidity.
9.07      In line with the financial restructuring plan agreed with APC and
the GOJ, APC's outstanding debt to the Government (about JD 13.5 million,
or US$39 million equivalent) has been consolidated into long-term debt
maturing in 1993, with a 3-year grace period to ease the liquidity
constraint. Furthermore, this debt has been subordinated to the rights of
other lenders and will, as quasi-equity, strengthen the financial structure



- 35 -
of the Company, without increasing Government conrtrol over APC. (The
existing liability vis-a-vis the GOJ consists of installments due and not
paid, of loans channelled to APC through the Government (JD 3.2 million),
interests accrued (JD 9.2 million) and deferred interests due (JD 1.1
million)). The conversion of Government debt, or part thereof, into
preferred redeemable shares is an option also provided for under the
Government's decree relative to the debt subordination. The financial
projections for APC through 1995, incorporating the rescheduling measures
are given in Annex 12. (These projections illustrate the case where
Government liabiliti.es are consolidated into long-term debt fully repaid by
1990 with a two-year grace period, and assume that the payment of the
balance of the share capital increase has been completed by end 1986.)
9.08      The possibility for APC to issue, on the local market, conver-
tible debentures, through public offering or direct placement with local
financial institutions was discussed. In addition to raising medium-term
funds, this could constitute the first step towards potential broadening of
the company's capital base and seeking a larger private sector
participation in APC. The optimal timing and comparative cost of such a
financing instrument, and the conditions of convertibility, would be
carefully assessed. Potential assistance from the World Bank Group to APC
during project's implementation in exploring and pursuing this avenue was
discussed during negotiations.
C-   Financial Covenants and keportiM Re uIr#ftnts
9.09      Under the financial covenants of the 1978 Bank financed project,
APC was required to maintaia as of 1986, a debt/equity ratio below 55/45
and a debt service coverage (DSC) ratio above 1.5. As these ratios are
more stringent than those cori-monly applied to large industrial projects, it
is recommended to relax some of the financial covenants under the proposed
project. In addition to the financial restructuring measures approved by
the Government of Jordan to pay in the additional share capital increase,
and convert/subordinate its outstanding debt to APC into a seven-year
maturity debt, with a 3-year grace period, APC has agreed to follow prndent
financial policies to restore and maintain the integrity of the company and
the value of its stock, and in particular: (i) maintain a debt/equity ratio
below 60/40; (ii) maintain, through 1990, a current ratio of no less than
1.0, and 1.4 thereafter; (iii) maintain, through 1991, a debt service
covera6e ratio of no less than 1.0, and 1.3 thereafter; and (iv) consult
with the Bank prior to undertaking capital investment exceeding US$8
million in any fiscal year.
9.10      With regard to accounts, audit and monitoring, APC will be
required to submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports during project



- 36 -
implementation, and annually thereafter during the life of the proposed
loan. In addition APC wvuld continue to have its accounts audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and submit audited accounts
to the Bank within six months from the end of its fiscal year.
D.   ProJect Risks
9.11      Regarding the commercial risk associated with the marginal
investment, the analysis shows that potash prices, for the Incremental
output, could decline sharply from their present depressed levels before
the investment be no longer justified. This considerable price flexibility
which APC could afford in the event of tightening comp1etition, markedly
enhances the viability, while alleviating the risk, of the investment. The
main market risk for APC would be associated with a market collapse-for
instance resulting from the imposition of quotas-where APC would be unable
to market its full production. In the event of tightening market outlets
and increased competition, APC strategy would be-as a result of low
marginal production costs-to boost sales while increasingly discounting
prices, rather than cut back on production. The market position of APC,
its short but effective marketing record, and the marketing network and
contracts- Mitsubishi (East of Suez market), ENC (Europe and Africa), and
Woodward Dickerson (Americas)--it has entered into (para 4.09), would
secure with minimal risk, outlets for the incremental production. As
regards the technological risks associated with the investment component
and the ability of APC staff to operate effectively the optimized facility,
these risks are moderate, as the company has already acquired a
satisfactory knowledge and experience on the technological and operational
aspects of potash operations, and the optimization measures foreseen under
the project will further increase safety margins and add operating
reliability to the plant. In addition, organizational and procedural
adjustments (para 5.14) have been made to further improve effectiveness,
and measures have been taken to enhance mid-level managerial capabilities
and staff skills' especially in operational areas such as maintenance,
where, the departure of the initial core of expatriates may impair work
efficiency. As for the Techuical Assistance component, the risks that the
cold crystallization study *ay prove unsuccessful is moderate, as the basic
process and technology has been already proven in other potash operations
and the focus of the study will mainly concern the definition and
optimization of process parameters. The proposed investment, in
conclusion, shows an attractive return associated with an acceptable risk,
for which Bank assistance is warranted.

X. AGREMENTS
10.01     Assurances were obtained from, and agreements reached with, the
APC that it will:
(W) continue to manage its affairs on a sound basis, and follow
prudent financial practices in compliance with the covenants
of para 9.09; and
(ii) continue to operate its facilities in compliance with sound
environmental and safety standards acceptable to the Bank.
10.02     The GOJ has confirmed that it will complete, as the majority
shareholder of APC and guarantor of the Bank loan, the payment by March
1988 at the latest, of the balance of the share capital increase subscribed
in 1985 and not paid-in (para 9.05).
10.03     A special condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan would be
that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the cofinanciers
(IsDB and USAID) agreements have been fulfilled.
10.04     Based upon the foregoing assurances and agreements, the proposed
project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$12 million
equivalent on standard terms, to the Arab Potash Company, with the
guarantee of the GOJ.

SECOND ARAB POTASH PROJECT
Summary of Project Situation
1.        The Arab Potash Project was mechanically completed and formally
inaugurated its operationp in 1982. However, shortfalls in the carnallite
deposition rate and low yields in the refinery, soon cast doubts upon the
ability of the system to perform at the designed capacity of 1.2 million
tons per year (tpy). Given growing indications on capacity constraints,
APC hired three consulting groups (Jacobs Engineering Group, Great Salt
Lake (GSL), and Lukes & Bartlett) to review the design and operation of the
solar pan schemes. Jacobs--the design and supervision engineers of the
Plant-also undertook a global diagnosis of the refinery's operations. The
three groups were asked to predict current production capability, assess
the effects on output of various operating variables, and in case of risk
of shortfall from design, propose improvements to reach the design capacity
level. The Bank employed an independent expert to assess the consultants
reports, make independent estimates of current capacity, and recommend
future actions/changes to assure the desired production of 1,200,000 tpy.
The conclusion, broadly shared by all groups, was that plant capacity was
reduced because of the following major problems:
(i) The extrapolation factor used in designing the salt pan
section from the results of the pilot tests was overly
optimistic and caused the salt pans to be undersized.
(ii) The salt-to-carnallite pond ratio was out of balance, which
left the carnalllte area comparatively insufficient to
provide the required carnallite amount.
(iv) Various start-up, operational and design problems severely
reduced the yield of the refinery, resulting in excessive
potash loss and recycling to the ponds, with overload at the
plant front end.
2.        The proposed changes, as suggested by the consulting groups, and
retained for execution by APC, were as follows:
(a)   olar ponds.  The plan called for building of a diversion
dike in the salt pan and the modification of the pan system
to balarice the salt-to-carnallite ratio through expansion of
the carnallite pond. About 6.5 km2 of pre-carnallite area
was converted from PC-1 into carnallite, through the
erection of a dyke. A diversion dyke was also planned in the
new created carnallite area (hence called C5 and C6) to

allow rejection of the flow water in the (Truce Line) flood
channel. The incremental carnallite area entered service in
May 1985.
(b)  Refinery.  With regard to the refinery, the modifications as
proposed by Jacobs would be effective in improving overall
production rate, and would increase yield from the present
level of 50-67.5% to 75%. Among the process changes
suggested, was the modificatia of the carnallite
decomposition step from a single-stage co-current system to
a two-stage counter-current flow to achieve maximum yield
efficiency.
3.        Modifications to the solar ponds started in early 1984 and were
completed in May 1985. By correcting these deficiencies, the solar pond
section was brought slightly over its original design capacity and, with
further improvements in the refinery, it was established that the plant
output could reach about 1.4 million tpy KCI.
4.        The delay in capacity build-up and the resulting shortfall in
output, combined with depressed potash prices and increases In input
(energy) costs, have strained APC's financial position. Net losses
amounted to JD 13.8 million in 1983, JD 9.4 million in 1984 and JD 6.5
million in 1985. With major debt repayments coming due as of 1984, and
APC's equity base Impaired by the cumulative losses, additional capital
contribution was required to put back the Company on a sound footing.

JORDAN
ARAB POTASH COMPANY
TERMS OP REFERENCE FOR POTASH LONG-TERM EXPANSION STUDIES
General Baekground
1.        The Arab Potash Project was designed to exploit one of the
physical resources available to Jordan-the Dead Sea brine-which is rich
in minerals and salts, particularly potash. Studies initiated in :975,
confirmed the feasibility of the production of 1.2 million tons per year
(tpy) of potassium chloride (KC1), and the resulting project, one the
largest in Jordan, was completed in 1982. Production amounted to 908,560
tons in 1985, while the plant reached production level equivalent to 1.0
million tpy in August 1985 as additional carnallite deposition In the solar
pans became available.
2.        The total production of the Arab Potash Company (APC) is
exported; this amount is small as compared to the overall world potash
trade. The APC project has a major impact on the Jordanian economy, and
helps diversify and strengthen Jordan's export base. If market conditions
allow, APC could have an advantage in expanding production beyond existing
capacity given the sizeable fixed Investment already incurred, particularly
in infrastructure and utilities including township and port facilities, and
which could accommodate higher production levels. Given large fixed, and
low variable, operating costs, resulting in a high profit breakeven point,
APC's advantage in increasing production would be significant.
3.        A potential expansion would primarily depend on the market
prospects for APC potash trade. The competitive position of APC in terms
of structure of costs, geographic location and already established market
network make the prospects for capacity expansion worth to be studied.
Indeed, compared with the major world potash producers and traders, APC is
able to compete successfully in world markets, especially in the Indian and
Pacific Ocean areas where APC enjoys significant freight advantagea. In
,addition, the main elements of APC's marketing strategy have been
established, including organization, representation, and promotion, product
specification and packaging, and shipping policies.
4.        In Jordan, the production process of potassium chloride now
consists in obtaining carnallite by solar evaporation of Dead Sea brines in
a network of ponds, and refining carnallite by hot leaching and crystalli-
zation into fertilizer grade potash. In a first stage of plant
modification, APC has been reviewing the refining process, where analyses
are under way on specific production aspects which require upgrading.



- 47 -
ANNEX 7
Energy consumption levels and balances are also being analysed with a view
to devise appropriate conservation measures with saving potentlals. After
eliminating existing bottlenecks in various production stages, and speeding
the build-up in capacity utilization level, APC expects to reach a
production level of 1.4 million tpy KCI by 1989/90. The company however
intends to act towards further optimization of its production by (i)
reducing operating, including energy, costs through optimization of Its
technological processes; and (ii) increasing output beyond the 1.4 million
tpy through plant expansion, to a level to be determined in light of market
prospects, possibly with a new technology that may enable substantial
reduction in average production costs.
5.        For a potential plant expansion beyond 1.4 million tpy KCl, APC
is planning to carry out, in two phases, a series of studies the main
features of which are described in the following.
Objectives
6.        The Arab Potash Company wishes to study the technical feasibility
and economic and financial viability of expanding production capacity from
the 1.4 million tpy achievable in 1989/90 to about 1.8 to 2 million tpy KCI
through expansion of Its facilities at Safi. To this purpose, the
potential expansion project to be studied would consist of:
(a) Expansion of solar pans capacity using solar evaporation
techniques for concentrating the brines and depositing the
carnallite;
(b)  expansion of the existing plant for the chemical processing
and extracting of potash. The modified plant could include
a cold crystallization unit; and
(c)  expansion of infrastructure, utilities, transportation,
storage and shipping facilities, as required.
7.        A number of extensive studies and site surveys, which served as
the basis for the execution of the existing plant have already been carried
out. Copies of all available studies on the project can be examined in the
offices of APC in Safi, Jordan.
8.        The expansion studies under these terms of reference will be
carried out in two phases: in Phase I, the following areas will be
covered:
(i)  Extension of the solar pans network; under this component
aspects related to additional requirements in terms of water
and power supply, infrastructure, road transportation,
storage and shipping of potash will also be covered;
(ii) development of a cold crystallization process which could be
integrated into, or replace portions of, the current
refining scheme and would result in expanding the plant's



- 48 -
ANNEX 7
total output, at the same time substantially reducing
production costs. The development of such a process would
call for the installation and operations of a pilot unit at
the plant site;
(iii)  execution of a market and marketing study which would assess
the commercialization prospects for increased output and
define the maximum realistically marketable level of APC
production; and
(iv)  execution of a detailed evaluation of the technical
feasibility and economic and financial viability of the
expansion project. The results of this evaluation will be
included in a Phase I Evaluation Report to be submitted to
APC for review and approval.
9.        Under satisfactory results of the Phase I Evaluation Report and
after APC review and approval, Phase II of the feasibility study will
start, which will consist of:
(i) Execution of the basic design for the expansion project; and
(ii) preparation of technical specifications and bidding
documents for the expansion work.
10.       It is anticipated that separate consultancy services will be
contracted in Phase I, respectively for: (i) the solar pan/infrastructure
expansion study; (ii) the development of a cold crystallization process;
and (iii) the execution of the techco-economic evaluation. The market and
marketing study will be executed by APC's staff with the assistance of
experienced consultants as required. In Phase II the execution of the
basic design and preparation of bidding documents for the expanded plant
will be implemented under a separate contract. The consultant firm
contracted for the execution of the techco-economic evaluation in
Phase I will not be permitted to bid for the execution of the work under
Phase II. APC will have the right to halt the execution of Phase II,
should the results of Phase I work prove discouraging.
Scope of Work
11.       Scope of work for each of the above tasks is detailed
respectively in attachments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Schedule ef Works
12.       A preliminary implementation bar chart is attached.  It is
expected that overall, Phase I will take 30 months to complete; the solar
pan/infrastructure expansion study is expected to take 21 months to
complete, the development of a cold crystallization process 25 months, the
market/marketing study 6 months and the techco-economic evaluation study 6
months.

ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 4
13.       After completion of Phase I, APC will decide whether to proceed
with the project and approve the start of Phase II. Phase II is expected
to take 6 months to complete. It is anticipated that after the completion
of Phase II, the consultant responsible for the engineering work of
Phase II, may be retained as technical advisor to APC, should the company
decide to proceed with the execution of the. project.
14.       During execution of Phases I and II of the feasibility studies,
the consultants will be assisted by APC personnel, in number and
qualifications to be agreed upon beftre the start of each study.

only to provide indicative information on the prospects for
further long-term expansion. Field work will not be
required at this stage.
Scope of Work
I.   SOLAR PAN EXPANSION
This work will consist of, but not be limited to, the following
components:
A.   SALT PAN EXTENSION
1.   Objective
The objective is to examine the technical feasibility and
economic viability of increasing the salt pan area by some 20 to 25 sq. km
by enclosing the subka to the North East of the Lisan Peninsula between
Dike 1 and the vicinity of the Brine Intake Pumping station.

Page 3 of 6
3. Methodology
3.1 Preliminary Schemes
The Consultant will carry out all the studies indicated in para
2.1 to 2.9 above, with the exception of the work described in para 2.3
which will be assigned to a specialized contractor. The Consultant,
however, will supervise the execution of the field work by the contractor.
After reviewing all the geotechnical and topographical information, the
Consultant will prepare a preliminary action plan. Suitable areas for an
extended Salt Pan will be identified from existing maps, survey information
and data from ground reconnaissance carried out during the Implementation
of the Potashx Project.            J
Such preliminary studies would form the basis for determining the
locations and extent of field studies required to supplement available
information.
3.2 Field Investigations
The Consultant will assist APC in preparing tender documents for
the contractor work, analysing tenders and selecting the successful bidder,
and will supervise the field investigations carried out by the contractor.
The field investigations will include:
(i) Topographical Survey. This may need to be carried out by
aerial photography if access across the subka results
difficult for land survey. A reconnaissance will be made in
the initial state to determine the best and most economical
method of obtaining the survey data required. Hydrographic
survey may be required.
(ii) Geotechnical Invest!igltion. This will include, but not be
limited to: (i) boreholes of about 10 m to 20 a depth along
the lines of the dikes; (ii) vane tests in clay to 5 m depth
along and each side of the dikes; and (iii) boreholes at the
pumping station. Access for drilling boreholes will be
studied in a reconnaissance visit in the initial stage. It
is probable that a drill mounted on a large soft tyred
vehicle such as the Geaco will have to be used and small
personnel-carrying hovercraft may be considered. No
provision for any marine investigations is envisaged at this
stage.
(iii)  Laboratory Testing.  Laboratory testing will be carried out
on the site and at an approved laboratory to determine
design parameters from the soil samples extracted.
3.3 Design
The Consultant will prepare designs for the dikes and pumping
station using the results of the field investigations and the results of
the work carried out during the construction of the Potash Project.



- 53 -
Attachment 1
Page 4 of 6
Viability of the scheme is dependent on future Dead Sea levels
and projections of these levels will be updated from the studies carried
out in the 1970's.
The capability of the fresh water system and power supplies will
be assessed in relation to the power and water requirements for a new
pumping station (should a new pumping station be required).
3.4 Cost Estimates
The Consultant will prepare detailed estimates of the capital and
operating costs of the viable alternative.
B.  CONSTRUCTION OF CARNALLITE PAN C-4
Design work previously done for this pan will be reviewed by the
Consultant while referring to current c'onditions and updated as required.
A field examination will be made by the Conuultant to appraise the impact
on the pan of erosion and salt deposition.
The Consultant will also study the possibility of enlarging the
area of this pan. Estimates of the related construction costs will be
provided.
C.   CONVERSION OF PAN PC1 TO CARNALLITE PRODUCTION, CONSTRUCTION OF AN
ADDITIONAL DIVERSION DIKE IN THE SALT PAN, AND RELOCATION OF THE
EXISTING PC-1 FEED PUMP STATIONS
This study will provide detailed construction cost estimates for
simple diversion dikes in pan PC-1 between approximate coordinates 61,600
N-193,800 B and 61,800 N - 196,000 E and in the salt pan between
approximate coordinates 64,000 N- 193,600 E and 62,300 N - 200,000 E and
the relocation of the existing brine transfer facilities to permit pumping
brine from the salt pan to pan PC-2. 
II. EVALUATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION CAPABILITIES
This study will be carried out by the Consultant to assess the
potential for expanding support facilities with particular attention to
water supply adequacy and long-term reliability; appraisals should include
not only the present Safi and Nazar well fields and the Wadi Hudeira base
flow but also the Wadi Hasa base flow, The Mujib Conveyor, and sources of
Brackish water.
The electric power supply will be appraised for adequacy for the
higher production level. The practicality of increasing power generation
from the existing plant will also be evaluated.
The capability of the existing Safi - Aqaba road segment to
sustain increased traffic from and to the plant will be evaluated.



54 -                        Attachment 1
Page 5 of 6
The adequacy of the existing Aqaba potash terminal to support
handling and shipping of increased output will be evaluated.
The Consultant will provide a preliminary estimate of investment
and operating costs for expanding the above infrastructure/offsites, as
required.
III. EXPANSION BEYOND 2 NILL!ON TPY  C
This study will be carried out by the Consultant to identify the
prospects for further expanding the APC production facilities beyond 2
million tpy KC1. It will include a review of all previously developed
information regarding additional areas for solar pan construction with a
view to preliminarily indicate potential for further expansion. In this
context possible logistical limitations (feeding, harvesting, water, power
supply, etc.) will also be identified.
Study Proramme
To implement the above method of approach, it is expected that a
21-month programme will be required according to the following
implementation schedule. This programse is estimated to require 65
man-months of consultants services to complete.

ARAB POTASH COMPANY
TERMS OF REFERENCE TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A
COLD CRYSTALLIZATION PROCESS FOR REFINERY MXPANSION
Background
1.        The Arab Potash Project was designed to produce 1.2 million tpy
KCI by a conventional hot leach--crystallization process utilizing as
feedstock carnallite obtained by solar evaporation of Dead Sea brine.  The
plant has been operational since October 1982 and is expected to achieve
1,150,000 tpy KC1 production in 1987.
2.        Modifications made during start-up and others now being
implemented will bring the capacity of the potash refinery to 1,400,000 tpy
production level by 1989/90. The Solar Pan System and the refinery will be
in balance when the work underway is completed.
3.        APC is now considering a further expansion of the refinery
production capacity through cold crystallization of potash from carnallite,
to reach a total of about 2 million tpy KC1. The potential for concurrent
expansion of the solar evaporation system will also be studied, and is
covered by separate terms of reference (Attacbment 1). The cold
crystallization process has been proved on a commercial scale; however, a
technical development program based on pilot plant operations is necessary
to determine design parameters in the specific APC conditions.
4.        Cold crystallization of carnallite to produce potash is a lower
cost process than the hot leach process, both in terms of capital and
energy costs; therefore the economics of such expansion, if proved
technically feasible, should result attractive.
Objectives
5.        This study aims at assessing the feasibility of expanding potash
production from 1.4 to about 2.0 million tpy KC1, utilizing a cold
crystallization process. The exact expansion increment is dependent on the
most economic increment of Solar Pan Area that is available as determined
by a parallel study (Attacument 1) and on the results of the concarrent
market/marketing study (Attachment 3).
6.        Pilot plant work will determine the design parameters to
beneficiate carnallite suitable for cold crystallization processing and
establish design parameters for a commercial scale cold crystallization
unit.

Attachment 2
Pagt. 2 of 3
Scope of Work
7.        To determine the prospects for establishing a viable cold
crystallization process, APC will contract an experienced consulting firm
(the Consultant). The work to be carried out by the Consultant will
consist of the following main tasks.
(a) Design, procure and supervise the installation at Safi of a
suitable pilot plant to:
(i) Determine design parameters of beneficiations procesh
to provide approximately a 95% purity carnallite feed
stock.
(ii)  Determine design parameters for an industrial cold
crystallization process to produce a 96% KC1 purity
product of suitable particle size.
(b)  Provide technical supervision during the period of pilot
plant operations through a complete harvest cycle of solar
pans (carnallitc, particle size distribution is expected to
vary during the year-long cycle due to (i) number of harvest
passes; (ii) pan position of harvester; (iii) pan depth;
(iv) temperature, etc.).
(c)  Collect and evaluate the data, and prepare a report
including final findings and recommendations on process
feasibility and reliability. The report should also include
the basic elements necessary for the preparation of the
process basic design.
Schedule of Works
8.        It is expected that the study, including pilot plant design,
construction, operation, data evaluation and final report preparation will
require 25 months to complete, according to the following implementation
schedule:
