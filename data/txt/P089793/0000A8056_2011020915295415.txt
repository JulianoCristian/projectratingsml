                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A Loan Amendment was prepared and approved to empower the Ministry of Social Security as an authorized representative of the Borrower for disbursements under the loan (Article
                         2.02 of the Loan Agreement). The client made a separate request to alter some project activities and reallocate money among expenditure categories (while leaving the Project
                         Development Objective unchanged). However, in light of the project's poor performance history (no disbursements as of December 2010) the proposed Amendment was not
                         approved. The Bank expects the project to close as scheduled in June 2011.
