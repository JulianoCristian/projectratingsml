                      TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN – PARSEP II


                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER

   SUMMARY
1. The restructuring while keeping the original Project Development Objective (PDO)
   proposes the following changes: (i) reduce project scope to limit the activities to those
   that will be funded under the loan; (ii) revisions in results indicators to reflect reduction
   in project scope; (iii) extension of closing date by six months to December 31, 2011 to
   allow for completion of activities that are critical to the achievement of the PDO; and (iv)
   reallocation of loan proceeds to reflect nature of contracts to be pursued under the
   project.


   PROJECT STATUS
2. The project had a slow start and through December 2010 the loan still had not disbursed.
   However, between January and March 2011, 62 percent of loan resources ($ 3.1 million)
   were disbursed for the project’s centerpiece activity: "recadastramento" (database clean-
   up) of state pension system databases. The client has signaled to the Bank that a pending
   disbursement request of US$ 0.9 million is awaiting the reallocation of loan proceeds
   among expenditure categories. This would increase the disbursement rate to 80 percent of
   loan proceeds.

3. Recadastramento processes have been partially completed for almost 85 percent of the
   public servants to be covered by the project. An action plan endorsed by political
   authorities and technical level staff from the Ministry of Social Security identified that a
   6-month extension of the closing date is needed to ensure PDO is achieved.


   PROPOSED CHANGES

       •   Results/indicators

4. The results indicators will change following the change in scope. Please refer to Annex 1
   for details.

       •   Components

5. The proposed restructuring requires the following changes, as requested by the
   Borrower,: (i) eliminate the development of new payroll module; (ii) eliminate activities

                                                 4
   for the development of a unified database of state pension systems; (iii) substitute the
   original training activities with training activities on pension system structure and
   management, as well as seminars on public service pensions policy; (iv) eliminate the
   study of disability insurance and health and security legislation of the states (as well as
   consultation and dissemination related to this study); (v) eliminate actuarial analyses of
   state pension systems; and (vi) eliminate development of a prototype UPA and related
   studies.

6. The Borrower’s request described above implies the elimination of components “2. MPS
   Data Base Implementation and Upgrading” and “3. Unified Administrator Model”, with
   the exception of the provision of information technology equipment, which is now folded
   under component 1 “Upgrade Cadastres and Information Technology”. In addition, it
   implies a reduction in the number of activities financed under components (4)
   Strengthening the Participant States’ Pension Management; and (5) Strengthening the
   MPS.

       •    Financing

7. There are no changes in the overall project costs. However, the elimination of
   components (2) and (3) and reduction of activities under components (4) and (5)
   necessitated a reallocation of loan funds between components.

             o    Reallocations of Loan Proceeds

8. The proposed restructuring includes a reallocation of Loan proceeds given the nature of
   the contracts being pursued under the loan as per the following comparative table. There
   will be no change to the loan’s disbursement percentage.

9. The proposed restructuring also includes an extension of the closing date to December
   31, 2011 The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that the key contracts under
   execution are finalized, as included in the Borrower’s action plan to complete the project.
   This will be the first extension of the project.


   APPRAISAL SUMMARY
10. The proposed restructuring does not raise new social or environmental issues nor does it
   trigger new risks or exceptions to Bank policies.
