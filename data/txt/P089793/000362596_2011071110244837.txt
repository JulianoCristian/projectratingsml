                                   Description of the Project

The objective of the Project is to enhance fiscal stability and sustainable economic growth in the
Participating States through improved pension management.

The Project consists of the following parts:

1. Cadastre and Information Technology Upgrading

       (a) Upgrading of Participating States’ executive branch pension registers including
           verification of individuals’ registers and inputting into the respective states' unified
           pension system.
       (b) Upgrading of registers and systems of the legislative and judicial branches and other
           autonomous agencies of the Participating States so that, to the extent possible, they
           can be integrated with pension cadastres, thereby creating unified cadastres and
           systems.
       (c) Upgrading of Participating States' information systems so that their respective state
           government branches' pension data bases are integrated in a unified system.
       (d) Provision of information technology equipment to Participating States.

2. Strengthening the Participating States’ Pension Management

       (a) Training of Participating States’ staff in subjects related to the Project.
       (b) Carrying out of workshops to disseminate in the Participating States the legislative
           requirements of the federal pension system, the results of cadastre work undertaken
           under the Project, and institutional strengthening support implemented under the
           Project.
       (c) Training of relevant staff of the legislative and judicial branches of Participating
           States and other autonomous agencies of the Participating States on the unified
           pension system.
       (d) Training of auditors that would in turn train officials of the Participating States in the
           unified pension system.

3. Strengthening the MPS

       (a) Strengthening and operation of the Borrower’s Council of State Pension Officials
           (CONAPREV) comprised by, inter alia, pension officials from the Borrower and its
           states (including the Participating States).
       (b) Provision of consultants services for the SPS’s PEU including printing and
           dissemination of newsletters and publications on pensions.
