follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: a lesson is that small operations can have\n            a big impact. Despite the relative small size of this\n            operation (US$ 5 million), its implementation strengthened\n            institutional capacity in 15 states and 43 government\n            institutions, with annual potential savings accounting for\n            over US$26.2 million and an internal rate of return of 195\n            percent. The strong commitment of the current federal\n            administration in reforming pension management and\n            implementing a strong anticorruption agenda shows the ex\n            post relevance of these operations. In the particular case\n            of PARSEP II, the project's activities conveyed a clear\n            anti-corruption message in the participating states, in\n            particular in Federal District of Brasilia. Projects that\n            involve relatively large and complex procurement processes\n            should consider additional and enhanced support from at\n            least part-time consultants with solid experience in Bank\n            procurement processes and rules, in particular at the\n            beginning. For this project, while the change in the\n            strategy for procurement management, from hiring United\n            Nations Development Program (UNDP) as an intermediate agency\n            to managing procurement in-house, is commendable, additional\n            procurement support should have been considered at the\n            beginning of project implementation until capacities at the\n            Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) have been adequately strengthened."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
