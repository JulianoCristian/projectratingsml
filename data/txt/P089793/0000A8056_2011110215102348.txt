                         Implementation Status Overview
                           The project was restructured in June 2011, keeping the original Project Development Objective (PDO), with the following changes: (i) reduce project scope to limit the activities to
                         those that will be funded under the loan; (ii) revisions in results indicators to reflect reduction in project scope; (iii) extension of closing date by six months to December 31, 2011 to

                         allow for completion of activities that are critical to the achievement of the PDO; and (iv) reallocation of loan proceeds to reflect nature of contracts to be pursued under the project.

                         Between April and October 2011, the government continued to make progress towards the completion of the action plan presented during the supervision mission in April 2011. As of
                         October 18, 2011, approximately 75 percent of loan resources have been disbursed (about US$ 3.75 million). Recadastramento activities (upgrade of employee and retiree

                         databases), the main activity of the loan, had been finalized in Brasilia-GDF and were being completed in the rest of the jurisdictions. Only in GDF, which included 42 percent of the
                         number of public servants in the exercise, initial findings signal savings for over US$ 21 million. The rest of the recadastramento processes are expected to conclude by the end of
                         November 2011.

                         PARSEP II recadastramento activities will finally cover different branches in 14 states, for an estimated total of 315,000 public servants. Of the original 23 states which expressed
                         interest in participating, the project had resources for 19 due to exchange rate differentials and increase in costs compared at appraisal. Of these 19 states, 2 states desisted from
                         participating after the procurement process took place, leaving the April 2011 action plan with 17 states. Since then, further 3 states have desisted from participating. The project will
                         close on December 31, 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                           The client continued to make progress in the completion of the action plan presented in April 2011, prepared for the project restructuring process concluded in June 2011 which
                         included the extension of the closing date until December 31, 2011. Initial findings from recadastramento activities signal the achievement of significant potential savings. All activities
                         are expected to be concluded by December 31, 2011, and project is expected to close on its current closing date with no further extensions.
