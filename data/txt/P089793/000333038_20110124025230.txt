STATE PENSION
 
REFORM II TAL 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
SUMMARY 
 
The proposed restructuring designates the Minister of Social Security as the Borrower’s 
Representative for disbursement purposes under Section 2.02. of Article II of the Loan 
Agreement.  This change is based on a request received from PGFN to facilitate project 
disbursements.  The Minister of Finance will continue as the Borrower’s Representative 
under the Loan. 
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
After considerable delay, three ICB contracts were signed in May 2010 for 
recadastramento 
(pension data quality improvement), which constitutes the central 
activity under the project.  A request for disbursement was submitted to the Bank in 
December but cannot be authorized until the requested change is effected to recognize the 
Minister of Social Security as the Borrower’s Representative for disbursement purposes.  
Implementation has been rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.  The project will close in June 
2011 and any undisbursed funds will be canceled at that time.  
 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
·
Institutional arrangements  
 
The proposed restructuring requires the following change: (i) to include the 
Borrower’s Representative for disbursement purposes under Section 2.02. of 
Article II of the Loan Agreement, i.e. the Minister of Social Security. 
 
APPRAISAL SUMMARY
 
The proposed restructuring does not change the original appraisal of the Project nor does 
it trigger new risks.
