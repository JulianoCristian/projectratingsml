There will be anticipated\n            impacts, and mitigating measures. During construction, the\n            total closure of roads should be avoided and single line\n            traffic maintained wherever possible. Where existing\n            services such as water, sewerage, electricity and telephone\n            lines have to be temporarily disconnected, the period of\n            disconnection should be kept to a minimum. Heavy transport\n            and equipment activity should be restricted to normal\n            working hours. The development of new water sources must be\n            linked to the availability of resources without derogation\n            of existing supplies. For new boreholes, a survey of\n            adjacent wells must be undertaken and data on ground water\n            levels, pumping rates and water quality collected. All new\n            boreholes will be subjected to test pumping on completion,\n            at a discharge rate greater than that at which they will be\n            expected to operate. Wastewater sub-projects require\n            particular attention to the disposal of raw sewage flows.\n            Where this is to a regional trunk collector, the capacity of\n            the pipeline to take the increased flows must be\n            established. Where sewage is ultimately discharged to a\n            treatment works, its capacity must be adequate to take the\n            additional flows. The generation of dust and exhaust fumes\n            should be kept to a minimum. Access and haul roads should be\n            kept swept and sprayed with water. Spoil heaps should also\n            be sprayed. Hauling trucks shall be properly covered."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
