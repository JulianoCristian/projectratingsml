risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a key\n            recommendation for future project design is to avoid\n            subsuming a broad range of objectives and sectors under the\n            umbrella of a single emergency project. It is more effective\n            to focus projects on specific sectors and activities that\n            are directly related to the immediate reconstruction\n            efforts. Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) may not be the most\n            appropriate lending instrument for 'softer' or\n            longer term interventions such as disaster preparedness and\n            prevention since ERLs are typically designed for a three\n            year project implementation period. Economic recovery\n            initiatives are best formulated under a separate project\n            with clear and measurable employment, income, and\n            empowerment outcome/impact indicators. Incompatibilities\n            must be resolved up front in dealing with bidding and\n            contract regulation mechanisms in countries where they are\n            different from those of the World Bank. Emergency\n            reconstruction projects of this nature should have a\n            monitoring and evaluation system in place upfront with\n            mechanism to track core performance indicators. Community\n            participation in identifying sub-projects is essential. Many\n            of the EERP subprojects were identified and implemented with\n            very limited consideration given to this aspect, for\n            example, in some cases subprojects were contrary to local\n            priorities bringing public dissatisfaction, conflicts and delay."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
