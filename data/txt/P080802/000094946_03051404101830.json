Recovery\n            Project will relieve the socioeconomic hardships caused by\n            the earthquakes in Kermanshah (April 2002), and in Qazvin,\n            Zanjan, and Hamedan (June 2002), through the reconstruction\n            of public, and private assets, and, by developing an\n            effective monitoring, mitigation, and management system\n            designed to reduce the impact of future earthquakes. The\n            project will finance: a) reconstruction of housing, and\n            social and public infrastructure; b) economic recovery to\n            reduce vulnerability; c) capacity building and project\n            management; and, d) disaster insurance preparation. The\n            project will directly benefit affected populations, by\n            supporting the restoration of economic activities, in\n            particular, agricultural production, which is the main\n            source of income in the affected areas. Technical assistance\n            will provide wider public benefits, by strengthening the\n            public sector capacity, to become responsive in the face of\n            natural disasters. However, the major risk is the potential\n            delay in project implementation, given limited knowledge of\n            both the implementing agency in procurement procedures, and\n            the Bank with Iranian authorities. To minimize this risk, at\n            appraisal time, procurement training was provided to\n            Government authorities, while finance management training\n            will be provided to the Project Management Unit during\n            implementation, in addition to intensive Bank supervision\n            closely monitoring implementation. Furthermore, the\n            insurance component creates another risk, in that it\n            requires a separate committee and a working group, but\n            provision of technical assistance, including studies,\n            advisory services, and the preparation of a regulatory\n            reform, should minimize this risk."}, "docdt": "2003-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
