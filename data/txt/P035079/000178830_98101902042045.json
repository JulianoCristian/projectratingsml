disposal in Pusan City and Chunbuk Province.\n            This report consists mainly of the environmental impact\n            assessment for i) the Pusan City Janglim Sewage Treatment\n            Plant; and ii) the Specified Wastes Incineration Plant in\n            Chunbuk Province. To mitigate the impact of air pollution\n            during construction, dust will be reduced by paving road\n            surfaces, spraying water, and controlling the speed limit of\n            vehicles. Sludge generated during operation will be burnt.\n            Sewage and waste water will be treated on the project sites\n            to meet the requirement of water quality. The impact of\n            noise pollution will be mitigated by controlling night work\n            during construction. Sound-proof equipment will be used to\n            reduce noise level during operation. Odor generated by the\n            wastes will be mitigated by isolating the location of the\n            storage facility and by cleaning it periodically. Trucks for\n            waste transportation will be covered. Gas generated from the\n            land fill will be collected and incinerated."}, "docdt": "1994-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
