and Chunbuk province environmental, institutional and\n            technological concerns regarding wastewater and specified\n            waste disposal; to reduce the health hazards of surface and\n            ground water contamination; and to promote the reuse of\n            treated effluent on a major scale. The project will have two\n            main components. The first component consists of the second\n            phase expansion of the Janglim wastewater treatment plant,\n            in Pusan, comprising the construction of: primary and\n            secondary treatment units to increase its capacity; tertiary\n            treatment units to treat the effluent for reuse as\n            industrial water; and 4.5 km of interceptor sewers; and two\n            pumping stations. The second component includes the supply\n            and installation of a specified waste incineration unit, in Kunsan."}, "docdt": "1994-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
