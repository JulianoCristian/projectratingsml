      sustainability likely, and the institutional development\n            impact substantial. Lessons outline the expensive cost of\n            environmental protection management, as evidenced in both\n            Kunsan and Pusan. Instead, by thoroughly evaluating the\n            technical alternatives, and their impacts, based on\n            discussions with the environment protection agent, and the\n            initiating investor on the least-cost solution for the\n            society, could excessive costs be avoided. As for private\n            operators of environmental facilities (and contrary to\n            popular belief), these are less likely to be exposed to\n            pressures from local civic groups than the Government,\n            demonstrated by the case of Kunsan, currently the only\n            incinerator for specified waste owned by the Government, but\n            exposed to systematic demands from civic groups. This is\n            likely because the Government is much more sensitive to\n            negative exposure than the private sector. Furthermore, the\n            legal-commercial aspects of the sewerage service requiring a\n            contract between the service provider, and the beneficiary,\n            was not pursued in Pusan. This contractual relationship\n            should be enforced to enable more efficient, and better\n            quality treatment. Additionally, a municipal land use\n            policy, and urban planning blueprint, should be completed\n            prior to the design of wastewater treatment plants,\n            particularly for mixed residential and industrial areas, to\n            include zoning enforcement, and environmental regulations\n            concerning the use, and discharge of wastewater."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
