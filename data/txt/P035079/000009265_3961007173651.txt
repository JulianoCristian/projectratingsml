MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A WASTE DISPOSAL PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$75 million to help
finance a Waste Disposal Project.  The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace. A part
of the proceeds of the loan in the amount of US$60 million equivalent would be
onlent to Pusan City on the same terms as the Bank loan, including foreign exchange
and interest risks, plus a 0.05X p.a. administrative charge.
2.    Backgrour.. KoreaIs industrial growth and higher living standards have greatly
increased the generation of various waste. Wastewater is projected to grow from 11
million m3/d in 1990 to 19 million m3/d in 2001, solid waste from 145,000 t/d to
250,000 t/d, and specified waste' from 3,000 t/d to 12,500 t/d. Resulting
deterioration of the environment has become a concern to the public and the
Government.
3.    The protection of rivers is outlined in the 1990 National Wastewater Treatment
Plan. The Plan, now being implemented, will reduce river pollution expressed as
BOD, from 960 t/d in 1990 to 450 t/d in 2001. Achieving this goal depends not only
on new wastewater treatment plants (WTP) but on strict regulation and adopting
technical advances, such as reuse of effluent. This project would include a plant
that would produce effluent of reusable quality.
4.    The 1993 National Comprehensive Waste Disposal Plan (NCWDP) sets out solid
waste policy: collection and disposal would involve both private and public sectors,
with the latter responsible for (a) policy and management, (b) filling in areas
where the private sector faces difficulties which it cannot reasonably control, such
as resistance to disposal sites; and (c) disposal of dangerous categories of
specified waste.
5.    Management of the environment, including sewerage, wastewater treatment and
general and specified waste is the responsibility of local governments supported by
the Ministry of Environment (MOE).   MOE provides standards and guidelines for
implementing environmental  laws  and monitors  compliance.    Its Environmental
Management Corporation (EMC), provides technical support and loans for on-site
recycling and treatment of waste, and manages a wide range of specialized waste
treatment and disposal facilities, including those for dangerous categories of
specified waste. NCWDP includes the establishment by 2001 of six comprehensive
treatment and disposal facilities countrywide to treat and dispose of such dangerous
waste. This project would support construction of one such facility.
6.    Project Objectives.  The project objectives are to support Government efforts
1 Korea identifies residential and non-toxic work-site waste as general
waste. SRecified waste includes 22 categories of toxic work-site waste, such as
acids and alkalis, oils, organic solvents, asbestos, pesticides, polychlorinated
bi-phenyl (PCB), and sludge containing heavy metals. In many countries these are
called hazardous.



2
to address in Pusan city and Chunbuk province environmental, institutioual and
technological concerns regarding wastewater and specified waste disposal; to reduce
the health hazards of surface and ground water contamination; and to promote large-
scale reuse of treated effluent.
7.    Project Desgrintion.  The project's two components are located in Pusan and
Kunsan.  The Pusan component would expand Janglim WTP, comprising construction of
primary and secondary treatment to increase its capacity by 285,000 m3/d to 615,000
m3/d; tertiary treatment for 615,000 m3/d to render the effluent suitable for reuse
by industry; 4.5 km of interceptor sewers and two pumping stations. The Kunsan
component woulld supply and install a 60 t/d incineration unit within the Kunsan
integrated specified waste treatment plant serving C!.unbuk provinc. Consulting
services to super-rise construction of both components and trainiti., in managing the
incineration unit are also included.
8.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$273.2 million, of which
US$242.6 million and US$30.6 million would be Pusan and Kunsan components,
respectively.  At the Government request the Bank loan would finance only equipment
and associated materials. A breakdown of costs and the findncing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in Korea are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 13570-KO, dated November 14, 1994, is being distributed
separately.
S.    Projeot Inlemnentation.  The PAsan component would be implemented trom 1995
to 1999 by the city's construction center on behalf of Pusan Sewerage Management
Office (PSM), and the Kunsan component from 1996 to 1999 by EMC on behalf of MOE's
Waste Treatment  Facilities Division.   Both  agencies would be  supported by
consultants.
10.   Project Sutainability would be ensured by the permanence and financial
stability of PSM and EMC, the operating agencies, which operate and maintain several
similar plants. Also, both agencies would maintain tariffs that would adequately
finance their operations.
11.   Lessons froM Previous Bank Lending. Bank finance helped five water supply and
two sewerage projects, and prepared a sector study. The water supply projects
expanded services in about 73 municipalities. Four were successfully completed and
one is under implementation. The Bank helped to introduce corporate planning and
computerized accounting, establish tariff policies, transfer leak detection
technology, and improve water supply services organization. The sewerage projects,
now being implemented, will improve the environment in four cities, reduce health
hazards and continue Bank support for technological and institutional advancement
in the sector.
12.    The Bank evaluation indicates that the completed projects substantially
contributed to institutional dev7elopment (PPAR Nos. 8174 and 11950) and that the
goals were achieved or surpassed (Report No. 11062 Annual Review on Evaluation
Results -OED, August 1992); they also state that well defined objectives and the
commitment of the agencies contributed to success. Noting these lessons, and with
the firm support of the implementing agencies, this project is well prepared to



3
focus on key goals.
13.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on December 23. 1993. The
CAS and the graduation plan for Korea identified environmental improvement and the
managing of waste as an appropriate area for continued Bank participation.  The
project would upgrade a major WTP and link water conservation and pollution
prevention by introducing reuse of effluent.
14.   The specified waste component provides the Bank with an opportunity to support
the Covernment's policies in a sector wvt-re the lack of in-country technological
expertise and operational experience is acknowledged. The Government welcomes Bank
support to introduce advanced equipment and management practices to treat the most
dangercus waste, and to implement MOE's national specified waste strategy.
15.   Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that (a) Pusan
City and MOE would implement environmental monitoring programs co evaluate the
environmental impact of the facilities provided; and, on evaluation of results,
would prepare and submit to the Bank for comments a plan for mitigating actions; (b)
the financial statements of PSM sewerage special account and Kunsan treatment plant
account would be audited. Such statements and audit reports would also include a
separate opinion on Statement of Expenditures and the Special Account for the Bank
loan; (c) PSM would produce funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than
25X of the annual average of its capital expenditure; (d) Kunsan treatment plant
would produce revenues equal to not less than the sum of its total operating
expense, depreciation, and total indirect expenses; (e) Pusan City and MOE would
provide semi-annual progress reports, including revised project cost estimates and
implementing schedules as well as their annual updated financial projections.
Disbursement for each component would be conditional on the execution, respectively,
of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and Pusan City and of a Kunsan
plant contract between MOE and EMC.
16.   Environmental Aspects.  Both components would treat and dispose of municipal
and industrial waste, and thus have a positive impact on improving the environment
and public health. The Pusan component would treat wastewater that would otherwise
pollute the Nakdong river.   Tertiary treatment would further improve effluent
quality, provide a major source of industrial water, and reduce future demand for
water from the river. The Kunsan component would treat and dispose of specified
waste generated in Chunbuk province and its industrial complex at Kunsan. Treatment
and safe disposal of specified waste would minimize environmental damage and danger
to public health.
17:   The environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are open to public review, have
MOE approval, and are satisfactory.   Measures would be taken to mitigate any
negative impacts that occur during construction and result from operating the new
facilities, (noise, air pollution, effluent discharges, and transporting sludge).
Plant performance and environmental impact would also be monitored and corrective
measures applied if performance is unsatisfactory.   EIA summaries were made
available to the Board in September 1994.
18.   Program Objective Categories. The project would provide a WTP in a large city
and dispose of specified waste from a major industrial complex. While these



4
components *-ould not reduce poverty, or address women's issues, they would have a
great impact on the poorest segment of population which is the most exposed to the
dangers of pollution and untrented or improperly disposed of toxic waste.
19.   Project Benefits.  The Pusan component would: (a) improve  water quality in
the Nakdong river, (b) reduce health risks now posed by pollution for commercial
fishing, water sports and recreation, and (c) protect a bird habitat in the Natural
Environment Preservation Area on the estuary.   Reuse of treated effluent would
further reduce river pollution and defer new abstractions from Pusan's water source.
The Kunsan component would: (a) treat and dispose of the most hazardous specified
waste, and (b) provide advanced waste treatment technologies.
20.   Rlsks. No significant risks are expected during implementation; the decision
to carry out both components within the planned schedule has been taken and
financing Is being secured. Local concern about the specified waste component may
affect progress but the Government has regular open consultations in the projecc
area and intends to continue them during construction to maximize public
understanding.
21.   The risk oE inefficient operation of facilities is countered by monitoring
instruments to be installed under the project.   Local vigilance and Government
capacity to take legal action in response to negligence would minimize long-term
risks.
22.   Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
