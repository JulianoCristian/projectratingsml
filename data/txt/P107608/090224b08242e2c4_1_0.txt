                         Civil works on the Pulgon-Burgandy section (km 123-155; 32kms) of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor have been completed on-time and within the budget. The section was
                         handed over to the Osh-Batken-Isfana Road Department (OBI UAD). As a result of the works performed transport fare (travel by car) reduced by 23% on average according to survey

                         The contract for civil works contract for the Nookat Pass (km10-28) and sections in and around Osh (15 km) and Jalal-Abad cities (3 km) was signed. Works on Nookat Pass are
                         progressing well (ahead of the schedule). Works in Osh (Osmonova and Airport Streets) have not started yet (expected to start in 2014 construction season). Only pothole repair
                         works started per request of Osh Regional Road Department (RRD). Works in Jalal-Abad (3 kms) will be financed from the MOTC budget, as agreed and confirmed earlier by the
                         MOTC.

                         On Road Safety Enhancement, most activities have been completed. Bidding documents for the road accident crash database were finalized and submitted to the Bank for final
                         review. The Road Safety Strategy and underlying detailed Action Plan has been approved by all ministries and submitted to the Ministry of Justice for approval.

                         On Road Asset Management Improvement (RAMS), an international consultant was recruited, two MOTC staff members (Road Engineer and IT Specialist) were assigned and a
                         RAMS Coordinator (IPIG Deputy Director) within IPIG was appointed. Initial road data collection will be undertaken with the help of the Kyrgyz Road Transport Design Institute
                         (KDTP) which has the necessary equipment for road roughness measurement. Instructions on road condition data collection are prepared.
