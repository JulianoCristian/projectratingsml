                          The overall implementation progress of the Project is satisfactory. The latest observations from the last supervision mission (April 2013) present evidence that the Project
                         Development Objectives are likely to be achieved by the end of the Project.

                         Civil works on the Pulgon-Burgandy section (km 123-155; 32kms) of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor are satisfactorily completed on-time and within the budget. The Supervision

                         During April 2013 supervision mission and the visit in August 2013 the Bank team observed good quality of road pavement, structures and other works.

                         4,502 person/months were generated going beyond the target of 4,122 person/months. Osh city administration and benefiting communities expressed their general appreciation for
                         the project, works performed and visible improvement of roads quality. Continued routine maintenance of city roads remains an issue of concern for Osh city administration. The
                         limited financings from the city budget does not fully support routine and periodic maintenance needs of the city road network, while the project was providing 4-6 times of city annual
                         budget for these types of works. Most of resources from the city budget are directed to city-center areas, while in peri-urban neighborhoods the city administration tries to mobilize
                         local communities to carry out drainage cleaning and routine maintenance.

                         Civil works contract for the Nookat Pass (km10-28) and sections in and around Osh (15 km) and Jalal-Abad cities (3 km) has been signed with Xinjiang Beixin Road and Bridge
                         Construction Co Ltd (China). The contractor has mobilized equipment, plants and laboratory and already started works on the Nookat Pass, whereas rehabilitation of city roads in
                         Osh and Jalal-Abad are scheduled for the next calendar year.

                         The Road Safety Strategy and underlying detailed Action Plan including required budget for each action and good analysis is now being finalized by the Ministry of Transport and
                         Communications to be approved as a National Strategy of the Government. All relevant stakeholders, including Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Internal Affairs,
                         Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Health and others have participated at the official launch workshop chaired by Vice Prime Minister Sarpashev in May 2013. The Ministry of Transport
                         and Communications will enforce its implementation by other line ministries and local governments through the Government Resolution.

                         The Road Asset Management has been pronounced to be a strategic priority of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. In September 2013, a team of internationally and
                         nationally recruited individual consultants are expected to start jointly with MOTC staff the collection of condition data for the core road network, to develop a road database and
                         analyze the results with a view to improve the planning, programming and budgeting of road maintenance works in the country.

                         As started during the previous supervision mission (June 2012), the Bank team continues conducting analysis of social and economic benefits resulting from rehabilitation of sections
                         of Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor, in particular, from new roadside construction and businesses. For this assignment a local firm has been contracted by the Bank. Works are now at
                         pilot and administrative data collection stage. As soon as administration data are collected, selection of target villages will be enabled. 4 focus group discussions and 2 KII have been
                         conducted.
