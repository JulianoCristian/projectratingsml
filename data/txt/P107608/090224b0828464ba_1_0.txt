                         In a letter dated April 15, 2014 the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic requested for reallocation of grant proceeds of the IDA Grant H5200 to finance expenditures related to

                         IDA Credit 4658-KG and IDA Credit 4826-KG under the project to address the requested increase in civil works contingency on bypass road section of Osh City (Yuldashev and
                         Osmonov Streets). These road sections make a part of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor and are considered as the republican roads being on the balance sheet of the Ministry of
                         Transport and Communications of Kyrgyz Republic (MOTC). The increase in civil works contingency was due to the proposed upgrade of scope of works from asphalt overlay to full
                         rehabilitation due to severe cracks and rutting of the existing pavement. On July 25, 2014 the Bank notified the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic on concurrence with the

                         request and reallocation of the project proceeds to complete contingent civil works.

                         On Road Repairs and Rehabilitation, works are progressing well with all civil works contracts signed and ongoing. As of July 2014, on Osh bypass road (Osmonova Street) and Osh
                         Airport road the contractor completed repairing potholes and crack sealing works in preparation for asphalt paving works. On Nookat Pass, the contractor completed earthworks and
                         is about to finish asphalt paving works.

                         On Road Safety Enhancement, most activities have been completed. An Invitation for Bids (IFB) was no-objected by the Bank and published on July 16, 2014. The Road Safety
                         Strategy and underlying detailed Action Plan approved by all ministries is now with the Ministry of Justice for approval.

                         On Road Asset Management Improvement (RAMS), implementation is moving on. The international consultant is expected to visit the country in the first two weeks of August 2014 to
                         train designated staff of the MOTC Road Department (DDH) on visual surveys.
                         Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in cooperation with PLUADs (Regional Road Agency) has undertaken roughness survey on over 4,100 km of roads throughout the
                         country. JICA will share roughness survey data with the Investment Projects Implementation Group (IPIG) and the DDH and organize same survey on missing road sections of the
                         Osh-Batken-Isfana corridor.
