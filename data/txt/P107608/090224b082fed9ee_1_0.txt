1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. Until 2008, a favorable external environment and sound economic policies resulted
in a steady increase in the pace of economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic. Later on, adverse
external developments led to deterioration in economic conditions. The rise in global food
and fuel prices combined with the global and regional economic slowdown hampered the
performance of the Kyrgyz economy. The outlook worsened considerably as trade and
remittances declined. However, external assistance (e.g., Russia, the International Monetary
Fund) helped the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (GOK) maintain its macroeconomic
stability while mitigating the impact of the crisis in 2009.

1.1.2. The transport system, in particular the road network, was a priority for GOK given
its importance in providing access to markets and basic public services. At the time of
project preparation, 92 percent of passenger travel and 59 percent of freight traffic was
carried by road in Kyrgyzstan. The National Road Rehabilitation (Osh-Batken-Isfana)
Project (NRRP) was designed to respond to the demand for reliable, affordable and safe
access along an important transport route - the Osh-Batken-Isfana (OBI) road. This
corridor, one of the country’s six strategic corridors, provides the only connection for about
one million inhabitants or 18 percent of the population with the rest of the country. The
original alignment of the corridor crosses through Uzbek and Tajikistan territories.

1.1.3. Travelling this road was no problem in the past when there was one transport network
connecting cities within the Former Soviet Union. Since 1991, the situation has changed
due to the creation of enclaves resulting in transit through foreign territory. Frequent delays
experienced at border crossing points arising from lengthy and sometimes cumbersome
control procedures severely hampered connectivity along the road. Existing secondary
roads which deviate around 110 km from the original alignment (so-called ‘detours’) were
in poor to very poor condition. GOK planned to primarily rehabilitate the detours and link
them with the original alignment during Phase I. Phase II was expected to focus on the
rehabilitation of the original alignment, which would form the OBI road corridor to by-
pass foreign territory (Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) and their enclaves within the Kyrgyz
Republic. Road safety was alarming in Kyrgyzstan, with about 41 deaths per 10,000
vehicles, which was 30 times higher than in Western Europe and 3 times higher than in
Eastern Europe and Asia. Bad road conditions, increased speeds on improved roads, lack
of effective road safety education for all road users, traffic rule violations, and increasing
population were the main causes of high accident rates.

1.1.4. There were three main reasons for the involvement of the World Bank in this
Project: (i) the World Bank was asked by the Government to act as the lead donor for the
preparation of the rehabilitation of the entire road corridor from Osh to Isfana; (ii) the Bank
together with the World Health Organization took the leading role internationally to
improve road safety; and (iii) the Bank was well placed to define and implement support
for institutional development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1. The objectives of the Project were: (i) to contribute to the reduction of transport
costs and travel time along the Osh-Batken-Isfana Road Corridor, and (ii) to improve road
safety planning. Progress towards the attainment of the PDO was to be assessed through
the following indicators:

(i)     Project Outcome Indicators:
 Reduction in transport costs for road users, by car and large bus, along the project road
    section and in the project area;
 Reduction in travel time for road users, by car and large bus, along the project road
    section and in the project area;
 Proportional increase in traffic one year after project road section has been improved
    or rehabilitated;
 Proportional increase in the number of rural people in the project area who live within
    2 km of an all-season road;
 Increased effectiveness of road safety planning (road safety planning is conducted in
    an integrated and comprehensive manner).

(ii)    Intermediate Outcome Indicators:
 Number of kilometers of all roads rehabilitated under the project;
 Percentage of the total classified road network in the project area in good and fair
     condition;
 National road safety program developed and launched;
 Pilot demonstration projects on road safety along the project road section developed;
 Technical audit is conducted.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1. As part of Level-1 Restructuring/ First Additional Financing (AF1) which was
processed as an emergency operation and approved by the Bank Board of Directors on
September 30, 2010, the PDOs incorporated a third sub-objective to reflect scaled-up
project activities. The PDOs became to: (i) contribute to the reduction of transport costs
and travel time along the OBI road corridor, (ii) improve road safety planning, and (iii)
repair and rehabilitate road infrastructure in and around Osh and Jalal-Abad cities
thereby creating temporary jobs. During the second Level-1 Restructuring/Second
Additional Financing (AF2) approved by the Bank Board of Directors on June 28, 2011,
the PDOs remained the same but incorporated another aspect to the second sub-objective
to reflect the inclusion of a new activity. The PDOs became to: (i) contribute to the
reduction of transport costs and travel time along the OBI road corridor, (ii) improve road
safety planning and road asset management, and (iii) repair and rehabilitate road
infrastructure in and around Osh and Jalal-Abad cities thereby creating temporary jobs.

1.3.2. During AF1 and AF2, the Results Framework and associated monitoring indicators
were revised to either reflect increased project scope or clarify that those indicators relate


                                              2
only the OBI road corridor and to later break those indicators down into two sub-indicators
for each individual major section of that corridor. One PDO indicator and two intermediate
indicators were introduced during AF1, and two PDO indicators and an intermediate one
during AF2. During AF2, the intermediate indicator “National road safety program
developed and launched” was upgraded to the PDO level. One PDO indicator and one
intermediate indicator were dropped during AF2. The summary of changes to the
monitoring indicators is presented in Annex 2, Section B.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1. The primary target group included road users who were expected to benefit from
(i) reduced transport costs, (ii) reduced travel time, (iii) route options increase allowing
more direct travel between destinations, thereby creating a more accessible and reliable
transport system, and (iv) safer traveling on the improved project road section. The project
was expected to benefit people and goods going to and from Batken Oblast or on transit to
Tajikistan. The project was expected to make a significant contribution to the level of
connectivity offered as the road corridor provides the only connection between the main
Kyrgyz cities in Fergana valley (such as Osh and Batken cities) and the rest of the country.
The local population surveyed as part of the social assessment during project preparation
responded overwhelmingly positive about the expected benefits of the Project, with 89
percent claiming that it would bring tangible benefits to their households. Local contractors
and local communities of the city of Osh were also direct beneficiaries of temporary job
opportunities created under AF1.

1.4.2. The secondary target group included government institutions that were expected to
benefit from improved capacity in road safety planning through development and launch
of a national road safety program, preparation of demonstration projects for road safety,
establishment of road accident database and purchase of road safety equipment. MOTC’s
RMD was also expected to benefit from the development of Road Asset Management
System (RAMS).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1. The original Project was approved on by the Board on November 3, 2009 and
became effective on February 26, 2010. The Project consisted of three components: (i) road
repairs and rehabilitation, (ii) road safety enhancement and road asset management, and
(iii) project management and implementation.

1.5.2. Component 1: Rehabilitation of a Section of the Osh-Batken-Isfana Road Corridor
(Estimated total cost of US$27.29 million equivalent). The component was to finance the
provision of works and consultants’ services for the rehabilitation of about 30 km of the OBI
road corridor. This included consultancy services for construction supervision (estimated at
US$1.5 million) and physical and price contingencies (estimated at about 8 percent).

1.5.3. Component 2: Road Safety Planning Improvement (Estimated total cost of US$1.50
million equivalent). This component was to finance the provision of goods, and consultants’
services for: (i) the development and launch of a national road safety program; (ii)


                                             3
preparation of demonstration projects for road safety; and (iii) improvement of road safety
planning. This component was to build on the Government’s Road Sector Development
Strategy and the work then carried out by the Permanent Secretariat for Road Safety on the
revision of road safety guidelines and the preparation of a National Road Safety Program.
Other road safety related activities that were considered for support included the
establishment of road accident database and purchase of road safety equipment.

1.5.4. Component 3: Project Management and Implementation (Estimated total cost of
US$1.93 million). This component was to finance the provision of goods, consultants’
services, training, and operating costs, including an audit, to support Project coordination,
implementation and management. Consulting services were to be used to assist the PIU
with the preparation, management and implementation of all activities associated with the
Project, including the updated of the feasibility study and technical designs and the
supervision of all safeguards and fiduciary aspects of the Project. Other donors were
providing the PIU with parallel financing for their operating costs.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1. There were changes to the names of the first two components as well as changes to
project activities under project components during both level-1 restructurings, which were
done as part of AF1 and AF2. The first Level-1 Restructuring/AF1 was an emergency
operation processed under OP/BP 8.00, prepared in response to social unrest in the Kyrgyz
Republic during April and June 2010. It was designed to support scaling up road
rehabilitation activities of the original Project and create temporary jobs in road
construction in areas affected by the civil unrest.

1.6.2. Activity 1: Road Repairs and Rehabilitation (US$9.5 million equivalent). AF1 was
to finance two types of civil works in addition to increasing the scope of consultants’
services initially procured under the original Project to design and supervise civil works:(i)
the repair of urban roads within the city of Osh; and (ii) rehabilitation of urban roads in and
around greater Osh and Jalal-Abad cities.

(a) Rehabilitation of a Section of the Osh-Batken-Isfana Road Corridor – additional
consultants’ services related to road works (US$0.5 million equivalent). This activity was
to finance expanded scope of consultants’ services procured under the original Project to
cover design, design review, preparing bidding documentation, providing technical support
for bid evaluation, consultant services for construction supervision, and social assessment
for activities envisioned under AF1.

(b) Repair of urban roads within the city of Osh (US$4.5 million equivalent). This activity
was to finance routine repairs of urban roads that are under City of Osh administrative
responsibility. Works were to include pothole patching, crack sealing, edge repairs,
sidewalk repairs, rehabilitation of open canal urban storm water drains on a wide network
of primary and secondary streets, and other minor rehabilitation. Repair works were to be
carried out by small local contractors selected through competitive tenders under Term
Maintenance Contracts. During the first phase, about three contracts were expected to be
awarded by November 2010. This type of routine repair work was to take place during


                                              4
winter months, involve low-skill tasks, and provide temporary supplemental income for
many local residents. A second batch of contracts was to be awarded in early 2011 with
adjustments made based on experience from the first batch.

Since the proposed AF was processed on an emergency basis, implementation was
expected to adopt a phased approach. If funds were made available, resurfacing or
rehabilitation of some Osh city roads was to be considered. In order to do this equitably,
respecting local sensitivities, a social assessment was to be completed to identify roads for
more extensive repair works. The activity was to also finance technical assistance to assess
financing options for municipal road maintenance activities and to benchmark of several
practices by Kyrgyz cities to identify good practice guidance for future financing of
municipal road maintenance.

(c) Rehabilitation of urban roads in and around the greater Osh and Jalal-Abad cities
(US$4.5 million equivalent). This activity was to finance works provision to rehabilitate
urban roads that are in and around the greater cities and their surrounding areas, including
proposed road rehabilitation of a section in Jalal-Abad). Priority road sections included a
section of the OBI road corridor that enters the city of Osh, and two adjoining sections of
the Osh Ring Road that would reduce the traffic flow into the city.

1.6.3. Activity 2: Road Safety Enhancement (US$0.2 million equivalent). Activity 2 was
to finance the provision of road safety goods and equipment, such as traffic cones, mobile
traffic signs, reflective jackets, thermal plastic paint, illuminated medium strip (so-called
“cat’s eyes”). It was expected to build on the Government Road Sector Development
Strategy, the recently launched program of regular road safety audits, and help finalize the
National Road Safety Program. These small-scale activities were considered an MOTC
pilot project to develop the Ministry’s awareness of international good practices.

1.6.4. Activity 3: Project Management and Implementation (US$0.3 million equivalent).
Activity 3 was to finance provision of (i) goods, consultants’ services, training, and
operating costs, including an audit, to support Project coordination, implementation and
management and (ii) consultant’s services to develop and implement a communications
strategy for Project activities.

1.6.5. The second Level-1 Restructuring/AF2 was prepared to address the request of the
MOF to accommodate another section of the same road corridor, which was initially
rejected due to insufficient funds from IDA for the original project, and provide technical
assistance to improve road asset management. The activities proposed under AF2 were to
scale-up the activities of the original Project and AF1, as modified and expanded below:

1.6.6. Component 1: Road Repairs and Rehabilitation. This component was to finance:
       1.1 Provision of works and consultants' services for the rehabilitation of segments
       of the OBI road corridor.
       1.2 Provision of works and consultants' services for the repair of urban roads within
       the city of Osh and the assessment of financing options for road maintenance
       activities by municipalities.



                                             5
       1.3 Provision of works and consultants' services for the rehabilitation of urban roads
       in and around the greater Osh and Jalal-Abad city vicinities.

1.6.7. Component 2: Road Safety Enhancement and Road Asset Management. This
component was to finance:
       2.1 Provision of goods and consultants' services for: (i) development and launch of
       a national road safety program; (ii) preparation of pilot demonstration projects for
       road safety; and improvement of road safety planning.
       2.2 Provision of goods and consultants' services for the development and
       implementation of a road asset management system.

1.6.8. Component 3: Project Management and Implementation. This component was to
finance:
       3.1 Provision of goods, consultants' services, training, and Operating Costs,
       including an audit to support Project coordination, implementation and
       management.
       3.2 Provision of consultants' services for the development and implementation of a
       communication strategy for the Project activities.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1. The Project underwent four restructurings. The first two were Level-1
restructurings in 2010 and 2011, which were also Additional Financings, and the other two
were Level-2 restructurings in July and December 2014. The summary of restructurings,
major changes and reasons for those changes are presented in Table 1 below.

1.7.2. Schedule. With the increased scope of work under AFs, the project closing dates
were extended twice, which brought the total extension period to 18 months and the total
implementation period to 4 years and 10 months, instead of the original three years.

1.7.3. Implementation arrangements. MOTC was responsible for the implementation of
all transport and communications related projects, including the NRRP. Prior to NRRP
financed by the World Bank, MOTC, and the Investment Projects Implementation Group
(IPIG) within MOTC had implemented a number of projects financed by other donors with
a good track record. The IPIG was responsible for the financial management function of
the Project, including flow of funds, budgeting, internal control, accounting, reporting, and
auditing. There were no major changes to the implementation arrangements during the
restructurings. AF1 introduce a slight change to the implementation arrangements in order
to support the implementation of maintenance works on Osh urban roads, which were
under the jurisdiction of the Osh municipality. A cooperation agreement between MOTC
and the Osh City Administration was signed and executed.

1.7.4. Funding allocations. The government’s co-financing for the parent project
represented 20 percent of the total project costs. The original Project included Government
counterpart funding for US$5.76 million equivalent of total Project costs of US$30.72
million equivalent. AF1 and AF2 covered 100 percent of Project costs and no co-financing
was planned from the Government or other donors. The last two Level-2 restructurings


                                             6
entailed reallocation of the IDA Grant H5200 (see Annex 2, Section C) and partial
cancellation of uncommitted funds in the amount of SDR732.8 from the IDA Credit 46580.
These funds were to be reallocated to other IDA operations in the Kyrgyz Republic.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1. Soundness of the background analysis. The preparation of NRRP was launched in
October 2007 after the recognition of the OBI Road Corridor as one of key priorities in the
country’s Road Sector Strategy Development Strategy 2007-2010 and the Presidential
program of Roads Development for 2008-2010. Because this was a corridor type of project
and the updated feasibility study, detailed designs and the bidding documents were prepared
for the entire corridor, project preparation took two years from 2007 to 2009, but sped up in
2009. It was built on two general and country specific lessons learned, specifically that: (i)
improving the overall management of the national road network remained a priority and (ii)
greater efforts were required to reduce road traffic accidents. There was a solid rationale for
the Bank involvement in the Project, which included three main reasons: (i) the
Government’s request of the Bank to act as the lead donor for the preparation of the
rehabilitation of the entire road corridor from Osh to Isfana (the updated Feasibility Study


                                                  7
and detailed technical designs for the corridor were financed out of a Project Preparation
Advance, PPA), (ii) the Bank’s joint leading role with the World Health Organization to
improve road safety worldwide, and (iii) the Bank’s sound position in defining and
implementing support for institutional development of transport sectors in many countries.

2.1.2. Assessment of the Project design. The design of the parent project was intentionally
kept simple in terms of components, geographic coverage, novelty, involved organizations,
and safeguard policies in order to achieve the PDO within the three-year implementation
period. There were an adequate number of components (three), which were not burdened
by complex contents. Geographically, the Project was not spread across the country, as the
civil works were limited to the same road corridor and the same region. There were no co-
financier involved in the Project, although other development partners (European
Commission, EC, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD)
contributed through parallel financing mechanisms. During project preparation the World
Bank made additional efforts to harmonize existing rules of the development partners in
order to save costs and streamline project implementation. The Government however
requested to use each financier’s disbursement and project rules. The implementation
arrangements were simple: MOTC, through IPIG, was the only implementing agency of the
project. IPIG had adequate capacity and sufficient experience to implement the project as it
had been involved in implementation of other donor-assisted projects under MOTC. The
project triggered only two policies OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP/BP 4.12
Involuntary Assessment. The main novelty supported by the parent project was that the road
safety audits were applied to the design in order to ensure ‘safe’ engineering. AF1 supported
the second novelty which was execution of municipal maintenance works with the
involvement of local communities.

2.1.3. Adequacy of Government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement and participatory
processes. Government’s strong commitment to the parent project was demonstrated
through a large share of co-financing – over US$5.76 (over 25 percent of the entire project
costs), its engagement of other development partners through parallel financing as well as
inclusion of activities in the Road Safety Component which were built on the Government’s
Road Sector Development Strategy and the work carried out by the Permanent Secretariat
for Road Safety. Key stakeholders were consulted with during project preparation through a
social assessment as well as informal interviews and participatory discussions. The
preparation of AF1 also involved a lot of social participatory work in order to minimize the
risk of this operation to inadvertently fuel tensions between communities and ensure that the
project design is sensitive to the fragile conflict dynamics in the south of Kyrgyzstan.

2.1.4. Assessment of risks. All risks were properly identified and mitigation measures were
adequately developed during project preparation. The overall risk rating of this project was
assessed as substantial before mitigation in light of the macroeconomic vulnerabilities and
other project related risks. However, with the development of all mitigation measures, the
overall risk of project implementation was rated as moderate. The preparation of the first
AF identified a number of significant socials risks associated with the promotion of road
maintenance with involvement of local communities. However, adequate mitigation
measures were developed and built in the design of the first AF which eventually prevented



                                             8
any of those risks from materializing. The preparation of the second AF also identified a
number of risks but compared to the previously identified risks they were insignificant and
the proposed mitigation measures were adequate and sufficient.

2.1.4. Despite the Bank’s and Recipient’s acknowledgement of the importance of greater
coordination between road safety stakeholder agencies as the first essential step they could
not anticipate that lack of efficient coordination and cooperation between the key
stakeholder government institutions (namely, MIA and MOTC) would be the main risk
faced during the implementation of road safety activities. It was the one which eventually
caused a delay in reaching a consensus on the establishment of the road accidents database
and the actual implementation of the National Road Safety Plan.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1. Implementation was rated as satisfactory in the Bank’s Implementation Status and
Results (ISR) reports throughout the project life. However, the last ISR rated it as
moderately satisfactory due to the cancelation of delayed procurement of a number of
consultancies. The project underwent two level-1 restructurings mainly to modify the
project design to respond to changing circumstances, and two level-2 restructurings in last
year of the project life to reallocate proceeds between categories in one of the Grants. .
These are discussed in earlier sections. The mid-term review carried out in September 2011
reviewed progress of project implementation and concluded that the PDOs were likely to
be achieved by the project closing date.

2.2.2. The following are major factors which were beyond the control of IPIG or MOTC
and affected project implementation:

2.2.3. Political events. During 2009 – 2014, there were six major changes in the
government (Council of Ministers). This directly affected the process of building
collaborative and partnership spirit with MIA and State Auto Inspection (SAI), which was
critical for the implementation of most of road safety activities. Once compromise was
reached by MOTC with MIA and SAI on several issues (either related to the development
of a new crash database or development and approval of a new Road Safety Program), the
key management staff were changed in MIA and SAI and MOTC had to start its partnership
building process from the scratch again. Despite frequent changes in the composition of
the Government, this did not affect MOTC much. The State Secretary, who was later
directly involved in IPIG, ensured continuity of the project and MOTC’s dedication to it.
His extensive sector experience and leadership skills benefited project implementation
during and after the civil unrest as well as ensuring the coordination of all work in the
sector and on the OBI corridor financed by multiple donors.

2.2.4. Civil unrest. In June 2010, large-scale conflict broke out in the Osh and Jalal-Abad
oblasts (regions) of southern Kyrgyz Republic. About 400,000 people were displaced and
several hundred people lost their lives. The violence was accompanied by large-scale
destruction of infrastructure with significant economic impacts. It is estimated that 3,450
houses, 700 commercial establishments and 79 public buildings were burnt down. The June
2010 events decimated livelihoods for numerous households. In total, about 1.1 million


                                             9
people, accounting for over a fifth of the Kyrgyz Republic’s population and over half of
the Osh and Jalal-Abad oblasts, were impacted. Although direct damage to transport
infrastructure was limited and little disruption was caused to the project implementation,
AF1 was prepared to alleviate the consequences of the civil unrest through scaling up
project activities. To promote peace, security, and social cohesion, AF1 supported the
creation of temporary employment for Uzbek and Tajik local communities through
involvement in road maintenance and repairs within a short time horizon.

2.2.5. Lack of MIA and SAI ownership and interest in key road safety activity. The
government appreciated the development of a National Road Safety Program (NRSP) and
had aspirations for upgrading its status from the level of a sector policy document to the
level of a national policy document, i.e., converting it to the National Road Safety Strategy.
As a result of the change in its status, this document had to undergo several reviews by all
concerned ministries and agencies prior to its final approval by the Parliament. However,
after going through multiple reviews for almost two years, it was not adopted as the
National Strategy applicable to all road safety stakeholder agencies but only as NRSP
applicable to MOTC. That is mainly due to the change of leadership in MIA and its
subsequent loss of interest which prevented MIA from finding consensus on a number of
proposed actions and recommendations included in the Strategy. Finally, MOTC and MIA
failed to reach agreement on the approval of this document as the National Strategy. The
procurement of a road accidents database was also significantly delayed due to the IPIG’s
delayed procurement process as well as lack of MIA and SAI interest, despite the Bank
management and team’s interventions and MOTC’s multiple demonstrations of importance
of such a database to carry out more effective planning of all road safety activities.

2.2.6. The following are the factors which were in control of IPIG or MOTC:

2.2.7. Outdated design for the civil works contract under AF2. Prior to the commencement
of the civil works under AF2 in 2012, it turned out that the approved detailed design for the
Nookat bypass section was no longer relevant and responsive to the level of traffic which
had increased significantly compared to the forecast during the feasibility study in 2009. The
design had to be revised and updated leading to the variation order. Later on, the same
contract which also covered two streets in the city of Osh (i.e., Osmonova and Yudasheva
streets) faced a similar design-related issue. The designs for both streets had to be also revised
and updated in order to respond to current road conditions which had deteriorated faster than
expected since the completion of the feasibility study. The Bank supported IPIG’s decision
in upgrading civil works on these two streets from overlaying to full rehabilitation.

2.2.8. Continuity and commitment of IPIG Staff. The project was implemented through a
period of enormous turmoil, yet, MOTC and IPIG demonstrated their dedication and high
professionalism during challenging times. The IPIG also demonstrated its effective
management of a number of projects financed by several donors, including the World Bank,
EBRD, ADB, EC and bilateral donors. Having the same unit to be in charge of implementing
projects in the same corridor helped IPIG ensure coordination between all donors and stay
on top of all issues. Fortunately, several changes in the government did not trigger major
changes in the IPIG which allowed the same staff to continue and prevented any disruption



                                               10
to project implementation. Despite the fact that many of the IPIG staff enhanced their
experience and skills through involvement in the implementation of multiple donor-funded
projects, they stayed committed and did not move to the private sector.

2.2.9. Well-defined and implemented communication strategy for AF1. The development
and implementation of the comprehensive communications strategy proved to be the key
success factor. It enabled to prevent further tension between the ethnic communities when
AF1 started supporting the creation of temporary jobs in the repair of urban roads in Osh
for local population from two conflicting ethnic communities. The communication strategy
provided accurate information about the project to Osh residents and general public,
ensured contractors apply equitable hiring policy and maximize job creation, and counter
any misperception that the road works funded by AF1 would lead to any inefficient use of
government funds. Social mobilizers who implemented the communication strategy
conducted individual consultations instead of public meetings, explained to local
communities the criteria for the selection of laborers for road works, and assisted IPIG and
the Osh local government to timely address any social issues emerging on the ground.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. The parent project had well defined PDO indicators which encompassed most of the
project activities. However, three instead of seven PDO indicators (two of the five outcome
indicators were further segregated) would have been sufficient as they captured the PDO
sufficiently well. Progress in achievement of the road safety sub-objective was monitored
through the intermediate indicator of the development and launch of the Road Safety Strategy.
While the Bank team did consider using the fatality or accident rate which is a more outcome
oriented but had to abandon this idea, because there was no reliable road accidents statistics
and the Project incorporated an activity to improve a crash database. As discussed in Section
1.2, results framework underwent several changes during both AF1 and AF2. Indicators were
either modified, dropped or added in order to more accurately reflect changes in the scope of
the project under AF1 or AF2. The major changes to the PDO indicators involved cancelling
PDO indicators related to reduction in travel time and travel costs by large bus. No changes
were done to the Results Framework during the last Level-2 restructurings.

2.3.2. IPIG was responsible for the collection of project’s performance indicator data and
analysis of the results. Progress towards the achievement of the final targets was monitored
through regular project progress reports by MOTC and Bank’s Implementation Status and
Results Reports (ISRs). The indicator of road users costs on the project road section
(US$ per vehicle per km) was found useful by MOTC and was adopted for the recently-
approved CARS Project. The PDO-level indicator of “development and launch of the
National Road Safety Program” is not assessed by the ICR team as the most appropriate
one to demonstrate improved road safety planning, as the existence of such a program does
not necessarily mean that the Program is being implemented and new practices in road
safety planning have been mainstreamed and applied by MOTC in all of its projects.
Mainstreamed application of road safety audits to all designs (which would have entirely
depended on MOTC) or development and implementation of road safety activities based
on the analysis of the statistics of the new crash database would be more reform-oriented
and more appropriate to demonstrate changes in the road safety planning process.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1. Environmental Safeguards. The project was an Environmental Category B Project.
The rehabilitation works under the project took place within the existing alignment and
negative environmental impacts were local, limited in time and manageable. The
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
was prepared by the Client and included a set of mitigation measures to prevent and
minimize potential negative impacts. The EIA/EMP was disclosed on August 4, 2009 in
the country and on August 5, 2009 in the Bank’s InfoShop and public consultations were
held on August 13 and 14, 2009 in Bishkek. There were no changes to the environmental
category under AF1 and AF2; the same EIA/EMP remained applicable as it covered the
entire OBI road corridor. Site-specific EMPs were prepared and included in the bidding
documents and works contracts under National Competitive Bidding (NCB).

2.4.2. There were no major environmental issues associated with the implementation of the
project. There were some issues related to landscaping of the borrow pits, handling of
construction waste and sanitation. These issues were addressed by the contractors during
the civil works execution. Adequate mitigation measures were also timely developed and
implemented to prevent potential erosion and landslide at the Nookat pass (this has not
been originally envisaged by the initial design).

2.4.3. IPIG was responsible for supervision of the environmental safeguards. There were
two designated environmental specialists with IPIG, whose capacity was built through their
participation in joint IPIG/WB missions, safeguards trainings and workshops organized by
the World Bank and other donors the region. The quality of environmental documentation
was found satisfactory by the Bank team.

2.4.4. Social Safeguards. Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) was triggered under the
original project. As the project intended to support the rehabilitation of a road section of the
corridor which mostly runs through uninhabited land and follows the existing alignment or
gravel tracks, no major land acquisition or resettlement were envisaged. Possible impacts
were identified to include the acquisition of agricultural land, gardens, trees, and walls, and
in exceptional cases residential and commercial structures. Since the design was not finalized
by the time of the appraisal and scale of this impact was not known, a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) was prepared in accordance with OP4.12 requirements and disclosed in
the country on August 4, 2009 and at the Bank Infoshop on August 5, 2009. There were no
changes to this safeguards policy during the preparation of AF1 and AF2.

2.4.5. IPIG was responsible for the management of social safeguards implementation.
There were also two social specialists with IPIG whose capacity was also built through
their participation in safeguards trainings and workshops in the region organized by the
World Bank and other donors.

2.4.6. A grievance handling mechanism was established under the project to register and
address the communities’ concerns and grievances. Regular consultations and hearing with



                                              12
the involvement of local communities, NGOs and local governments as well as the
grievance handling mechanism allowed to effectively and timely handle any social
safeguards or development issues arising along the project road sections. The development
and implementation of a very comprehensive Communication Strategy for the creation of
temporary jobs through employment of local communities in the repair or urban roads in
Osh allowed MOTC and local governments to prevent any further civil unrest.

2.4.7. Under AF2 the abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan was prepared, translated into
the Kyrgyz language and shared with the seven road-side businesses which were expected
to be affected by the project on the Nookat pass. There was no land acquisition under either
the parent project or AFs, and there were no project affected people (PAPs) under the parent
project and AF1. The total compensation of about KGS 350,000 (US$7,000) was paid to
seven project affected businesses under AF2.

2.4.8. Procurement. Based on the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR)
Update of November 2007, the major procurement risk concerned the lack of international
experienced procurement staff, lack of Bid Evaluation Committee Members’ knowledge
and apparent interference of politicians in the procurement procedures that might obstruct
or delay the procurement process. Although IPIG within MOTC had substantial experience
in implementing donor-financed projects, it hired an individual procurement consultant
with international experience to assist the Evaluation Committee Members to work closely
with the international consulting company preparing the updated feasibility study for the
project. Later on, another full-time procurement consultant was hired to support the
implementation of AF1 and AF2.

2.4.9. Procurement was carried out in accordance with the World Bank’s “Guidelines:
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” published in May 2004, revised in
October 2006, May 2010 and January 2011,”Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” published in May 2004, revised in October 2006,
May 2010 and January 2011, and also in accordance with provisions stipulated in the
Financing Agreements of the original project, AF1 and AF2. In addition, the World Bank’s
“Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants” dated October 2006 and updated in January
2011 also applied.

2.4.10. Procurement of works was carried out through International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) for most of civil works contracts and through NCB for civil works contracts financed
under AF1 due to emergency nature of the project. Procurement of consultant services was
done through Quality and Cost-based Selection (QCBS) for supervision services, through
a single source for supervision of works under NCB (due to the same emergency reason),
through Consultants Qualifications Selection (CQS), Individual Consultant Selection (IC)
for consultant services, and Least Cost Selection (LCS) to hire an audit firm, in view of a
small value contract. As of the closing date of the project, there were no unresolved
procurement issues.




                                            13
2.4.11. Financial Management. There were no major issues in financial management
(FM). FM function, including flow of funds, budgeting, internal control, accounting,
reporting and auditing, was handled by IPIG within MOTC, which was adequately staffed.
Good internal control procedures were in place and MOTC was in compliance with the
audit covenant, with Interim Unaudited Financial Reports acceptable to the Bank. During
AF1, it was decided to have project audit carried out by an independent auditor using terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank and procured by MOTC. Annual audit reports were
received on time, and the auditor’s opinion was unqualified.

2.4.12. The final (after AF1 and AF2) total amount of the IDA Credit (IDA-46580, IDA-
48260, and IDA-49750) and Grant (IDA-H5200, IDA-H6190, and IDA-H7110) were
US$47.84 million (SDR 31.44 million). As of May 12, 2015, the disbursed amount was
93.6% of total costs. IDA-Q6240 was re-financed from IDA H5200 with the value date of
March 5, 2010. US$1.07 million (SDR 732,772.86) was cancelled from IDA-46580 on
November 27, 2014. By the end of June, IDA will cancel SDR 3,651.44 from Credit Account
46580, SDR 497,207.97 from Credit Account 48260, SDR 18,432.70 from Grant Account
H520, and SDR 11,384.75 from Grant Account H711, since the funds were not committed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1. After the project closing date, the Bank team continued monitoring the
implementation of the minor civil works as part of the defect liability period. Moreover,
the Bank team is also discussing with the MOTC an opportunity of approaching the Global
Road Safety Facility to seek a grant support to improve inter-agency coordination for road
safety work, strengthen the technical and financial capacity of the Road Safety Commission
which lacks sustainable government funding, and continue building the ownership of the
MIA and SAI of the development of a new road accidents database.

2.5.2. The recently approved First Phase of the Central Asia Road Links Program (CARs-
I), which builds upon the NRRP and its two AFs, supports improvement of road operations
and maintenance practices, including the establishment of Service Level Agreement
between MOTC and the OBI Roads Department (OBI UAD). Under the Service Level
Agreement, OBI UAD will be responsible for routine maintenance and emergency works
for the entire OBI corridor, with special focus on those sections which have recently been
rehabilitated. The Project will ensure that OBI UAD receives secured and adequate funds
for routine maintenance as well as emergency works from the republican budget (estimated
at about US$100,000 annually) to maintain the road sections at a defined level of service,
and in accordance with the performance indicators (targets). The project will support OBI
UAD, and its Local Maintenance Units (DEPs) with new equipment and provide exposure
to international practices on maintenance techniques.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3. The following approach was used to assess the overall outcomes. The first Level-1
Restructuring/AF1 was approved only seven months after the effectiveness of the project
(with 1.7% funds disbursed); the original two sub-objectives remained the same till the



                                            14
project closing date, while a third sub-objective was added during AF1. Only 9 months
after the approval of the first Level-1 Restructuring, a second Level-1 Restructuring/AF2
took place after 11 percent of funds was disbursed, incorporating a new element in the
second sub-objective - road asset management. The split evaluation is presented in the
table in Section D of Annex 2.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. At the project closing date, the entire PDOs comprising the three sub-objectives
remained highly relevant to the country’s current development priorities expressed in (i)
Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2013-2017, (ii) Road
Transport Development Strategy (RTDS) of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2011-2015, and (iii)
NRSP for 2015-2020. The PDOs were also consistent with the current Bank country goals
expressed in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY14-17, and regional and global
priorities outlined in (i) Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy (TTFS) for 2008-2017
endorsed by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), and (ii) the UN
Decade of Action for Road Safety for 2011-2020. The PDOs’ contributed to SDS’, RTDS’
and TTFS’ priorities of (i) development and improvement of the transport infrastructure
through the rehabilitation of the OBI Corridor which is one of the country’s six strategic
corridors, (ii) strengthening of road sector management and establishment of modern
information systems through the development of RAMS, and (iii) creation of temporary
jobs through rehabilitation of road infrastructure in and around Osh and Jalal-Abad cities.
The PDOs also contributed to the current CPS’s goal of expanding national and regional
transport connectivity through the rehabilitation of OBI corridor, and to NRSS’ and UN’s
global priorities of improved road safety planning, improved road safety and prevention of
road traffic deaths. Thanks to the Bank’s responsive implementation assistance in 2010 and
2011, the PDOs remained relevant as a result of the incorporation of the third sub-objective
targeting the repair and rehabilitation of city roads in the affected areas whereby creating
temporary jobs and of the second element – road asset management – into the second sub-
objective, respectively.

3.1.2. The relevance of the design is rated as High because the project design was found
consistent with the PDOs. All project activities directly contributed to the achievement of
the three sub-objectives. Component 1 supporting the rehabilitation of the 50-km section
of the OBI Road Corridor contributed to the reduction of transport costs and travel time
along this Corridor, Component 2 supporting Road Safety and Road Asset Management
contributed to improved road safety planning and road asset management, while
Component 3 supporting the repair and rehabilitation of urban roads in and around Osh
and Jalal-Abad cities contributed to the repair and rehabilitation of road infrastructure in
and around these cities thereby creating temporary jobs. Scaling up of some project
activities during AF1 and AF2 allowed the design to remain relevant to the PDOs as of the
date of the project closing.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1. The achievement of the PDOs is rated as Substantial. The Substantial overall rating
of the PDOs is justified by the High ratings of the first and third sub-objectives, Substantial


                                              15
ratings of the first element of the second sub-objective and Modest rating of the second
element of the second sub-objective. Both the Bank team and MOTC assigned higher
importance to the first and third sub-objectives than to the second sub-objective, because
it requires more time than one project to fully implement all necessary steps of those
institutional reforms and achieve the expected outcomes.

3.2.2. The achievement of the first sub-objective – to contribute to the reduction of transport
costs and travel time along the Osh-Batken-Isfana Road Corridor – is rated as High.
Transport costs for road users by car decreased from US$0.30 to US$0.25 (against the target
of US$0.27) on Pulgon-Burgandy section and from US$0.29 to US$0.27 on Nookat Pass of
OBI road corridor. Travel time declined from 50 min to 25 min on Pulgon-Burgandy section,
which exceeded by 44 percent the final target of 45 min, and from 18 min to 15 min on
Nookat Pass, with the final target being fully delivered. Reduction of transport costs and
travel time was achieved through the rehabilitation of total 50 km of OBI Road Corridor,
including 32 km of Pulgon-Burgandy section and 18 km of Nookat Pass.

3.2.3. The achievement of the first element of the second sub-objective - to improve road
safety planning – is rated as Substantial. Improvement in road safety planning was
achieved through the preparation and approval of NRSP, which was launched at the
Workshop chaired by the Vice Prime Minister of the country.

3.2.4. The achievement of the second element of the second sub-objective – to improve road
asset management – is rated as Modest. Improvement in road asset management was
measured using an intermediate indicator, whose final target was underachieved by 8 percent.
Improvement in road asset management was demonstrated through the collection and
transfer of road condition data of 1,377 km of roads (against the target of 1,500 km) into the
GIS-based Road Asset Management System (RAMS), whose development was supported
under AF2. Because the availability of the database and collection of the road condition data
do not indicate that these data are being used to inform planning and decision-making process
which are normally the expected outcomes of improvement in road asset management it is
the main reason for rating this element of this sub-objective as Modest.

3.2.5. The achievement of the third sub-objective – to repair and rehabilitate road
infrastructure in and around Osh and Jalal-Abad cities thereby creating temporary jobs–
is rated as High. This sub-objective was measured using one outcome-oriented indicator
(job creation) whose target was overachieved by 2 percent and two intermediate indicators
whose final targets were fully achieved. 5,100 man-months jobs, against the target of 5,000,
was created during the repair and rehabilitation of 350 km of urban roads within the city
of Osh and 15.5 km of roads in and around the greater Osh and Jalal-Abad city vicinities.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1. Efficiency in achieving the current/second-time revised PDO in terms of EIRR is
rated as High. The ex-post economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall project
is 65.1 percent and is higher than the ex-ante EIRR of 57.1 percent. The ex-post economic
evaluation was conducted using the same Highway Development and Management Tool
(HDM-4), the same methodology and assumptions regarding the road conditions and


                                              16
vehicle fleet characteristic used at appraisal. HDM-4 simulates life-cycle predictions of
road deterioration, road works effects and their costs and provides economic decision
criteria for road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance. This tool analyses projects
by computing costs and benefits of different investment options in terms of savings in road
maintenance costs, vehicle operations costs (VOC) and travel time costs. The comparison
is done between the “do something” scenario (project case) and the “do minimum” scenario
(without project case) over the evaluation period.

3.3.2. The ex-post economic evaluation adopted the actual rehabilitation costs per km and
the actual annual traffic growth rates on the project roads. For the Pulgon-Burgandy road,
the EIRR increased from 74.5 to 91.1 percent due to the lower rehabilitation costs and
higher traffic growth rates compared with the appraisal estimates. For the Nookat pass, the
EIRR decreased from 28.0 to 21.7 percent due to the higher rehabilitation costs and lower
traffic growth rates compared with the appraisal estimates. However, the overall results of
the ex-post economic evaluation of both roads showed that the Project had a robust
economic justification. The full economic analysis is given in Annex 3.

                       Table 2. EIRRs at Appraisal and Completion
                                                       Ex-Ante      Ex-Post
                                                        EIRR         EIRR
               Roads                                     (%)          (%)
               1. Pulgon-Burgandy Road                  74.5%       91.1%
               2. Nookat pass                           28.0%       21.7%
               Overall Project                          57.1%       65.1%

3.3.3. No ex-post evaluation of the urban roads in and around the greater Osh and Jalal-
Abad cities financed under AF1 was carried out as no ex-ante evaluation was done because
essential data could not be obtained within the project preparation time frame. However,
the repair of urban roads generally yields substantial economic benefits arising from
reduced travel time, lower vehicle operating costs, and easier access to work, education,
and social opportunities in a densely populated area. Thus, it is believed that rehabilitation
of these urban roads would also have a solid EIRR.

3.3.4. High efficient use of resources under this project is also demonstrated through the
use of the same Project Preparation Advance of IDA Credit to finance the update of the
feasibility study, including Environmental and Social Impact Assessments for the entire
OBI corridor, and detailed designs and bidding documents for Phase I which were used by
all donors for the preparation of their respective parallel projects. The same supervision
consultant was used to supervise the Bank- and the EBRD-funded projects. Moreover, all
projects on the OBI corridor were managed by the same unit within MOTC – IPIG.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1. The achievement of the overall outcome is rated Satisfactory. The summary of the
ratings of each aspect is presented in Annex 2, Section D, with more detailed discussion



                                              17
provided in the sections above. Should efficacy have been rated High among the two High-
rated aspects, the overall outcome would have been rated Highly Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1. AF1 supported the creation of temporary jobs (equal to 5,100 man-months) through
employing unskilled labor for repair and maintenance works among Uzbek and Tajik
communities in Osh in order to help the economic situation of those affected by the civil
unrest in 2010.

3.5.2. The socio-economic assessment of the project was carried out in 2013 to identify the
project’s impacts on the direct beneficiaries along two OBI corridor sections, namely
Pulgon-Burgandy and Nookat pass. Due to the absence of the baseline data, it is difficult
to attribute all findings to the Project and its AF1 and AF2. Nevertheless, the subject
assessment claims that the Project facilitated the achievement of such outcomes for the
local population as (i) local market and business development, (ii) agricultural productivity,
(iii) household welfare and employment, and (iv) access to services. Famers reported about
40-55 percent reduction in transport costs, leading to increased movement of people and
goods. About 80-90 percent of produce is now sold in local markets which prevents
produce wastage and allows timely selling of perishable produce. Revitalized local markets
became a critical source of employment opportunities directly in trade and in ancillary
services related to the operation of local markets such as provision of freight or passenger
transportation services, security or catering services. The beneficiaries also enjoy improved
access to rayon or oblast hospitals, although due to the lack of public transportation services
children continue to experience a challenge in accessing schools. More detailed discussion
is provided in Annex 5.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3. MOTC’s Road Management Division (RMD) is taking over the newly-developed
GIS-based RAMS, which is simple yet powerful database and recommended to MOTC as
an affordable systematic data collection. The system generates a number of standard reports
(tables and graphs), including overview of network condition, network use and traffic as
well as programming indexes. One of the reports (annual report) will be used for the
information of general public, and internal monitoring. The Consultant provided
recommendations to MOTC with regard to the road asset inventory and road classification
based on the review of legal framework for road network classification in the country. This
led to the revision of the respective governmental decrees by MOTC. Up to date the RAMS
database holds inventory for 18,000 km of roads and road condition data for 1,377 km of
roads. RAMS developed under the project looks more promising if compared to the
standard “off-the-shelf” products due to its simple and user-friendly format, Russian
language interface and affordability in terms of its maintenance. It is anticipated that the
use of the RAMS will provide more transparency to the decision making in the road sector
by ensuring that some of the reports will be posted on the web for public access in the
future. Hopefully, other donors’ projects will be built on this activity and will finance the
inventory and road condition data collection of the remaining network.


                                              18
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4. Local governments allocated lands along the rehabilitated roads to support the
growth of small businesses and construction of new houses. The project and its additional
financings responded to the requests of local governments and communities and supported
the provision of many additional structures (e.g., accesses, drainages, culverts, light poles,
etc.) in places where they were not envisaged in the original detailed designs. These
contributed to improved road safety.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.1. The risk that the achieved development outcomes would not be sustained is rated as
Substantial. The effectiveness of investment and maintenance planning significantly
depends on the budget allocation for RAMS maintenance. Similarly, the effective
implementation of NRSP largely depends on the capacity of the Road Safety Commission
which requires technical strengthening and budget allocation and which is often of a lower
priority to the Government than road infrastructure investments. While the newly-approved
CARs-I Project supports MOTC in ensuring sustainable arrangements for routine
maintenance of the entire OBI corridor, the maintenance of repaired and rehabilitated urban
roads and streets in Osh with involvement of local communities is also not sustainable due
to the constrained budget of the local municipality. The central government’s budget
situation does not look very promising in the short-term as a result of spillover effects from
the slowdown in Russia.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1. The Bank’s satisfactory performance is justified by its close collaboration with and
support to the Recipient and MOTC during project preparation, simplicity of the project
design and realistic PDO definition. Despite the change of the Bank TTL three times during
the two years of project preparation, uninterrupted and efficient preparation process was
still ensured by the Bank. After the OBI corridor was assigned a high priority by the GOKR,
the World Bank, as per the government’s request, took the lead in leveraging funds from
other development partners to secure financing for the entire Phase I of the OBI corridor.
It also assisted the government to secure a Project Preparation Advance (PPA) to update
the feasibility study for the entire corridor after its preparation under TRACECA in the late
90s. The updated feasibility study included Environmental and Social Impact Assessments
for the entire OBI corridor and detailed designs and bidding documents for Phase I, and
they were eventually used by all donors in preparation of their respective parallel projects.


                                             19
The Bank also led the distribution of the sections between all donors (EC, EBRD and JICA),
defining the timeline of key milestones and attempt to harmonize the donors’ rules in order
to save costs and streamline project implementation. Very detailed AMs demonstrate
Bank’s close collaboration with the Recipient and implementing agency (IA) in the
preparation and design of the project.

5.1.2. The Bank is also commended for the straightforward definition of the PDOs, the
simplicity of the project design, and the substantial support to the global priority of
improved road safety through including it in the PDO definition as well as designing a
stand-alone component. The number of the PDO level indicators was a bit too long but this
deficiency is minor as it did not affect the overall project implementation and progress
towards the delivery of project outcomes. The Bank is not criticized for not having
incorporated outcome-oriented indicators to measure progress towards improved road
safety planning and road asset management, because the Bank did explore this opportunity
but decided to use those indicators which had reliable baseline data and looked more
achievable. The Bank also took into consideration the fact that institutional reforms related
to improvements in road safety planning and road asset management require more time
than one project lifetime and normally are implemented in incremental steps. Therefore,
the key steps of the implementation of these reforms were used as monitoring indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3. The moderately satisfactory rating is justified by very pro-active involvement and
support of the Bank for most part of the project life and less active support in the last year
which was critical. From the launch of project implementation, the Bank stayed focused to
ensure efficient coordination of efforts of several donors present in the country as well build
its work on the activities of those donors. This concerned the support of the priority OBI road
corridor as well as several institutional activities, including road safety and RAMS. The Bank
is also commended for its pro-activeness and flexibility to accommodate new activities through
AF1. It helped GOKR address the changed circumstances as a result of the civil unrest within
less than a year since approval of the parent project. The Bank was swift in preparing the project
under the Emergency Operations, OP/BP 13.20 and effective suggesting a timely, yet, simple
design of a new component to provide short-term employment for two conflicting ethnic
communities. The Bank was also good in ensuring AF1 was conflict-sensitive and incorporated
instruments to minimize the risk to negatively impact certain groups of population and
inadvertently fuel tensions in the country. Supervision missions were carried out two-three
times a year. The AMs were found very informative providing detailed discussion of emerging
issues and solutions to address those issues.

5.1.4. Although the Bank made an extra effort to expedite and finalize the outstanding
activities in the last year, its involvement was less intensive in the last year than in the
previous years. Level-II Restructuring was carried out in July 2014 to support the Recipient
and IA’s request for the reallocation of funds to finance the requested upgrade of scope of
works on the Osh bypass. Besides site visits, frequent video- and audio-conferences were
arranged to advise and guide IPIG in the remaining activities. In addition, the Bank transport


                                                   20
management and Country Management teams also got involved to help IPIG address few
remaining issues related to road safety activities, including the final official approval of
NRSP by the Minister of Transport. High commitment of the Bank team to the project is also
demonstrated through its several visits to the project sites after the project closure and support
to the Recipient in the development and implementation of a new lending operation which
builds on this project and its achievements.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.5. The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory because of a
satisfactory rating of the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and a moderately
satisfactory rating for ensuring the quality of supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1. The satisfactory rating is assigned to the Recipient’s performance in recognition of its
demonstrated commitment during the project life. Despite frequent government changes,
GOKR always showed commitment and support to this project in numerous ways throughout
preparation and implementation. Without waiting for donors’ financing, the government
invested around US$2.5 million (KGS 95 million) in carrying out some improvement works
on about 67 km of the OBI corridor. It committed a substantial co-financing share of over 25
percent of the entire project costs. However, lack of MIA and SAI’s efficient collaboration
and support affected the implementation of the two major road safety activities, which
prevents from assigning highly satisfactory performance to the Recipient.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2. The Satisfactory rating is assigned to the performance of MOTC, including IPIG, in
recognition of its continuous commitment to the project and its pro-activeness throughout
the project life and after the project closure. During the five-year project implementation,
MOTC high-level management changed quite several times, yet this did not cause major
disruptions. MOTC was efficient in filling in the required positions in IPIG and provided
necessary capacity building opportunities for IPIG staff. There was no major turnover of
the staff despite their enhanced professional capacity through trainings and exposure to
international experience. All major civil works contracts and most of institutional activities
were completed by the project closing date. The IPIG is especially commended for taking
a pro-active approach in addressing a number of issues that were unforeseen at the design
stage but emerged during the execution of major civil works.

5.2.3. MOTC took the lead in securing support of the First Deputy Prime Minister for the
NRSP and later on successfully soliciting support of all road safety stakeholder agencies, but
MIA and SAI. MOTC reached consensus on several items in the Program but still could not



                                               21
find compromise with MIA and SAI on a number of suggested actions in order to upgrade
the status of this MOTC’s Program to the GOKR’s Strategy. That was beyond its control.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.4. The overall satisfactory rating is assigned due to the satisfactory performance of the
Recipient and satisfactory performance of IA as discussed above.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1. A corridor approach should be applied in the preparation and implementation of the
same type of road projects. This approach is especially valuable when resources are limited.
The corridor design led by the Bank for the rehabilitation of OBI corridor was instrumental
in helping the government leverage financing from several donors. Moreover, all financing
from those donors was secured on favorable terms, which allowed newly prepared projects
to remain acceptable under the Country’s debt management program.

6.2. It is important that the design of a follow-up project is influenced by the predecessor
project. CARs was not only built on the lessons learnt from and experience of the NRRP
and its two AFs but its design was significantly informed by their achievements. CARs
finances the improvement of road links which connect the recently rehabilitated OBI
corridor with another important corridor in the neighboring Tajikistan. The Bank also
continues working on the improvement of routine maintenance practices and technologies
through this new project. It supports OBI Road Department in providing sustainable routine
maintenance of the recently rehabilitated OBI corridor.

6.3. Development of new IT systems should be well coordinated between all donors
present and active in the country’s sector and involve a comprehensive analysis of the
situation on the ground. Successful implementation of RAMS is a good proof to this.
RAMS promoted by the Bank was based on RONET and was designed to carry out analysis
based on the data related to the pavement. However, the client found more comprehensive
and appealing JICA-supported road asset management system, as it involves data for
pavement, earth support, and other data. ADB’s road management system is also different
from both of these. The MOTC and IPIG eventually succeeded in the implementation of a
simplified RAMS under this project because it was built on the previous efforts of JICA
and ADB in the past.

6.4. Sustainability of RAMS which has just been developed is at risk if donors’ follow-
up projects do not continue building on this activity. While IPIG clearly understands the
benefit of RAMS in the planning process and appreciates its simplified version, RMD may
often use the excuse of lack of funding to maintain RAMS. Moreover, MOTC top
management needs to get further support from donors to the benefits of applying RAMS
in the planning and decision-making process.




                                             22
6.5. The process of building MIA and SAI’s buy-in and ownership of road safety
activities aligned with best international practices requires substantial time, beyond the
length of project implementation. MIA was considered the lead road safety agency during
the Soviet Union times. This leadership culture is deeply entrenched in many MIAs in most
of former Soviet Union countries. However, MIAs unlike road agencies or Ministries of
Transport remain most resistant to any drastic reforms and review of their archaic practices
which often date back to the Soviet Union time. Thus, it is essential for the Bank and its
counterpart (e.g., MOTC or road agency) to continue a dialogue with MIA and SAI on the
importance of a new/improved crash database and a new approach (through inter-agency
collaboration) to improve road safety in the country.

6.6. Short-term employment using cash-for-work and labor-intensive public works
proves to be a good conflict mitigating and local economy restoration tool, if it is
accompanied by a well-defined communication strategy. Short-term employment through
involvement of local communities in labor-intensive works can help reduce tensions and
causes for conflicts as they support the development of the region, which conflicting
communities share, and help provide the same communities with access to services and
markets. This scheme should always be implemented with the support of social mobilizers
who facilitate individual communication instead of carrying out public consultations.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1. On February 6, 2015, the Recipient/IA submitted to the Bank “Final Project

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The economic evaluation of the project was conducted using the Highway Development
and Management Tool (HDM-4), which simulates life-cycle predictions of road
deterioration, road works effects and their costs and provides economic decision criteria
for road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance. The HDM-4 analyses projects by
computing cost and benefits of different investment options in terms of savings in road
maintenance costs, vehicle operations costs (VOC) and travel time costs. The comparison
is done between the “do something” scenario (project case) and the “do minimum” scenario
(without project case) over the evaluation period.

The ex-ante economic evaluation of the original project evaluated the economic return on
the investment for the rehabilitation of the Project financed road section between Pulgon
to Burgundy that totals 32 km. The ex-ante evaluation yielded a very robust Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 74.5 percent and Net Present Value (NPV) of US$123.8
million, at a discount rate of 12 percent. The high EIRR estimated at appraisal was due to
the fact that the Project was mainly upgrading the road from unpaved to a paved surface
(90 percent of the Project road), which causes a marked decrease of road user costs, and
the high traffic of the road.

The Project AF1 financed the rehabilitation of urban roads in and around the greater Osh
and Jalal-Abad cities. Because essential data could not be obtained within the Project
preparation time frame, an ex-ante economic evaluation of the road works financed under
the Project AF1 was not presented in the Project Paper. Curfew was lifted the day before
field appraisal and the traffic level was very depressed. However, repair of urban roads
generally yields substantial economic benefits arising from reduced travel time, lower
vehicle operating costs, and easier access to work, education, and social opportunities in a
densely populated area. The EIRR was found to be close to 200% in the previous Urban
Transport Project where similar activities, i.e. repair and routine maintenance of urban
roads, were financed in Osh.

The Project AF2 financed the rehabilitation of the 18-km long Nookat pass, which is 10
km south of Osh along the OBI road financed under the original project and was in critical
condition. The civil works consisted of leveling the road to restore a proper evenness and
the pavement was replaced. The rehabilitated road had a Class III geometric standard The
ex-ante economic evaluation done during the AF2 preparation indicated that the EIRR of
the AF2 civil works was 28.0 percent with a NPV of US$12.1 million, at 12 percent
discount rate.

The ex-post economic evaluation of the project was done for the two road sections for
which ex-ante results are available (Pulgon Burgandy road and Nookat pass) taking into
account actual construction costs and traffic data. The Pulgon-Burgandy road was
rehabilitated under one contract, while the rehabilitation of the Nookat pass was part of a
contract that included the rehabilitation of the Osh bypass and the Osh airport road financed
under the AF1. Table 1 presents the original contract costs and the actual costs per contract

including variation orders and price adjustments. The actual costs are 1.24 to 1.30 times
the original contract costs.

A comparison of the rehabilitation cost per km estimated at appraisal and the actual
rehabilitation costs shows that for the Pulgon-Burgandy road the actual costs are 83 percent
of the estimated costs, while for the Nookat pass the actual costs are nine percent higher
than the estimated costs (see Table 2).

Table 3 presents the traffic of the project roads at appraisal and the corresponding latest
traffic data. On the Pulgon-Burgandy road, the actual annual traffic growth rate from 2008
to 2012 was 5.8 percent per year, while on the Nookat pass, the actual annual traffic growth
rate from 2008 to 2014 was 4.3 percent per year. The annual traffic growth rates adopted
at appraisal were 3.7 and 6.8 percent per year respectively. On the Pulgon-Burgandy road,
the actual annual traffic growth rate was 56 percent higher than the one estimated at
appraisal, while on the Nookat pass the actual annual traffic growth rate was 64 percent of
the one estimated at appraisal.

The ex-post economic evaluation of the project roads followed the same methodology and
assumptions made at appraisal regarding the project roads condition and vehicle fleet
characteristics. The ex-post economic evaluation adopted the actual rehabilitation costs per

km and the actual annual traffic growth rates on the project roads. Table 4 presents the ex-
ante and ex-post economic evaluation results in terms of EIRR. For the Pulgon-Burgandy
road, the EIRR increased from 74.5 to 91.1 percent due to the lower rehabilitation costs
and higher traffic growth rates compared with the appraisal estimates. For the Nookat pass,
the EIRR decreased from 28.0 to 21.7 percent due to the higher rehabilitation costs and
lower traffic growth rates compared with the appraisal estimates. Considering both roads,
the overall project EIRR increased from 57.1 percent based on the appraisal estimates to
65.1 percent considering actual rehabilitation costs and traffic data, indicating that the
project had a robust economic justification.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of the parent Project and its AF1 and AF2 was
carried out in 20032. This annex presents preliminary evidence on the attainment of the
project’s socio-economic outcomes which were identified during that Assessment. While
the key objective of this Project was to reduce transport cost and travel time along one of
the six strategic land transportation routes of the country, the project contained a
distinctively developmental and poverty reducing goal, not only because of its direct effects
on local and regional accessibility but more importantly, thanks to its welfare enhancing
potential. Such outcomes are normally obtained primarily through two transmission
channels: (i) expansion of economic opportunities via small and medium size enterprise
(SME) development along rehabilitated road corridors and (ii) affecting the livelihood and
access to services of residents residing in the project’s immediate catchment area
settlements.

Project’s area of influence

This Project financed rehabilitation works on two road sections of the OBI road corridor,
namely 32 km of Pulgon-Burgandy section and 18 km of Nookat Pass. These two sections
serve over 1 million direct beneficiaries. Limited access to markets in some villages
throughout the rayons constitutes one of the major constraints faced by the rural labor force.
A 2013 study3 which was designed to examine the spatial relationship of access to market
in the Kyrgyz Republic showed that some villages close to the Project corridor had very
low market access indexes, as measured the potential connectivity between village/towns
and big cities via the transport network4. As such, the project offered immense potential to
improve (i) access of the residents of villages and towns to the regional road network and
beyond to the country’s main highway corridors and (ii) mobility of road users along these
important roads.

Expected Project Impacts and Transmission Channels

The importance of infrastructure, and particularly transport infrastructure, in economic
development is widely recognized in the development economics literature. Where road
networks are poorly developed, transportation costs are high, inhibiting investment,
innovation, the competitiveness of the private sector in export markets. High transportation
costs can also affect households, reducing real income, and limiting access to health,


2 The socio-economic assessment was carried out with the objective of providing a useful snap-shot of indicative effects

of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road rehabilitation project on household level wellbeing and business development. The
assessment of socio-economic effects had some evaluation design limitations such as absence of baseline data and data
from equivalent comparison villages. Thus, recorded changes in socio-economic well-being of people residing along this
road segment cannot be directly attributed to the Project and its AF1 and AF2. Also, the study was implemented shortly
after road completion (in fact, some road segments were not fully operational at the time of data collection). Thus, it may
be suspected that some road related benefits may not have materialized yet.

education, and employment. Poor road infrastructure also limits the flow of information
and access to markets, leading to imperfect competition and misallocation of productive
resources5.

Impacts like improved mobility of goods and people and increased household consumption
of local goods and services may be considered short to medium term indirect effects while
impacts like reduction in costs of inputs and services, increased production of agricultural
goods, increased investment in small business development and employment
diversification may take longer to achieve. While such indirect impacts are expected to
lead to improved economic wellbeing in terms of household incomes and productivity, they
take longer time to materialize and it has proven hard to trace and disentangle such
impacts 6 . The project’s socio-economic Assessment and Baseline Report analyzed the
broader impacts through the following direct and indirect transmission channels:

          Direct effects: improved accessibility and mobility (reduced travel time and cost
           and other related cost savings);
          Indirect effects: Welfare and labor markets impacts (wages, income, and
           consumption);
          Indirect effects: improved economic opportunities (new business development,
           reduced cost of agricultural inputs and outputs); and
          Indirect effects: Improved use (consumption) of education and health services
           (although access to health and education facilities is usually considered under the
           rubric of direct effects).

The remainder of this annex focuses on some of the observed indirect impacts, particularly
on welfare outcomes at the household level and expansion of economic opportunities in
the project area. By looking at existing constraints in the project area and how the project
seeks to address them, it further hypothesizes about longer term impacts which could be
captured in a follow up impact assessment.

Welfare Impacts in the Project Area

The implementation of rehabilitation work along the subject two sections of the OBI road
corridor in the Kyrgyz Republic brought unprecedented changes for the better in socio-
economic wellbeing of people residing along the rehabilitated road sections. The project
reduced transport costs and travel time, facilitating the achievement of other welfare
outcomes for the local population, particularly in terms of (i) local market and business
development, (ii) agricultural productivity, (iii) household welfare and employment, and
(iv) access to services, which are discussed below.

Local market and business development

While the incidence of transport infrastructure on investment and market development
tends to be observable in the medium to longer term, evidence from the project’s socio-
economic assessments demonstrated that the geographic areas around the rehabilitated road
segments witnessed an unprecedented increase and diversification of local and trans-border
trade, shortly after works were completed. First, the project facilitated further growth and
relocation of markets specializing in consumer goods, diversifying, in the process, the array
of options available for consumers but also for the local population. Second, there seems
to be some evidence pointing to increased SME activity along the corridor, with road
rehabilitation appearing to be a strong factor in business start-up. While one cannot
establish a causal relationship from the analysis, the findings show that the number of
entities more than doubled from 2012 to 2013 along the rehabilitated road segment.
Perhaps more importantly, businesses in project areas tended to provide more full time jobs
per entity compared to businesses in non-rehabilitated areas controlling for business
activity type and year of establishment. In sum, the data shows that the project resulted in
significant local market development, potentially increasing levels of investment in the
area and thus regional economic growth.

Agricultural Productivity

The rehabilitated road helped local agricultural production, cutting travel time to markets
by almost half in several cases, according to the socio-economic impact. Such reductions
significantly increased the movements of people and goods in the area helping a greater
number of residents sell their fresh produce in markets, preventing wastage and
encouraging more frequent trips to sell perishable goods. Although there was no indication
that the project might have reduced the price of inputs on one hand and raise farm-gate
prices on the other, crop producers did report significant cost reductions thanks to (i) a
decrease in transportation costs to bring produce to markets (including road side trade
availability); (ii) availability of wholesale on-farm pick-up by trucks which was less
common before the road rehabilitation; and (iii) improved access to labor in peak
harvesting seasons. Indeed, farmers reported a steady 40 to 55 percent reduction in
transportation costs to local markets (e.g., from 5 to 2 kg per kg of delivered produce),
which significantly improved their overall profitability.

This last set of outcomes can be largely explained by the significant reduction in transport
costs resulting in lower prices for some specific goods that are transported along the road,
particularly oil-derivatives. For example, access and affordability of gasoline and diesel
improved drastically. Previously, the price of fuel in the area was about KGS 10-15 more
per liter than at other gas stations. Residents would also have to travel long distances (up
to 25-30 km) to find a station. Following the road rehabilitation, more gas station were
opened throughout the corridor; indeed, there are currently at least one or two gas stations
within a kilometer or two of most villages, and the price differential has dropped to about
KGS 1-3 per liter. Such reduction would tend to encourage sellers to sell in more distant
markets rather than locally, which should act to increase the price in markets closer to
where the good is produced.



                                             9
Given emerging trade opportunities and lower transport costs, some farmers also reported
being able to expand and diversify their consumer base. Focus group discussions with
small-scale farmers revealed that the locally established markets began to draw more
traders from other districts and more remote settlements. As much as 80-90 percent of
produce is still sold in local markets, which prevents wastage and encourages more
frequent trips to sell perishable goods. But lower transaction costs also enabled other key
crops like apricots and cherries to be sold across the borders to the Russian Federation and
Kazakhstan, something which was not possible prior to road rehabilitation.

Household welfare and employment

Reduced transportation costs helped spurring productive investment in project areas as
investors took advantage of lower transactions and logistics costs. All else equal, higher
levels of business activity should generate employment and, as a result, household income
and consumption. The socio-economic assessment, while not considering household-level
employment levels attributable exclusively to the project, provided evidence that short-
term and long-term employment opportunities in selected sectors increased following road
rehabilitation. Revitalized local markets became an essential source of employment
opportunities directly in trade and in ancillary services related to operations of local
markets such as work as transporters, drivers, security personnel, cooks. Similarly, small
businesses along the road corridor created direct employment opportunities for residents
from nearby villages. Finally, travel/transportation costs fell sufficiently for residents to
look for seasonal jobs beyond their region. Indeed, higher demand from large local
producers meant that more laborers residing outside the districts where labor shortages was
historically a problem could benefit from seasonal jobs such as harvesting of local produce,
particularly fruits. As discussed, the socio-economic assessment was not meant to measure
income and consumption and the evaluation window was not long enough to empirically
examine the observable benefits of the road improvement at the household level. However,
it is plausible to infer that higher earnings from emerging jobs and other generating
opportunities coupled with lower prices for consumer goods resulted in increased real
income at the household level due to the intervention.

Access to services

Another important set of social outcomes that arises from roads improvements are those
related to improved access to public services. Where transaction costs related to travelling
to schools or hospitals falls, utilization should increase with a corresponding improvement
in long run outcomes. One of the key impacts emphasized by residents consulted after
project completion was their ability to reach rayon or oblast hospitals without major
impediments. Village level clinics provide only very basic care and tend to refer the patient
to the hospitals. Prior to road rehabilitation, getting to a hospital was a major ordeal; for
instance, as many as 66 percent of surveyed households considered accessing a hospital in
the Ak-Tatyr – Ovchi segment as “very difficult”. Similarly, for some who lived close to
the Tajik border and far away from the rayon capitals it was easier to visit Tajik hospitals,
given the poor condition of the local and regional road network. While an accessibility
analysis is still pending, it is expected that better connected markets will result in better



                                             10
access to essential services such as hospitals but also increased medical visits on behalf of
trained doctors and nurses to the more remote villages. Similar accessibility gains should
be observable for schools, universities and training centers. All of the villages in the project
area have at least one primary school within their borders. Despite such proximity, a
relatively large percentage of respondents along some of the road segments report that it is
difficult for their children to get to school. The issue will be explored further, but all else
equal, the improved road conditions should enhance access to schooling facilities which is
relatively poor in some remote villages, with 56 percent of them reporting having
difficulties.

Conclusion
The subject Socio-Economic Assessment produced vital information to have a general
overlook of the major accessibility and connectivity constraints faced by the inhabitants of
the project area and the project’s potential contribution and linkages with local market and
business development, agriculture productivity, household welfare, and access to services.
Data collected shortly after project completion demonstrated that the project resulted in
lower transportation costs which might have increased business activities and local marker
development along the corridor, more trade and employment, and more competitive prices
for local farmers and consumers.

On February 6, 2015, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic submitted to the Bank its
Final Project Completion Report. On June 25, 2015, the Recipient submitted to the Bank
the updated version of the same Report that provided the update for the final number
(5,100) of person-months of employment created in Annex I, but still had a typo of 4,502
of person-months of employment in the main text of its Completion Report.

Below is the extract from the Recipient’s Report covering progress of the project
implementation, objectives and results achieved, safeguards policies implementation,
project management, performance of the Recipient and Implementing Agency,
performance of the World Bank, and recommendations. These chapters, included here
without editing, present the Borrower’s assessment of project implementation and are very
important for the Bank to draw lessons for current and future work with the Government
of the Kyrgyz Republic and other countries. Since the first chapter “General information
about projects” narrates the same information which is included in the sections 1.1-1.7 of
the main text of the ICR, it has been decided not to include it in this Annex. The Recipient’s

Minister d KR stated about government commitment to :he road traffic safety provision.

For the purpose of me further advance of lhe National Strategy project the Implementation
Agency developed a draft of the Kyrgyz Republic Government Decree -On the Approval of
~ational road tra'fic sa"ety strategy" which was sent to a!I ministries and au:horities for
reoonciliation. l n the result. lhe project was reconciled with all ministries and authorities except
the Ministry of Internal Affah of KR and its division represented by the Road Patrol Service
because of disagreement on number of provisions in the Su-ate-gy project. Later 'the dOC\.lment
was sent for additional s:udies by the Road Patrol Service of KR by the request of 'the V!Oe-
Premier-Minister of KR and concurrently the Chairman of the Commission on road trafic safety
provision under the Govemmt!nt of the Kyrgyz Republic.

However. because of prolonged approval process of the National Strategy project the
Implementation Agency made a decision to reconsider this documem and 10 provide its own
Road Safety Program based on recommendations proposed by the national Strategy Project. In
the resuh the Program of the Ministry of Transport and Communications ot KR on road safety
was approves in accordance v.i th the Decree of lhe departmen:al board.

For the purpose to achieve the sated objective review of an existing road crash data acquisi1Jon
system and variants for improvement and preparation of an advanced system introduction was
conducted. In the result lhe lAAP system which is widely used around the world was
recommended. The qnaJ repon on review of the existing system and the proj ect of the proposed
data-base was produced. Projea of tender documemation on pw-chasing oS data-base software
and hardware was prepared also.

Powever lhe preparation to lhe tender process W3S prolonged because o& reasons indepe-ndent
of the Implementation Agency. Thus. the ._ · istry of intemaJ Af"airs in~ rmed about lack of
necessity to implement a new road crash data-base. As a resuh the question about a necessity
o& a dau-base was leveled up to the Vtoe-Prernif:f-t.iinister o& KR.    men

Implementation Agency would cany out all appropriate tender procedures, and purchased
software and nardware would be given the Road Patrol Service was made. Tender commission
w.lS established and representatives of this authonty were included in it However questions
concerning the further management and maintenance o& this data-base were still open. In the
result lhis objective was canceled by the World Bank on the account of shorted terms for tender
process compledon and absence of a single poin: soh.rtion conceming necessity o& the

In the frames of Objective 3 realizatk>n thorough review of worlt procedures and equipment of
the Road Patrol Service of KR and the State Agency of the Road and Wa~er Transpon under
the Ministry of T ransport and Conununicaoons of KR was done. In the resuh the list of

furnishing. After gerung resul:s of road safety audit it is planned «> implement a number of
arrangements to increase road sa..~ty on this section.

The main problem that the lmpJ   ementa1ion AQency faced with during implementation of" this
component was week partner involvement oi the government si:ructures and its insuf'licient
disin:erestedness in promotion of the results of this component which was the \lational road
sa~ty strategy project The project documents came through long procedures o.z reoonci g .
Mainly the implementation of m e proj ect wa.s detained by disputes arose between two ministries
- the Ministry of Transpon and Communications of KR and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of KR
that in accordance with its Decree the Minisuy of Internal Affairs of l<R is responsib e for
deve1opment and implementation of the policy in m e field of road trafic safe:y.

Besides. a question of financial support of arrangements proposed in the S:rategy projea was
posed poin:-blanlt. tt was impossible to carry ou: the financial support of arrangements at the
sta:e budget cost because of the socio-economic problems e xisting in the coun:ry nowadays. It
was not possible to consider a:traction of financial resources of in:ema:ional financial institu-Jons
and on the basis oz public and private pannef"Ship as a secure funding provision.
Implementation of self financing tools proposed in the Strategy project con~a~·enes the Law of
KR ·Abom basic principles o,& budget law· . S«:!sides. in accordance iM1h the Law of KR *About
Laws and Regulations· a regul atory acts realization of v.tlich leads financing from the sta:e
budget shall not be approved until identifying the financial resource for it.

All stated above severely detained the imptementation of the proj ect.

However. i; should be mentioned :ha1 a number of arrangements proposed by :he Strategy
proj ect found support of the Ministry of lntemal Affairs of KR and we-re lmplemen:ed in the
frames of their own acUvity (essential increasing of fines. reorganization of the road patrol
service r educing staff etc.}.

2-2 Additional financing 1

Proj ea realized in m e frames of the fi~ Additional financing was unique for :he Implementation
AQency. In con:rast to common proj ects focused on road infrastructure improvemen: 1he
objective o" ':his project was support oz residents o" Osh chy economics~ whi ch suFered badly
in m e result of socia1 conflic~ in 2010. More<>ver. the main objective was «>create :emporary
jobs for local population. For this purpose the main part of   works proposed in the project was
hand work ma: aid not require speciaJ quaJifications and that could be carried ou~ by as many as
possible ordinary citiLens.

For achievement oc the sta:ed obj ective the Implementation Agency es:ablished strict
requirements for the contractor. for ex ample. to organize their work to create as many as
possible opponunities for hand wortt : for carrying out works to eni st the serv1ces of sta'f only
from Osh city residents, to pro'oi de equaJ a~ss to job placemen: for represematives of all
social and e1hnic groups etc.

The Implementation Agency atached great impor.ance to effective intercommunication with
local population. First, public hearings wrJl represem.ati\-es of the local community (territorial
community councils. neighborhood committees. non-government organizations, non-formal
leaders of communities etc.) were conducted on the regular basis. By means oz such meetings
community got inZcrma~on of this prqea. and had opportunrty to say 1heir rem arks and
requirements. Second, two social mobilizers were hired to represent two big ethnic groups
(Kyrgyz and Uzbek ). Their objecrives also im'Olved to inform popu1ation about the project. its
goaJs and tasks. to explain opponunities and conditions of job placemen· to help to solve
disputes · necessary. to trace the process of creation of job placement by lhe contractor. to
inform 1he Implementation Agency about situation etc.

questions and represent their claims and offers to the Implementation Agency functioned in the
frames of the proj ect

Upon hiring representatives of socially vulnerable g roups had the priority. particutarty, m embers
o~ low-income, multi-cllild families and families with disabled people. To get infunnation about
such tam es the project closely cooperated with local social security authorities and non-
govemment organizations. About 250-280 people were attracted to wotks in the frames of the
proj ect daily. Average salary of one employee was 8,000 sorns monthly.

Citizens that were involved in project wotks s:ated that the project provided good opportunii)' to
eam money~ preparation of children for school, tor paymem under the contract for educabon.
for daily life in short letmS and near their houses. Women were happy because their husbands
and sons did not have lo go outside the republic for e..aming because they managed :o get job i n
their home:o-.vn. Disabled people from deaf and mute sociay sta:ed that particip.llion in the
projea equally with heallhy people helped them to fell thernselves as productive members of
sociei)'.

pro1ea is represented below:

Moreover. the project was not limited ~ solving social problems. A lot of attention was paid
directly 10 improvement of road intrastrucwre of Osh city and i<:s surroundings. Such worics as
holes patching, crack pouring. curb repairing. rehabilitation of curb inJe:s. provrs.ion and laying of
surface dressing. gravel road repairing. replaoement of old and mounting of new concrete
curbs. piggi119 and construcoon of new wate<-flow and drain pipelines, draina~e di:ches and
trenches. chann"Els reinforcement. signing, marting e:c.

T Ollal repair included more than 250 streets. partJcularty 18 km of roads were covered with new
aspha 55.5 km were installed with gravel roads. 153 km we.re repaired by holes patching .
Powever. the main quantiuy of work (30 % ) was carried ou~ by hand cleansing o .. trenches and
ditches.

Roads. that were to be repaired , were selected by independ em im.   e mational consultant with the
approval of the Implementation Agency. and the Department of Automobile Roads of the Osh
Mayor's office. During selection of roads r.s socral rreaning tar local population that is presence
o.. hospitlls. cfinics, kindergartens. schools. universities, state institu1ions. religious centers.
                                                 18
shopping centers e:c. was taking into considerabon. Also tra1ic volume index on a street and rts
crossing with other streets of the city had great importance. Other fao:ors during selection of
streets were their locations. It was very important that selected streets were equally spaced
through the city. Special attention was pa.id :o districts \\ith m oced ethnic composition.

Ba~c ~suits of the project
    ./ It was created 4,502 humans./ months job places under planned result wi".h 4 248
       humans/ months:
    ./ It was paid more than 23 395 000 soms .)$a salary tQ locaJ;
    ./ Certain repair was carried ou~ on 250 streets of Osh ciry and its surroundings.

Together with achievement 'the project fa<:ed with many di'liculties. --=or example. much
confusion arose conoeming 1he proce:ss o" selection o" road tor maintenance. Unton:unately, the
project: had limited recourses and they did no1 allow covering all streets needed to be repaired.
There were problems wnh job plaoemeru of citizens that djd no1 have passports or omer
i dentlfica1ion documents because the ob1ecciive was. as it was mentioned before. to hue only
citizens o" Osh city. To solve this probtem social mobiliza:ors coopera:ed w ith neighborhood
comrnir..ees and tenitorial community councils. Moreover. many citizens worl<ed in the project
pre"erred to move with it from one s:reet to another. Their preferences were reasonable and
understandabE. Nevertheless. the Contractor was noll recommended to approlw•e such
occurrence because it did not further the goal of equal job placement where the priority of
getting the job was given to citizens tha! lived on this street.

Besides, in win:er worts were o ften suspended ~use o" wel.ther ooriditions and impossibility
to provide a.JI wortcers with appropriate outfits. Low qu ality winter clothes and shoes that loc
citizens used during works were no; able to stand ag ains~ severe wimer penod. Some of mem
because of mis fact had to stop their work. HoweYer. especially in winter local citizens with
unstable and low income needed to have additional source of mcome (for payment for
etecuicity, heating etc .).

A big problem in the beginn:ing of the project implementation was misunderstanding of its
obj ectives by the local state adminis:ra:ion th at considered that il would be more reasonable to
                                               1




i nvest projects means in capiUI repair of roads. This opinioo was reasonable technically but
undermined social aspects of the project. It was no! easy to pursue mem but it was achieved.
Subsequently the projeCl implementation was carried ou~ with close cooperation wfil1 the Osh
Mayor's Office and adminis7ation of municipal roads.

Week poim in the project i mplementation was disability to provide s:abilny of achieved resuJts.
Practice of hiJing of local citizens "or carrying o~ certain WOfks performing by public utilities of
the city has not been used presently. Some resul:s of road ma.imenanoe {cleansing of drainage
systems, uenches etc .) that were obwined in the frames of the project are no: carried out by the
city autholi1ies because o" lack o" proper financing.

Implementation of the project contn"buted to increase a num!M!r of villagers also. In comparison
with 2009 rural population in 201 4 increased in all major loca.Sties situated along the Osh-
Batken-lsfana road corridor. Increase in Kara-Suy and ookat dis1ricts of Osh oblast of the
Kyrgyzsun reached Q.6% and 10% respecOvE!ly.

The main problem 1he tmpleme:n:ation Agency faced with during rehab- anon al the considered
section was, as was deteo:ed in the        oon~.ruction process. neoeossity of additional work
conducting . As for the section ma: runs through ooka~ Pass was founded that parameters of
pavemen: surfacil'lg which were identified in the inijal des.ign oi the project implemented in
200Q are not answerable o increased tra'fic flow presently. In order to avoid cracks in new
aisphah concrele surface the decision to reinforce road sn.icwre was made.

Unexpected circumstanoes related to condition of me existing earthwork on Osmonov and
Y u ldashev Stre-ets occurred also. l n.itiaJy only one layer of asphalt concrete sur'acing was
specified for certain sections of these streets. However , it was founded ou: during construction
process :hai base ma:erial on these sections was no~ answerable to it. This circumstance
brought :o carry ou: ;in e xcavation of the existing asi:>ha.Jt conCS"ete surface and partial
raptacemem of earth.

In summary in me frames of the project three Orders concerning changes were issued in the
result of which cost per contract for civil works increased from $16 to approxima1ely S1Q,7
mi on.

2.3 .2. Implemen ting a Road Ass et Management S ystem.

The main objective of this component was to improve qu~ of repair managemem and
maintenance of road facilities. to imJ>lOV!? the ei'ectiveness of plaMing and programming
tlhrough imptementation of road asset management system and to make · consistent with
intematiooaJ best practices.

To realize this componen~ an individuaJ intemationaJ consultant who was required to carry out
tine following goals was hired:

1. Supervision of coltec:ion and update of road inventory data and developmem of options to
ensur e susta.lnabiity for :he collection and evaluaoon of road network data;


                                                 21

repor-.s on road ne~ monitoring, planning and investment requirements;
4 _ Assessment oc financial needs and opbons for road main~enanoe activities by municipalities_

In me frames of Ob:jective t the full inven:ory o" road seaions having international and sta:e
si gni:icance was conducted. For this objective schemes and official i sts of roads were checked
for accordance with effective Prooedure of classification and numeration of automobile roads on
the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic approved in 1Q97 by thee Kyrgyz Republic Government
Decree •About Measures on realization of the Law o" the Kyrgyz Republic ·Abou1 au~omobile
roads·· . In the result incompliance was found in      supporting documents. In this respect the
lmplen"entalion Agency is developing a project of the Kyrgyz Repub6c Govemmem Decree
concern.mg amendme.ms for m e above stated Decree.

Obj ective 2 provided devek>pment of the road asset manage.men: sys~em (RAMS). The decision
was m ade to develop an experimenul data-base by using of generally available tools that are in
common use and the choice was done in favour of MSExcel. The dev eloped data-base include
infonnation about roads aooon:ling to oblascs. cfistricts. road maint@nane@ organizations, typeos
and categories of roads. road surface e:c.

This data-base   I be kept in special computers. Besides. the basic da~base · Master" wiU be in
the Road :>epartmen: under the Ministry of Transpon and C.ommunications which will run it in
furure.

Wittlin the project frames tocal road operating facilities specialists got trairUl'lg conoeming the
process of visual: inspection ot roads and inspection of dlsfiguremen~ of the road sur"aoe. Aft.er
conducted training speciali~ inspected 1,;suaDy selected road sec:ions with to:al length of 1 377
km. 0.1:.J of :hese inspections were included in the road datab.l.Se. Such in:.peetions will be
conducted by road enterprise twice a year.

According to r esults of Objective 3 a form for the standard report on road system condruon, r oad
system usage, fk>w of ~ffic ets. was developed.

At the same bme implementation of the component faced a number of difficulties that had
si gni1icant impact on the projects implementa:ion :erm and cover.age. Although 1\e need for a
coherem and comprehensive database was ex pressed by Road Department Managemen; and
staff, ·, was clear during the implementation of surveys. lha: Road l\1aintenanoe Department
(RMD} did not consider the road asset m anagement. as it is un derstood in i ntema1JonaJ practice,
to be pan of thoeir routine tasks. During the whole duralion of the project. the RMD did no~
understand the need and the reason to carry out any condition surveys nor traffic counts. Partly,
this is coming from their understanding as being a "rnain:enanoe company", dea ng wrth works,
rather than a '-'etwork Manager. Although they admitted that road condition knowledge is pan of
their tasks, they stated tha.t surveys we.re usu y no~ •real!y" done. Many R~D actually admitted
that road condition surveys were carried ou1 a.s •desk-study"', meaning evaluation of the road

5. Performanc e of the Borrower and Executing Agency

The performance of the Borrower and the Executing Agency was satisfactory. The project was
implemen:ed according to :he arrangements envisaged at appraisal. AJJ loan covenants were
oomp(jed wi:h. Adequate counte-rpart funds were provided by die borrower and executing
agency.

The Executing Agency worked for effecrive settlement of all difficulties which arose during the

During me projed implementa:ion, un&ortunately. a number of oomponents ("    tmp lemen:ing of
road crash data-base. approval of the ational road safety s:rategy in the Govemmem of the
Kyrgyz Republic) were cancelled. Hawever, it happened due to circumS<".ances beyond the
control of the Execu:ing Agency. The above men:ioned oomponents include en:en?sts of a whole
range of govE!f'rvnem institutions tha~ is why they appeared under the influence of longtime
rec:onciEa:ion and approval procedures, disi.n:erest in their imptementa:ion due to cflfferent
reasons. The Executing Agency did everything possible for setlemem problems leve g their'

processing me various requests during implementation, 11or delay in payments . The Kyrgyz
Resident Mission assis-.e<I with govemmem iaison . At the same time there is a need to enhance
institutional reforms projects preparation process.

An general arrangements im'OJved in me projects stucfed abOV"e were carried out satisfactorily
h aving achieved main expected resufts.

Rehabilitation of the Osh~Batken-ls&ana road corridor rendered help to local and regional socio-
eoonomic developmen h became much easies and faster to reach main cen:ers. Improved
transport enfrastructure signfficantly reduced transport cos-.s (economy on repair parts and
consumption ot fuel products). as the resuh trips for local residents became cheaper. production
o f tanners increased due to reduction of delivery time of short-lived commodiiies. Sphere of
trade and services along the reh abilita:ed road corridor sections has developed. Users of the
road increased the number of their trips, therefote. traffic flow on this road corridor inaeased in
general too. Besides . local heal:h authoribes noticed improvements of heahh condition oz me
population iving along the road   mau   has to breathe in dust. Freight and passenger transport
recovered from customs taxes a.nd delays rela~d :o necessity to undergo customs procedures
