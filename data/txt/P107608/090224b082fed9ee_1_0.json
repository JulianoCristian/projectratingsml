     Republic were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a corridor\n            approach should be applied in the preparation and\n            implementation of the same type of road projects. It is\n            important that the design of a follow-up project is\n            influenced by the predecessor project. Development of new\n            information technology (IT) systems should be well\n            coordinated between all donors present and active in the\n            country\u2019s sector and involve a comprehensive analysis of the\n            situation on the ground. Sustainability of road asset\n            management system (RAMS) which has just been developed is at\n            risk if donors\u2019 follow-up projects do not continue building\n            on this activity. The process of building ministry of\n            internal affairs (MIA) and state auto inspection (SAI\u2019s)\n            buy-in and ownership of road safety activities aligned with\n            best international practices requires substantial time,\n            beyond the length of project implementation. Short-term\n            employment using cash-for-work and labor-intensive public\n            works proves to be a good conflict mitigating and local\n            economy restoration tool, if it is accompanied by a\n            well-defined communication strategy."}, "docdt": "2015-06-27T00:34:05Z"}
