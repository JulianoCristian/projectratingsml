Development project\n            seeks to accelerate modernization of agriculture in the Wadi\n            Rima alluvial basin of the Tihama coastal plain, to protect\n            agricultural lands in the vicinity of unstabilized sands, to\n            improve farm incomes and the quality of rural life, and to\n            improve knowledge of the water resources in the Tihama\n            region. This project comprises: (i) restructuring of the\n            wadi's primitive spate diversion and irrigation system\n            to improve its efficiency, including construction of a\n            diversion structure, a syphon and a supply canal, and\n            rehabilitation of badly eroded reaches of the existing\n            canals; (ii) a pilot program of sand stabilization to\n            prevent deterioration of cultivated lands bordering\n            unstabilized sandy areas; (iii) identifying social factors\n            which constrain development of rural life and developing a\n            pilot program for improving the quality of life of the rural\n            population; (iv) project management including technical\n            assistance, staff housing and maintenance equipment; and (v)\n            a water resource study for the Tihama regions."}, "docdt": "1979-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
