                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured in October 2012 to reallocate US$2,554,200 in savings from the renovation of local welfare offices to support implementation of Management
                         Information System. The reallocation of loan proceeds did not affect the Project Development Objective.

                         The project has successfully introduced a One-Stop-Shop organizational model for all social assistance benefits in local welfare offices nationwide. Introduction of the new One-Stop-
                         Office organizational and business model made it possible for beneficiaries to claim their full legal entitlement to benefits in one place and at one time, and by providing their personal

                         reduced from 4.5 hours to 1.2 hours per application. A higher number of benefits are now processed per social officer per month: 498 in 2011 up from 260 in 2006, and so contributed
                         to the MoSP’s efforts to contain the growing administrative costs of social assistance programs. The project-financed renovations in local welfare offices allowed delivery of benefits
                         and related services in better, more dignified conditions.

                         The nationwide implementation of the Management Information System (MIS) will not be achieved in time. All activities to set up the ICT platform have been completed but
                         operational acceptance of the application software to support daily operations of local welfare office under the One-Stop-Shop business model in pilot Vinnytsia oblast has not been
                         completed in time, thus preventing its national roll-out. Since 2008, the software has been gradually improved in a sequence of versions of increasing functionality and coverage of
                         benefit programs and was planned to be launched in 2012 in each local welfare office. The Ministry would need to complete the national roll-out of the application software in 2013
                         and finance it from their budget funds. The MIS will also need on-going support and maintenance to sustain the achieved results.
                         However these funds were not allocated in the draft 2013 State budget so far.

                         After completion of the One-Stop-Shop organizational model nationwide the project supported development of another wave of administrative improvements. In 2012 significant
                         progress has been made in developing policy to further improve Social Safety Net administration and tools to target benefits to most in need. All activities, including draft legislation
                         and regulations, to (i) strengthen the Ministry’s capacity to fight error and fraud in the benefit system; (ii) introduce hybrid means-testing instrument to increase targeting accuracy of
                         benefits determination and inspection; (iii) extend the One-Stop-Shop business model to cover administration of services integrated with benefits has been completed; (iv) develop
                         business model for social patronage to provide benefits and service to vulnerable families with children . All these activities are included in the National Plan for reforms to be
                         launched in 2013.

                         By December 2012, the project disbursements reached USD 89.9 million. The total amount of commitments is USD 95.5 million. No further commitments are planned.
