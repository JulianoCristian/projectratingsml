The project has made noteworthy progress in\n            2008, which continued in 2009. The last supervision mission\n            recorded significant progress in all three project\n            components and the rating was upgraded. The project is now\n            at a phase when different activities under the three\n            components start fitting together, allowing the Project to\n            achieve its overall objective. Given the extension, end of\n            project target dates for achieving final results will be\n            adjusted accordingly. The extension is necessary to complete\n            ongoing management information system (MIS) related\n            activities, which are a key to attaining the project\n            development objective (PDO). The key milestones established\n            as conditions for considering project extension have been\n            met, particularly in terms of completion of civil works and\n            development of the MIS. The project's implementation\n            schedule has been revised to allow completing it by the\n            proposed closing date. This revised schedule puts project\n            activities into a tight timeframe and leaves no room for\n            delays. Recent payment delays by the national treasury\n            affected income tax (IT) contracts execution. Therefore, the\n            team agreed to reduce the minimum application size for\n            payments directly from the loan account from USD1.8 million\n            to USD200,000 for a six month period and already\n            communicated this decision to the Borrower. This reduction\n            will accelerate payments under large IT contracts. This will\n            be the second extension for the project. The first extension\n            was for 17 month reflecting far too short implementation\n            period for the project that covers introduction of the new\n            client intake model in more than 750 local welfare offices\n            all over Ukraine. The second extension will bring the\n            project's cumulative extensions to 30 months and the\n            overall project implementation period to five years."}, "docdt": "2010-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
