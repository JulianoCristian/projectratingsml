System\n            Modernization Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was high; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: financing of Information\n            Analytical System for Social Assistance (ASSAP) operations\n            should be secured to ensure sustainability. Multiple\n            contingency plans should be made in case primary financing\n            fails to materialize. Some of the costs could be covered by\n            other budgets, such as funds allocated for the\n            administrative functions of the Ministry of Social Policy\n            (MOSP) or the social centers; even external donor funding\n            may be a source for the MOSP to explore. Procurement methods\n            affect the development process. Implementation of any kind\n            of uniform system across a country with great variance in\n            local capacity and attitudes requires strong oversight and\n            control mechanisms at the central level. Currently, the\n            Ministry is lacking virtually any capacity to coordinate\n            activities with the regions and local welfare offices and to\n            oversee their implementation, which needs to be taken into\n            account by any follow-up operations. Sustainability of\n            software, hardware, and knowledge to use the equipment must\n            be addressed before and during implementation. Arrangements\n            should be made at the outset of the project to ensure\n            financing of equipment maintenance. A cost/benefit analysis\n            will ease the process of securing funding for system\n            operations, maintenance and further development. Using\n            internal country systems where appropriate is a useful\n            cost-saving measure and can help in building capacity."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
