                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After the extension of the project closing date and the SIDA co-financing grant from May 30, 2010 to July 1, 2011 the project performance improved even further. In 2010 this project
                         became the second best disbursing project in the active Ukrainian portfolio.
                         The majority of the contracts for renovations have been completed and additional US$4 million for renovations allocated to the oblasts in 2010. The MLSO planned the total of US
                         $18.164 million of loan proceeds to be allocated to the regions for renovations. 60% of local welfare offices have completed renovation of their premises. The disbursements under
                         renovation contracts reached US$12 million. By the end of September 2010 the tender procedures for contracting out renovations under additional allocations for renovation had

                         Good progress has been also achieved in software development for the new Management Information System (MIS). The key activities relate to MIS implementation continue to

                         progress satisfactorily. The most critical procurement for supply of hardware and standard software for local and regional welfare offices has been completed. By the end of 2010 the
                         project commitments are expected to reach 95 % of the total loan amount. The main project challenge ahead would be to complete implementation of all MIS related contracts by the
                         project closing date. The MLSP and the World Bank team agreed to continue monitoring project progress on a weekly basis to be able to resolve problems immediately.
