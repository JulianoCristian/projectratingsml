The closing date for the project will be\n            extended from July 1, 2011 until January 1, 2013. The\n            extension is necessary to: undertake the national roll-out\n            of software for a Management Information System (MIS) that\n            was designed, developed and tested under the project;\n            migrate data from the old system to the new one; create main\n            and back-up server offices for the registry; and undertake\n            some training sessions and studies. The Project's\n            implementation schedule and procurement plan have been\n            revised and an action plan prepared to allow for completion\n            of all activities by the new closing date. With the\n            extension, it is fully expected that the project can be\n            completed and meet its original objectives. There are no\n            outstanding audit reports for this project. This will be the\n            third extension of the project and will bring the cumulative\n            extensions to 48 months."}, "docdt": "2011-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
