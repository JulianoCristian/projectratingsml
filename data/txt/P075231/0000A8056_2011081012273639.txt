                         The project seeks significant improvement of the effectiveness of Ukraine's social assistance system by better targeting the benefits and reducing the burden

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since October 2010 the Project made significant progress in implementing all three project components and commitments rose to 86% (as of July 1, 2011) and disbursements
                         reached 66% of IBRD Loan proceeds. The Project became the fastest disbursing project in Ukrainian portfolio. The most considerable progress under the Project was made in
                         implementing a #One-Stop-Shop# business model for administration of social assistance benefits. Implementation of a #One-Stop-Shop# business model for administration of social
                         assistance benefits in almost all Local Welfare Offices (LWOs) has reduced the time it takes to process benefit applications from 4.5 to 1.4 hours. Such efficiency improvements have
                         allowed staff in LWOs to process more benefits per month (from 260 to 370), thus containing the growth of administrative unit costs of social assistance programs. However, this is

                         Information System (MIS) that was developed under the project and piloted in two oblasts. By July 2011, renovations have been undertaken in 720 LWOs, allowing the delivery of

                         benefits and related services in better, more dignified conditions. Out of the total of 757LWOs only 30 LWOs did not meet the conditions established by the Ministry of Social Policy
                         for getting allotments for renovations. After meeting the conditions they will be renovated at the expense of the central and local budgets.

                         The Project has a complex component on Information and Communication technology (ICT) and equipment that supports development of the new MIS for Social Safety Nets in
                         Ukraine. The main inputs for MIS development have been either provided or their delivery is underway. The Government of Ukraine has requested an 18-month extension of the
                         Project closing date to complete three large procurements related to the national roll out of the MIS and a series of capacity building and institutional development activities that will
                         improve the functioning and use of the MIS in local welfare offices and so improve the targeting accuracy of the social assistance system, which is critical to the achievement of the
                         PDO. On June 30, 2011 the World Bank extended the project closing date from July 1, 2011 until January 1, 2013. The Ministry of Social Policy (MSP) together with the World Bank
                         project team revised the project implementation schedule and developed a detailed Action Plan to allow completion of all project activities by the new closing date
