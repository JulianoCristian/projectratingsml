The project\n            has two components : 1) the Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            component includes the following investments: Zagreb network\n            rehabilitation entails the replacement of a dual pipe trench\n            (35 km), transmission pipes (20 km), and distribution pipes\n            (15 km). These investments were identified as priority\n            rehabilitation investments where energy and water losses are\n            high; and, Osijek network rehabilitation entails the\n            replacement of distribution pipes (1 5 km) and connection to\n            the main combined heat power (CHP) plant of customers\n            currently connected to the inefficient local heat only\n            boilers. 2) the consulting services component includes: the\n            development of a demand side management (DSM) Program, where\n            HEPT will look at options to promote voluntary installation\n            of DSM equipment. The component further includes the\n            completion of two surveys in Zagreb and Osijek; preparation\n            of bidding documents; construction supervision; and,\n            preparation of annual audits."}, "docdt": "2006-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
