Project\n            for Croatia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: commitment and ownership on the side of\n            the Borrower and implementing agencies are important for the\n            success of this project. This was demonstrated by the\n            capability of the Hrvatska Elektroprivreda Toplinarstvo (HEP\n            T) team, which implemented the project on time, even though\n            one year of implementation (2008) was lost due to a change\n            in the composition of its supervisory management board. A\n            key lesson for district heating projects in Europe and\n            Central Asia  (ECA) is that politically difficult decisions\n            on increasing heat tariffs should be an integral and\n            complementary part of the economic dialogue underpinnings\n            (DPLs) (as is the case in Ukraine and Moldova). A simple and\n            focused project design helps in effective implementation and\n            achieving the project objectives. It is important to have\n            continuity in the implementing agency's management\n            team. For example, HEP T's Supervisory Board was\n            changed after the change of government in 2008, and this\n            change caused a one year delay in project implementation due\n            to the new Board's unfamiliarity with the Bank's\n            procurement procedures. The size of procurement packages for\n            works (in this case for pipe installation works) should be\n            designed in such a way that several local companies have the\n            financial capability and implementation capacity to execute\n            them, thus allowing adequate competition. There should be\n            financial incentives for tenants to implement Demand Side\n            Management (DSM) measures in apartment buildings. As long as\n            the heat tariff is low and there is no incentive for\n            investment, apartment owners are not likely to be keen on\n            accepting voluntary Debt Management Section (DMS)."}, "docdt": "2010-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
