A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

Sector background

District Heating (DH) companies serve about 400,000 people in Croatia. The main towns where DH
services are provided are: Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka, Sisak, Vukovar, Karlovac, and Slavonski Brod. On an
annual basis, about 2,200 GWh o f energy i s provided through networks that have a total length o f around
300 kilometers (km). The DH services are provided by subsidiaries o f a national company - Hrvatska
Elektroprivreda (HEP) - and by municipal companies, excepting in Rijeka where the DH company i s
jointly owned by the municipality and the private sector. The HEP subsidiary providing services in
Zagreb and Osijek i s called HEP Toplinarstvo (HEP T) which will implement this project. Zagreb and
Osijek represent about 75% and 7%, respectively, o f the sector interms o f connected consumers.

Development issues

The Government intends to strengthen the DH sector as it i s an economical way to provide heat to densely
populated areas where DH networks exist.           To this end, in March 2005 the L a w on Production,
Distribution and Supply o f Thermal Energy (DH Law) was adopted. Inearly 2005, the Croatian Energy
Regulatory Agency (HEM) was also formed which has a mandate to regulate the entire energy sector
including the DHsegment.


b       Rehabilitate the sector: Over the last 15 years, due to paucity o f funds the networks in the DH
        companies were not well maintained and replaced in a timely manner. This leads to frequent
        breakdowns which affect the quality o f services and result in heat and hot water losses. In
        Zagreb, the average number o f breakdowns per lulometer o f the network i s around 4, which i s
        eight times higher than the average number o f breakdowns in Western European countries,
         Similarly, the heat losses in the networks are around 15-25%, compared to a figure o f around 5-
         10%inEU-15countries. There i s a need to systematically identify the rehabilitationpriorities in
        all DHcompanies and determine fundingpossibilities for network rehabilitation;


 b      Introduce cost recovery tariffs: Most DH companies are able to cover their cash operating
        expenses   - fuel, materials, and salaries. However, in many cases, the tariffs today do not cover
        depreciation that limits the ability o f the companies to invest in upgrading the DH network.
        Further, for a DH company, about 75-80% of the cash operating expenses are for fuel that makes
        the profitability o f the company very dependent on international gas and oil prices. Therefore, a
        tariff system that is linked to the price of fuel and includes depreciation charges should be
        considered; and


 b      Introduce Demand Side Management: Consumers are not able to control their consumption
        and their bills are based on the surface area o f their apartment and not actual consumption. This
        often leads to energy wastage as consumers control their heat intake by opening and closing
        windows. Experience in other countries in the region has shown that the use o f regulators to
        control consumption and cost allocators to distribute the costs registered in a building sub-station
        among the apartments leads to savings inhousehold energy consumption and increased comfort.
        The new DH L a w requires that new buildings usingDH should have Demand Side Management
         (DSM) through heat meters. However, there i s n o regulatory requirement for existing customers
        to use DSM, although they may do so voluntarily. Given that the bulk o f the consumers are the




                                                      1

        existing ones, the DH Law should be amended to make it mandatory to install D S M equipment
        by a certain deadline. This will promotethe use ofDSM as seeninother countries inthe region.

GovernmentActions

On M a y 5,2006, the Government adopted a Conclusion (No. 310-02/06-02/05) which sets the framework
for the development and implementation o f the District Heating Strategy (DH Strategy). Key features o f
the Conclusion are:

        The Ministry o f Economy, Labor, and Entrepreneurship (MoELE) will be responsible for the
        development and implementation o f the DH Strategy.           The responsibilities o f MoELE will
        include the preparation o f subsidiary legislation under the DHLaw and co-ordination with H E M
        on matters relatedto tariffs and service standards. On an annual basis, the MoELE will provide a
        report to the Government on the status o f implementingthe DH Strategy. Through the Guarantee
        Agreement of the project, the MoELE has also agreed to submit the same report to the Bank;

        The development and implementation o f the DH Strategy will be financed by the central
        Government budget between 2007 and 2010;

        The viability o f small DH companies that do not use Combined Heat and Power (CHP) boilers as
        a heat source will be determined. In small towns where non-viable DH companies exist, the
        possibility o f providing heat through alternative means will be examined;

        Demand Side Management options will be reviewed, taking into account the current situation, the
        benefits, and the costs to the consumer to install equipment at the household level that will
        regulate consumption and allocate costs among apartments in a building. Currently, the
        installation o f D S M equipment i s voluntary.    Options to make it mandatory to install D S M
        equipment will be considered; and

        An EnergyBenefit Program for low income and vulnerable groups to pay for heatingbills will be
        developed, especially as tariffs are expected to increase to reach cost recovery levels. This
        program will be included as part o f the larger social assistance program and to this end, the
        MoELE will co-ordinate with ministries and agencies responsible for implementing the social
        assistance program.

     Rationalefor Bank involvement

        Helping Croatia with EU Accession: The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Croatia
        supports activities that will help Croatia to accede to the EUand meet EU directives. The project
        will support D S M through a voluntary program to be implemented by HEP T and policy changes
        under the implementation of the Government's DH Strategy. D S M will help to reduce energy
        consumption in buildingsresulting inreduction o f carbon dioxide emissions as per EU Directive
        93/76/EEC that makes specific reference to energy efficiency for the DHsector;

        Experience with DH issues: The Bank has implemented a significant number o f DH projects
        and has gained experience in policy, institutional, and investment matters for the sector. This
        experience will help the Croatia and Bank partnership to implement this project. Inaddition, the
        Bank i s currently implementing two energy projects in Croatia that have deepened its knowledge
        o f sector issues. These two projects are the Energy Efficiency Project and the Renewable Energy

0       The project was partly prepared before: The Bank started preparationo fthis project in 1999.
        However, project preparation was suspended in July 2002, when a decision was taken that
        approval of the Bank loan could move forward subject to the satisfactory resolution o f the
        following and the progress made on each issue i s indicated in italics: (a) a DHLaw should be in
        place. A satisfactory law is in effect since March 2005; (b) HEP T should have its own financial
        statements. This is in place since 2003.       The DH assets are registered with HEP which leases
        them to HEP Tfor afee; (c) staff should be transferred from HEP to HEP T. This was done in
        2003; and (d) there should be a draft agreement between HEP and HEP T on service obligation
        and operationAn agreement between HEP and HEP Tis in place.


3. Higher level objectivesto which the projectcontributes

This project will be one o fthe first activities inthe sector to improve the operations of a DHcompany ina
systematic manner. The DH companies in Zagreb and Osijek represent a significant share o f the sector
(around 82%) and improvements in these two companies will bring about improvements for the sector.
Further, the improvements inthese two companies will have a demonstration effect that can be replicated
byother DHcompanies inthe country.

Through the Guarantee Agreement, the project supports the following which will create a conducive
environment for the development o f the sector:

0       Development o f a tariff methodology by December 31, 2006 that will allow DH companies to
        charge tariffs that will cover: operating costs, including depreciation; and investment costs,
        including debt service;


0       Implementation o f the Government's DH Strategy which will bring about policy and institutional
        changes in the DH sector between 2007 and 2010. The M o E L E will report on an annual basis to
        the Government and the Bank on the progress made in implementing the DH Strategy which will
        include corrective actions to be taken, ifneeded, to successfully implement the strategy; and

0       Development and Government adoption o f a Demand Side Management Program by March 1,
        2008. The project will also support a voluntary D S M program to be implemented by HEP T.
        The implementation o f the Government's Program and the voluntary program by HEP T will
        promote D S M that will increase energy conservation at the household level. Further, consumers
        will be more satisfied as they would have the ability to control consumption and be billed for
        actual heat consumption.


B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The project has been designed as a Specific InvestmentLoan (SIL).

2. Projectdevelopmentobjective and key indicators

The project objective is to promote efficient operations by HEP T. This objective would be met by:



                                                        3

0      reducing energy and water losses through the rehabilitation o fthe network and the closure o f non-
       economic local boilers inOsijek;
0      increasing the profitability o f HEP T by promoting the use o f cost recovery tariffs, assuming that
       the Government allows tariffs to be adjusted as per HEP T's proposal; and
0      increasing the level o f customer satisfaction by understanding their needs through surveys and
       implementing a voluntary D S M Program in Zagreb and Osijek, based on the positive results o f a
       pilot program that was carried out in Zagreb by HEP T which resulted in energy savings o f
       around 10-20% in apartments.

3. Project components

The project has two components: Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Consultancy Services (details in
Annex 3). The table below summarizes the project cost and the financing plan.

                                      Project Cost and FinancingPlan




A. InfrastructureRehabilitation This component includes the following investments:

0      Zagreb: Network rehabilitation, including replacement o f a dual pipe trench (35 km),
       transmission pipes (20 km), and distribution pipes (15 km). These investments were identified as
       priority rehabilitation investments where energy and water losses are high. HEPT will contribute
       byprocuringthe pipes andthe Bank loan will finance the installationworks andpipe parts; and

0      Osijek: Network rehabilitation, including replacement of distribution pipes (15 km) that are in
       poor condition and connection to the main CHP plant o f customers who are currently connected
       to the inefficient local heat only boilers. Inaddition, rehabilitation o f 25 heating sub-stations will
       be supported. Further, for some consumers (heat load o f 6 MW) the heat supply will be switched
       from steam to hot water.

B. Consultancy Services        This component includes the following.       This component will be fully
financed by HEP T.


0      Development o f a D S MProgramby December 31,2006. Under this program, HEPT will look at
       options to promote voluntary installation o f DSM equipment. To the extent possible, HEP T will
       provide incentives to consumers to install the equipment. The incentives that are currently being
       considered are: a different tariff structure for consumers that install the equipment compared to


                                                     4

        those that do not; and a one-time rebate for consumers that install the equipment. From 2007,
        HEP T will implement its D S M Program which is expected to be implementedrapidly once the
        DHLaw is amendedmakingthe installationofthe equipment mandatory;
e       Completion o f 2 surveys inthe cities o f Zagreb and Osijek to understand and respond to the needs
        o f the consumers. The first survey will be carried out in the first year o f project implementation.
        The second survey will be carried out in the fourth year o f project implementation to determine
        the impact o f the project;
e       Preparation o fbiddingdocuments;
e       Construction supervision; and
e       Preparation o f annual audits for the project and HEP T.

4. Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design

Policy and institutionalenvironment hasto be correct Project preparationwas suspended inJuly 2002
when the Government and the Bank decided to wait until a proper policy and institutional environment
for the project was inplace. Currently such conditions exist which make it conducive for the project to
meet its objectives. Some o f the key differences betweenJuly 2002 and now are:

e       energy and follow DHpractices - such as D S M-that are common inEUmember countries;
        Croatia has begun accession negotiations with the EU and intends to meet the EU's directives on

e       a DH L a w i s in place that outlines service responsibility and the framework to establish a tariff
        methodology through subsidiary legislation;
e       an energy regulator, HERA, i s in place to ensure service quality and that tariffs are based on
        costs; and
e       HEP T has been formed as a separate entity with separate accounts that helps to clearly identify
        the revenues and expenditures related to DH, within the HEP group, and make necessary changes
        to increase the profitability of the company.

Need to promoteDSM The sustainability of DHprojects is increased ifconsumers receive good quality
service. In a survey carried out in 2001, the majority o f the consumers sampled in Zagreb and Osijek
expressed an interest to control heat consumption and be billed for actual DHusage (Section D4). HEPT
carried out a pilot D S M program in Zagreb where the energy savings have been around 10-20%. Under
the project, HEP T will expand the positive outcome o f the pilot program by developing and
implementing a voluntary D S M Program for Zagreb and Osijek.

5. Alternatives consideredandreasonsfor rejection

Technical Assistance Component to support policy and institutional reforms:                    A Technical
Assistance (TA) component - financed by the Bank loan - was considered at the project concept stage.
This TA would have supported the Government to carry out policy and institutional reforms in the DH
sector and included support on implementing DSM, strengthening HEM, developing secondary
legislation under the DH Law, and preparing a program to support the low income groups to pay for
energy bills. However, this option was not pursued since the Government on its own decided to develop
the sector and provided funding from the budget'. The activities proposed under the Government's DH
Strategy are similar to the proposed TA component discussed at the project concept stage. Thus, instead
o f a separate TA component, the project design - through the Guarantee Agreement - supports the
implementation of the Government's DH Strategy that will result inpolicy and institutionalreforms.

Sector wide approach: A sector wide approach was considered through which the project could cover
all the DH companies in the country. However, this option was not pursued as the viability o f some of
the smaller municipal companies i s not certain and the Government's DH Strategy on this matter is not
yet in place.  Further, it would complicate project implementation arrangements as there would be
multiple end beneficiaries. Thus, under the project it was decided to work with a large enterprise like
HEP and HEPT which have the institutional capacity. Further, HEPT's operations inZagreb and Osijek
cover about 82% o f sector and the viability o f DH services in these two cities i s certain as the networks
are already in place and both cities have Combined Heat and Power boilers that can provide heat at
economic terms.

Lend directly to HEP T: The option o f making the Bank loan to HEP T was considered as it is
responsible for providing DH services and the company has adequate institutional capacity. However,
this option was not pursued as the company is not yet profitable. Thus, it was decided that the Bank loan
will be made to HEP, HEP T's holding company, which i s a profitable national power company and has
experience in worhng with the Bank on the ongoing Energy Efficiency Project and Renewable Energy
Project. Improvements inHEP T will be promoted through the Project Agreement between the company
and the Bank; and the Subsidiary Agreement betweenHEP and HEPT.


C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

There will be a Loan Agreement between the Bank and HEP which will on-lend the Bank loan proceeds
to HEP T through a Subsidiary Agreement. The terms and conditions o f the Bank loan between HEP and
HEP T will be identical to those betweenthe Bank and HEP. There will be a ProjectAgreement between
the Bank and HEP T clarifying how the project will be carried out by HEP T. Further, there will be a
Guarantee Agreement between the Bank and the Republic o f Croatia, for the loan to HEP, which will
provide the financial and performance guarantees related to the project. In addition, there will be a
Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement between HEP and the Ministry o f Finance (MoF). HEP and HEP T have
created a joint Project Implementation Unit (PIU) comprising staff from the technical, financial,
accounting, and legal departments o f the two companies. There are no external consultants in the PIU
and staff members from HEP and HEP T work in the PIU and also carry out their other duties in these


`Basedon  the Conclusion ofthe Government dated May 5, 2006,


                                                    6

companies.    HEP and HEP T will ensure that the PIU i s staffed properly and functions effectively
throughout the duration o fthe project.

2. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

The project development indicators are: energy loss (% o f heat generated), ratio o f water added to the
network volume, net profithevenues, and customer satisfaction. The intermediate outcome indicators are:
percentage o f rehabilitation completed, ratio o f receivables to sales, ratio o f payables to cash operating
expenses, operating ratio, and total number o f domestic connections. These indicators will be monitored
over time against target values and the results will be available to the Bank inthe Project Report prepared
by HEPT on a semi-annual basis. The indicatorsare provided inAnnex 3.

3. Sustainability

DHis a basic service and the proposedrehabilitation investments will leadto efficient operations byHEP
T. The risk o f the services beingdiscontinued is extremely low as consumers have expressed satisfaction
with the services being provided by HEP T and not indicated their preference to move to other forms o f
heating (Section D4). Measures are being taken under the project for the services to be delivered in a
sustainable manner. These measures are:

0       improvement in HEP T's financial performance through an increase in tariffs and reduction in
        energy and water losses;
0       voluntary introduction o f D S M to allow consumers to have more control on their consumption
        and be billed for actual usage o f DHservices. This will lead to increased customer satisfaction;
0       surveys to be carried out by HEP T to determine customer satisfaction and make improvements,
        as necessary; and
0       policy and institutional changes to be made by the Government to support the development o f the
        DHsector.

4. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

There are three risks related to the project: the development o f a tariff methodology may be delayed, there
may be delays in tariff approval by the Government, there may be delays in establishing a contract
between HEP T and the City o f Zagreb which i s a disbursement condition for the Zagreb component o f
the project.


Delay inintroducingtariff methodology

As per the DH Law, the tariff approval process is as follows - HEP T proposes a new tariff to H E M
based on a methodology. The Government then approves tariffs endorsed by HERA. As the DH L a w
and HERA are relatively new, the tariff methodology i s not yet in place, although a draft methodology
has been prepared and by law it should be inplace by December 31, 2006. To address the risk, under the
Guarantee Agreement, the Government will ensure that by December 31, 2006, a tariff methodology i s in
place that will cover operating costs, including depreciation, and investment costs (counterpart funds and
debt service).




                                                       7

Delay intariff approvalbythe Government

Tariffs endorsed by H E M have to be approved by the Government. If the decision o f the Government
on approving tariffs i s delayed, then the financial position o f HEP T will be affected. To address this risk,
under the Guarantee Agreement, the Government will ensure that HEP T i s able to meet its financial
obligations under the project. This would include approval o f adequate tariffs by the Government in
accordance with Croatian legislation. Through the Project Agreement, HEP T has also agreed that it
would submit to H E M a tariff proposal, one month after the tariff methodology i s in place to avoid
delays in implementing new tariffs.

Delay inclarifyingDHasset ownershipinthe City of Zagreb

InZagreb, all the DHassets are registered inHEP's balance sheet and the city has allowed HEP T and
HEP (before HEP T was formed) full access to all the assets. For the provision o f services, the DHLaw
requires a city and an existing DH service provider to establish a service or a concession contract. Such a
contract exists in Osijek. For Zagreb, there i s a 1992 decision o f the city that delegates the DH service
provision to a public company but HEP i s not mentioned by name in this decision, although HEP and
later HEP T have provided the services. However, to clarify the basis for service provision, the City o f
Zagreb i s in the process of establishing a contract with HEP T by end June 2006. This i s also stated
through a January 2006 letter from the mayor o f the City o f Zagreb to the head o f the Management Board
o f HEP. The letter mentions that the city i s satisfied with the services provided by HEP over the years
and intends to establish a contract with HEPT, as per the DHLaw.

Delays inestablishing this contract are not expected to hamper the services. However, to clarify the legal
arrangement between the City of Zagreb and HEP T, a disbursement condition for the Zagreb component
o f this project is that the contract between the City o f Zagreb and HEP T i s executed. Ifthere are delays
inestablishing the contract thenthe Zagreb component of the projectwill not be implemented. However,
this riskis not considered highgiven that the contractingprocess is well underway and it is inthe interest
o f HEP T and the City o f Zagreb to clarify the legal arrangements as soon as possible, in accordance with
the DHLaw.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

Details o f the economic and financial analyses are presented in Annex 9 and the main features are
summarized below. The financial covenants are presented in Section (2.5.

Economic Analysis

A cost benefit analysis was performed which resultedinan economic rate o freturn (ERR) of 18.4 % and
12.0% inZagreb and Osijek, respectively, justifying the investments. The benefits o f D S M have not been
taken into account as the D S M Program to be implemented by HEP T i s not yet inplace. However, as
demonstrated by the pilot program in Zagreb, the D S M measures will result in savings o f 10-20% in
energy consumption at the apartment level. This will result in fuel savings, yielding a higher ERR on the
project compared to the numbers mentioned above. The incrementalbenefits assumed are:


    0   iavings in fuel cost;
    0   savings intreated water cost;
    0   savings inrepair and maintenance cost;
    0   additional electricity generated by switching the DHnetwork connection from local boilers to the
        Osijek CHP plant, in some parts o f the city. The supply o f 5.6 MW o f heat will switch from local
        heat only boilers to the CHP plant. To supply this additional heat, more electricity will be
        generated inthe CHP plant which i s more economic compared to the generation o f electricity ina
        standard condensing plant; and



                                                     10

      0   savings due to switching customers from steam to hot water inOsijek.

 Energy savings constitute about 50% and 60% o f the benefits o f the project in Zagreb and Osijek,
 respectively. As gas prices play a large factor in determining the magnitude o f the energy savings due to
 the project, a sensitivity analysis on the ERR by varying the price o f gas has been carried out. Under a
 base case scenario, an economic gas price o f  200/1000m3has been assumed which results in an ERR o f
 17.0% for the entire project. Ifthe gas price increases by 20%, the ERR for the entire project i s 18.9%.
 Inthe event ofa20%decreaseingasprices, the ERRis 15.0%.

 FinancialAnalysis

 HEP(theBorrower)

 HEP i s a national holding company for a number of subsidiary companies that provide multiple services
 including: (i)  electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii)district heating; and (iii)gas
 distribution. On July 1, 2002, HEP T was formed through a restructuring in HEP. Prior to this date, DH
 services were provided in Zagreb and Osijek by HEP. The assets for DH services are held by HEP but
 leased to HEP T for a fee, which i s a practice followed by HEP with its other subsidiaries. There i s a
 Management Board and a Supervisory Board for the HEP holding company and each subsidiary company
 i s headed by a Director who reports to HEP's Management Board. For this project, HEP will be the
 Borrower of the Bank loan and it will on-lend to HEP T the Bank loan proceeds at terms and conditions
 that are identical to the loanbetween the Bank and HEP.

 Past and recent results: As o f December 31, 2005, HEP had total assets o f about HRK 28,087 million
 ( 3.8 billion equivalent). About 90% o f HEP's revenues come from electricity where the average tariff
 i s HRK 0.55kWh ( 0.08kWh),            6% from district heating, and the remaining 4% from the gas
 distribution and other activities. Since 2003, HEP has been generating an after-tax profit, and its internal
 cash generation has been strong.       In2005, HEP's total revenues were HRK 9,653 million and the
 operating profit was HRK 544 million. HEP has also been undertaking a large investment program
  averaging about HRK 2 billion per year in the last three years. To help finance this program, HEP has
  increased its medium and long term borrowings. Neveflheless, HEP's debt service coverage ratio (2.5)
  and the debt to equityratio (28:72) remain at adequate levels.

 Future performance: Under its four-year Business Plan for 2004 -2007, HEP is projecting profitable
  operations with an annual growth o f around 3.6% in electricity demand.          Based on a conservative
  extrapolation o f the trends beyond 2007, it i s projected that HEP will continue to maintain profitable
  operations and will meet its financial obligations with respect to the Bank loan.

  HEPT (ProjectImplementingEntity)

 Past and recent results: HEPT is a subsidiary o f HEPandprovides DHservices to Zagreb and Osijek.
 Under a lease agreement, HEP T purchases heat and steam from HEP's CHP plants and supplies them to
 household and other consumers. The price o f heat and steam purchased from HEP by HEP T reflects the
  costs o f production. Inthe future, once the tariff methodology i s inplace, it will establish the price HEP
  T will have to pay HEPfor the purchase o f heat and steam.

  As o f December 31,2004, HEPT had total assets o f about HRK 791 million( 109million). HEPT has
  been incurring annual losses due to inadequate tariffs that have not kept pace with the risingcosts o f heat,
  fuel and other inputs. In2005, HRK hadtotal revenues o f HRK 528 million, an operating loss o f HRK 60
. million, and it had accumulated payment arrears o f around HRK 175 million to HEP for the purchase o f
  heat and steam. At prevailing tariff levels, HEP T i s not able to cover its depreciation charges, provide


                                                       11

local counterpart financing for investments, and reduce its payment arrears to HEP. HEP T also has
accumulated receivables (amounting to about 3.5 months o f sales revenues) mainly due to difficulties in
collecting revenues from household consumers. However, the annual collection performance has been
improving and was about 99% in2005, including collection o f arrears from earlier years.

Future performance: HEP T will need to progressively increase its tariffs to reach full cost recovery
levels that would cover operating expenses, including depreciation; debt service payments; counterpart
financing for the project; and payments to HEP to eliminate arrears. Concurrently, HEP T will also have
to maintain a strong collection performance. Financial projections (Annex 9) indicate that, for HEP T to
meet its financial obligations, the average tariff for Zagreb and Osijek will have to be progressively
increased from the 2005 levels (Zagreb - HRK 202kWh; Osijek            - HRK 232kWh).     For HEP T to be
profitable in2007, these average tariffs would have to be at HRK 258kWh and HRK 3 19kWh,inZagreb
and Osijek, respectively. To reach full cost recovery levels, over the period o f 2005 to 2010, the average
tariff for heat will have to be increased inreal terms by 27% and 29% in Zagreb and Osijek, respectively.
However, the Government approves the tariffs, after they are endorsed by HEM. Thus, the Guarantee
Agreement reflects the need for the Government to facilitate an increase o f tariffs for HEP T. With the
increased tariffs and sustained collection performance, HEP T would be able to progressively reduce its
arrears. HEP T's perfonnance in reducing payables and receivables will be monitored regularly during
project implementation.

FinancialRate of Return

The overall financial rate o f return (FRR) for the project i s estimated at 13.8 % (15.5% for the Zagreb
component and 5.9% for the Osijek component). The main incremental financial benefits o f the project
are the fuel savings due to reduction o f heat losses, savings due to water losses, and reduction in repair
costs. As DH is a basic necessity, the FRR is not the most appropriate measure of the project's worth.
However, at the FRRs mentioned above, HEP T will be able to meet its financial obligations under the
project.

2. Technical

A detailed feasibility study was conducted which defined the proposed investments and the expected
benefits o f the project. The proposed investments are technically viable, well tested, and not complicated
to put in place. The Project Report, prepared on a semi-annual basis will monitor project progress,
highlightany technical issues that may arise duringimplementation, and recommendmeasures to address
the issues that may arise.

 3. Fiduciary

A financial management review was undertaken in October 2005 with a follow-up review in February
 2006. The financial management arrangements o fthe project are acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower i s
 in compliance with its audit covenants of existing Bank-financed projects. Formats for the un-audited
 interim financial reports (IFRs) have been developed. Under the Bank's Energy EfficiencyProject, where
HEP i s also the Borrower, all audit reports have been submitted to the Bank o n time, the auditor's
 opinions are unqualified, and there are no internal control issues raise inthe management letters.

 A procurement review of HEP T was conducted inNovember 2005 and the conclusion was that HEP T
 will be able to implement the project (details inAnnex 8).

4. Social

In 2001, a social assessment on DH services was carried out in the cities of Zagreb and Osijek where
about 750 and 600 consumers were sampled in the two cities, respectively. Ingeneral, consumers have a
positive opinion o f DHand some highlightso f the assessment were:


    0   Majority of consumers considered the service quality to be `good' or `very good' - 72% in
        Zagreb; 85% inOsijek;

    0   Only a small percentage of the people sampled expressed an interest to move to other forms o f
        heating-2.8% inZagreb; and 0.8% inOsijek;


    0   Consumers expressed satisfaction with DHas it is clean a source o f heating and affordable; and


    0   While consumers were satisfied with DH, the majority o f them expressed an interest to have
        D S M - 80% in Zagreb; and 85% in Osijek.           Consumers now control room temperatures by
        opening windows, leading to energy losses.

As shown inthe table below, in2005, the average cost per apartment on DHwas around 3.3% inZagreb
and 3.4% inOsijek which are at affordable levels for most consumers. For the low income households, as
part of the DH Strategy, the Government i s considering to introduce an Energy Benefit Program to be
included under the general social assistance program. In addition, for all consumers, discussions are
underway to have a two-part tariff system where the fixed costs would be paid over the non-winter
months and the variable costs (mainly fuel costs) during the winter months. If such a method is adopted,
the cost of DH would be spread over the year for the consumer, without causing sharp increases in
heatingbills inthe winter months.




For this project, a survey will be carried out in the first year o f implementation to learn more about
consumer preferences and satisfaction. Household income levels will also be updated to see how many
consumers need assistance to pay for DH services and this information will be provided to the
Government for it to incorporate the Energy Benefit Program within the general social assistance
program. At the end of the project, another survey will be carried out to determine the impact o f the
project.


* The survey mentions that the average household incomes were HRK 5,500 and 5,000 in Zagreb and Osijek,
respectively. These incomes were increased with an annual growth rate o f 5%.

5. Environment

The project, which i s classified as an environmental category B project as per Bank's policies, mainly
addresses rehabilitation o f the existing network and as a result there are no major environmental concerns.
The project will have positive environmental effects due to reduction o f energy and water losses. During
construction, some minor environmental issues may arise (noise, dust, and traffic disruption). These will
be addressed through the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which was discussed in public
meetings in Zagreb (December 13, 2005) and Osijek (December 7, 2005) where no major environmental
concerns were raisedby participants.

The Bank's safeguard policy on Environmental Assessment will be triggered. To this end, an EMP has
been prepared to address minor environmental concerns during construction. The project involves no
Involuntary Resettlement. However, a Land Acquisition Policy Framework - satisfactory to the Bank -
has been prepared in case HEP T has to acquire land. It i s unlikelythat land acquisition will be required
as HEP T has the right of way for the existing networks. The framework has been prepared in case there
are alterations in the layout o f networks in areas where HEP T does not have the right o f way. As per
Bank's policy, since a Land Acquisition Policy Framework has been prepared and publicly disclosed, the
OP/BP 4.12 i s considered relevant and as a result, the above box has been checked. HEP T has adequate
capacity to implement the EMP and the land acquisition process, if required, in line with Bank's
guidelines.

                           CROATIA: DISTRICT HEATING PROJECT


Backgroundof DHsector

InCroatia there are 10 district heating (DH) companies in the major cities and towns. The DH sector
started inthe mid 1960s with the construction o f the Zagreb DHnetwork. The two largest DHcompanies
are in Zagreb and Osijek which are owned and operated by HEP T. Other major towns where DH
services are provided are: Rijeka, Karlovac, and Slavonski Brod. Some o f the characteristics o f the DH
sector are briefly described below:

    0    The total number of DH customers in the country is about 150,000, o f which 95% are
         household consumers.     The breakdown of consumers in percentage terms, in major cities is:
         Zagreb 75%; Osijek 7%; Rijeka 6%; Karlovac 5%.

    0    The total length of DHnetworkinCroatian DHcompanies is about 300 kmo f which about 180
         kmand40 kmare inZagreb and Osijek, respectively.

    0    The annual heat supply o f all the DH companies in Croatia in 2004 was about 2,300 GWh o f
         which Zagreb and Osijek's share was 75% and 8%, respectively.

    0    Ownership of the DH companies differs fi-om town to town. In Zagreb and Osijek the DH
         system i s operated by the HEP T which i s a subsidiary o f HEP. InSisak, another HEP subsidiary
         called Toplinarstvo Sisak provides DHservices. These HEP subsidiaries purchase heat and steam
         fi-om HEP CHP plants located in the cities. In other cities, the DH companies are owned by
         municipalities, excepting in Rijeka where the ownership is shared between the municipality and
         the private sector.

Sector DevelopmentIssues

The Government intends to strengthen the sector as it i s an economical way to provide heat to densely
populated areas where DH networks exist.        To this end, in March 2005, the L a w on Production,
Distribution and Supply o f Thermal Energy (DH Law) was adopted. Inearly 2005, the energy regulator
(HEM) was also formed which has a mandate to regulate the entire energy sector including the DH
segment. Further, on M a y 5, 2006, the Government adopted a Conclusion (No. 310-02/06-02/05) which
sets the framework for the development and implementation o f the District Heating Strategy (DH
Strategy). InSection Al, the development issues and the Government actions are outlined.

CurrentDHSysteminZagreb

InZagreb, most ofthe consumers live inapartment buildingswith each buildinghaving a sub-station,
equipped with regulating valves that control heat distribution within a building. The sub-stations are in
good condition and they are equipped with heat meters so the actual heat consumption in a building i s
known. However, at the apartment level, cost allocators are not installed and as a result for billing
purposes, the building level consumption is distributed to the apartments based on the area o f an
apartment and not actual consumption.

The construction o f the DHtransmission and distribution network started in 1965 and the total length o f
the network i s about 180 km (2-pipe trench).       Between 2000 and 2004, HEP T started a network


                                                     15

rehabilitation program from its own financing and has replaced about 10% o f the network. Currently
about 35% o f the network i s about more than 30 years old where the pipes have a large amount o f heat
and water losses and repair costs are high due to frequent breakdowns. The number o f breakdowns has
grown from 43 in 2000 to 137 in2004. Duringthe same period, the annual water leakages have increased
from 320,000 tons to 960,000 tons and the current energy loss i s around 12.5% o f the heat generated,
indicating the need to urgently carry out the rehabilitation o fthe network.

The heat to the network i s provided by two CHP plants (TE-TO and EL-TO) which are owned and
operated by HEP. Natural gas i s the main fuel in both the plants and heavy fuel oil is used as a reserve
and supplementary fuel. The heat generation capacity o f the TE-TO-plant i s about 950 MW (including the
CHP units and heat-only-boilers) and the electricity capacity about 177 MW. The newest unit inTE-TO
i s a combined cycle CHP-unit with 190 MW heat output and 150 MW electricity output, which was
installed in 2003. The total heat generation capacity in the EL-TO-plant i s about 750 MW and the
electricity generation capacity about 94 MW. The heat transmission from the CHP plants to the DH
network is done by DHpumps which are operated invariable flow mode, which i s a modern and efficient
way to operate a DH system as heat i s supplied based on demand. The CHP plants are well maintained
and in good condition.

CurrentDHSysteminOsijek

InOsijek, similar to Zagreb, there arebuildinglevelsub-stations andheat metersbutthe billingisbased
on the area o f an apartment and not actual consumption. The network construction started in the late
1960s and the current network length i s about 40 km (2-pipe trench). About 30% o f the network i s more
than 30 years old where the energy and water losses are high. It i s estimated that about 15% o f the heat
generated is lost due to leaks in the network. In Osijek, HEP T also supplies steam to industrial and
domestic consumers. The current estimated loss i s around 30% for the steam supply. Through the
project, some o f the consumers will switch from steam to hot water that will lead to savings for HEPT.

The heat to the DH network i s provided through a CHP plant in Osijek, owned and operated by HEP.
The main fuel i s natural gas and heavy fuel oil i s used as a reserve and supplementary fuel. The heat
generation capacity i s highcompared to the needs o f DH system, where the total heat generation capacity
i s about 430 MW and the electricity capacity i s about 95 MW. The CHP plant is well maintained and in
good condition.

       Annex 2: MajorRelatedProjectsFinancedby the Bank andor other Agencies
                         CROATIA: DISTRICT HEATINGPROJECT


The following ongoing Bank projects are relevant as they cover energy efficiency and reduction o f
greenhouse gas emissions. Inthe proposed Croatia District Heating Project, the rehabilitation o f the DH
networks and the proposed DSM Program will lead to energy savings and result in reduction o f
greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the implementation o f the following projects has made the Bank
familiar with energy issues inCroatia and the operation o f HEP.

Energy Efficiency Project (P079978/P071461)

The project's objective i s to increase the demand for and supply o f energy efficiency projects and
services. This will be achieved by:

    0   creating a core developer o f energy efficiency projects within HEP. This new energy service
        company (ESCO) o f HEP will develop, finance and implement energy efficiency projects on a
        commercial, for profit basis, usinglocal businesses as key delivery agents; and

    0   providing a framework for other emerging service providers to tap into the new energy efficiency
        business opportunities.

Progress in meeting the development objective and implementation are both satisfactory. The project i s
financed by the Bank and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and implemented by the Bank.


RenewableEnergy Project (P071464)

The project's objective i s to help develop an economically and environmentally sustainable market for
renewable energy resources in Croatia.     Development o f this market will support Croatia in its EU
accession efforts. The project i s targeting both the production o f electricity and heat from renewable
energy sources.

Progress in meeting the development objective and implementation are both satisfactory. The project i s
financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and implementedby the Bank.

                          CROATIA: DISTRICT HEATING PROJECT


The project will have two components - Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Consultancy Services. The
estimated cost and the proposed financing plan are presented below. The cost includes physical and price
contingencies, and taxes and duties o f 8%. Value added tax (VAT) i s not included as HEP and its
subsidiaries do not include this tax in contracts with suppliers. VAT i s paid separately to the suppliers by
HEPand its subsidiaries and fully recovered from the consumers.




    A. InfrastructureRehabilitation This component includes the following investmentsinZagreb and
    Osijek:

        0   Zagreb: Network rehabilitation, including replacement of a dual pipe trench (35 km),
            transmission pipes (20 km), and distribution pipes (15 km). These investments were
            identified as priority rehabilitation investments where energy and water losses are high. HEP
            T will contribute by procuring the pipes and the Bank loan will finance the installation works
            and pipe parts.

                          CROATIA: DISTRICT HEATING PROJECT

Country Issues: The Croatia CFAA report (May 2005) concludes that the level o f fiduciary risk
attached to the primary elements o f Croatia's public financial management systems (legal framework,
institutional capacity and practices for the core financial control processes such as budgeting, treasury and
cash management, accounting, financial reporting, internal control, internal audit, external audit and
Parliamentary oversight) i s significant.      However, additional project level safeguards have been
established in order to mitigate the risks inherent in Croatia's public financial management (PFM)
systems, e.g. the requirement for an independent external audit or ensuring that there are adequate
counterpart funds to complete the project in a timely manner.

Financial Risk Analysis HEP: The financial management risk has been assessed as modest, with
mitigation measures indicatedbelow.

Financialviability assessment: The Borrower, HEP, i s a profitable enterprise and details o f its financial
situation are provided inAnnex 9.

Strengths and Weaknesses: The significant strengths that provide a basis to rely on the project's
financial management arrangements include: the existence o f staff in HEP with prior experience in Bank
projects; HEP and HEP T use a well known accounting system, which can be adjusted to recordthe Bank
project and produce Interim Unaudited Financial Statements (IFRs); and a satisfactory internal control
system inHEP.

Funds Flow: Bank will make funds available to HEP and project funds will flow from: (i)the Bank
through a Designated Account, opened by HEP, in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank; (ii)                   HEP
will open for HEP T two project accounts in the same commercial bank. The accounts will be inHRK
and Euro. HEP will transfer the funds from the Designated Account to these project accounts for HEP T
to pay the suppliers; (iii) counterpart funds for the project will be available in HEP T's current account,
which i s used for regular transfers from HEP or collection o f HEP T's own revenues. This current
account will also be used by HEP T to pay suppliers, as needed.                          The PIU will prepare relevant
documents (e.g. application for withdrawal) and obtain necessary clearances.

Staffing: A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) comprising staff from HEP and HEP T has been
established. The PIU are qualified for the following matters: technical, procurement, legal, accounting,
and financial. A PIU member has experience in implementing the Bank's ongoing Energy Efficiency
Project and other staff have attended Bank's procurement training. The CVs andjob descriptions o f the
PIU members have been submitted to the Bank and this information i s included in the project's
Accounting and Internal Control Manual.




                                                               25

Accounting Policies and Procedures: The project's financial statements will be prepared on an accrual
basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This i s in line with the
standards currently used by HEP. Also, there i s an internal accounting manual in HEP which contains
details about the accounting procedures to be followed inthe company. For the project, this manual may
be used and references to it are made inthe project's Accounting and Internal Control Manual.

Reporting and Monitoring: The PIU will maintain the project accounts and will ensure appropriate
accounting o f the funds in these accounts. The PIU will be responsible for preparing Interim Financial
Reports (IFRs) on a quarterly basis for HEP. The IFR will include the following and format o f the
following reports are included inthe project's Accounting and Internal Control Manual:

    e   Project Sources and Uses o fFunds
    0   Uses o f Fundsby Project Activity
    0   Special Account Statement
    e   ProcurementReport
    e   Physical Progress Report
    0   Cash Flow Forecast.

The first IFRs will be furnished to the Bank no later than 45 days after the end o f the first calendar quarter
after the effectiveness date, and will cover the period fkom the effectiveness date to the end o f the first
calendar quarter. IFRs formats have been agreed with the PIU and are included inthe accounting manual.

InformationSystem: HEP and HEPT use an Oracle accountingandreporting system which will also be
used for the project as the system can be separated to record transactions o f the project, generate
analytical accounts, produce trial balance sheet, and generate detailed account listing. The access to the
system i s password protected, users have restricted access to the different modules, and there i s a back-up
procedure. The project's financial statements will be generated through the current accounting system o f
HEP and HEP T. From detailed trial balance in Excel, manual IFRs will be produced.                  The same
procedure i s being used for the Energy Efficiency Project, implementedby HEP.

Budgeting: The budgeting process is clearly defined and will be used for the purposes o f the project.
Each year, HEP sends budget instructions to its subsidiaries. The budget i s prepared both in physical
units and financial measures. There i s also a process o f comparing the actual expenditures against
budgeted amounts on a monthly basis. HEP seeks clarification on variances between actual expenditures
and budgeted amounts prior to its monthly Board meeting on the budget.

Supervision Plan: The Project Report will outline the implementation progress. IFRs will be reviewed
jointly by the Bank's Financial Management Specialist and Procurement Specialist who will address any
issues that may arise on financial management matters. The frequency o f on-site Bank supervision will
depend on the project's financial management and procurement risk rating, generated by a model used by
the Bank. Audited financial reports o f the project will be reviewed and as necessary follow up actions
will be taken.

Internal Audit: HEP has an internal audit department that reports to the Board and audit committee o f
the company. The fields covered by the internal audit department are: corporate governance, internal audit
and internal control. The internal audit department follows the Croatian Operational Rules o f Internal
Auditors and Code of Ethics. Its work program i s approved by HEP's Management Board, and guidelines
are established within HEP on the operation o f the internal audit department. This department carries out
inspection and audit of all business activities, functions, and processes across all companies in the HEP
group. The focus of the internal audit i s on the purchases and all HEP subsidiaries are under close

scrutiny and inspected against Croatian regulations and HEP rules. Due to lack o f sufficient staff HEP
does not plan to include the project in its internal audit plan. Thus, no reliance will be placed on the
internal audit arrangements o f HEP.

ExternalAudit: Both HEP and HEP T are audited by independent auditors. Inrecent years, Deloitte
(2004) and Price Waterhouse Coopers (2003) conducted the audits. HEP's 2003 and 2004 audits are
qualified: in 2003 it was an issue on accounting treatment o f an investment; and in 2004 it was an issue
related to jubilee awards and retirement bonuses which were not treated in accordance with I A S 19. For
HEP T, the 2003 and 2004 audits are unqualified. The current external audit arrangements are in line
with Bank's financial management requirements. An independent auditor, in accordance with ISA and
IFRS, will also audit the project's financial statements.

DisbursementArrangements: Disbursements will follow the traditional method, either through direct
payments to suppliers or through replenishment o f the DA. Withdrawal applications for the
replenishments of the DAswill be sent to the Bank by the PIU every quarter, or when about a third o f the
initial deposit in the DA has been utilized, whichever comes first. During the life of the project, if PIU
develops cash flow forecast capabilities, they can move to IFRbased disbursements.

Under the traditional method, the loan funds will be disbursed through Bank procedures on direct
payments and Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation for SOEs, including
completion reports and certificates, will be retained by HEP and HEP T and made available to the Bank
during project supervision.
      _ ..                      Disbursements for expenditures above the SOE thresholds will be made
against presentation o f full documentation relating to the expenditures.      The following shows the
allocation o f loan proceeds.



                                                                                                        '

The Bank financing inEuros as mentioned in the Loan Agreement for the above categories is as follows:

End Fee - 0.06 million.
(a) Works - 7.87 million; (b) Goods - 16.07 million; (c) Consultant Services -  none; and (d) Front
                               Retroactive financing o f 2.4 million i s available for Works and Goods
contracts identified inthe Procurement Plan. The Bank will finance 100% o f certain contracts while HEP
T will fully finance other contracts. The overall Bank financing will be 67% o f total costs. Value added
tax (VAT) i s not included as HEP and its subsidiaries do not include this tax in contracts with suppliers.
VAT is paid separately to the suppliers by HEP and its subsidiaries and also fully recovered fkom the
 consumers.

Use of Statements of Expenditures(SOEs): The reimbursement o f expenditures made from the DA
may be made on the basis o f certified SOEs, for the following items: (a) contracts for goods valued at less
than  400,000; and (b) contracts for works less than 4,000,000. Consulting contracts with firms will be
 financed out o f counterpart funds.

        audited statements and audit report will be provided to the Bank within six months o f the end o f
        each fiscal year;

        HEP and HEP T will provide the Bank with a copy o f the annual audit report o f the companies;
        and

        HEP and HEP T will maintain supporting documentation for all project expenditures up to 6
        months after the final withdrawal from the loan and will make these available for Bank review
        and for other audit reviews.

B. Assessmentof the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement

HEP T is the Project Implementing Entity. A joint PIU has been established by HEP and HEP T and it
will be responsible for day-to-day coordination, management, implementation and monitoring o f the
project in close collaboration with all other departments within HEP and HEP T. The PIU staff will be
assigned to project related responsibilities in addition to their current duties in the HEP and HEP T. All
staff have been previously involved inprocurement, both under the Croatian Public Procurement L a w and
inimplementingprojects financed by other International FinancialInstitutions (IFIs). The PIUis already
participating in the preparation o f the project and in the preparation o f bidding documents for contracts
plannedto be retroactively financing by the Loan.
In November 2005, the Bank team carried out the assessment o f HEP T and considers that the
procurement risk rating o f the agency i s average.       As HEP T has adequate capacity, hiring of a
procurement consultant i s not planned.       No particular training o f the staff involved in the project
implementation i s envisaged. A project launch workshop will take place in Zagreb shortly following the
effectiveness o f the Loan. In this workshop, there will be procurement training which will include
preparation o f bidding documents for each procurement method, bid and proposal evaluation, and
contract preparation.

C. ProcurementPlan

The Procurement Plan provides the basis for the procurement methods and identification o f contracts
subject to prior review by the Bank. The Procurement Plan will be available at HEP T's web-site. It will
also be available in the project's database and in the Bank's external website.           The format of the
Procurement Plan may be modified during the course o f the project implementation to help the PIU to
plan and monitor procurement activities. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the
Bank annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs.

                           CROATIA: DISTRICT HEATING PROJECT

Economic Analysis

A cost benefit analysis was performed for the proposed investment programs inZagreb and Osijek. The
analysis compares the economic costs o f the project scenario to the scenario without the project. The
investment costs assumed for the calculations are HRK 186.5 and HRK 54.8 million in Zagreb and
Osijek, respectively. These costs do not include taxes. The estimated economic rate of return for the
Zagreb and Osijek components are 18.4% and 12.0%, respectively.

The benefits o f DSMhave not been taken into account as the D S M Programto be implemented by HEP T
i s not yet in place. However, the D S M measures will result in savings o f 10-20% in energy consumption
at the apartment level, as demonstrated in the pilot program in Zagreb. This will result in fuel savings,
yielding a higher economic rate o f return on the project compared to the numbers mentioned above. The
assumed incremental benefits for the economic analysis are:

     0   Savings in fuel cost: The reduction o f energy losses i s based on the rehabilitation program and
         the use o f new pre-insulated pipelines. The reduction o f energy losses due to the project are:
         Zagreb - 20 GWh (2007) and 55 GWh (2010); and Osijek - 1GWh (2007) and 7 GWh (2010).
         An economic gas price o f 200/1000m3 has been assumed to estimate the fuel savings due to the
         reduction inenergy loss.

     0   Savings in treated water cost: The water leakage in Zagreb i s large where the water volume o f
         the DH system i s changed over 25 times per year, compared to once in the Scandinavian DH

         324,000 tons (2010); and Osijek - 11,000 tons (2007) and 30,000 tons (2010). An economic price
         systems. The reduction o f water losses due to the project are: Zagreb - 108,000 tons (2007) and

         o f HRK 18/m3for chemically treated water has been used for the analysis.

     0   Savings in repair and maintenance costs: The repair costs o f the DH networks are high and
         expected to grow if the project i s delayed. The repair costs will reduce with the installation o f
         new pipes and the costs savings are estimated to be: Zagreb - HRK 2.0 million (2007) and HRK
         4.4 million (2010); and Osijek -HRK 3.7 million (2007) and HRK 0.3 million (2010). InOsijek,
         under a no project scenario, a major rehabilitation cost (HRK 3.3 million) o f the boilers i s
          included in 2007. In a project scenario, as the boilers will be shut down, there will be no such
         rehabilitation costs.

     0   Additional electricity generated by switchingthe DH network connection from local boilers
         to the Osijek CHP plant, in some parts of the city: The supply o f 5.6 MW o f heat will switch
          from the local boilers to the CHP plant. Inthe CHP plant in Osijek, with every MWh of heat
          generation, an additional 0.39 MWho f electricity will be generated. The electricity generated in
         the Osijek CHP plant (efficiency o f 85%) is more economic comparedto the electricity produced
          in a standard condensing plant (efficiency o f 38%).   This difference in the cost o f generating
          electricity between the Osijek CHP plant and a standard condensing plant will benefit the
          economy and i s taken into account. The annual savings are estimated to be HRK 0.9 million.

     0    Savings due to switching customers from steam to DH in Osijek: The steam system,
          supplying6 MW o f heat, is outdated and the project will switch the steam consumers to the hot
          water system. Once this switching i s completed, the steam system will shut down which will

         result in savings due to reduction in energy losses and repair costs. This saving i s estimated to be
         HRK0.7 millionon anannualbasis.

Sensitivity on Gas Price

Energy savings constitute about 50% and 60% of the annual benefits o f the project inZagreb and Osijek,
respectively. As gas prices play a large factor in determining the magnitude o f the energy savings due to
the project, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out on the economic rate o f return by varying the price
of gas. Under a base case scenario, an economic gas price o f  200/1000m3has been assumed which
results inan ERR of 17.0% for the entire project. This base price has been increased and reducedby 20%
to show the impact on the ERR. The table below summarizes the results.

FinancialAnalysis

For HEP and HEP T, historical and projected financial statements, together with a summary o f
performance indicators, are presented inTables 1 to 5 o f this Annex. Inaccordance with HEP's request
for confidentiality for some aspects of its financial operations, including details o f input purchase prices
and composition of the investment program, these details are not included in this Annex, but are available
inthe project files.

HEP (theBorrower)

HEP i s the holding company for a number o f subsidiary companies that cover (i)       electricity generation,
transmission and distribution; (ii)district heating; (ii) gas distribution; and (iv) other activities. As o f
December 31, 2005, HEP had total assets o f about HRK 28,087 million ( 3.8 billion equivalent). About
90% o f HEP's total revenues come from electricity, 6% from district heating, and the remaining 4% from
gas distribution and other activities.

Past and recent financial results: Inrecent years HEPhas been generating an after-tax profit eachyear.
For 2004 (with figures for 2003 in parentheses), HEP had total revenues o f HRK 8,616 million (HRK
8,217 million), operating profit o f HRK 610 million (HRK 181 million) and net after-tax profit o f HRK
439 million (HRK 30 million). In 2005, the average electricity tariff was about HRK 0.555kWh (
0.08kWh). For 2005, HEP had sales revenues o f HRK 9,653 million, an operating profit o f HRK 544
million, and a net after-tax profit of HRK 441 million. Revenue collection performance has improved in
recent years with the collection ratio (annual collections/annual billings) reaching about 100% in 2003,
2004 and 2005, but this also includes collection o f overdue amounts from earlier years. Due to the
improved collection, the total amount o f overdue receivables accumulated prior to 2003, has been
declining. HEP also plans to reduce its current liabilities, thereby improving its current ratio (current
assets/current liabilities) which was about 0.9 in 2004 and 2005.           The operating ratio (operating
expenses/collected revenues) and the working ratio (operating expenses excluding depreciatiodcollected
revenues), which measure operating efficiency, were 0.96 and 0.77 respectively in 2005 (0.93 and 0.72 in
2004).   Although HEP's internal cash generation has been strong, it has been undertalung a large
investment program averaging about HRK 2 billion per year inthe last three years. To help finance this
program, HEP has increased its medium and long-term borrowings. Nevertheless, HEP's debt service
coverage ratio (2.5) and the debt to equity ratio (28:72) remain at adequate levels.

Future performance: HEP has been preparing a rolling four-year Business Plan that is updated each
year. Under the current Business Plan, HEP i s projecting continued profitable operations for the period
up to 2007 with an annual increase o f 3.6% in electricity demand. Beyond 2007, HEP is expected to
continue to have profitable operations with steady improvements in the key financial indicators -
operating ratio, working ratio, current ratio, and debt service coverage (Annex 9; Table 1). The financial
appraisal indicates that HEP will be able to i s able to meet its obligations towards the Bank under the
project.

HEP T (the Sub-borrower and Beneficiary)

HEP T provides DH services in Zagreb and Osijek and under a lease agreement with HEP it purchases
heat and steam from HEP's CHP plants. As o f December 31,2004, HEP T had total assets o f about HRK
791 million ( 109million).

Past and recent financial results: For 2004 (with figures for 2003 in parentheses), HEP T had total
revenues o f HRK 530 million (HRK 493 million), an operating loss o f H E 18 million (HRK 40 million)
and an overall loss of HRK 18 million (HRK 28 million). For 2005, HEP T had total revenues o f HRK


                                                      35

528 million, and an operating loss o f HRK 60 million. The losses are the result o f inadequate tariffs that
have not kept pace with the increasing cost o f heat and other inputs. HEPT has also built up large arrears
o f payables to HEP for heat and steam purchases, amounting to about HRK 175 million at the end o f
2005. At prevailing levels o f tariffs, HEP T i s not able to cover its annual depreciation charges or to
reduce its arrears of payables to HEP. Inaddition, HEP T will not be able to provide its share o f the local
counterpart financing for the project unless tariffs are increased appropriately. HEP T's annual revenue
collection ratio (annual collections/annual billings) i s about 99% but this reflects also collection o f some
arrears fromprevious years.

Future performance: HEP T's tariffs will need to be progressively increased to generate adequate
internal finds to cover its operating expenses, debt service, local counterpart financing needs o f the
project, and progressive elimination o f the payment arrears to HEP. It i s estimated that, in the period
2005 to 2010, heat and steam tariffs will have to be raised inreal terns by about 27% for Zagreb and 29%
for Osijek (Annex 9, Table 3). Although HEP T plans to increase tariffs, the Government ultimately
decides on the tariff level. Thus, provisions will be included in the Guarantee Agreement for the
Government to facilitate an increase o f tariffs proposed by HEPT. Financial covenants for HEP and HEP
T related to the project are mentioned insection D1o fthis document.

FinancialRate of Return

The financial rates of return (FRR) have been estimated based on financial prices, including taxes and
duties where applicable (Annex 9, Table 5). The main incremental benefits under the project are from
fuel savings, water loss reductions, and reductions in repair costs. The FRRs are estimated at 15.5% for
the Zagreb component, 5.9% for the Osijek component, and 13.8% for the two combined. As district
heating i s a basic necessity, the FRR i s not the most appropriate measure for assessing the worth of the
project. Rather, the project should be measured by its economic benefits that have been discussed earlier
inthis Annex. However, the FRRsare adequate to enable HEPT to meets its financial obligations under
the project.

                                  Annex 10: SafeguardPolicyIssues
                           CROATIA: DISTRICT HEATINGPROJECT


This project is classified as an environmental category Bproject, as per Bank's policies. To this en1 HEP
T has prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) acceptable to the Bank. The EMP was
discussed at public meetings in Osijek and Zagreb on December 7 and 13, 2005, respectively, and i s
available at HEP T's internet site and the Bank's Infoshop. The environmental concerns raised for the
project are mainly during construction. As part o f project implementation, HEP T will implement the
recommendation o f the EMP by making sure that the contractor carries out the following environmental
impact mitigationmeasures inline with Croatian legislation:


    0   traffic disturbance - construction should be carried out when traffic i s light. Further, proper
        traffic safety measures, in consultation with the local officials and the police, should be taken by
        markingroads, installing fences, and usingtemporary traffic lights;


    0   air pollution-the ground should be sprinkled with water to minimize highair pollution;


    0   silt run-off - sediments/silt arising from construction should not be rinsed off-site and will not
        block a storm drain or waterway; and


    0   noise pollution- equipment that meet noise pollution levels should be used and the construction
         should be carried out duringthe day.


A Land Acquisition Framework (Framework for Real Estate Acquisition and Establishment o f the Right
of Servitude) has also been developed which will be implementedby HEP T, in case the activities o f the
project require land acquisition. It i s unlikely that land will have to be acquired as HEP T already has the
right of way for the existing network that will be rehabilitated. This framework is available at HEP T's
website.
