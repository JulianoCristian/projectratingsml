The\n            International Development Association (IDA) accepted the\n            risk of dealing with a new institution and maintained its\n            role in the long process of institution building, making\n            adequate provisions in the project for engineering support\n            to WASA with design and construction advice, and for a\n            management team to assist in operations and training. The\n            Bank was aware of the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA)\n            inherent problems at the time of appraisal, but possibly\n            underestimated the effect. Too much faith was given to the\n            inputs of engineering consultants to overcome many of these\n            problems. This project confirms the importance of adequate\n            project preparation. For more effective project execution,\n            it might have been appropriate to extend or intensify the\n            assistance of external consultants, but then the effect of\n            learning by doing may have been less than desired for WASA."}, "docdt": "1986-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
