                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In March 2011, the Government of Nigeria requested an extension of the project's closing date extension. An amount of US$18.8 millions is remaining, and the Government has
                         requested the project's restructuring and funds reallocation to allow for the completion of some on-going activities as well as finance some new ones which will contribute to the
                         achievement of the project's development objectives.
