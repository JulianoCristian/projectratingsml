{"cdata!": "The overall outcome for the Second\n            Adaptable Program Loan (APL) for the West and Central Africa\n            Air Transport Safety and Security Project for Nigeria was\n            moderately satisfactory. The risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; the Bank's performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and the borrower's performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. The overall outcome is rated\n            moderately satisfactory, due to: (a) the relevance of the\n            project development objective and project design and\n            implementation to the Bank's current country\n            partnership strategy and regional integration assistance\n            strategy, national, regional, and global priorities; (b) the\n            moderately satisfactory achievement of the project\n            development objective; and (c) the satisfactory efficiency\n            of the project. The project development objective was not\n            revised at any time during project implementation and the\n            key indicators and components remained unchanged. Other\n            significant changes included Closing date was extended twice\n            and government-funded activities were however not carried\n            out under the project, but they were implemented, with some\n            adjustments, using parastatal agency funding. Another\n            significant change was the declaration of misprocurement for\n            the acquisition of two ILS/VOR/DME6 systems. Lessons learned\n            in relation to project preparation and design are the\n            following: 1) need to adequately address in project design\n            the lack of managerial autonomy of beneficiary entities; 2)\n            political economy context; 3) flexibility in a dynamic\n            environment; 4) do not underestimate bureaucratic processing\n            timeline; 5) need for robust procurement assessments and\n            technical assistance to ensure that project activities can\n            be procured efficiently and in a timely fashion; and 6) need\n            to simplify project design in a complex and challenging\n            implementation environment."}, "docdt": "2014-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
