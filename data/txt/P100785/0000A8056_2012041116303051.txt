                         Abuja and Lagos Airports; as well as the three remaining studies, related to the design and supervision of installation of central ICT system for NCAA and NAMA, plus the security
                         upgrade for NCAA) would need an extra eight additional months beyond the project closing date to be satisfactorily completed. Only the procurement process for the acquisition of
                         meteorological equipment remains to be launched, for expected delivery/installation by February 2013.
                         As of mid-March 2012, the project has disbursed US$29.2 million (which represents a disbursement rate of about 65%), and the remaining uncommitted funds are US$11.8 million.
