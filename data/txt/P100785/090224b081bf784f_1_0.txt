                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the project’s last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report before the project’s May 31, 2013 closing date. The only key remaining activities are a few training in air
                         transport safety and security oversight and operations for the technical staff atthe five beneficiary agencies (NCAA, NCAT, FAAN, NAMA, and NIMET) to enhance and maintain their
                         capabilities, as well as the crisis exercises at the key four international airports. The recruitment of external individual consultants who will validate the updated results of the latest
                         ICAO safety and security audits is on-going and the results of their analysis are expected by the project’s closing date.
