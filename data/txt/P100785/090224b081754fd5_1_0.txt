                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After the recent spate of air crashes involving Nigerian registered airlines, the Government and the World Bank recognized that urgent support to Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority
                         (NCAA) is required in order to further strengthen the air safety and security oversight, and to help the country to keep its US FAA IASA Category 1 certification. To this end, the
                         Government is expected to re-submit a new request for the reallocation of the project's remaining funds (about US$11 million) and continue the intensive training for NCAA staff,

                         to complete the airlines' AOC (Air Operator Certificate) recertification process. Thus, far the request from the Government to re-locate funds has not been received.
