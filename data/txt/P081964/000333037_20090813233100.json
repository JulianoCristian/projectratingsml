  Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration Project for\n            Burundi were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: improved\n            demobilization center counseling and sensitization.\n            Counseling must be better tailored to the profile of each\n            ex-combatant, and classes are more practical than\n            theoretical. Associations can be an important means to\n            social reintegration and economic security. They are also\n            another possible means of reinforcing sustainability and\n            mainstreaming reintegration support, since associations can\n            also apply for support via other development programs and\n            initiatives. Spouses and families should be encouraged to\n            participate at some or all stages of reintegration support\n            (activity choice, training, and implementation) by all\n            implementing partners. The involvement of spouses and\n            families in reintegration activities has been shown to\n            increase the chances of their sustainability, but spousal\n            involvement in Burundi has been low. This issue must be\n            addressed in a more coherent manner. Possibilities for\n            community involvement and support should also be identified.\n            Promote labor-intensive public works for reintegration\n            activities and establish monitoring mechanisms at the\n            implementing partners' level to continuously assess the\n            economic opportunities in the community of resettlement."}, "docdt": "2009-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
