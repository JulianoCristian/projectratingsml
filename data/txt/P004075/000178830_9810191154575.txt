KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The proposed Heavy Machinery Project will form part of the Changwon
Industrial Complex which is located near the Masan harbor on the southeastern
coast of the Korean peninsula. At full production, the Project will have an
annual output of 100,000 tons of machinery (worth about US$400 million in
real 1976 terms) which will primarily be destined for Korean steel, power,
chemical and petrochemical plants, and which is expected to constitute about
40% of the country's capital equipment requirements in these industries in
the mid-1980's; the remainder will continue to be imported. The Government
of Korea has selected the privately-held Hyundai International Inc. (HII) as
the company best qualified to implement this high priority and complex project
and has asked the Bank to help finance it with a loan of US$80 million equiva-
lent; if approved this would be the first direct Bank loan to industry in
Korea.
ii.       The machinery building industry in Korea has grown at a rapid pace,
with production increasing at an average rate of 28% in real value terms
between 1972-76. Within the industry, Korea has been concentrating attention
on light manufacturing activities so that in the more capital-intensive areas,
such as manufacture of heavy plant and equipment, the country has remained
highly import-dependent. Under the fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) the in-
dustry is now receiving further increasing emphasis and is projected to grow
at an annual average rate of 22%, supported by a number of measures and an
investment of US$1.85 billion. The rapid growth in the past has led to a
shallow structure with a number of companies engaged in small and medium-scale
low technology activities. The formulation of an overall framework for
rational development of the industry with due emphasis on high technology
capital goods manufacture is underway. The Project will be the first in
Korea to enter the manufacture of the very heavy class of advanced technology
plant and equipment.
iii.      The Project has been well prepared by HII in consultation with
its overseas consultants and licensors. Though it is designed primarily to
supply the three target markets, its manufacturing facilities will be highly
flexible and capable of producing a wide range of heavy and technologically-
advanced equipment. The Project will comprise forge, foundry, machining,
fabrication, assembly, test and support facilities and include a number of
large and complex items of machinery.
iv.       HII will be responsible for the implementation of the Project and
with the support of outside assistance in selected areas such as heavy machin-
ing, assembly, forge and foundry operations, the management of the Company is
capable of executing the Project efficiently. HII is one of eight Hyundai
Group Companies which - starting from a small beginning in the 1950's - form
the largest business enterprise in Korea and which in 1976 had combined sales
of US$893 million equivalent. The Hyundai Group has established a reputation
for reliable and high-quality work at home and abroad.



- ii -
v.        HII, run by its founder and president, who is one of the leading
businessmen in Korea, also has progressed from a small trading company into
a large manufacturing and worldwide tramping operation, and is supported
by sound and dynamic management. The Company's activities include shipping,
automotive parts production at its Anyang plant, and machinery building at
its Gunpo plant; the Gunpo plant was recently expanded, assisted by loans
from the Asian Development Bank and the US Exim Bank, to permit manufacture
of machine tools as well as construction and industrial machinery. The
Project will extend HII's operations into the heavy manufacturing sector and
forms part of a further major expansion of the Company's activities which,
in real 1976 terms, are forecast to increase from US$47 million in sales
in 1976 to US$623 million in 1983, when the Project is expected to be in
full production.
vi.       Total financing requirements of the Project to bring it to full
production are estimated at US$422 million, of which about half would be
needed in foreign exchange. These requirements would be met by an issue of
new shares (US$63 million equivalent); cash generation from the Company's
operations (141); a Government loan (79); foreign bilateral (47) and foreign
commercial bank credits (12); and the Bank loan (80). The Bank loan would
finance the CIF costs of imported equipment, spares, structural steel and
technical assistance, all to be procured in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines.
vii.      HII plans to sell its products in line with prices of comparable
imports. The Company's and the Hyundai Group's past experience, the tie-in
with reputable licensors and competitive prices, based on low cost and efficient
labor, coupled with appropriate support from the Government, are expected to
assure an adequate starting position in the market. HII will strengthen its
existing marketing organization along product-lines to support the Project and
to maintain close contact with potential customers and relevant Government
agencies from the earliest stages of identification of projects in the target
market sectors. Though the Project analysis is based only on domestic sales,
HII plans to make an early start in export marketing of turnkey plants, as it
is already doing successfully with cement plants.
viii.     The products proposed for manufacture and the planned manufacturing
processes represent technologies largely new to Korea. The extent to which
the Company is able to capture a significant share of the Korean market and
do so quickly, presents a major potential Project risk and will depend on
how rapidly it can adopt these new technologies and use them efficiently.
With regard to the initial market acceptance of the products to be manufac-
tured under the Project, the Government will support the Project so that its
facilities are utilized to the fullest extent possible during the early stages
of operations.  As for the transfer of technology, HII has already concluded
licensing agreements with manufacturers in Australia, France, Germany, Japan
and the U.S., who are amongst the leaders in their fields. The Company has
also prepared and is further developing a comprehensive program of technical
assistance, overseas and domestic training and recruitment of experienced
expatriate staff. These factors and HII's intention of bidding early con-
tracts jointly with licensors and only gradually building up the local content



- iii -
of its products commensurate with its objective of maintaining high quality
standards for its products from the outset are expected to largely alleviate
the risk associated with effective transfer of complex technology and initial
market penetration in Korea.
ix.       Other risks relate to adverse effects on the market through reduced
economic growth or a shift in Government development emphasis, and provision
of adequate sales financing to support Project sales. A weakness in the
market is considered unlikely in view of the strong past performance of the
Korean economy and the Government's well advanced planning; also it could be
partially offset by export sales. As regards sales financing, the Government
has agreed to take the needs of the Project into account in the formulation
and implementation of sector plans in this area.
x.        As must be expected when adding such a substantial Project to con-
siderably smaller existing operations, the Company's financial position
remains tight through Project implementation and so will debt service coverage
through the first two years after mechanical completion (1980 and 1981) as
Project operations are not expected to break even until after 1981; thereafter
all financial indicators are expected to improve rapidly. Cash generation
from existing operations will be one of the major contributors to funds
requirements of the Project and potential shortfalls clearly pose a financial
risk. HII is a closely-held company and the shareholders will guarantee the
provision of any additional funds that may be needed to complete the Project
as planned and bring it to profitable operations. Mlajor shortfalls could
strain the capacity of existing shareholders and the Government has agreed to
provide a second line of guarantee. In view of the perceived risk associated
with the Project, an equity offering to the public is not considered realistic
at this time. On the other hand, Hyundai Construction Co. Ltd., which owns
44% of HII's shares, is expected to go public in 1977. Accordingly, HII will
achieve a measure of indirect public ownership at an early stage. The Company
will open ownership to the public with an equity issue as the Project achieves
normal operations.
xi.       The most significant contribution of the Project will be the de-
velopment of the machinery industry and the upgrading of the Korean techno-
logical base into precision heavy manufacturing. The impact would range far
beyond HII, to a number of smaller supplying industries by providing them an
opportunity, with HII assistance, to enter into the production of more so-
phisticated products, requiring new technologies and advanced manufacturing
methods. The Project's financial rate of return in real 1976 terms is esti-
mated at 15.2% pre-tax and 12.2% after tax; the economic rate of return
is higher at 17.4%.  At the steady state of operations the Project would
also annually result in US$210 million in foreign exchange savings and US$47
million equivalent in cash flow to the Government, in real 1976 terms.
xii.      Based on agreements reached with HII and the Government, which are
summarized at the end of this report, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan
to the Government of Korea of US$80 million equivalent for onlending to HII
for a period of 14 years, including four years grace. Interest will be at
8.2%, plus a 2% guarantee fee to be paid by HII to the Government.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a heavy machinery project to be located at
Changwon on the southeastern coast of the Republic of Korea, the first of
its kind in that country. The Project would produce, under license from
reputed international manufacturers, a wide range of plant and equipment
primarily for the steel, power-generation and chemical/petrochemical sec-
tors. At full production, scheduled to be achieved in 1983, its annual
output would comprise 100,000 tons of machinery, valued at around US$400
million in mid-1976 prices. The Project is primarily planned to meet do-
mestic needs, although it has potential for future exports. Based on the
Government's development plans, it would supply about 40% of the plant
and equipment requirements of Korea's steel, power-generation and chemical/
petrochemical sectors in the mid-80's.
1.02      In view of the importance the Government attaches to the develop-
ment of the heavy machinery manufacturing sector, it has asked Hyundai Inter-
national Inc. (HII) to execute this complex project based on HII's existing
capabilities and record of achievements. The total financing requirements of
the Project are estimated at about US$422 million, and the proposed Bank loan
of US$80 million is to finance about 39% of the Project's foreign exchange
requirements of US$206 million.
1.03      Following submission of the loan application to the Bank by the
Economic Planning Board in April 1976, a reconnaissance mission visited
Korea in July 1976 and a final feasibility report prepared jointly by HII
and its consultants, Ingersoll Manufacturing Consultants (IMC), was sub-
mitted to the Bank in November 1976. The Project was appraised in November
1976, by a mission consisting of Messrs. Nayar (Chief), Greig and Sood of the
Industrial Projects Department and Messrs. Balakrishnan and Choi (Consultants)
as well as Messrs. Josiah (East Asia and Pacific) and Soussan (Legal). A
final mission to update information in certain areas visited Korea in March
1977. Project evolution up to the presentation to the Executive Directors, in
June 1977, is given in Annex 1.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Hyundai Group
2.01      Hyundai International Inc. is one of eight companies each owned,
either fully or partially, by members of the Chung family. However, each of
the companies is incorporated as a separate legal entity and the Hyundai Group
itself has no distinct legal status under Korean law. In 1976, combined sales
of the eight companies amounted to US$893 million, with pre-tax earnings of
US$13 million (a loss of Hyundai Shipbuilding reduced Group profits from the
US$42 million recorded in 1975). Together, the Hyundai Group is the largest
private industrial group in Korea, and is the country's greatest single source
of export earnings.
2.02      The most important companies in the Group are:  Hyundai Construc-
tion, which is Korea's largest construction company with a reputation which



- 2 -
has allowed it to win major contracts worldwide, particularly in the Middle
East; Hyundai Motor, the largest automobile manufacturer in Korea; and Hyundai
Shipbuilding which operates one of the world's major shipyards. The Group's
other activities include: construction operations in Guam (Hyundai America);
the manufacture of cement (Hyundai Cement) and other building products (Keum
Kang Asbestos); ship repairing (Hyundai Mipo Dockyard); and, under HII, the
manufacture of auto parts, construction machinery, and industrial equipment.
Further information on the Group's operations, ownership structure, and
financial statistics is contained in Annex 2-1.
B.   The Company
2.03      HII was established in 1962 by its president, Mr. In Yung Chung,
to conduct international trading operations for the Hyundai Group. It later
diversified its activities into shipping, and the manufacture of auto parts,
castings, forgings and construction equipment (paras 2.09 to 2.12). Trading
activities ceased in 1973. Total share capital, as of December 31, 1976,
amounted to Won 6 billion (US$12.4 million) divided into 600,000 common
shares with a par value of Won 10,000 each. At present 50.9% of the shares
are held by Mr. In Yung Chung, and 44.3% by Hyundai Construction Co. Ltd.
2.04      Under the "Public Offering Inducement Act", the Government encour-
ages large business corporations to offer their shares to the general public
and may even order them to do so if it considers this to be in the public
interest. Three companies in the Hyundai Group - Keum Kang Asbestos, Hyundai
Motor, and Hyundai Cement - made public offerings of their shares in 1973,
1974 and 1975.   General public ownership in them is now 78%, 58%, and 49%
respectively. A fourth company in the Group, Hyundai Construction, is sched-
uled to go public in 1977. Since the construction company owns 44% of HII's
shares, a measure of indirect public ownership in HII will be achieved at
that time. It is the Company's desire, fully supported by the Government,
to open HII to direct public ownership once the Project becomes profitable
and reaches steady state operations. In this regard, HII has agreed that,
by July 1, 1983, it will have met all the requirements to become a "widely-
held corporation" as defined under Korean law. By this date, no more than
51% of HII's shares may be held by a single shareholder or related individ-
uals, and at least 40% of HII's shares must be owned by shareholders, each
owning less than 1% of the shares.
C.   Organization and Management
2.05      HII's present organizational structure is given in Annex 2-2.
The Company's Board is made up of 20 directors, consisting of members of
the Chung family and top management of HII. The president and founder of
HII, Mr. In Yung Chung, is one of Korea's leading businessmen and has a
long career of successful management and entrepreneurship, as demonstrated
by his performance at HII and his role in the establishment and development
of other companies in the Hyundai Group.
2.06      Reporting directly to Mr. Chung, and responsible for the Company's
day-to-day operations are six senior directors, one each for: (a) manufac-
turing operations, which are conducted at plants at Anyang and Gunpo; (b) per-
sonnel administration, finance and accounting; (c) marketing of standard pro-
ducts, such as auto parts, castings and forgings, and construction machinery;
(d) marketing of textile, cement and paper-making plant and equipment; (e)



operation of the Company's shipping division, the Korea Atlas Line; and (f)
implementation of the Project. Details of the Project management and organi-
zation are given in Chapter VI of this report.
2.07      The quality of HII's management and staff is high, and the present
organization is well-designed to meet the Company's existing needs. Once
portions of the Project become operational in 1978, the present organiza-
tional structure will be modified to set up vice-presidencies for the three
operational divisions (Gunpo/Anyang, Changwon, and Shipping) and one each for
the centralized functions of Finance, Marketing, and Administration. The pro-
posed structure after Project completion (Annex 2-3) is considered suitable.
D.   Accounting and Audit
2.08      HII's accounting and management information systems produce accu-
rate and up-to-date information and allow effective control of the Company's
operations. Accounts have been audited since 1973. In 1976, HII appointed
San Kyong & Company, a member firm of Touche Ross International, to conduct
the annual audit. The firm is approved by the Ministry of Finance to per-
form audits of companies traded on the Korean Stock Exchange and is auditor
for a number of institutions to which the Bank has made loans. Agreement was
reached that audited accounts will be presented to the Bank within four months
of the close of each fiscal year, and unaudited quarterly financial statements
within 45 days.
E.   Present Operations
2.09      HII's present activities are divided into manufacturing and ship-
ping operations. Manufacturing is conducted at the Company's plants at Anyang
and Gunpo, both of which are located about 30 km from the center of Seoul.
The Anyang plant was constructed in 1965 to produce stainless steel table-
ware, but has undergone a number of expansions since then and is now chiefly
involved in the production of automobile parts such as electric motors, shock
absorbers, engine radiators, and steering mechanisms (among other items) which
are sold to Hyundai Motor as well as other local automobile manufacturers.
The Anyang plant accounted for about 31% of HII's annual sales in 1976.
2.10      The Company's Gunpo facility was established in 1970 to produce
iron and steel castings. A machine shop and forging plant were added in
1972 allowing the Company to enter into the production of a variety of con-
struction equipment (including cranes, bulldozers, forklift trucks, and ex-
cavators) under license from a number of U.S. and Western European manufac-
turers.  In mid-1975, HII began an extensive expansion of the Gunpo plant
aimed at substantially increasing the Company's production capacity for
construction equipment, castings and forgings, and at providing new facil-
ities for the manufacture of machine tools (lathes and milling machines) and
industrial machinery (textile spinning machinery, and cement and paper-making
equipment). The expansion which was assisted by loans from the ADB (US$17.5
million) and the U.S. Exim Bank (US$7.6 million) is expected to be completed
in June 1977, three months ahead of schedule. Experience gained from the
Gunpo project, as regards its cost, timing, and efficiency of the local labor
force, has been used in developing the cost and implementation schedules for



- 4 -
the Project. In 1976, the Gunpo plant accounted for 54% of HII's sales. This
percentage will increase significantly as production from the new facilities
reaches full output by 1979.
2.11      The remaining 15% of HII's revenues derive from its shipping opera-
tions, the Korea Atlas Line, which owns and operates four ocean-going cargo
vessels. These ships are leased on a spot or time charter basis for the
transport of goods between Korea/Japan and the west coast of the U.S. Details
of HII's present activities and the licensing arrangements under which it
conducts its manufacturing operations are given in Annex 2-4 and Annex 2-5
respectively.
2.12      HII has no subsidiaries and each of its three present operations,
as described above, are operated as divisions of the Company. The Company
agreed that subsidiary companies will not be set up and assets transferred
thereto without prior consent of the Bank.
F.   Past Performance and Financial Position
2.13      While recent expansions of the Company's facilities (paras. 2.09
and 2.10) have resulted in a dramatic increase in sales, from Won 2.0 bil-
lion (US$4 million equivalent) to Won 23.1 billion (US$47 million) between
1972 and 1976, this has yet to be fully reflected in higher earnings. The
addition of new product lines, associated start-up costs, and the necessity
of having had to rely heavily in the early years on bought-out parts, resulted
in declining manufacturing gross profit margins between 1972 and 1975. This
trend was only reversed in 1976 after higher manufacturing sales had allowed
HII to produce in-house formerly bought-out parts and to realize savings
through more efficient usage and purchasing of raw materials. Even so, 1976
earnings were still below what might otherwise be considered normal due to
extraordinary expenses on account of the build-up of labor, engineering and
administrative staff in anticipation of the start up of the Gunpo expansion
in mid 1977. Gross profit margins on shipping operations are subject to
fluctuations in international charter rates and thus have shown substantial
swings.
2.14      About 37% of HII's sales in 1976 were to Group companies and
were primarily represented by auto parts and construction machinery sold
to Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Construction respectively. Less than 5% of
HII's purchases are from Group companies. In order to ensure that such
intra-group transactions are made at fair market value, and that the Bank
is informed of these and other transfers of funds, assets and goods between
HII and other Group companies, agreement was obtained from the Company
that separate accounts of such transactions will be maintained and audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Also, agreement was obtained
from the shareholders that, if the Group were to set up its own "export
window agency", sales by HII through such an agency would require prior
consent of the Bank.

a/   Based on taxes actually paid.  In 1975, HII was assessed for taxes
due on prior years.
2.16      HII's present financial position is reasonably sound.  HII's current
and debt/equity ratios, at year-end 1976, were slightly above the maximums
permissable under the project agreement with the ADB (1.2:1 and 70:30 respec-
tively). HII's shareholders have agreed to meet the 70:30 debt/equity ratio
as a condition of loan effectiveness. While such a ratio is high by Western



- 6 -
standards, it is not overly so by Korean practice. Average turnovers of
current assets and liabilities in 1976 were satisfactory and are estimated as
follows: accounts receivable (40 days), inventories (90 days) and accounts
payable (90 days).
G.   Future Expectations of Existing Operations
2.17      As noted above, with the Gunpo expansion coming on stream in mid
1977, and with minor rearrangement and upgrading of facilities at Anyang,
production capacity for all the Company's product lines will significantly
expand and new products will be added (Annex 2-4). Overall, it is estimated
that HII's sales from existing manufacturing operations will increase from
Won 19.5 billion in 1976 to Won 135 billion in 1979. This target is consid-
ered realistic since, in most areas, Hl's output will substitute for pres-
ent imports and the Company will be the sole domestic supplier with competi-
tion limited to imports which are regulated through imposition of duties
and/or quantity restrictions, depending on product priority and local manu-
facturing capability. Details of the market, sales and financial projec-
tions for the Company's existing operations are given in Annexes 2-8 and 2-9.
III. THE MARKET
A.   Industrial Development
3.01      Korea has established an outstanding record of growth in the recent
past, with aggregate real GNP increasing at an average rate of around 10% per
year since 1962. This growth has been based to a large extent on the expan-
sion of exports of manufactured goods and has resulted in a transformation of
the structure of the Korean economy. The manufacturing sector has grown about
twice as fast as GNP and in 1975 accounted for 32% of GNP as against 12% in
1961. The growth in net manufactured exports from less than 1% of GNP in 1962
to 10.7% in 1975 has been accompanied by a change in the export product mix
towards more sophisticated and higher value-added products; details are pro-
vided in Annex 3-1.
3.02      The change in export product mix is reflected in a structural change
in the manufacturing sector itself. While heavy and chemical industries have
gained in importance, food processing industries declined. The most notable
recent increase within the manufacturing sector has been in machinery build-
ing, electronics and shipbuilding - the so-called machinery sector - which
increased from 9.3% of gross manufacturing output in 1971 to 14.6% in 1975.
In 1975, these industries accounted for around 4% of GNP.
B.   The Machinery Sector and Industry
3.03      The machinery sector has been the focus of development attention
since the sixties; between 1971 and 1975 it registered annual average growth
rates in current prices of 44% in terms of production and 66% in exports



(about 28% and 50% in real terms). It has also gained in employment gene-
ration and in 1975 accounted for 23% of employment in the entire manufactur-
ing sector. Much of this growth is attributable to the electronics and
shipbuilding industries, which together accounted for 50% of the sector's
1975 output and 67% of its exports. Machinery building, though it has lagged
behind electronics and shipbuilding in export performance, has nonethaless
performed remarkably, with production increasing at an annual average rate of
44% in current terms (around 28% in real terms) between 1972-76.

c/   Estimates for 1976
Source: MCI; Korea Society for the Advancement of Machine Industry
3.04      The machinery building industry can be further categorized into
four subsectors: general machinery, electrical machinery, transport equip-
ment and precision machinery. Of these the general machinery subsector,
which includes industrial machinery and plant equipment and is the most capi-
tal-intensive, in 1976 contributed only 21% of the output of the machinery
building industry and remains highly import-dependent (74% in 1976). Gener-
ally, Korea initiated its development of industrial activities at the lower
end of capital-intensity where it enjoys a comparative advantage in export
markets. In view of the extreme heterogeneity of the products and largely
private ownership, centralized investment planning has been difficult. Con-
sequently, the general machinery subsector comprises a large number of frag-
mented concerns engaged in light and medium-scale, low technology operations.
3.05      Under the fourth Plan (1977-81), machinery building and electronics
are receiving increased planning and investment emphasis. The machinery build-
ing industry itself is projected to require investments of US$1.85 billion
during the Plan period and to grow at an annual average rate of 22%, with
exports increasing to US$1.4 billion by 1981 from only US$0.3 billion in 1975.
The measures for support of the industry include: further development of the



- 8 -
Changwon Machinery Industry Complex (Project location); increased local con-
tent of domestically produced plant and equipment; direct assistance to 500
existing medium and small-scale enterprises; increased training of scientists,
engineers and skilled manpower; increased research and development and tech-
nology-inducement incentives; a wide range of investment incentives for for-
eign and domestic enterprises; and financial assistance to machinery manufac-
turers and end-users. The Changwon Complex is located on the southeastern
coast of Korea and is planned to include 104 machinery related units. HII
is one of 49 units that have entered the Complex by end-1976. The further
development of the Complex, the industry and its prospective plans as well
as the above-mentioned support measures are detailed in Annex 3-1.
3.06      The rapid growth of the machinery building industry in the past,
however, has resulted in certain weaknesses. The major issues of concern
that require Government attention are: rationalization of investment; ra-
tional development of Changwon; transfer of technology; research and develop-
ment; upgrading of training programs; development of supply industries; sales
financing; and export strategy (Annex 3-1). In these areas the Government has
carried out a number of studies, planning efforts and also established some
mechanisms. In early 1977, a ministerial committee chaired by the Minister of
the Economic Planning Board (EPB), was established to encourage localization
in the machinery building industry; it has already begun to establish a basic
strategy. While therefore the development of a general framework is underway,
detailed planning and implementation still remains to be worked out. In this
regard, the Government agreed to develop and submit to the Bank by the end of
September 1978, a master plan of action for the machinery building industry to
cover the above-mentioned and other relevant issues, including the setting
of schedules and allocation of responsibilities for its implementation and
thereafter implement such program. In particular, the master plan of action
will take into account the need to provide adequate sales financing mechanisms
sufficient to support the needs of the Project.
C.   Demand for Products to be Manufactured by the Project
3.07      In view of the Government objective of increasing the local content
of domestically produced plant and equipment, it has selected HII to set up
a modern facility for manufacture of such equipment under the Project. The
Project would be the first in Korea planned to manufacture the very heavy
class of advanced-technology plant equipment. The primary target markets
for the Project as described in greater detail in Annex 3-2 are the steel,
power-generation and chemical/petrochemical sectors. The market assessment
is based on firm plans of the Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO) and the
Korea Electric Company (KECO), both Government-owned, as well as other in-
vestments to be carried out under the fourth and fifth Five-Year Plans.
3.08      In the seventies, the requirement for steel in Korea has so far been
increasing at an average rate of 19%, composed of an apparent domestic con-
sumption growth of 14% and export growth of 45%. Domestic consumption is
expected to continue rising rapidly at a rate of around 17% between 1977-81
and 11% thereafter, as steel intensity first increases with industrial de-
velopment but subsequently levels off. Allowing for some uncertainties in
export forecasts, projected to remain at 30% of the total requirement as at



- 9 -
present, this would result in a demand of 18.0-20.0 million tons of crude
steel in 1986, as against 5.4 million tons in 1976. To meet this demand and
at the same time reduce import dependence, the Government has planned to
expand POSCO's crude steel capacity by 3.0 million tons between 1979-82 at a
fixed investment cost of US$1.3 billion. Part of the equipment component of
US$577 million, consisting of the full range of iron and steel-making as well
as rolling/finishing facilities, will form the market for HII in this sector.
Further additions in crude and finishing capacity, with an estimated equipment
component of around US$1 billion, are projected for the fifth Plan.
3.09      Demand for power in Korea has increased at a dramatic rate of over
20% annually since 1967 and in the future is expected to grow at a slower
pace of around 15% in the fourth Plan and 12% thereafter. In line with this
forecast, KECO has planned an ambitious expansion program involving thermal,
nuclear and hydro plants at a total investment cost of US$7.7 billion over
the next decade. The equipment deriving from this plan, comprising boilers,
turbines, generators and feed-water equipment, would form a steady continuous
market for the Project, and would account for almost 50% of its primary pro-
duct sales.
3.10      Korea's chemical/petrochemical sector has also grown rapidly led
by gains in textile exports. For its requirements of petrochemical products,
the country has largely relied on imports. Under the fourth and fifth Five-
Year Plans, Korea intends to significantly increase its self-sufficiency
through increased refining and petrochemical product capacities based on
expanded naphtha-cracking units, with total investments estimated at US$1.9
billion and US$2.5 billion respectively. Part of the equipment requirements,
primarily comprising fabricated products and process machinery, estimated at
US$1.6 billion over this period will be the market for the Project.
3.11      The investments planned in these sectors under the 4th and 5th Plans
relate reasonably to past investments as shown in the following table. The
large increase in the power sector reflects an effort to simultaneously meet
rapidly growing demand and increase available reserve capacity, and investment
in more expensive nuclear plants.

D.   Demand-Supply Comparison
3.12      The demand for major items of plant equipment in the Project's
three principal target markets has historically been met by imports; these
markets are expected to account for about 80% of the Project's annual sales
value at full production with the remaining 20% shared in about equal parts
by sales of (a) ancillary equipment which, while forming part of the pack-
ages to be sold to the target markets, has not been specifically identified
and (b) jobbing sales consisting of fabricated items and forgings and castings
not related to the three target markets. For the time being, HII is expected
to be the sole domestic primary heavy equipment supplier, the remainder having
to continue to be imported. HII sales will include purchases of subcomponents
from abroad and some peripheral items from local suppliers. The demand and
supply of the Project's three target markets (i.e. those accounting for 80%
of Project's sales) are summarized in the following table.
3.13      The market comprises a number of complex products which are difficult
to define in physical units; it has therefore been assessed in terms of sales
value, derived as a percentage of the value of total investment in the three
target markets. The analysis excludes any consideration of sales to the re-
placement market, exports and machinery and equipment sales to other sectors
even though such sales are possible within the Project design. These would
potentially provide a safety margin over and above the market for HII given in
the table below.

E.   Prices and Competitiveness
3.14      HII will maintain prices at levels that are reasonably related to
its production costs and comparable international price levels. As operating
efficiencies are achieved, once the Project reaches full operations, the
Company plans to share the benefits accruing from such efficiencies with its
customers. The major market risks covered in Annex 3-2 and further discussed
in Chapter VII revolve around initial market acceptance of HII products.
Since such high technology and sophisticated equipment has not previously
been produced in Korea, there is a possibility that there will be some initial
hesitation on the part of potential customers to purchase the products to be
manufactured under the Project. To alleviate this, and subject to the main-
tenance by HII of reasonable pricing and quality standards for Project prod-
ucts, the Government will take all steps necessary on its part to ensure that
Project facilities are utilized to the fullest extent possible for a period of
five years after Project completion. After this initial stage, and once HII
has established the necessary domestic market acceptance, the Company's expe-
rience, its tie-in with reputable licensors, and competitive prices, are
expected to provide it with an adequate position, provided it is given an
equal opportunity to bid. Agreement was reached with the Government that
HII will in fact be given this opportunity.
F.   Marketing Organization and Strategy
3.15      HII has a plant sales department, which comprises 40 staff and is
responsible for sales of plant equipment to be manufactured at Gunpo and under
the Project. In order to adequately support the Project, the Company plans
to increase the strength to over 200 by 1980, and let it draw on its other
technical and operational staff as needed.
3.16      Marketing will continue to be centralized and organized along
product lines with the staff reporting to five managers responsible for:
power plant; chemical plant; steelniaking; textile, paper and pulp plant; and
cement plant and export sales. The Company's approach to domestic marketing
emphasizes two aspects, namely, close contact with relevant Government agencies
and continuous information exchange with customers. HII plans to be involved
from the earliest stages of project identification, providing design and other
information, and seeking inputs in product and licensor selection. It also
plans to discuss, with relevant agencies, issues such as product-standardiza-
tion, setting of localization ratios (i.e. the proportion of local content in
HII's products) and sales-financing arrangements.
3.17      In view of the importance of overall system and component reliabil-
ity in HII's products, the Company intends to rely heavily on its licensor:
particularly in the early years of operation, and to bid the first few con-
tracts jointly with them. Subsequently, it will gradually build up the local
content of the bids in consultation with the licensors and in line with its
own capability and reputation for reliability. This approach is satisfac-
tory.  In this regard, assurances were obtained from the Government that it
will allow the Company to build up the local content only gradually com-
mensurate with the principal objective of maintaining adequate quality for
the Project's products.



-  12 -
3.18      In the early years, the Company plans to concentrate its efforts
on the domestic market but will make an early start in export marketing
capitalizing on the overseas work of its affiliate, Hyundai Construction;
subcontracting requirements of its licensors; and the fact that it already
devotes resources to export of some items including cement plants. Such a
strategy is considered appropriate and is expected to assist entry into
turnkey plant exports as soon as HII has established a strong reputation
at home. Further details of the marketing organization and strategy are
provided in Annex 3-3.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objectives
4.01      The Project, which will be located near the new Masan harbor on
the southeast coast of the Korean peninsula and will form part of the Changwon
Industrial Complex, is well prepared in close cooperation among HII, Ingersoll
Manufacturing Consultants of the U.S. (IMC) and licensors. It is designed
primarily to manufacture most equipment required for steel mills and power,
chemical and petrochemical plants. The Project's manufacturing facilities,
however, will be highly flexible, versatile and capable of producing a wide
range of heavy industrial equipment and machinery with the following character-
istics: large and heavy custom-built equipment; equipment and vessels operat-
ing at high temperatures and pressures; machinery operating at high centrifugal
speeds; equipment requiring extra-thick materials and involving high strength
properties; and facilities requiring high accuracy with close tolerance levels
and rigid performance standards. A detailed description of the Project is
given in Annex 4-1.
4.02      At the steady state of operations to be reached in 1983, the Proj-
ect will have the capacity to produce equipment for (i) 1,000 MW of power
plants each year; (ii) one steel mill with 3.0 million tons per year output
every three years and (iii) chemical and petrochemical plants. Combined
annual output will be around 100,000 tons of machinery and equipment. The
design of the Project recognizes that each of the major products is technic-
ally complex requiring a very high degree of engineering work, manufacturing
skills and significant expertise in testing and assembly. In developing basic
Project parameters, due consideration has been given to factors such as planned
product mix at the steady state of production based on market requirements,
specific product and technology requirements, desirable import substitution
levels, the optimal trade-off between labor and equipment, local supply
capabilities, material flow for products and future expansion requirements.
4.03      To achieve the above objectives, the Project will consist of the
following separate major manufacturing facilities: foundry and forge
shops; two fabrication shops (one for flat steel fabrication and another
for non-flat steel fabrication); two machine shops (one for heavy machining
and the other for light machining); one assembly and test shop; support
facilities such as large heat treatment, grit blasting and painting facil-
ities, X-ray facility, tool room and material handling facilities; and other



-  13 -
auxiliary installations such as electric power, water, compressed air, fuel
oil and gases supply facilities, warehouse, training school, laboratories, and
administrative and other buildings. The plant layout is shown in Annex 4-2.
B.   Prolect Details and Observations
4.04      Based on the needs of the planned product mix, the equipment re-
quirements and configuration were developed. Adequate size and weight capa-
bilities have been included in critical areas of production to match a broad
base of industrial machinery products. The foundry will include one 20-ton
electric arc furnace and one 100-ton electric arc melting furnace; the forge
shop will include one 3,000 ton and one 8,000 ton hydraulic press with necessary
manipulating systems. The forge shop, which is capable of handling up to 200
ton work pieces, will have an average annual capacity of 24,000 tons. Since
the foundry and forge shops are designed on the basis of maximum weight
requirements, these will have some surplus capacity which will be utilized to
meet the local demand for such products. Although these shops will have the
necessary pollution control devices, they will be located in the remote
northeast corner of the plant site to avoid any pollution from dust and fumes
to other production facilities.
4.05      To improve material handling and fabrication efficiency, there
will be two fabrication shops (one for flat steel and the other for non-
flats), which will include machines to handle plates up to 160 mm thickness.
Modern cutting and welding techniques, such as electroslag, MIG and TIG 1/
weldings and plasma arc cutting, will also be utilized in these shops. Since
the raw materials used in the heavy machine shop and light machine shop are
distinctly different, they will be located in two separate buildings. To
minimize the cross flow and handling of materials, the heavy machine shop and
assembly shop will be in one building. The heavy machine shop, which requires
the highest investment in production equipment, is the most crucial facility
in the Project and the success of the Project will greatly depend upon its
efficient operation. This shop will have very large machine tools to handle
large and heavy cubic parts (rolling mill stands, turbine casings, etc.) and
cylindrical parts (rotors, rolls, etc.). Machinery in the light machine shop
is kept to the bare minimum, on account of the light machining capabilities
already available in the country.
4.06      Most of the equipment in the assembly plant will have the maneu-
verability required for assembly and test purposes of various heavy products.
To ensure the flexibility needed to match a constantly changing work load
and product-mix, the fixed facilities in this shop will be kept to a minimum.
The machinery and equipment included in the Project are considered sufficient
to meet the size and capacity for the planned products; no further modifi-
cations are expected as a result of the final review of the facilities by
the consultants (para. 6.03).

C.   Technology and Licensing Agreements
4.07      The products proposed for manufacture under the Project represent
technologies largely new to Korea and are primarily technology and material
intensive. Overall reliability and satisfactory performance of products,
which are essential for the success of the Project, can only be achieved by
upgrading the Korean technological base into precision heavy manufacturing.
Therefore, the Project involves a high level of technology transfer through
licensing agreements with reputed international manufacturers, licensor and
Company training and the use of experienced expatriate personnel. De-
tails of technology transfer are given in Annex 4-3. As mentioned in para.
4.01, the Project is capable of producing most large industrial machinery
and equipment, provided the Company has the necessary licensing agreements
to make such products.
4.08      HII has already concluded licensing agreements with Krupp of Germany
for iron and steel-making equipment, General Electric of the U.S. for turbine-
generator equipment, Combustion Engineering of the U.S. for boilers, Mitsubishi
of Japan for chemical and petrochemical equipment, Creusot-Loire of France for
hydro-pumps and water turbines, Alsthom of France for hydro-generation equip-
ment and Jaques of Australia for crushing equipment as well as manufacturing
agreements with Wean United of the U.S. for steel rolling mills (Annex 4-3).
HII is in the process of negotiating additional agreements with a number of
internationally well-known manufacturers, and has agreed to enter into, to the
satisfaction of the Bank, all licensing agreements required for the purposes
of the Project. In particular, the Company will conclude the necessary (about
10) principal licensing agreements for its three primary product lines before
the end of 1977. By 1983, HII is expected to have about 40 licensing agree-
ments. A top level position, Director of Technology Transfer, is now being
created to ensure that appropriate technology is continued to be acquired and
that its transfer takes place smoothly and effectively (Annex 4-3). Given the
lack of sufficient expertise available in the country, the Company also plans
to appoint experienced expatriates, from the licensors' staff or from similar
facilities, in important line functions for key product groups. To assure
smooth implementation, the Company agreed to develop a detailed program cov-
ering all aspects relating to technology transfer, specifying dates and
staff and organizational responsibilities, and submit it to the Bank before
the end of 1977.
D.   Products and Process Flow
4.09      Besides the three primary product groups, HII will also manufacture
secondary products such as mining and pollution control equipment, large pumps
and compressors and other job orders in order to level out capacity utiliza-
tion in the wake of the cyclical production requirements of the primary pro-
ducts. All products (primary and secondary) fall into two basic categories:
(i) those which are predominantly machined and assembled, such as rolling
mills, turbines generators, pumps and compressors; and (ii) those which are
predominantly fabricated, such as blast furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces,
boilers, heat exchangers and pressure vessels. Typical process flows for
such products are given in Annex 4-4.



- 15 -
E.   Raw Material and Components
4.10      Details of raw materials and components are contained in Annex 4-5.
The products planned under the Project are largely material intensive, with
materials representing about 54% of sales value, once the steady operational
state has been reached. Most required materials are locally available and
are: pig iron, ferro-alloy, scrap and sand for the foundry shop; plates,
sections and tubes for the fabrication shops; and various types of bar
stocks for the light machine shop. The Project also requires a wide range
of bought-out parts and components, such as controls, electrical systems,
hydraulic systems, light machined parts and light fabricated products.
Generally, critical and technically complex parts will be imported until local
capabilities are sufficient to produce them. HII has already identified the
local sources of raw materials and components and it will assist these sources
to make sure that their supplies conform strictly with its requirements. Even
at the steady state of operations, about 20% of materials and components (such
as hydraulic systems, sophisticated equipment, magnetic alloy sheets and
high-pressure valves) are expected to be imported.
F.   Ecology
4.11      The Company will conform to the provisions of the Government's "Law
on Prevention of Public Nuisance" enacted in 1963 and amended in 1971; the
law is based on Japanese practice and follows international codes. With the
exception of the foundry and forge shops, HII's production is relatively clean
with no adverse effect on the environment. HII has incorporated into the
Project adequate measures for the monitoring and prevention of pollution
in each area and will obtain the necessary approval from the Ministry of
Health and Social Affairs before implementing the Project. In the foundry
there will be an electro-static precipitator for dust collection and, in
addition, individual collectors for each furnace for direct absorption of
dust, fumes and particle-emissions. The heat treatment plant will have
similar pollution control devices. All water will be treated before dis-
charging and the noise level will be kept at acceptable levels. Details
are given in Annex 4-6. All these measures are judged to provide adequate
pollution control; however, assurance was obtained from the Company that
they will in fact be implemented and maintained.
G.   Employment and Training
4.12      As described in Annex 4-7, the Project will require about 8,000
new employees, of which only about 4,500 will be direct operational labor
reflecting the high level of technology involved and the need for engineering
and indirect support requirements. At the end of 1976, HII had about 3,500
employees and when the Project reaches its steady state of operation (1983),
it will have about 14,000 employees, including an additional 2,500 in the
Gunpo and Anyang Plants. The total number of employees estimated for the
Project is about 20% higher than that in similar plants in developed countries



- 16 -
with comparable product mix. This is primarily due to the intention of HII to
use less complex high investment machinery and to substitute cheap skilled
labor in lieu of machinery and equipment wherever possible. No major problem
is foreseen in recruiting an adequate number of workers for the Project.
Since the demand for qualified engineers is high and supply is somewhat
limited, recruitment of engineers and high skilled technicians will require
particular attention. However, given the Company's reputation in the country
and its elaborate recruitment program, this is not expected to pose a major
problem. Furthermore, HII plans to absorb some highly qualified technicians
and engineers from the other Hyundai Group companies.
4.13      As mentioned earlier (para. 4.07) one important means of technology
transfer is through proper training and the Company is fully aware of this
essential need. HII plans to supplement existing training capabilities
in the country, which for basic training are considered excellent, with
Company training to upgrade expertise of the work force; this effort has
already started in the Gunpo Plant. Furthermore, an elaborate overseas
training program is being developed and about 400 technicians and engineers
will be trained in the licensors' and equipment suppliers' facilities.
This program, which is already underway, falls into three basic categories:
(i) product oriented programs (ii) manufacturing and specialized activity
programs and (iii) operating activity programs. Further details are given
in Annex 4-7. Although the overall training effort and approach are satis-
factory, details of this will be worked out only after the final review of
the project facilities is completed (para. 6.03). Therefore, the Company has
agreed to submit to the Bank a comprehensive training program before the end
of 1977.
H.   Infrastructure Requirements
4.14      The Project is located very close (3 km) to the Changwon Industrial
Complex and administratively forms part of it; the Complex already has all the
necessary infrastructure. The Government will provide the additionally needed
access roads, electric supply, water supply and telecommunication connections
up to the plant site to meet the Project requirements. Details on infrastruc-
ture are given in Annex 4-8. HII is responsible for site clearance and infra-
structure development within the plant site. The infrastructure facilities
included in the Project are considered adequate but will be reviewed again as
further details on the facility designs of the plant become available.

Annex 5-1.
b/   CIF cost at the plant site, including US$4.2 million in duties and taxes.
c/   Working capital requirements are through to the 1983 steady state of
operations.
5.02      The base cost estimates were prepared jointly by the Company and
IKC based on quotations received in mid-1976 from equipment suppliers in the
U.S., Japan, and Western Europe and HII's recent experience. Some quotations
received in March 1976 were adjusted to July 1976 to reflect inflationary
increases between the two dates. No major revisions in these cost esti-
mates are expected as a result of the final review of the Project by the
forge/foundry consultants (para 6.03). The Project is expected to be 90%
exempted from all duties on imported equipment and spares, which normally
average 20%. Accordingly, duties of 2%, and the applicable defense tax of
2.5% have been included in the cost estimates. Freight and insurance for
imported items is estimated at 3% of their FOB value. Civil and building



- 18 -
works costs are based on an estimate of total volume of work required for
each plant section and unit prices calculated from Gunpo's actual costs, as
are erection and installation costs. The estimate for pre-operating expenses
is based on the Company's past experience and also takes into account the re-
quirements for technical assistance, license fees and training needs. These
include around US$1.0 million for 120 man-months of consultancy at an average
cost of US$8,300 per man-month including travel and overhead expenses.
5.03      A physical contingency of 10% has been added to the base cost esti-
mate, and an allowance for price escalation added to both the base cost esti-
mate and physical contingency. For foreign costs a declining price escalation
rate of 9% in 1976, 8% in 1977 to 1979, and 7% thereafter has been used, and
for local costs one of 13%, 12% and 10% respectively. Total physical and
price contingencies allowed for amount to about 31% of the base cost. Total
project costs, including contingencies, are considered realistic estimates.
B.   Working Capital
5.04      Working capital requirements for the Project (Annex 5-2) through
to the 1983 steady state are estimated at US$135.8 million, of which US$50.3
million would be in foreign exchange, representing inventories of parts bought
abroad. Since the Government allows companies engaged in import substitution
to convert domestic currency into foreign exchange as required for the import
of production materials, these needs can be financed from internal cash flow.
The Government has provided assurances that access to foreign exchange for
working capital and other operational needs will be continued. Working
capital in domestic currency, US$85.5 million, will also be financed by
HII.
C.   Financing Plan
5.05      The total financing requirements for the Project are proposed to be
met as follows:

a/   HII's entire cash generation, 1976-80, will be utilized for financing
the Project as well as meeting requirements for existing operations. The
amount available for the Project, US$75.5 million equivalent, is included
in the above table. Between 1981-83, cash generation of US$65.4 million
equivalent will be required for Project working capital needs. In
addition, surplus cash of US$65.6 million equivalent will be built-up
during this period. This latter amount is excluded from the table.
b/   Represents local funds converted to foreign exchange for the financing
of working capital and foreign interest during construction.
5.06      Of the total financing requirements of US$422.2 million, the local
currency component is estimated at US$216.7 million. This amount will be
covered by equity contributions from HII shareholders, cash generation from
existing and Project operations (para. 5.09), and a loan from the Government
(para. 5.08). With regard to foreign exchange financing, the importance of
maximizing borrowings from bilateral agencies and foreign commercial banks has
been stressed to the Company. As a result, HII has received letters of intent
from bilateral agencies in the U.K., France, and Austria, and the allocation
of equipment for procurement in these countries indicates that HII can utilize
about US$46.7 million of such bilateral funds, with a Bank loan of US$80
million being sufficient to cover the remaining foreign exchange needs for
imported equipment, spares, structural steel and technical assistance. Direct
lending of the Bank loan to HII is not possible under Korea's "Public Loan



- 20 -
Inducement and Management Law" which allows such only to government corpora-
tions or corporations whose shares are "widely-held." Therefore, it is pro-
posed that the Bank loan be made to the Government of Korea for onlending
to HII for a term of 14 years, including 4 years' grace. The length of the
grace period is necessary in order to ease the debt repayment burden in the
early years of Project operations. Interest will be 8.2% annually, plus a 2%
guarantee fee to the Government. This 2% spread is consistent with the prac-
tice normally followed by the Korea Development Bank (KDB).
5.07      Bilateral credits, estimated at US$46.7 million, are expected to
finance 85% of bilaterally-financed equipment costs. The remainder, US$11.9
million, representing downpayments (US$8.3 million), and a small amount of
direct equipment costs (US$3.6 million) will be financed by foreign commer-
cial banks (letters of intent sufficient to cover this amount have been
received by HII). Bilateral credits will be made directly to HII and guaran-
teed by the Korea Exchange Bank or KDB. Terms on bilateral credits average
about 8%, payable over 12 years including 3 years' grace. For foreign com-
mercial banks, terms average about 11%, payable over 7 years including 3
years' grace. The Company will bear the foreign exchange risk on all external
loans, including the Bank loan.
5.08      Local equipment and construction costs will be met, in part, by
a loan from the Government, to be channeled through various local banks.
The financial projections indicate about US$79.4 million in Government funds
will be needed. The Government has agreed to provide local loans sufficient
to meet the needs of the Project. The terms of such funds are 13%, repayable
over 8 years including 3 years' grace.
5.09      The balance of local financing needs, US$137.3 million, will be
met from HII's cash generation and the contribution of new share capital
by shareholders. The latter is estimated at US$63.3 million, representing
the amount of new equity which must be raised to meet a debt/equity ratio
of no higher than 60:40 by the end of 1981 and thereafter. HII sharehold-
ers have agreed to this debt/equity requirement and also that a debt/equity
ratio of no higher than 70:30 will be maintained through 1978, I/ and 65:35
from the end of 1979 through 1980. In addition, HII shareholders agreed to
jointly and severally guarantee the provision of equity funds to meet these
debt/equity ratios and also to meet a current ratio of 1.2 times (para. 7.07).
If the shareholders are unable to raise the required share capital in full the
remainder could be covered by other arrangements, such as a subordinated loan
from shareholders or other sources, and/or investment by other institutions,
such as IFC, all on terms satisfactory to the Bank. Finally, the Government
has agreed to provide a guarantee to meet any equity shortfalls from the above
sources through equity contributions of its own or subordinated loans to HII.
1/   The 70:30 covenant is identical to that stipulated in the project
agreement between ADB and HII.



- 21 -
5.10      The shareholders also agreed that they will provide whatever addi-
tional appropriate resources might be needed to complete the Project and to
bring it into operations, including the maintenance of an adequate working
capital level through to the achievement of full capacity operations (para.
7.07), irrespective of whether the need for additional funds is caused by cost
overruns or shortfalls in the Company's cash generation. In addition, the
Government agreed to guarantee that debt or equity funds required to complete
the Project as scheduled will be promptly provided in the event that share-
holders are unable to meet their commitments in this respect. Both the funds
to be furnished by the shareholders and the Government will be provided on
terms satisfactory to the Bank and within the debt/equity and current ratios
stipulated in the preceding paragraph.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Organization and Management
6.01      HII will be responsible for Project execution and, in the light
of the experience gained in the planning and implementation of the Gunpo
project, is judged to be qualified to execute such responsibilities. The
main burden in this task will rest on HII's Project Team, recently estab-
lished with staff predominantly from the Gunpo project team and Hyundai
Group companies, particularly from Hyundai Construction and Hyundai Ship-
building. Details of Project organization and management are given in Annex
6-1. All key management personnel, who have already been appointed, have
considerable experience in project planning and execution. Mr. B. J. Hwang,
an experienced mechanical engineer who was previously responsible for imple-
mentation of Hyundai Shipbuilding's shipyard is the head of the Project Team,
which will work under the general guidance of the Company's president.
6.02      The Project Team is organized along four line functions (design
and engineering, construction office, supply, and financing and cost control)
and a project planning and coordinating office. This arrangement is satis-
factory and is based on the Hyundai Group's vast experience in project im-
plementation. A consultation committee, composed of all senior directors
of HII, will advise the president and the Project Team leader on policy and
other critical matters concerning the Project. In addition, HII will be able
to obtain advice and assistance from other companies in the Hyundai Group.
However, in light of the Project's technical complexity, the Company recog-
nizes that outside assistance will be required for equipment selection and
preparation of detailed engineering.
6.03      The Company has selected IMC, which has played an important role
in the basic design of the Project, for technical assistance for the detailed
design of the machine, assembly and test shops. Terni of Italy, an experi-
enced operating company, has been employed to cover this aspect for the
foundry and forge shops. All licensing agreements do or will also cover
technical assistance to HII from the licensors in such areas as machining,
fabrication, assembly and testing. However, with respect to the foundry
and forge shops, although some help will be available from licensors, addi-
tional know-how, training and technical assistance will be required during



- 22 -
implementation and early years of operation. HII has signed a letter of
intent with Terni for such assistance, and has agreed to finalize a contract
by March 1978. Civil construction work will either be carried out by HII
or Hyundai Construction. Although the Bank will not finance civil works,
Bank approval will be required for any contract signed by HII with Hyundai
Construction for the purpose of the Project to ensure that the contract
price is reasonable in the Korean context.
6.04      Upon Project completion, the Project Team will be absorbed under
the Project operational division which will also be reporting directly to
the president. This division will have all necessary powers to operate
the plant effectively. Finally, the Company plans to set up a policy commit-
tee comprising the president, and vice-presidents of the Project and existing
operations, essentially to establish major policies for production and sales
and to optimize coordination among HII operating units. Further details on
the proposed organization of HII after completion of the Project are given in
Annex 6-1.
B.   Project Implementation
6.05      Project engineering and procurement action has commenced.  Adver-
tisements for international bidding, after approval by the Bank, were placed
in various periodicals in September 1976, and the Company is in the process
of prequalifying prospective bidders; preliminary site work is also underway.
As shown in the project implementation schedule in Annex 6-2, detailed engi-
neering and design are expected to be completed in the second quarter of
1977. Order placement is scheduled to begin in July 1977. Equipment in-
stallation is forecast to start in the first quarter of 1978 and, while
certain facilities will be ready for production and sales in the second half
of 1978, mechanical completion of the entire Project is only expected prior to
the end of 1979.
C.   Procurement
6.06      Civil construction and building works for the Project will be
carried out by HII or Hyundai Construction (para. 6.03). Besides civil works,
the Project comprises technical assistance and a large number of machine tools
and equipment items. Procurement of equipment will be through tied bilateral
credits, Bank financing and local commercial shopping. Financing will be on
a parallel basis with separate equipment packages for Bank and bilateral
financing. A tentative list of items to be procured under the Bank loan is
contained in Annex 6-3. The equipment and spares and structural steels to be
financed by the Bank are to be procured through international competitive
bidding, in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Equipment packages costing
less than US$100,000 equivalent, estimated to amount to less than 8% of the
Bank loan will be obtained through international shopping. The Company plans
to use a two-stage bidding procedure for complex and critical machinery in
order to achieve reasonable uniformity among technical bids before priced
bids are opened.
D.   Disbursement and Allocation of Bank Loan
6.07      The disbursement schedule for the Bank loan given in Annex 6-4
is based on detailed estimates of order placement and expected delivery



- 23 -
times for equipment in line with the construction schedule. The Bank loan
will be disbursed against 100% of c.i.f. costs of the equipment, spares and
structural steel mentioned in para. 6.06 and the foreign exchange cost of
technical assistance required for the Project. No retroactive financing will
be needed. Any loan funds remaining uncommitted upon completion of the
bidding on the Bank financed items would be used, if found justified, to
finance additional equipment for the Project; otherwise these funds would be
cancelled. The entire Bank loan is expected to be disbursed by the third
quarter of 1979.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Project Revenues and Operating Costs
7.01      The major assumptions used in the financial projections are given
in Annex 7-1. Projected revenues (Annex 7-2) are based on steady-state
production in 1983 and thereafter (para. 4.02), with the sales build-up,
1978-82, taking into account the domestic market and the development of
in-house manufacturing capability during this period. With the exception of
the steady state (1983), the annual sales plan for the project has so far been
defined only in value terms. Detailed production (sales) planning specifying
types of equipment to be produced by year, however, will begin in the latter
part of 1977 as HII begins to receive orders for equipment to be manufactured
in 1978 and later years.
7.02      Sales are expected to increase (in real 1976 terms) from Won
18 billion (US$38 million) at Project start-up in 1978 to Won 192 billion
(US$396 million) by 1983 (or Won 31.9 and 317.3 billion in current terms),
when the projected sales mix is as follows: power plant equipment 40%,
steel plant equipment 20%, chemical plant equipment 20%, and ancillary equip-
ment and jobbing sales 20%. While forecast sales appear high in the early
years of Project operations, a major - though declining - proportion will be
made up of bought-out components, thereby reducing the in-house manufacturing
burden in these years.
7.03      Operating costs are discussed in Annex 7-3.  Material costs are by
far the largest item and have been prepared in detail by HII for the assumed
sales mix from 1978 to 1983. The material costs so arrived at (54% of sales
at the steady state) are in line with those achieved by manufacturers of
similar types of heavy equipment worldwide. Material costs in the years
prior to the steady state will be much higher (78% of sales in 1978), due
to the greater reliance on bought-out parts and inefficiencies in raw mate-
rials purchasing and usage in these years.
B.   Future Profitability
7.04      A summary of projected income statements for HII (Annex 7-4) is
given in the following table. As noted in para. 2.17, sales and earnings
from existing HII operations (Annex 2-9) are projected to increase sharply
once the Gunpo expansion comes on stream in mid 1977. Start-up problems



- 24 -
are expected to be minimal and the earnings flow should be immediate, reach-
ing steady-state levels in 1979. The learning curve on Project operations
will be longer, and the high proportion of bought-out parts in the early
years will limit its earnings capability. Overall, the Project is forecast
to have cash losses for three years and an earnings loss for another year.
HII's earnings overall are nevertheless expected to increase through 1979,
followed by a drop in earnings in 1980 when interest during construction
will no longer be capitalized. The upward earnings trend is resumed in
1981 as the Project's reliance on bought-out parts decreases and as efficiency
of labor and materials usage rises. No income taxes are payable by HII
through 1980 (and income taxes are reduced in 1981) due to an 8% investment
tax credit on the Project and the Gunpo expansion. A defense tax, at one-
quarter of the income tax otherwise payable, is nevertheless deducted from
pre-tax earnings over the period.

C.   Financial Position
7.05      Projected sources and applications of funds for HII are given in
Annex 7-5 and balance sheets in Annex 7-6; the latter are summarized in the
table on the following page.
7.06      The Company's financial position remains tight during Project
implementation and so will debt service coverage through the first two years
after mechanical completion (1980 and 81). Thereafter, however, all financial
indicators are expected to improve rapidly.



- 25 -
7.07      To ensure maintenance of a sound financial position, in addition
to the covenants relating to the financing of the Project (paras. 5.09 and
5.10), HII has agreed to the following: (i) HII will maintain a current ratio
of not less than 1.2 times 1/; such a ratio is adequate for the nature of the
Company's business; (ii) although the Company has never paid a cash dividend,
HII will continue not doing so nor make any other cash distribution until its
debt/equity ratio has reached 60:40; thereafter cash dividends or other cash
distributions may only be made provided - after such distributions - the
current ratio does not fall below 1.5:1 and the debt service coverage, pro-
jected for the year in which such distributions are made, does not drop below
1.5 times 1/; (iii) HII will not incur new debt if to do so would cause the
Company's debt/equity ratio to exceed those set out in para 5.09 and, if to do
so, other than for the Project, would cause its projected debt service cov-
erage to fall below 2.0 times; and (iv) in order to ensure adequate management
attention is given to the Project, HII will not without prior consent of the
Bank undertake any investment exceeding US$10 million in any one year,
until after the end of 1983.

D.   Break-Even Analysis
7.08      Profit break-even for the Project is not reached until after 1981.
The profit break-even point in 1983, the first year in which the Project
reaches the steady state of operations, would be about 67% of the Project's
effective capacity, and since debt repayment is higher than depreciation, the
cash break-even point in that year would be slightly higher (73%). This means
that, in 1983, assuming full production, revenues could fall by as much as 27%
before the Project would have a cash loss. Further details on the break-even
analysis are given in Annex 7-7.
E.   Financial Rate of Return
7.09      The Project's pre-tax financial rate of return is 15.2% in real
(1976) terms; the after-tax return is 12.2%. Details of the financial rate
of return and sensitivity analysis are given in Annex 7-8 and summarized
below:
H.II: Sensitivity Tests_on Financial Rate of Return
Capital               Operating    Pre-Tax
Case                    Costs    Revenues       Costs      Return
1.   Base Case                      100       100          100         15.2%
2.   Capital Cost Increase          120       100          100         13.4%
3.   Revenue Decrease               100         90         100          4.9%
4.   Revenue/Operating Cost
Decrease                     100        80           80         12.6%
5.   Operating Cost Increase        100        100         110          6.7%
6.   Operating Cost Increase        100        100         120         (4.8%)
7.   One Year Project Delay                                            13.9%
7.10      The above tests indicate that the return on the Project is rela-
tively insensitive to increases in capital costs. This can be attributed
to the Project's ability, after a period of initial losses, to generate
relatively high earnings in relation to capital costs. Project returns
are much more sensitive to changes in revenues and operating costs. Lower
than forecast selling prices for the Project's output would have a dramatic
effect on the rate of return. The risk of this happening, however, is
unlikely in light of the conservative basis on which selling prices have
been derived, i.e. being fully comparable to import prices (Annex 7-2).
With regard to operating costs, it is important that the Project achieve
internationally competitive cost levels within a reasonable period of time
after start-up; otherwise returns will drop sharply.
F.   Major Risks
7.11      Major risks associated with the Project can be divided into two
categories: (i) those beyond the control of the Company; and (ii) Company-
associated risks. With regard to (i), lower than expected rates of economic
growth, or a shift in Government policy with regard to development of the



- 27 -
heavy industrial sector could have an adverse impact on the market for the
Project. However, in light of the strong past performance of the Korean
economy, even under recessionary conditions worldwide, and given the Gov-
ernment's well-advanced planning for development of the heavy industrial
sector, the aforementioned eventualities are considered unlikely. Moreover,
weakness in the domestic market could at least partially be offset by export
sales especially to countries where the reputation of the Hyundai Group is
already well-known. A third risk in this area relates to the provision
of adequate sales financing to support Project sales. The Government has
agreed that, in the formulation and implementation of the master plan of
action for the machinery industry, the needs of the Project for adequate
sales financing mechanisms will be taken into account (para. 3.06).
7.12      Company-associated risks are three-fold.  First, successful adap-
tation of complex technology will be critical to the Company's ability to
produce high-quality products at costs competitive with similar manufacturers
worldwide. Present arrangements for overseas training of key technicians,
the provision of technical assistance from licensors, consultants, and ex-
patriate staff during the early years of Project operations will largely
alleviate this risk. Also, the Hyundai Group's wide experience in the
rapid and successful incorporation of foreign technology provides a solid
base for attainment of Project goals in this regard. Second, HII must cap-
ture a significant share of the local market for heavy equipment in order
to achieve projected levels of output and profitability. This risk is closely
tied to the technical risk described above. Assuming this is overcome, how-
ever, the provision of adequate sales financing mechanisms (para. 7.11), and
Government measures to ensure necessary support for the Project during the
early years of operations (para. 3.14) should allow sufficient sales volumes
to be achieved from the outset. Finally, there is the risk that cash gener-
ation from existing operations, and particularly from the Gunpo expansion,
will be less than projected, thereby creating a shortage of equity funds
with which to finance the Project. While the existence of a captive domes-
tic market is expected to alleviate the market risk (para 2.17), the achieve-
ment of reasonable operating cost levels from the outset will require close
management control. In the event of cash shortfalls, the shareholders have
agreed to guarantee the provision of additional funds, with the Government
providing a second line of guarantee (para 5.10).
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Alternatives to the Project
8.01      There are three major alternatives to the Project as described.
First, Korea could continue to import the substantial amounts of heavy
equipment required to support the future growth of its steel, petrochemical,
and power generation industries. This would increase the country's outflow
of foreign exchange and delay development of the heavy manufacturing sector,



- 28 -
of which the Project is currently the lead effort. Second, the Project might
have been incorporated as an expansion of HII's existing facilities. This
alternative is uneconomic since infrastructure requirements and facilities
for the transportation of heavy equipment are more readily available within
the Changwon Complex where linkages with supplying industries and other
companies in the sector can be maximized. Finally, another public or private
enterprise might have been considered to sponsor the Project. Given the
financial, technological, and management base of the Hyundai Group, combined
with its proven track record in similarly complex ventures, the Korean Govern-
ment's selection of HII as the vehicle best suited for implementation of the
Project seems appropriate.
B. Economic Rate of Return
8.02      The economic rate of return for the Project is estimated at 17.4%
in real terms (Annex 8-1). Costs are based on the financial projections,
adjusted for taxes and duties. No shadow pricing of labor or foreign ex-
change has been used since it is felt that market rates for these items
adequately reflect economic costs. Revenues are based on the imported price
(excluding taxes and duties) of similar types of heavy equipment now being
purchased by Korean enterprises from manufacturers in the U.S., Western
Europe, and Japan. Sensitivity tests indicate that, as discussed under the
financial rate of return (para. 7.10), the Project's economic rate of return
is particularly sensitive to changes in revenues and operating costs.
C. Foreign Exchange Savings
8.03      The Project is expected to contribute significantly toward the
Government's objective of import-substitution through localization of the
manufacture of plant equipment. At the steady state of operations, the Proj-
ect would generate annually US$210 million in net foreign exchange savings
(Annex 8-2) with payback of the foreign exchange investment in three years.
The Project would also result in US$47 million equivalent annually in cash
flow to the Government once steady state operations are reached in 1983
(Annex 8-3).
D. Impact on Employment
8.04      The direct employment impact of the Project would amount to 8,030
persons at full production. In addition, it would generate employment for
around 30,000 persons in the supplying industries, based on local supplies
and prevailing labor-output ratios in the machinery industry.
E. Transfer of Technology and Machinery Industry Development
8.05      The most significant contribution of the Project to Korea's eco-
nomy would be in the development of the machinery industry and the upgrading
of the technological base of the country through transfer of technology. The
Project itself would incorporate a number of advanced product and manufactur-
ing technologies new to Korea and would be the country's leading effort in
the heavy machinery area (Annex 4-3). The impact would also extend to a

number of light and medium industries. The Project is designed to include
limited capacity in these areas to foster reliance on existing small sup-
pliers. The requirements for a number of diverse parts and components re-
quiring sophisticated production techniques and new technologies would be
increasingly met locally. HII plans to assist smaller companies in product
selection, technology licensing and training in precision manufacturing in
order to ensure product quality. The Project has also served to focus the
Government's attention on the need for a rational and coordinated approach
to the growth of the machinery industry.  In this context, the Government has
agreed to prepare and implement a master plan covering a number of relevant
issues (para. 3.06). These factors are expected to contribute significantly
to the overall orderly development of the machinery industry and benefit Korea
in extending its capabilities into more skill-intensive areas.

to thie Government (para. 5.06); (x) maintain a debt/equity ratio of
no higlher than 70:30 through 1978, 65:35 by the end of 1979, and no
higher than 60:40 by the end of 1981 and thereafter (para. 5.09);
(xi) guarantee the provision of equity funds to meet these debt/
equity ratios (para. 5.09); (xii) provide cost overrun and project
