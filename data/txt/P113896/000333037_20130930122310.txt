                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY
1. The proposed restructuring is to: (i) extend the closing date by 6 months to March 31,
   2014, and (ii) reallocate loan proceeds from the technical assistance component
   (Category 2) to the components supporting the implementation of the Eligible
   Expenditure Programs in the health and education sector (Category 1). The proposed
   changes are to ensure the sustainability of the reforms supported by the project and to
   fully achieve the Project Development Objective (PDO).

B. PROJECT STATUS
2. The Board approved a loan in the amount of US$50 million for the San Juan Social
   Inclusion and Development Project – SWAp on March 16, 2010. The loan only
   became effective on September 14, 2011 due to unforeseen delays in passing a
   governmental decree authorizing the signature of the loan. The project was
   restructured in March 2012 to extend the closing date by 18 months to September 30,
   2013 and to adjust the implementation schedule and the target reference date of the
   disbursement-linked indicators for the Health Sector.
3. The San Juan SWAp has so far shown good results and progress towards achievement
   of the PDO and Implementation Progress have both been rated satisfactory
   continuously. Four out of five disbursements have taken place with disbursement
   currently standing at 81 percent. The PDO can be fully achieved by the new closing
   date.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
4. Extension of closing date: The closing date will be extended from September 30,
   2013 to March 31, 2014. This will be the second extension of the project.
5. Reallocation of loan proceeds: Proceeds of the loan will be reallocated as follows:
