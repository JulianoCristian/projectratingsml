                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are to: # Improve the equity, quality and efficiency of health services, thereby supporting the reduction of child and maternal
                         mortality, especially among those citizens with limited resources who rely heavily on public health services. The four health programs supported by the operation
                         (detailed below) are conducive for these objectives. # Improve the equity, quality and efficiency of education services in the first few years of schooling; thereby
                         strengthen the human capital foundations of the province and improving equal opportunities in education. The two education programs supported by the operation
                         (detailed below) are conducive for these objectives. # Strengthen public sector management. The project aims to build institutional capacity in key line ministries and
                         the finance ministry, introducing basic elements of performance-informed budgeting and policy planning, improving public resource management, and strengthening
                         monitoring and evaluation of service delivery. The TA component is designed to support this objective.

                         The Board approved the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the AR San Juan SWAP on March 16, 2010. The loan only became effective on September 14, 2011 due to
                         unforeseen delays in passing a governmental decree authorizing the signature of the loan. A restructuring of the loan agreement became effective on March 22, 2012 to extend the
                         closing date by 18 months to September 30, 2013 to enable the provision of Technical Assistance to ensure smooth project implementation going forward and to achieve the project
                         objective of strengthening public sector management. Four out of five disbursements have taken place and the implementation of the project is on track.
