REPORT AND RECaO1.EDATIWJ OF TIIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
DEVELOP1iET CREDIT TO THE 11AIAGASY REPUELIC
FOR A PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $9.6 million
to the lialagasy Republic to assist in financing a port project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In hay 1968, the Bank made a technical assistance grant of
$196,800 to the Malagasy Government to finance hydrological, economic
and preliminary engineering studies, and the preparation of a master
plan for the development of the port of Tamatave. These studies formed
the basis for the proposed project, wihich wias appraised by a mission
that visited Madagascar in October 1969.
3.        Negotiations wiere held in W!ashington from Nay 11 to 14, 1970.
The Malagasy delegation was led by the Honorable Eugene Lechat, Mfinister
of Equipment and Communications, and included H. E. Jules A.
Razafimbahiny, Ambassador of the i'alagasy Republic in Washington, and
representatives of the Linistries of Finance, Planning and Communications.
4.        Since 1967, the Bank Group has made five loans and credits to
the Mialagasy Republic for four projects, the 1968 highway project wa
finaneed by a conbined loan amd credit.  The follo!fing is a aummry
statement of those loans and credits as of April 30, 1970:
Loan or
Credit    Year       Borrower       Purpose    Amount (US$ million)

- 2 -
5.        Physical progress under the above-mentioned loans and credits
is generally satisfactory. In two cases, the 1967 education loan and
the 1968 loan and credit for highwxays, there have been administrative
delays in the preparation of withdrawal requests which have now been
largely overcome. At the Government's request, the Association has
agreed that the part of the undisbursed balance of the Highway Credit
No. 90-MAG that will not be required for the original project should be
applied to certain additional construction works and further road
studies. To enable the undisbursed balance to be so applied, the clos-
ing date of this Credit has been postponed from December 31, 1970 to
December 31, 1972 (IDA/R69-76).
6.        Negotiations for a credit of about US $5.0 million for an
irrigation project in the Lake Alaotra region are expected to begin
shortly. Other possible projects at various stages of preparation in-
clude livestock, irrigation and highways. Preliminary consideration
is also being given to the creation of a development finance
company suitable for Bank Group assistance.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.        Borrower:              The Malagasy Republic
Amount:                Various currencies equivalent to $9.6
million.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A report entitled "Appraisal of the Port of Tamatave Project -
N1alagasy Republic" (PTR-48a), dated May 25, 1970 is attached.
9.        The economy of Madagascar is highly dependent on foreign trade;
in recent years, the combined value of exports and imports has averaged
about one-third of GDP. Land communications within the island are difficult
and coastal shipping is also of unusual importance. About 75 percent of
imports and 35 percent of exports pass through the port of Tamatave, which
serves the most populous and developed regions, including the capital
Tananarive. In 1968, Tamatave handled about 460,0O0 tons of general dry
cargo and 670,000 tons of petroleum products. Projections indicate that,
by 1979, dry cargo traffic will more than double and petroleum products
will increase by about one-third, far beyond the capacity of the present
port, which is, moreover, poorly protected from the open sea and ineffi-
ciently laid out. Quay aprons are narrow, the transit sheds and ware-
houses are small, badly designed and poorly located. The loading and un-
loading of petroleum products in the main area of shipping movement is a
major hazard. The proposed project is designed both to remedy these defi-
ciencies and to provide the capacity needed to handle traffic projected
until 1979.
10.       The project is based on the master plan for the Port of Tamatave
and consists of the extension of the existing breakwater by about 225 meters;
the construction of two new berths, transit sheds and warehouses; the
provision of cargo-handling equipment, and of a new deepwater tanker mooring
for petroleum tankers; and consultants' services for final engineering design
and supervision, and technical assistance in management and accounting.
11.       To execute the project and operate the port, the Government
has agreed to establish a new port authority, Port Autonome de Tamatave.
The draft legislation required to establish the authority has been drafted
and is satisfactory to the Association. Passage of the legislation,
expected in July, would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit. The existing port assets would be transferred to the authority and
the Government would receive in exchange the initial equity of the autho-
rity, which would take over full responsibility for the port and the project
by April 1, 1971. In the meantime responsibility would remain with the
Ministry of Equipment and Communications which operates the present port
through two separate agencies, a Port Directorate and a Port Operations
Section of the National Railways.  Division of responsibility between
those agencies, neither of which has financial or administrative autononm,
contributes to the present inefficiency of port operations. The Government
has agreed that expatriate personnel would be appointed initially to fill
the top management posts of the new Port Autonome de Tamatave, including
those of Director, Chief Accountant, Chief Traffic Manager and Chief
Training Officer, and the proposed credit provides for the payment of
their salaries for three years. The port authority would provide suitable
local counterparts, who would be expected in due course to take over.



12.       Total project costs are estimated at $1 7.7 milflion, including
local taxes amounting to $0.7 million. The proposed credit would finance
the foreign exchange requirements, estimated at $9.6 million. The pro-
ceeds of the credit would be on-lent by the Government to Port Autonome
de Tamatave, as a 24-year loan, including 4 years of grace, with interest
at 3/4 o7f1 percent per annum during the grace period and 7 percent per
annum thereafter. Local costs will be covered by a Government equity
contribution of $5.4 million equivalent, and $1.8 million from the cash
flow of the port authority. A dividend on the Government's equity would
be distributed only after the port authority had met its debt service
requirements and set aside one quarter of its net operating revenues on
a port development reserve account. Additional debt may not be incurred
unless total debt service requirements are covered at least 1 .5 times by
cash generation from operations. The project includes the construction
of an oil pipeline from the coast to the Tamatave oil refinery, at a
cost of $0.9 million equivalent, to be financed by the petroleum compa-
nies which own the refinery.
13.      The project would be completed by June 1974. Procurement of
equipment and contracts for execution of civil engineering and other
works to be financed under the credit would be let in accordance with
the Association's guidelines for international competitive bidding.
14.      If port capacity is not increased, ship delays will rise sharp-
ly. Economic benefits will result mainly from reduced ship turn around
time and lower shipping costs for petroleum products. On this basis,
the project is expected to yield a first year economic return of 19% for
197V/75, the opening year of the new facilities. The return would be
expected to increase thereafter.
15.      The Government has agreed to an increase in port charges of
12 1/2% as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit. Thereafter
the tariff structure will be progressively revised with the assistance of
consultants to achieve a rate of return on net fixed assets rising from
about 4 percent in 1974 to 7 percent in 1978.
PART IV - IBDAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Malagasy Re-
public and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.      The draft Development Credit Agreement follows the general pattern
for projects of this kind. Section 3.02(a) provides that the Borrower shall
cause, not later than April 1, 1971, Port Autonome de Tamatave to be respon-
sible for the operation, maintenance and development of facilities at the
port of Tamatave. The Borrower also undertakes to appoint promptly to the
management of Port Autonome de Tamatave competent and experienced persons

management of Port Autonome de Tamatave competent and experienced persons
acceptable to the Association, and to submit to the Association, not later
than September 30, 1971, a training program in all phases of cargo-handling
(Section 3.08).
PART V - THE ECONOYff
18.      A report on "The Economy of the Malagasy Republic" dated
October 8, 1968 (No. AF-83a) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on October 16, 1968 (R 68-193). An economic mission visited 14adagascar
in November 1969, and is completing its report.
19.      Madagascar is the third largest island in the world. There is
a great vrariety of climate and physical conditions which make possible a
wide range of crops. There is great scope for the development of livestock.
On the other hand, the population of about 6.8 million is distributed very
unevenly, internal communications are severely hampered by distance and
rugged terrain, and Madagascar is by-passed by the major shipping routes.
20.      Economic growth in recent years has little more than kept pace
with the growth in population, estimated at about 2.2 percent a year.
The country has succeeded in achieving self-sufficiency in rice and cotton,
but important export crops, notably bananas, vanilla and sisal have
suffered from poor market conditions.
21.      In 1964, Madagascar formulated its first official Five-Year
Development Plan. By 1967, it became obvious that investment levels and
production figures remained well below the Plan targets. The Government
decided to take remedial action, particularly to increase the output of
rice and of export crops. An interim program called "The Program of Major
Operations", consisting of a number of investment projects mainly in the
agricultural field, was drawn up. As a result, public sector investment
rose from an average of FKG 11 billion in the 3-year period 1964-66 to
FMG 13 billion in 1 967 and FMG 1 7 billion in 1968.
22.      Total current revenues of the Central Government increased at
an annual rate of 8.5 percent in current prices between 1964 and 1969,
thanks in part to important tax revisions in 1966 and 1969. Central
Government current expenditures increased 7.5 percent annually in current
prices between 1964 and 1969, that is, 1 percent less than current revenues,
thus permitting the generation of increased Central Government savings,
which amounted to about 2.5 percent of GDP at market prices in 1969. Until
1967, the country's public finance policy had been relatively conservative
but when dissatisfaction with the development effort arose and the Govern-
ment decided to pursue a more active investment policy through the Program
of Major Operations, Treasury liquid balances declined and Madagascar's
international reserves were drawn down.
23.      Preparations for a second five-year plan, intended to cover



- 6 -
the years 1970-74, are still incomplete. The recent Bank economic mission
has made a provisional estimate that public investment in the next five
years could reach about FM1 85 billion, compared with a total during the
first plan period, of FTIG 63 billion, and that such a volume of invest-
ment could be sustained if foreign aid continued at about its present
gross level of FMI 14-15 billion ($50-55 million) a year and if public
savings continue to finance 35-40 percent of public investment. The
projected figure for external assistance assumes an increase in Bank
Group lending, offsetting an expected reduction in aid from other sources.
The mission estimates that with an overall investment level in the
1970-74 period of about FMG 130 billion, the economy would be likely to
grow at the same rate as since 1965, namely,approximately 4.5 percent a
year. Given a continued population growth of 2.2 percent annually, this
would mean that per capita GDP might increase by more than 2 percent
annually.
24.      Madagascar has traditionally received a major proportion of
external aid by way of grant, but over the last five years, the share of
grants has fallen from 92 to 81 percent, and it will probably fall fur-
ther. Hence a higher proportion of resources for investment will have to
come from foreign borrowing and from larger public savings. Present
external public debt is small, amounting to $103 million as of December
1969, with service payments of $6 million, or slightly over 5 percent of
export earnings, in that year. There is thus some room for additional
borrowing on conventional terms. However, owing to the country's poverty,
which means that an inflow of aid will be required for a considerable time,
and the modest prospects for exports over the next five years or so, most
external borrowing should be on concessionary terms. I consider that the
Malagasy Republic is eligible for assistance from the Association.
25.      A basic data sheet is attached as an Annex.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
26.      I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
27.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
