APPRAISAL OF THE PORT OF TAMATAVE PROJECT
SUMMRY
i.        Tamatave is Malagasy's most important port.  In 1968, 463,000
tons of general dry cargo were handled there, comprising roughly three-
quarters of the island's importa and one-third of its exports of dry
cargo. During the firat six months of 1969, traffic reached an annual
rate of 530,000 tons of dry cargo and 640,000 tons of petroleum. Dry
cargo traffic is forecast to reach 820,000 tons in 1974. This sharp
increase results from the opening in 1969 of a chromite mine, being
served through Tamatave, estimated to produce 160,000 tons of ore for
export by 1974, and the development of Tamatave's hinterland, the most
populous and economically productive area of the country.
ii.       Tamatave's physical facilities are deficient.  Although a 450
meter breakwater protects the port, certain ocean conditions create
sufficient disturbance within the harbor to affect ship mooring and
cargo-handling operations. Quay aprons are narrow, transit sheds and
warehouses are small, badly designed, poorly located and usually unsuitable
for the use of modern cargo-handling equipment. The discharge and loading
of petroleum products, effected in the main area of shipping movement,
creates considerable hazards.
iii.      Port operations are inefficient.  This is partly due to the
deficiencies referred to above but also to the present system of port
administration:  the lack of a suitable policy-making body -- the divided
responsibility for port management -- the uncoordinated maintenance and
port planning arrangements - and the lack of financial autonomy are all
unsatisfactory and need to be changed.
iv.       The project is designed to remedy the present physical deficien-
cies of Tamatave and provide adequate facilities to handle traffic projected
until about 1979. It also provides that the Government will establish a
Tamatave Port Authority (TPA) by the end of March 1971, with adequate ad-
ministrative and financial autonomy to direct facilities, staff and opera-
tions of the port. The proposed Credit vould finance the provision of
staff to occupy key positions in TPA for three years, and provide staff
training; consultants' services would alseo be provided to revalue assets
and review port tariffs.
v.        Under a Bank Technical Assistance grant made in May 1968, two
French consulting firme (SOGREAH and BCEOM) carried out studies for the
development of Tamatave port. The proposed project would implement phase
one of their master plan. It comprises an extension of the existing break-
water, construction of two new berths, provision of a new deepvater tanker
mooring and mechanical equlpment, consultant's services for final engineer-
ing design, supervision and the technical assistance referred to above.



- il -
The total estimated cost is FMG 4,460 million (US$16.1 million), exclud-
ing local taxes on construction work. The Credit would be for FMG 2,650
million (US$9.6 million) and cover the estimated foreign exchange component
(60%). Contracte would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding.
vi.       The evaluation of economic conte and benefits shows that the
project in justified both in size and timing. It is expected to produce
a first year economic return of 19%.
vii.      With reasonable increases in port charges, adoption of which is
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit, TPA will be financially
viable and able to provide an estimated US$1.8 million equivalent for the
project. The balance of US$5.4 million equivalent, which includes US$0.7
million for local taxes on construction work, vill be provided by the Gov-
erument.
viii.     The project ls suitable for an IDA Credit of US$9.6 million
equivalent to the Government of Malagasy on the usual terme. The proceeds
vill be relent to the proposed TPA for a term of 24 years including a four-
year grace period with interest at 3/4 of 1% per annum during the grace
period and 7% per annum thereafter.



MALAGASY REPUBLIC
APPRAISAL OF THE PORT OF TAMATAVE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In late 1966, a project identification mission visited Tamatave
and recommended hydrological, economic and preliminary engineering studies
and the preparation of a Master Plan for port development. In May 1968, a
Bank Technical Assistance grant for US$196,800 vas made to the Government
and subsequently a contract to carry out this work vas let jointly to
BCEOM and SOGREAH, French consultants. They submitted a provisional report
in March 1969 and a final report in November 1969.
1.02      The project now appraised covers the first development phase
largely as proposed by the consultants, including extension of the break-
vater, construction of a new berth and reconstruction of an existing berth,
new transit sheds and warehouses, provision of mechanical equipment, a
new deep-vater mooring for petroleum tankers and other minor improvements.
Provision is made for consultants' services for final engineering and
supervision, for assistance in revaluing port assets and carrying out
tariff studies and technical assistance in forming a new Port Authority.
The total cost of the project ïs estimated at US$16.1 million equivalent
excluding local taxes on construction work; the proposed credit is for the
foreign exchange component, US$9.6 million equivalent.
1.03      Previous lending to the Government of Malagasy for transportation
has been an IDA Credit (90-MAG) effective October 1966 for US$10 million,
and a joint IDA-BANK operation (134-MAG and 570-MAC) effective April 1969
for US$8 million (US$4.5 million IDA), both for highways. Although work
financed under 90-MAG started slowly, it is now progessing satisfactorily.
1.04      This report is based on the BCEOM and SOGREAH report and the
findinge of an appraisal mission to the Malagasy Republic in October 1969,
composed of Messrs. F. Higginbottom (Port Engineer), E. Haker (Economilt),
and H. Jones (Financial Analyst).
2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Malagasy Republic, the third largeat island in the world,
lien in the Indian Ocean, 400 km off the southesat coant of Africa. With
an area of 592,000 km2, it is as large as France and the Benelux countries
combined. Population vas approximately 6.5 million in 1968 and is growing
at about 2% per annum. The climate is mainly oemi-tropical with heavy
rainfall and periodic cyclones.



- 2 -
2.02      In 1966 GNP was US$620 million equivalent and has been increas-
ing at 3% per annum; GNP per capita is about US$100. Agriculture accounts
for 32% of GNP, industry 11%, transport 10%, the remainder consists of
commerce, services and government administration.
B. Transport Sector
2.03      Malagasy lacks an adequate inland transport system.  The northern
part of the western regions has no all-weather connections with the rest
of the island; the links with the southern region are merely trails. This
is due not only to the low population density and limited economic develop-
ment of much of the island, but also to high construction costs caused by
the rugged topography and the scarcity of suitable construction materials.
2.04      The main traffic flows are between Tamatave, the principal port,
and Tananarive, the capital, situated on the central plateau; and between
Tananarive and Fianarantsoa to the south.
Highways
2.05      The road network totals about 30,500 km including about 8,500
km of primary roads of which only 3,000 km are paved. In 1966 there were
some 45,000 vehicles in the country. Traffic on the primary road network
has been growing at 6% per annum for the past five years.
Railways
2.06      The Malagasy Republic has four railway lines, totaling 860 km.
The railways carried about 2.2 million passengers and 570,000 tons of
merchandise in 1967.  Since 1960, passenger traffic has been growing at
about 4% per annum and goods traffic by 5.5%. The traffic is unevenly
distributed and only the 379 km Tamatave-Tananarive line carries any signi-
ficant volume.  The railways are government-owned and do not enjoy financial
or administrative autonomy. They have recently been studied in detail
under a UNDP grant by the Belgian Consultants SORCA and BECEKA. The study
recommends sweeping organizational reforms, a basic overhaul of tariff
policy, the closing of one of the four lines and the abandonment of
passenger service on two others. These recommendations are being considered
by the Government.
Air Transport
2.07      The size of the country and the relative isolation of various
regions makes passenger air transport important. In 1967 there were 45
airfields served regularly; all but 13 are rudimentary with unpaved runways
which may be closed during bad weather. Tananarive and Majunga airports
can accommodate long-distance jet aircraft.



-3-
Ports
2.08      Coastal shipping is important as the only means of transporting
merchandise between many areas. Ports play an important role in the trans-
port system, handling most of the foreign trade and linking the main
regions by coastal shipping. The 4,000 km coastline has 23 ports. The
four principal ports are:  Diego Suarez in the north, Majunga in the west,
Tulear in the south and Tamatave in the east; in 1968 they handled 85%
of the island's international trade and 60% of its coastal traffic. The
other 19 ports are merely open roadsteads where ocean-going ships may stop
for some time, at considerable cost, to transfer cargo by lighter.
2.09      Tamatave, the most important port, handles about 75Z of the
island's importe, 35% of exporte and 20% of coastal trafflc.  In 1968 it
handled 463,000 tons of general dry cargo and 674,000 tons of petroleum
products.  Tamatave's hinterland extends about 1,000 km along the eastern
coast; Tananarive 300 km from the sea, i  at the apex of this area which
includes the provinces of Tananarive and Tamatave.  These are the most
populous and economically productive areas, vith one-fifth of the country's
total land area and two-fifths of its population. Agriculture i well-
developed in both provinces.  They produce significant proportions of the
country's rice, maize, coffee, cloves and bananas; i.e. all the important
Malagasy crops with the exception of sugar cane, vanilla, and raffia.  More
than 50% of the country's industrial actlvity is concentrated there and
the two principal minerals, graphite and chromite are mined. The hinterland
consumes a major portion of the country's importe.
C. Transport Coordination
2.10      Competition among transport modes is qulte limited.  A projected
circumferential littoral road now exists in only a few sections, so coastal
shipping is complementary rather than competitive with inland transport,
and is likely to remain so for many years. A similar complementary rela-
tionship exista between land and air transport in most cases. Competition
between road and rail is practically non-existent: the road between
Tamatave and Tananarive has been neglected in order to protect the railway
from road competition.  Protecting the railway in this fashion eliminates
the incentive to increase efficiency and its operating costs are very high.
However, the Government's policy in this regard is changing.  Savings from
Credit 90-MAG are being used to finance feasibility studies of roads between
Tamatave and Tananarive, Lake Alaotra and Fenerive and Tananarive and Fiana-
rantsoa, all competitive with the railway (see IDA R69-76).
2.11      Investments in the transport sector during the proposed Second
Five Year Plan 1970-1974 are expected to amount to about FMG 41.0 billion
(US$150 million equivalent) of which 60% would be for roads. The realiza-
tion of this forecast depende heavily on the availability of foreign assis-
tance.



- 4 -
2.12      The Government 18 avare that the present port system is inefficient
and, during the 1970-1974 Plan, expects to make substantial progrees in
concentrating international trade at the four main ports using coastal ship-
ping from secondary and smaller ports. A second objective, to close some
of the minor ports and consolidate coastal traffic, can be achieved only
when roads are available to provide an alternative outlet.
3. PORT OF TAMATAVE
EXISTING ORGANIZATION, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
A. Organization
3.01      There is no satisfactory body responsible for developing port
policy. An Admînistrative Council meets once a year for budget approval
and also if required by special circumstances. The Council is compoBed
of the Port Director, 12 representatives of Government agencies, four of
port usera and two of the National Railway. The Council is too large and
does not meet frequently enough to formulate policy or to give satisfactory
policy direction to port management.
3.02      Management is in the hands of two independent agencies; the Port
Directorate (Directorate) and the Port Operations Section of the National
Railways (Operations Section). Both are responsible to the Ministry of
Equipment and Communications (the Ministry), but through entirely separate
channels:
i)   The Directorate la headed by the Port Director who reports
directly to the Ministry. It has an administrative division,
a harbor master's department controlling ship movement and
pilotage, and a works division for maintenance and minor
improvements. The Directorate has some 250 employees; and
ii)   The Operations Section's Director, who is independent of the
Port Director, is responsible to the Ministry through the
Director of the National Railway. This section undertakes
all cargo-handling from ship's hold to sheds and warehouses,
and delivery to rail wagon or consignee's vehicle. It owns
and operates all mechanical cargo-handling equipment, quay
cranes, lighters, and towing tugs, and an equipment mainte-
nance and repair section. It has approximately 2,000 employees.
3.03      It will be seen that the main section of port management is in
effect controlled by the National Railway and consequently is more oriented
to rail than to port operations. There is a lack of competent direction of
port operations, equipment and operating methods are inadequate, and labor
productivity is low.



-5-
3.04      Each agency has its own civil engineering maintenance department.
Their work is uncoordinated and for this reason costly. Neither agency is
equipped to carry out the planning or design of port extension. This work
is undertaken in Tananarive by the Ministry.
3.05      Both sections of the port lack financial autonomy.  The annual
operating and capital budget of the Directorate is included with those of
the other Malagasy ports as a separate annex (Port's Budget Annex) of the
State Budget. Surpluses accrue to the Government; transfers between
budget categories and supplementary appropriations require the approval
of the Minister of Finance. This procedure is time consuming and prevents
adequate flexibility to meet unforeoeen expenses. The budget of the
Operations Section is part of the budget of the National Railway. It is a
separate annex of the State Budget and the same procedures must be followed
for supplementary appropriations and transfers as in the case of the
Directorate. Surpluses are divided equally between the Port's Budget Annex
and the National Railway (see also para. 7.01). Neither section can retain
funds for development or to build up reserves for contingencies. As a
result, capital expenditures tend to be related to the financial position
at the moment rather than to the needs of the port.
3.06      The Directorate prepares no balance sheets and merely lista
receipts and disbursements on a cash basis with a comparison against
budget estimates. Thé accounts of the Operations Section are not prepared
on a commercial basis: balance sheets are drawn up but no depreciation
vas provided until 1968 and income accounts are kept on a cash basis.  Ex-
pensive computer equipment i rented to prepare payrolls, trial balances,
apare parts inventories, traffic statistics summaries and costing. The
computer unit works well under a Technical Assistance Officer; however,
he follows the instructions of the Accountant, who lacks experience, 80
that output is of limited value (the coat analysis) or of poor quality
(the traffic statistics). Thus, management decisions are liable to be
based on poor or misleading information.
3.07      The lack of a suitable policy making body -- the divided respon-
sibility for port administration -- the uncoordinated maintenance and port
planning arrangements -- and the lack of financial autonomy are all unsa-
tisfactory and need to be changed. This need will increase when the pro-
ject works are completed and the responsibilities of all sections are
correspondingly greater. Arrangements for the proper coordination and
planning of port development, operations and finances are outlined in
Chapter 4.
B. Facilities (see bfap 3)
3.08      Details of port facilities are given in Annex 1.  While the
port i protected by a 450 m breakwater, under certain conditions ocean
swell adversely affects the mooring and cargo operations of ships. Prin-
cipal facilities comprise three deep-water and two coaster berths. Ex-



cept on Pier C, quay aprons are narrow and the transit sheds are small,
double storeyed buildings unsuitable for modern cargo-handling equipment.
A new shed for transshipment traffic is being constructed behind Pier B.
Some 300 m from the piers, there are 12 warehouses of which 11 are small
and unsuitable for modern equipment as their floors are not level with
the adjacent road.  Stacking areae are adequate but, except for those
on Pier C, are also some distance from the piers. One area has recently
been converted to a container park and another is used for imported vehicles.
3.09      Petroleum products are diacharged and loaded through a tanker
mooring off Pier B, connected by direct land-line to the refinery. Dis-
charging operations create a considerable hazard as the mooring is in the
main area of shipping movements. A new mooring away from the main port
area, and a connecting land-lîne are included in the project. No ship-
handling tugs are presently available, but one is being acquired.
3.10      Chromite ore is stockpiled in the port and loaded at Pier C
by large buckets. A mechanical handling system and a ship-loader are
being installed to replace the present temporary system.
3.11      Details of available cargo-handling equipment are given in
Annex 2. There is an imbalance between available tractors in good condi-
tion and trailers and a great shortage of cargo pallets; additional new
equipment will be needed for the proposed new berths.
3.12      Road and rail access to the port is generally adequate.  Exclud-
ing coastal traffic, the railway moves about 80% of total traffic. Any
change from the present rail-oriented movement of cargo would present no
difficulty.
3.13      The port includes an area occupied largely by railway sidings,
where trains from the port are marshalled, rails and other materials
imported for the National Railway are stored, and additional small ware-
houses leased to the Chamber of Commerce are located. This area is too
far from the berthe to be of any value for normal port operations and is
not required for future development (para. 4.05).
C. Operations
Labor
3.14      The Operations Section's employees include about 700 permanent
and 650 temporary dockers. The permanent dockers include about 200 who
are in effect semi-retired.



- 7 -
3.15      Dockers are organized into gangs of 30 divided into three groupe,
each with a foreman, for cargo-handling from ship to shore, from ship's
side to shed and inside the shed. Theoretically, some 34 gangs are avail-
able; 21 for the first shift and up to 13 for the second, the latter allo-
cated on priority of ship's arrival. In fact, due to absenteeism and ill
health, no more than 29 gangs have been available in recent yeare. The
cost of gangs used on these two shifte le included in the cargo-handling
rate; a third, overtime shift can be worked at the ship's expense.
3.16      The labor force ie inadequate to provide full service to the
ships using the port and the tonnage handled daily suffers correspondingly;
this position is further complicated by low output due to lack of experience,
knowledge and drive in foremen and a general lack of training in modern
cargo-handling techniques. Additionally, cargo tallying procedures are
deficient which further slows handling. A comprehensive training program
is necessary, particularly in view of the increased cargo to be handled in
the future. Additional gangs vill be needed and adequate labor is reported
to be available for training.
3.17      The Government has agreed that a training program embracing all
phases of cargo-handling, including labor and supervision, will be submitted
for the Association's approval by September 30, 1971 and started not later
than April 1, 1972. Technical assistance for this training is included in
the project.
Cargo Movement
3.18      The normal flow of traffic through the port is presently inhibited
by several factors. Except on Pier C, the transit sheds are unsuitable
for receiving cargo direct from the ship se that much cargo is moved long
distances to sheds. This also applies to transehipment cargo. Pallets
cannot be used effectively because forklift trucks cannot be employed
inside the sheds, thus all loading and unloading muet be done by hand,
except on the open areas. As already mentioned, the aprons on Piers A and
B are narrow, making movement of mechanical cargo-handling equipment diffi-
cult and inefficient. Equipment operating methods are poor, and are poorly
directed.
3.19      The proposed project will provide new transit sheds and a new
transshipment warehouse and reduce unnecessary cargo movement. The shed
now in the course of construction behind Pier B, intended for transshipment
traffic will also improve the present situation. However, in the location
in which it is being built, it will interfere vith traffic flow from the
transit shed proposed for Pier B and will have to be moved when the trans-
shipment warehouse included in the project ie available. The Government
has agreed that the shed will be relocated.



- 8 -
3.20      The transit shed on Pier C was provided by Compagnie Navale et
Commerciale Havraise Peninsulaire (NCHP) and its nhips have priority at
this pier. This occasions unnecessary ship movements and disrupts port
operations. The Government has undertaken to arrange for the termination
of the company's priority right at Pier C upon completion of the project.
3.21      Lighterage operations are usually limited to handling coastal
traffic and are not a significant part of operations. Container traffic
is presently limited ta small containers of about five tons capacity. It
is not antlcipated that standard 20 ft containers will be used for Malagasy's
foreign trade for a considerable time.
3.22      Cargo iL  permitted a free storage period of Il days after dis-
charge in the transit sheds and can be moved to warehouses only after a
further four days. Agreement was reached that by the time the project is
completed the free period will be reduced to five days and that transfer
from transit sheds to warehouse can be tndertaken at the consignee's expense
immediately thereafter.
3.23      An analysis over a period of six months in 1967 indicated that
33% of time spent by ships waiting alongside the berths, some 40 days, was
spent waiting for export cargo. This should not normally occur, and is
due either to an inability to locate cargo due for shipment in the various
sheds, or to late delivery of the cargo to the port. Provision of an
export cargo warehouse in the project will permit centralized storage of
cargo forwarded in advance.
Custome
3.24      Custome officials now work only from 0800 hours to 1200 hours
and from 1400 hours to 1800 hours. The port's working hours are 0700
hours to 2100 hours. Deliveries are therefore not possible from certain
sheds during six working hours and ships must pay overtime for maintaining
essential sheds in operation. Assurances have been obtained from the Gov-
ernmnent that Customs officers will work hours consistent with the port's
operations, without additional charge to port users.
4. PROPOSED TAMATAVE PORT AUTHORITY (TPA)
4.01      The new facility will alleviate the physical problems of the port
and the proposed training program will improve port operating methode.
However, for the reasons outlined in paragraph 3.07 the full benefit of
these improvements can only be obtained if port development, operations and
finance are properly coordinated. The Association considers this can best
be achieved by creating an autonomous port authority for Tamatave, and
after experience has been gained, consideration should be given to forming
a National Port Authority.



4.02      An outline of the agreed functions of TPA is given below.  Details
of its organizational structure are given in Annex 3. TPA will have:
i)   full responsibility for all functions necessary for
efficient import and export of goode through the port,
except Customs clearance;
ii)   adequate financial autonomy to enable it to generate funds
required to meet all necessary operating expenses, cover
debt service, and contribute to the financing of improve-
ments; and
iii)   adequate administrative autonomy to formulate port policy
in regard to employment, shipping movement, cargo receipt,
dispatch, and storage; movement of all transport vehicles
in the port area, and other necessary matters.
4.03      To achieve the above objectives, TPA vill have:
a)   a Board of Directors to formulate port policy comprising
a Chairman and repreeentatives of the Government, the regions
served by the port, shipowners, port users, merchants and
labor, in reasonable proportion. Appointments vill be
approved by the Minister;
b)   a Director General appointed by the Board and responsible
for day-to-day management. He will be an ex-officio
non-voting Board member; and
c)   a line management structure of specialist departmental heads
each responsible to the Director General and appointed by
the Board on his recommendations.
4.04      The Government has agreed that an autonomous Authority vill be
set up responsible to the Minister of Equipment and Communications. The
powers and organization of the Authority were discussed with representatives
of the Ministry in October 1969 and the Association'8 views on the required
legislation vere sent to the Government in December. A copy of draft legis-
lation has been received which gives an appropriate degree of autonomy to
the proposed TPA. It ie an agreed condition of effectiveness of the Credit
that this legislation and regulations shall have been enacted. It was also
agreed that TPA will be established in a form acceptable to the Association
and the new Director General appointed (para. 4.06) by April 1, 1971, fail-
ing which credit diabursements above US$400,000 would be suspended.



- 10 -
4.05      A study will be needed to determine the replacement and depreciated
value of the port's fixed assets in order to produce an opening balance
sheet for TPA. Provision for financing such a study is included in the
project. In this connection, the Government agreed that the present bound-
aries of the port will be changed to reduce the area of land presently oc-
cupied (Map 3 and para. 3.13).
4.06      The Government and the Association consider that the top manage-
ment of the New Port Authority must have considerable experience in port
administration, operation and finance. It has therefore been agreed that
initially TPA's Director General and the new Chief Accountant and Chief
Traffic Manager be technical assistance appointees with suitable local
counterparts; provision for such technical assistance for each post for a
three-year period has been included in the proposed project. Similar provi-
sion has also been made for a Chief Training Officer and two assistants
(para. 5.09). The Director General will be appointed and make recommenda-
tions for the other appointments as soon as possible; they and the required
counterpart staff will be acceptable to the Association and the Association
will be consulted on their replacements in due course.
5. THE PROJECT
5.01      The project consists of the first phase of the Master Plan for the
port of Tamatave, which was developed as a result of the hydrological,
engineering and economic studies previously referred to (para 1.01). Its
principal elements are extension of the breakwater and improvements and
extensions to existing piers; a few minor amendments have been made such
as the addition of two warehouses, variations in road and rail layout, and
the surfacing of some stacking areas. The present acheme is expected to
cover requirements until about 1979. Technical assistance in management
and accounting is also included. The Master Plan provides for future
extensions, the phasing of which will depend upon future traffic growth.
5.02      The project items and their estimated cost are indicated below
and described in detail in Annex 4.

Cost Estimates
5.03      The cost estimates are based on preliminary engineering designs
and are realistic; those for the breakwater are based on previous contract
prices and include an allowance for possible storm damage during construc-
tion; those for the remaining construction items and for equipment and con-
sulting services are in line with prices obtained recently for similar
contracts.
5.04      The total cost of the deep-water tanker mooring, sea-line, land-
line and fire-fighting equipment is FMG 550 million. The cost of the
land-line (FMG 250 million) is to be provided by the companies owning the
refinery. It has been agreed that construction of the tanker mooring will
not commence until appropriate arrangements acceptable to the Association
have been made for financing the land-line.
5.05      Engineering contingencies are 15% on all civil engineering con-
struction works to be carried out with credit funds, 5% on cargo-handling
equipment, and 10% on technlcal services; price escalation of 3% per annum
was allowed on the estimated expenditure over the period mid-1970 to December
1973. The project will be subject to a 6% local tax on construction and con-
sulting services. This tax, estimated to total FMG 202 million, has been
excliided from the cost estimates but included in the financial forecasts.
5.06      The estimated overall foreign exchange component of the project,
excluding the cost of the land-line and local constructLon taxes, is about
60%.
Local Currency Costs
5.07      Excluding the cost of the land-line to the refinery, some FMG
500 million of the local currency cost of the project will be provided by
TPA, and the balance of FMG 1,495 million will be provided by the Govern-
ment (para. 7.13).
Procurement
5.08      Contracts for procurement of equipment and execution of civil
engineering and other works to be financed under the credit, will be let
in accordance with the Association's procedure for international competi-
tive bidding.
Consultant Services
5.09      Consulting Engineers -- BCEOM (French) -- have been employed to
prepare the Master Plan for the port and have carried out some preliminary
engineering. It is logical for these consultants to undertake final engi-
neering, prepare contract documents and supervise the work, as is the
Government's intention, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Associa-
tion. Reference has previously been made to the technical assistance re-



- 13 -
quirements of the project (para. 4.06). Consultants vill al8o be required
to revalue port assets and carry out tariff studies (para. 7.19).
Diabursement Procedure
5.10      Disbursement will be made to finance (a) the foreign exchange
component of civil works for the breakwater and pier construction, for
improvement to existing piers, stacking areas and road and rail layout, on
the basis of an agreed percentage; (b) for the c.i.f. cost of cargo-handiïng
equipment; and (c) the foreign exchange cost of consultant services and
technical assistance. The works are expected to be completed in about
three and a half years. Assuming the Credit l8 effective by October 31,
1970, the estimated disbursement schedule is:
US$ Million
1970                         0.20
1971                         1.60
1972                         4.10
1973                         3.70
Total                        9.60
Excess Funds
5.11      Should the full amount of the Credit not be expended on completion
of all items in the project, it is recommended that consideration be given
to extending the technical assistance which the Association vill finance.
This should be subject to a satisfactory report by Association supervision
missions on the effectivenesa of the program.
6. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic
6.01      The economy of the Malagasy Republic is highly dependent on
foreign trade. Handling 35% of the country's exporte and 75% of its
imports, Tamatave is by far the island's most important port and plays a
key role in the development of agriculture, commerce and industry.
6.02      In 1967, traffie through Tamatave amounted to 391,000 tons of
dry cargo of which 68,000 tons was coastal and transshipment traffic, and
617,000 tons of petroleum products (Table 1). Figures for 1968 vere 463,000
tons of dry cargo and 674,000 tons of petroleum products. Results for the
first six months of 1969 indicate a total volume of 530,000 tons of dry
cargo for the whole year. Traffic forecasts were prepared by the consult-
ants. They are realistic and with some minor modifications, have been used
in the economlc evaluation (Table 4).



- 14 -
6.03      General dry cargo traffic, excluding rice, bananas and fertilizer,
is expected to grow at about 4% per annum between 1968-1974. This rate is
somewhat below the post-independence annual trend of 5.5% but is consistent
with the planned GNP growth of 4% per annum during the second Five Year
Plan Period (1970-1974), and the expected growth rate evaluated by the
recent Bank Economic Mis£ion. The traffic in a number of specific commodi-
ties, chromites, rice, fertilizer imports, bananas, and petroleum products,
discussed in Annex 5 is expected to grow at substantially higher rates
during this period.
6.04      These developments are expected to increase dry cargo traffic
from 463,000 tons in 1968 to abut 820,000 tons in 1974. Thereafter, it
is estimated to grow at 5% until the end of the decade. Petroleum products
are expected to reach ir0 million tons in 1979.
B. Costs and Benefits
6.05      The project is deslgned to increase the capacity and improve the
onerating efficiency of the port.  Its principal benefits will be:
i)   faster turnarolind time for ships in port;
ii)   reduction in anticipated ship-waiting times, which will rise
sharply if port capacity îs not increased; and
iiî)   reduction in shipping costS for petroleum products.
6.06      For the purpose of the economic analysis, four major components
(Table 7) of the project were considered separately:
Component 1: consists of those investments aimed at increasing
the productivity of existing berths; the widening of berth B,
with a new transit shed, two warehouses, stacking areas, mechanical
equipment, and improved road layout.
Component II: extension of the breakwater by 150 m which would be
the required extension to enable Pier C to be extended by 75 m,
and increase its capacity to two deep-water berths; ancillary works
such as transit shed, handling equipment and minor lmprovements to
roads and stacking areas.
Component III: the remainder of the breakwater extension, 75 m, to
give 225 m total length, extension of Pier C by a further 170 m, i.e,
one additional berth, one transit shed, and related cargo-handling
equipment.
Component IV:  provision of a new offshore buoy berth for handling
petroleum products, and its related land-line to the refinery.



- 15 -
As explained in Annex 5, the criterion adopted for the economic
justification of the project is the firet year economic return.
For the project as a whole, the first year return is 19% in 1974.
The results for the four major components are as follows (see
also Tables 5, 6 and 8 and Annex 5):
Component       I              41%
II              18%
III               10%
IV              16%
The internal rate of return, calculated over the expected economic
life of the project, would only be lower than the first year return
of 19%, if traffic were to fall and remain below the firet year
level. This is not expected to happen.
6.07      The firet year economic return for Component III is 10Z.  Our
best estimate is that the opportunity cost of capital in Malagasy is un-
likely to be higher than this. This component therefore appears to have
a marginal value on the basis of the criterion chosen for project evalua-
tion. A probability analysis was therefore carried out in order to assesa
the effect of changes in key parameters on the economic return. The effect
of changes in the following elements were analyzed; (a) the coat of the
investment; (b) traffic; and (c) productivity. According to this analysis
(Annex 5) there is a substantially higher probabilîty that the first year
return will exceed, rather than fall below, 10%. This component is there-
fore economically juatified at this time.
C. Conclusions
6.08      The evaluation of costs and benefits shows that the proposed
project is economically sound and well justified in size and timing.
Although benefits will accrue, in the first instance, mainly to the ship-
ping industry, an island economy such as Malagasy's cannot afford to
neglect its ports. Insufficient port facilities would certainly result
in surcharges on ocean freight and consequent reductions in the country's
capacity to earn foreign exchange. The project, therefore, constitutes
an important contribution to the economic development of the Malagasy
Republic.
7. FINANCES
A. Rates and Charges
7.01      Prior to 1968 the Directorate received only lump sums annually
from the Chamber of Commerce for rental of certain warehouses in the port,
and FMG 20 million from the National Railway. In January 1968 it started
charging: ships for pilotage, tugs and berthing; consignees for merchan-



- 16 -
dise loaded and discharged; and passenger3 for boarding and dis2mbarking.
Under the 1968 contract by which the Railway operates the port, the
Directorate now also receives one-half of the annual eurplus cash revenues
of the Operations Section.
7.02      The Operations Section charges consignees for loading, discharg-
ing, transshipment, storage and equipment rental. Ships are charged for
repairs, water and supplies. The prenent charges vent into effect in 1962.
7.03      Total charges levied by the port for general cargo imports
average FMG 1,225 (US$4.40) per ton; export charges average FMG 900
(US$3.25) per ton.  Tarlffs are not cost-based; charges levied on shipe
are -ery low and there is some tendevcy to favor exporta by means of low
port charges. The general level of charges is not high and there is scope
for increases to improve the financial position of the port; comparable
East African Plarbours Corporation charges are equivalent to about US$10.50
for imports and US$7.00 for exports.
B.  Presant Finances
Past Earnmnge
7.04      Table 9 shows the income account of the Operations Section on a
cash basis for the years 1965 through 1968, the firet six months of 1969
and budget estimates for 1969 and 1970. Increases in operating coots in
1965 and 1966, mainly wage increases, vere not compensated by increased
charges, and the operating ratio increased from 71% în 1965 to 95% in
1967. Increased traffic was handled in 1968 and 1969 with a lesa than
proportionate increase in personnel and other costs, and the operating
ratio improved in 1968 and 1969 to 91% and 84% respectively.
7.05      Table 10 shows the income account of the Directorate for 1967 and
1968 and the first six months of 1969 and budget estimates for 1969 and
1970.
7.06      To give some idea of the operating results of the port as a whole
the combined results of both sections for 1967, 1968 and the firet six montha
of 1969, as well as budget estimates for 1969 and 1970, are summarized in
the table below:
(FMG Millions)
(6 mos)   (estimates)

Operating Expenses                  510.4    605.3    332.6    670.3    676.8
Net Operatîng Revenue (Deficit)    (6.0)    76.1        70.9    141.1    128.6

- 17 -
If 1969 depreciation were calculated on a realistic basis it would be about
FMG 110 million more than the amount included in operating expenses, net
income would be about FMG 30 million and the rate of return on the estimated
value of fixed assets would be only about 1%. As outlined in paragraph 7.09
below, an immediate increase in port charges is needed to produce a reason-
able rate of return on the investment in port facilities and generate a
significant cash contribution to the cost of the project. As shown, it is
expected that the earnings performance achieved in the first half of 1969
will be maintained through 1970.
Balance Sheets
7.07      The Directorate prepares no balance sheets.  Those of the Opera-
tions Section reflect investments in fixed assets at original cost (no de-
preciation was recorded until 1968), give very little information on the
financial position and have therefore not been reproduced here. The only
long-term debt in FMG 88.3 million (US$0.3 million) to Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique. It ls repayable by the year 2001 vith 1% interest
per annum.
C. Future Finances
General
7.08      As described in Chapter 4, the Government is to establish a port
authority to take over the staff, operations, assets and liabilities of
the Directorate, and Operations Section. It was assumed that TPA would
commence operations April 1, 1971. The financial projections made for TPA
are discussed below:
Proiected Earnings
7.09      Table 11 gives the projected TPA income account for the period
1971-1978; assumptions underlying the projections are detailed in the
appended notes. On the expenditure side, allowance has been made for
increases in labor and material to handle the increased traffic and main-
tain the expanded port facilities, offset by economies from increased
productivity and the higher scale of operations. No allowance is made for
anticipated increases in the prices of labor and material, since these are
assumed to be offset as necessary by tariff adjustments. On this basis,
anticipated total operating expenditure vill increase by about 40% in
the eight-year period while dry-cargo tonnage should increase by about 55%.
7.10      Revenue projections are based on the traffic forecast (Table 4)
and the present schedule of charges, increased (except for petroleum prod-
ucts, for which a new, cost-based tariff was estimated) as follows:



- 18 -
(a)  12-1/2% as a condition of effectiveness of the Credit to yield
a 7% rate of return on the investment in port facilities by
1972; and
(b)  A further 12-1/2% increase when the project facilities come
into use to offset the increased depreciation and maintenance
costs of the new facilities and yield a satisfactory return on
average net fixed assets in use.
7.11      On these bases the forecast income account (Table 11) may be
summarized as follows:

Between 1971-1978 the operating ratio is estimated to improve from 86% to
71% which is a satisfactory ratio for ports. Annual debt service would
be covered in each year at least twice by cash generated. After the
project is completed the rate of return on fixed assets is expected to
increase from 4% in 1974 to above 7% in 1978.

7.13      The proceeds of the credit will be relent by the Government to
TPA under a subsidiary loan agreement the terms and conditions of which will
be acceptable to the Association. The relending terms will be: a 24-year
loan, including four years grace, wlth interest at 3/4 of 1% per annum for
the firet four years and 7% thereafter. The decision to charge only 3/4 of
1% during the grace period was designed to minimize the Governuient's con-
tribution to the coste of the project and to enable TPA to build-up its
financial strength. Of the borrowing required in the period 1971-1973 it
is estimated that FMG 2,540 million (US$9.2 million equivalent) will be
available from the IDA Credit (FMG 110 million - US$0.4 million equivalent
- would be disbursed prior to the establishment of TPA); and the Government
has agreed to provide FMG 1,495 million as a contribution to its equity in
TPA.
7.14      While construction i  proceeding only minor capital expenditure
outside the project should be required, and during negotiations assurances
vere obtained that auch expenditure will not exceed FMG 30 million
(US$108,000) per annum without prior approval of the Association.
7.15      Internally generated cash resources in 1974-1978 would be suffi-
cient to cover debt service, build-up sufficient cash for working capital
and to pay about 50% of the estimated cost of the next major expansion in
1979/1980. In this connection, the Government has agreed that no dividende
will be distributed in any year until TPA has met its debt service require-
mente and contributed at least 25% of its net operating revenue for such
year to a Port Development Reserve Account.
7.16      Balance sheet projections are shown in Table 13 and the assump-
tions on which they are based are detailed in the appended notes; pro forma
earned surplus statements are given in Table 14. The estimated present
values of existing buildings, equipment, floating craft and Pier C were
based on historical costs adjusted to allow for price changes since acqui-
sition. The values of other exïsting port assets and accumulated deprecia-
tion on all fixed assets were estimated by the appraisal team. Additions
were at estimated cost. The long-term debts of the Operations Section will
be assumed by TPA (para. 7.07). Agreement was obtained during negotiations
that approval of the lenders will be obtained prior to the signing of the
credit agreement. The results of balance sheet projections are highlighted
below:

7.17      This indicates a good financial position.  Net working capital
includes about FMG 800 million (US$2.9 million equivalent) in cash available
for reinvestment at the end of 1978. The debt/equity ratio will have declined
to 34% of total capitalization allowing sufficient scope for borrowing for
the next phase of expansion.
Financial Rate of Return and Tariff Covenant
7.18      During negotiations agreement vas obtained that port charges will
be increased by 12-1/2% as a condition of effectiveness and that, thereafter,
the tariff structure would be progressively revised so that tariffs would
more nearly reflect service coats. AisO, by this and other means such as
reduction in costs, the Government agreed that the port would earn a rate
of at least 4% per annum on the net value of its fixed assets in 1974 and
1975, 5% in 1976 and 1977 and 7% in 1978.
7.19      The consultants' study to revalue fixed assets is expected to
take about three months and should be completed by March 31, 1971. There-
after costing studies for the purpose of tariff revision will commence.
Agreement was reached to review the report and recommendations of the
study with the Association and introduce by January 1, 1974 the changes
required to achieve agreed financial rates of return (see para. 7.18).
Auditing
7.20      The accounts of both the Directorate and the Operations Section
are audited by the Accouating Agent of the Ministry of Equipment and Com-
munications. This is a Government, as opposed to commercial, audit which
offers no assistance in preparing the financial statements or improving
accounting procedures. Agreement vas obtained during negotiations
that TPA will retain qualified independent auditors acceptable to the



- 21 -
Association to carry out a commercial audit of its accounts and to furnish
the Association such audited statements, reports and other financial infor-
mation, in such scope and detail, as the Association shall reasonably
request.
Insurance
7.21      At present, the port, as a Government organization, has only
carried insurance on buildings and their contents. Assurances were
obtained that the port would take out insurance with responsible insurers
against auch risks and in such amounts as are consistent with sound business
practice. This would include insurance against marine, personal accident
and other commercial risks.
8.  RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Satisfactory draft legialation establishing a Tamatave Port
Authority has been received from the Government and its adoption by the
Malagasy parliament is a condition of the effectiveness of the credit
(para. 4.04). An additional condition of effectiveness is a 12-1/2% in-
crease in port charges (para. 7.10).
8.02      In addition to the standard Association requirements for bidding
and procurement procedures, appointing and retaining consultants and inde-
pendent and qualified auditors, the following principal points have been
discussed and agreed with the Government:
(a) Submission of a training program embracing all phases of
cargo-handling for the Association's approval and its
subsequent implementation (para. 3.17);
(b) Location of new port boundary (para. 4.05);
(c)  Initial appointment of technical assistance personnel to fill
posts of Director General, Chief Accountant, Chief Traffic
Manager and Officers to run the Training Program under the
proposed Technical Assistance (para. 4.06);
(d) Relending the proceeds of credit to TPA on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association and provision of
local currency for project works (para. 7.13);
(e)  Revision of tariffs, after the initial 12-1/2% increase, to
reflect costs and achieve agreed financial rates of return
(para. 7.18 and 7.19);
8.03      An additional condition is that TPA shall be established and its
Director General appointed by April 1, 1971, failing which diabursement of
the credit would be limited to US$400,O00 (para. 4.04).



- 22 -
8.04      The project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
US$9.6 million to the Government of Malagasy Republiç on the usual terms.
The proceeds will be relent to the proposed Tafatgve Port Authority for a
term of 24 years including a four-year grace period with interest of 3/4 of
1Z per annum during the grace period and 7% per annum thereafter.

REPUBLIC OF MALAGASY
APPRAISAL OF TAMATAVE PORT PROJECT
Description of the Existing Port
The existing port is located behind the "Recif de la Pointe" and
is further protected by an existing breakwater some 450 m long, based on
this reef, and built out in a northerly direction towards the "Grand Recif".
Its height i8 generally + five m with tetrapod armoring on the seaward side
up to + seven m. The distance from the end of the breakwater to the "Grand
Recif" is about 700 m (Map 2).
When heavy swells are experienced they break over the top of
the breakwater at high water, and to disperse this "overspill" an evacuation
channel has been made between the breakwater and Pier C.
Access to the port is either via the southern entrance through
the gap between the breakwater and the "Grand Recif" with a minimum depth of
i1 m, or from the north behind the "Grand Recif" with a minimum depth of 20
m. Mean spring tide range is about one m.
The port can be divided into two areas -- the service port and
the commercial port.
The service port is the original construction and has two basins,
one 130 m by 60 m and the other 160 m by 60 m, separated by a jetty 150 m
long and 60 m wide. It is used only by lighters and tugs and some fishing
vessels. The depth of water available îs two - three m. There is also a
amall slipway.
The commercial port has three piers which provide three deep-
water berths and the coaster berths as follows:

105 m by 55 m
Coaster Berths are locatetd on Pier A West.



ANNEX ].
Page 2
The existing oil berth is located at the end of Pier B where both
coastal and deep-sea tankers berth stern to the end of the pier; only one
vessel can be accommodated at a time.
At the foot of these piers is a large service area (190,000 m2)
in which all the port sheds other than those on the piers themselves are
located.  Its center is some 350 m from the foot of Pier A, 275 m from
Pier B and 350 m from Pier C.  It contains eleven warehouses.
Nos. 6 and 7              Tranashipment warehouses
Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11         Each 1,300 m2 and very old
Nos. 12 and 13            Each 1,350 m2 and in poor condition
Nos. 14 and 15            Each 2,000 m2 and in fair condition
All these warehouses have their floors one m above road levels.
No. 16 is a modern shed of 6,600 m2. Its floor is also raised
above road level but mechanical equipment can enter by end ramps. The
shed is served by railway.
There are also a number of open-stacking areas and some open-sided
sheds. The area behind Pier C and north of Shed 16 is used to stock chromite.
An overhead conveyor from this area to Pier C and a mechanical loader is in
the course of erection. Finally, there is a large area at the southern end
of the port containing the exchange railway sidinge for marshalling port
trains and some old sheds similar to Shed Nos. 6-15 which are leased to the
local Chamber of Commerce. To the east of the service area and south of
Shed 16 is a block-making yard which contains a Titan block-setting crane
which could be useful for breakwater repairs or construction.

REPUBLIC OF MALAGASY
APPRAISAL OF TAMATAVE PORT PROJECT
Description of Project Items
Breakwater Extension (Map 3)
1.        SOGREAH investigated various alternative breakwater lengths in
two possible alignments and concluded that an extension of the existing
breakwater along its present line by 225 m would ensure undisturbed con-
ditions at the existing wharves and permit an extension of 245 m to Pier
C and 570 m to Pîer A.  The breakwater will be of rock fill type generally
to level plus five m with 10 m3 tetrapod armoring on the seaward aide to
plus 7 m.
Extension to Pier C and lmprovement of Pier B (Map 3)
2.        The Master Plan prepared by BCEOM recommenda a 245 m extension
to Pier C to provide a total of three berths as the least coet solution
for the firat phase development of the port; also, filling behind the
existing Pier B s0 that, after demolition of the existing transit shed,
the quay apron can be widened. The extended Pier C will have a concrete
block quay wall. Under the present project, depth alongside will be
10.5 m; however, it will be designed to be dredged to 12 m.  Pier A will
not be altered in the present project.
Transit Sheds and Warehouses (Map 3)
3.        Two new transit sheds -- 105 m long -- are to be constructed on
the extended Pier C, and a new shed -- 140 m long -- on Pier B. Each will
be 55 m wide, single span. Two new warehouses will al0 be provided, one
for transshipment, and one for export cargo; there will al0 be 55 m single
span construction but only 70 m and 80 m long respectively due to site
conditions. Existing sheds Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 will be demolished to
enable the warehouses to be built.
Mechanical Equipment
4.        The mechanical equipment to be provided is detailed in Annex 2,
which also indicates the total equipment, available at the end of 1973,
which will be under 10 years old.

Deep-water Tanker MoorinR, Sea-line. Land-line. and Fire-FiRhting
Ecquipment (Map 2)
5.        Tankers now using the port are limited to 20,000 dwt in size.
They presently moor in the middle of the harbor, off thé end of Pier B, and
constitute a considerable safety hazard. The new tanker mooring buoy will
be located north of Tanio Point.  It will permit tankers up to 65,000 dwt
to be moored and be protected from ocean swells by the "Grand Recif". It
will be some 1,350 m off-shore and a 26" sea-line will connect the mooring
to the mainland. Depth of water at the new mooring buoy will be 20 m.
6.        To connect the new mooring to the existing refinery, it will be
necessary to lay a 5.3 km landline of 26" pipe.  This is not financed by
the credit, but is essential to connect the new mooring with the refinery.
7.        Because of the quantities exported, the distance from the refinery
to the new mooring, and the need to provide a number of pipelines for various
products, the small size coastal tankers exporting refined products will
continue to be handled at the head of Pier B. Provision of adequate fire-
fighting equipment on this pier is included in the credit.
Improvements to Stacking Area, Roada and Railway Tracks (Map 3)
8.        The stacking area adjacent to Piers B and C will be resurfaced
so that mobile cranes can operate; improvements to roade and railway tracks
comprise minor realignments and resurfacing.
9.        Consulting services will be provided for final engineering of the
project and for its supervision; also to make a valuation of the port's
fixed assets and to assist in revising the achedule of port charges.
10.       Technical assistance will provide each of the following officers
for a three year period: Director General, Chief Accountant, Chief Traffic
Manager, Chief Training Officer, and two Assistant Training Officers.

activity close to the 1968 level.
2. Traffic
Three distinct trends can be distinguished for dry cargo traffic
since 1952 (Table 3):
i)   The pre-independence period between 1952-1958 when
traffic was static, averaging 370,000 tons per annum;
ii)   1959-1961, the last year of colonial rule and the first
two years after independence when the annual average
dropped to 307,000 tons; and
iii)   1962-1968, when traffic recovered at about 5.5% per
annum.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
These trends are subJect to considerable annual fluctuations,
due to the predominance of agricultural commodities in the country's
exporta. In the future, theue fluctuations are expected to decrease as
the proportion of non-agricultural goode handled by the port increases.
In 1967, traffic through Tamatave amounted to 391,000 tons of
dry cargo of which 68,000 tons were coastal and transshipment traffic, and
617,000 tons were petroleum products (Table 1). Figures for 1968 were
463,000 tons of dry cargo and 674,000 tons of petroleum products. Resulte
for the firet six monthe of 1969 indicate a total volume of 530,000 tons
of dry cargo for the whole year.
Traffic forecasts were prepared by the consultants. They are
realistic and with some minor modifications, have been used in the economic
evaluation (Table 4). They vere prepared on the assumption that Tamatave
will continue to be Malagasy's principal port, a valid assumption since
there are no suitable alternative port sites on the east coast and none of
the existing ports are expected to offer Tamatave serious competition.
General dry cargo traffic, excluding rice, bananas and fertilizer,
is expected to grow at about 4% per annum between 1968-1974. This rate is
somewhat below the post-independence annual trend of 5.5Z but is consistent
with the planned GNP growth of 4% per annum during the second Five Year Plan
Period (1970-1974), and the expected growth rate evaluated by the recent
Bank Economic Mission.
A number of specific commodities, however, will grow at substan-
tially higher rates over this period:
(a) Chromites
A mine about 200 km northwest of Tamatave started production
in 1969 at the rate of 100,000 tons of exportable ore per
annum. Production is expected to reach 160,000 tons in 1972.
A possible further increase to 200,000 tons by 1974 has not
been taken into account.
(b) Rice
Mainly as a result of an irrigation project recently appraised
by the Association in Lake Alaotra, rice exports are expected
to increase from the present 20,000 tons to about 80,000 tons
in 1974.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(c) Fertilizer Importa
The Government expects non-nitrate fertilizer importe to
increase from the present 10,000 ton level to 80,000 tons
by 1972. While Malagasy agriculture could undoubtedly use
even larger amounts of these fertilizers, imports are not
expected to exceed 55,000 tons by 1974.
(d) Bananas
The Second Five Year Plan forecasts banana exports will grow
from the present 20,000 to 65,000 tons by 1972. However,
because of possible marketing difficulties, the forecasts
were reduced to 40,000 tons by 1974.
(e) Petroleum Products
A refinery has been in operation in Tamatave since 1967 and
importe of some 500,000 tons of crude oil and exporta of
about 210,000 tons of heavy fuel and 130,000 tons of refined
products -- 840,000 tons in all -- are expected for 1970.
Due to increased domestic consumption port traffic will
drop to 800,000 tons by 1974 but is expected to increase at
5% per annum thereafter.
These developments are expected to increase dry cargo traffic from 463,000
tons in 1968 to about 820,000 tons in 1974. Thereafter, it is estimated to
grow at 5% until the end of the decade. Petroleum products are expected to
reach 1.0 million tons in 1979.
B. Economic Analvais
1. Introduction
The project is deaigned to increase the capacity and improve the
operating efficiency of the port. Its principal benefits vill be:
1)   faster turnaround time for ahipa in port;
ii)   reduction in anticipated ship-waiting time, which will
rime sharply if port capacity is not increased; and
iii)   reduction in ahipping costa for petroleum products.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
The extent of future ship-waiting time, as a function of exist-
ing capacity and expected traffic growth, has been evaluated by the consul-
tants on the basis of a study made by the Port of New York Authority
("Solutions, Methods for Waiting Time Problems," 1958) and the relationships
between numbers of berths, berth utilization and ship-waiting times as shown
in Table 5. A separate analysis of future ship-waiting time, based on a
Queuing Theory Model developed ln the Bank, actually shows higher figures
for future waiting time than the consultants' estimates.  The following
economic analysis, tihich is generally based on the consultants' evaluation
of port capacity and waiting time is, therefore, considered to represent
a conservative estimate of future port congestion and of the economic
benefits to be expected from the proposed project.
The calculations clearly show that without additional facilities
the port of Tamatave would become completely congested by 1975. With the
growth of waiting time and the corresponding increase in shipping costs,
demand for port services would be bound to suffer as export markets were
lost and imports decreased, so that the penalties for being late in expand-
ing capacity would be extremely high. Under conditions of congestion the
investment decision is mainly one of optimum timing and the appropriate
criterion in this case is the first year economic return. According to
this criterion, the return on the investment (including the economic cost
of capital tied up during construction) during the first year of operation
of the new facilities should be at least equal to the opportunity cost of
capital in Malagasy. If this criterion is met no benefits could be gained
from postponing the project.
2. Productivity
Before evaluating the benefits of the project, the extent to
which present port productivity could be improved through managerial and
operational reforms, not requiring investments, was assessed. Present
productivity per ship day for ocean-going ships averages 348 tons for
exports, 472 tons for imports and 245 tons for coasters. These rates are
low and can be improved by (a) increasing the number of gangs working the
second shift and (b) improvements in cargo-handling techniques. Further,
the average size of cargo shipped is expected to increase. The overall
result is expected to be a cumulative growth of productivity to 285 tons
for coasters, 487 tons for exports and 580 tons for imports by 1974
(Table 6). There is, however, some uncertainty as to whether these producti-
vity increases can be achieved by 1974, immediately upon the opening of the
new facilities and se soon after the expected establishment of TPA. Never-
theless, these productivity figures were used to calculate ship waiting
time.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
3. Costs and Benefits
For the purpose of the economic analysis, four major components
(Table 7) of the project were considered separately:
Component I:  consists of those investments aimed at increasing
the productivity of existing berths: the widening of berth B,
with a new transit shed, two warehouses, stacking areas, mechanical
equipment, and improved road layout.
Component Il:  extension of the breakwater by 150 m which would be
the required extension to enable Pier C to be extended by 75 m, and
increase its capacity to two deep-water berthe; ancillary works
such as transit shed, handling equipment and minor improvements to
roads and stacking areas.
Component III:  the remainder of the breakwater extension, 75 m, to
give 225 m total length, extension of Pier C by a further 170 m,
i.e., one additional berth, one transit shed, and related cargo-
handling equipment.
Component IV:  provision of a new offshore buoy berth for handling
petroleum products, and its related land-line to the refinery.
Component I
The economic cost is US$3.4 million (Table 7). These improvements
will increase the productivity of existing berths to 296 tons for
coasters, 506 tons for exporte and 598 tons for imports (Table 6).
For 1974 traffic, ship-waiting time would be reduced by about 1,000
ship days and produce savings valued at US$1.4 million (Table 8).
The first year economic return is about 41%. There are two causes
for this rather high result: (a) the investments are relatively
small; (b) even after the operational and managerial improvements
described above, the berth occupancy ratio would still
have been 94% in 1974, which means heavy congestion; with the
investments under this heading it is expected to drop to 91% causing
a relatively large reduction in ahip-waiting time.
Component II
The economic cost is US$7.5 million (Table 7). It will (a) insure
the full protection of the existing facilities from wave action and
(b) add one-half berth. As a result of this additional capacity
the berth occupancy ratio is expected to decline further, reducing
ship vaiting by about 980 ship days, a saving of about US$1,378,000
(Table 8). This gives a firet year of economic return corresponding
to 18%.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
ComPonent III
The economic cost is US$4.5 million (Table 7). It vill add a fifth
deep-water berth thereby reducing ship-working time by an additional
324 days (Table 8). The first year economic return is 10%. Our
best estimate is that the opportunity cost of capital in Malagasy
is unlikely to be higher than this. This component therefore appears
to have a marginal value on the basis of the criterion chosen for
project evaluation. A probability analysis was therefore carried
out in order to assess the effect of changes in key parameters on
the economic return. The effect of changes in the cost of the
investment, traffic and productivity were analyzed.
Investment Costs
The upper limit of possible increases in investment cost was taken
as +5% and the possibility of reduction as -10%, bearing in mind
the contingency allowances already made in arriving at investment
costs.
Traffic Forecasta
The revised traffic forecasts are best estimates. Accordingly
there is an equal probability that actual results will fall short
of or exceed forecasts by equal amounts. Given the element of
uncertainty in even the most carefully prepared forecasts a variation
range of + 25% was chosen for the probability analysis.
Productivity
As a result of increases in the number of gangs on the second
shift, and better management it was assumed that productivity
will increase by 20% between 1970-1974, although existing evidence
suggests that productivity has been static since independence after
an initial decline. In view of the rather low existing productivity
levels it should not be difficult to achieve the additional 20%
but there are substantial doubts as to whether this can be achieved
by 1974. For the purpose of the probability analysis it vas assumed
that a 20% increase is the upper limit for 1974 and 10% was the lower
limit.
Taking the more conservative of each one of the three assumptions
together a first year return of only 2% vas arrived at which is
unsatisfactory. The upper limits combined would result in 100%
berth occupancy, which means that an additional berth, not included
in the project, would also be justified. However, both these
cases are extreme and very unlikely. Assuming a normal distri-
bution of probabilities for each of the above factors a mean pro-
bability value of 13% was arrived at for the first year economic
return for Component III.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
Component IV
The economic cost of constructing the off-shore mooring facility
for tankers is estimated at US$2.5 million (Table 7). The elimina-
tion of large tankers from Pier B, the construction of the new
facility at Tanio Point, and provision of a 26-inch land-line to
the oîl refinery vill reduce ship turnaround time. It now takes
67 hours to handle a 20,000 ton crude oil tanker, the largest
ship which can presently be handled, and thisvwill be reduced to
30 hours. The new facilities will be able to handle tankers of up
to 65,000 dwt; however, with the present volume of petroleum traffic
it i8 not expected that these will exceed 40,000 dwt immediately.
The saving in turnaround time, plus the greater operating efficiency
of 40,000 dwt tankers, will produce savings of US$0.45 per ton of
petroleum products, resulting in a first year economic return of
16% in 1974. This does not include unquantifiable benefits related
to the removal of large oil tankers from their present location
off Pier B, which will significantly reduce operational hazards.

Notes on
TABLE 11
Page 1
REPUBLIC OF MALAGASY
APPRAISAL OF TAMATAVE PORT PROJECT
Forecast Income Account 1971-1978
Operating Revenue
1. Traffic Growth
Revenue from wharfage, cargo-handling and equipment rentals is
estimated to increase proportionately to traffic growth, as projected in
this report, Table 4. The present charges of the Port Directorate and
Operations Section were applied except for oil-handling for which a new,
cost-based tariff was estimated.
Revenues from other sources are expected to increase more slowly,
in consonance with past experience.
2.  Increases in Tariff Charges
Increases are assumed to take place as follows:
(a) 12-1/2% at the beginning of 1971 to produce a reasonable rate
of return on average net fïxed assets and to generate cash
resources to enable the port to make a reasonable contri-
bution to the coBt of the project;
(b) A further 12-1/2% increase to take place when the project
facilities come into use at the beginning of 1974 to
offset the additional coste of depreciation and mainte-
nance and enable the port to earn a satisfactory rate of
return (7%) in the fifth year of operation of the new
facility in 1978;
Operating Expenditure
1. Staff Costs
Analysis of staff costs of the Port Directorate and Operations
Section indicates they are 52% variable with traffic volume <excluding
petroleum and chromites). No improvement in productivity is expected until



Notes on
TABLE 11
Page 2
the project facility is completed and a 202 increase is expected to occur,
10% in 1974 and 10% in 1975. The effect of these two factors is incorpora-
ted in the cost projection. The cost of additional staff for the tug being
acquired and also to handle chromite traffic, vas estimated separately.
No allowance is made for increases in wage and salary levels on the assump-
tion that such increases would be offset by raising port charges. General
wage increases averaging about 10% were granted in 1966 and again in 1967
by the Operations Section but no general increase has been given since.
2. Materials and Supplies. Electricity and Water
Only a part of these costs should increase proportionately to
the volume of traffic. No allowance was made for increases in the prices
of these inputs. The prices of materials have gone up about 4% per annum
on average since 1962.
3. Maintenance and Repairs
These costs are expected to increase in proportion to the value
of the investment in fixed assets.
4. Administrative and Other Expenses
Only a minor part of these costs should increase proportionately
to the volume of traffic through the port. Allowance was made for the costs
of additional insurance to cover marine, personal accident and commercial
risks.
5.   Taxes
Municipal (urban) taxes are 1% of the value of fixed assets each
year; net book value Was used to estimate this tax. Other local taxes
are based on the rental value of port buildings. Transactions tax (taxe
unique sur les transactions) is 6% of total port revenues. Income tax
(impot sur les benefices divers) are 31% of all net profits after deducting
provisions for bad debts, etc. Alsao up to 50% of amounts invested within
the three previous years can be deducted 80 that it is expected that TPA
would not have income subject to such tax until 1978.
6.   Depreciation of Fixed Assets
Depreciation is calculated on replacement cost and the service
lives of the various classes of assets as outlined in the notes on Table 13.
7.        No provision has been made for additional revenues that may be
earned from projected cash surpluses either from interest on deposits or
revenues from other investments.

REPUBLIC OF MALAGASY
APPRAISAL OF TAMATAVE PORT PROJECT
Notes on Balance Sheet
Note 1. Fixed Assets. Only the fixed assets within the revised port limite
referred to in 4.05 of this report are included.
The bases of valuation are:
(a)  Land.  The cost of fill which builda up the reef on which the
port is built, as estimated by the appraisal mission. This
exceeds the market value of property in the port area.
(b) Roads and Stacking Areas at replacement cost as estimated by
the appraisal mission, plus additions at estimated cost.
<c) Breakwater. The existing breakwater at replacement cost as
estimated by the mission, based on actual quantities and
unit prices used in estimating the cost of the breakwater
extension, plus additions at estimated cost.
(d) Wharves. Pier C, at historical cost adjusted to allow for
changes in the cost of labor and materials since construc-
tion; other wharves at replacement coat estimated by the
appraisal mission, plus additions at estimated cost.
(e)  BuildinRs. Equipment and Floating Craft on the basis of
historical cost8 provided by the port administration
adjusted by the mission, tO allow for changes in prices
since dates of acquisition, plus additions at estimated
cost. Chromite-handling equipment and a tug to be delivered
in 1970 have been included at contract purchase price and
FMG 30 million has been included for estimated equipment
acquisitions in 1970.
(f) Additions After 1970. Additions apart from the project
were estimated to be FMG 30 million (US$108,000) annually
during the construction period (para. 6.11). Commencing in
1974 annual additions were estimated to be FMG 75 million
(US$270,000), an ample allowance.



Notes on
TABLE 13
Page 2
(g) Taxes. Included in projects costs ls a 6% local tax payable
on all civil worka contracts and engineering con8ulting
services. The tax does not apply to materials directly im-
ported or to the salaries of technical assistance personnel.
Note 2. Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated straight-line depreciation,
calculated on values determined as described in Note 1 using the following
service lives:
Years
Equipment                                  5-25
Buildings, surface stacking areas            40
Breakwater                                   60
Wharves                                      50
Tanker Mooring                               25
Note 3. Current Assets.
(a) Cash. When the Port of Tamatave i established as an
autonomous entity, it should be endowed with adequate
working capital cash. It was assumed that this would
amount to FMG 60 million (US$216,000). The Government
has agreed that TPA's cash and cash investments will
amount to at least 12% of its operating expenditures,
commencing in 1974.
(b) Debtors. It was assumed that on the average about one-
sixth of cargo-handling charges would be outstanding
and that ships would take about one month to settle
their accounts.
(c) Materials and Supplies. By better planning of purchases
the port could reduce inventories eventually from the
present level, equal to one year's expenses, to an estimated
nine months' expenses.
(d) Creditors and Accrued CharRes. It was assumed that these
would equal 5% of expenses excluding depreciation.
Note 4.  Deferred Expenses.  Technical Assistance financed under the
project was written off against Retained Surplus in five equal amounts in
the years 1974-1978.



Notes on
TABLE 13

Note 5. Long-term Debt. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the
Port on Bank lending terme, i.e., the loan would be repaid in forty equal
semi-annual payments after a four-year grace period with interest at an
assumed 7%. Interest during the grace period would be at 314%, the same as
the service charge for the credit. TPA will take over the Operations
Section's obligation to pay the debt to Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (FMG 88.3 million at end 1968) and a further debt to this same
institution in the amount of FMG 50 million being incurred in acquiring
chromite-handling equipment. This latter loan is repayable in equal pay-
ments over ten years after one year of grace, with interest at 5%. It was
assumed that the difference between the book value of port assets and the
liabilities assumed by TPA would be Government equity in TPA.
Note 6. Contribution for Capital Investments. It was agreed that funds
required by the port for capital investuent would be paid by the Govern-
ment as equity in TPA.
Note 7. Port Development Reserve Account. The Government agreed that no
dividend shall be distributed in any fiscal year untîl TPA has met its debt
service requirements and contributed at least 25% of its net operating
revenue to a Port Development Account. It was assumed that 25% of net oper-
ating revenue was transferred to such an account commencing in 1974.
Note 8. Dividends. It was assumed that dividende were paid to the extent
