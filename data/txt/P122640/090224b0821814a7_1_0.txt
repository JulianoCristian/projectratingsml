                         requests on October 17 and 27, 2011, to provide necessary resources to respond to the impact of the tropical depression 12E that affected the whole Central America region and
                         more seriously El Salvador. The Project continues to make progress towards its Development Objective (PDO) to enhance the capacity of the Government to implement its disaster
                         risk management program. The Bank has maintained an open dialog on DRM issues with the country and verified that the operation is successfully supporting two key policy areas of
                         El Salvador's Disaster Risk Management Program: (i) strengthening of the DRM institutional and legal framework, and (ii) mainstreaming disaster risk in the National Development
                         and Investment Programs.

                         From April to November 2013, the GoES has continued to make important progress on its DRM program. Among other things, the National Plan for Civil Protection, Prevention, and
                         Mitigation is being strengthened in terms of prevention and rehabilitation and the National Seismic Contingency Plan was tested through simulations in over 90 municipalities,
                         including the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador. Key ministries such as MARN, MOP, MINED, MINSAL and MH are incorporating risk management considerations in their work
                         agenda and coordinate their DRM work.
