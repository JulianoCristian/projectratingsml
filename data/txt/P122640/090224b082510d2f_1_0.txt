                         requests on October 17 and 27, 2011, to provide necessary resources to respond to the impact of the tropical depression 12E that affected the whole Central America region and
                         more seriously El Salvador. The Project continues to make progress towards its Development Objective (PDO) to enhance the capacity of the Government to implement its disaster
                         risk management program. The Bank has maintained an open dialog on DRM issues with the country to verify that advances in El Salvador's Disaster Risk Management Program are
                         being made in terms of: (i) strengthening of the DRM institutional and legal framework, and (ii) mainstreaming disaster risk in the National Development and Investment Programs.

                         Since the last supervision mission in November 2013, the GoES has continued to make important advances in its DRM program. Among other things, the National Seismic
                         Contingency Plan was tested through a national simulation in May 2014 and the National Commission is in the process of adopting the proposal for the National Policy for Civil
                         Protection and Disaster Prevention. Key ministries such as MARN, MOP, MINED, and MINSAL are incorporating specific activities to enhance disaster risk management in their work
