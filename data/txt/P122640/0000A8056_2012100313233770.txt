                         2011. The DPL with a CAT DDO was fully disbursed due to the need of additional resources to respond to the impact of the tropical depression 12E that affected the whole Central
                         America region and more seriously El Salvador. The Project continues to make significant progress towards its Development Objective - PDO to enhance the capacity of the
                         Government to implement its disaster risk management program. The Bank has maintained an open dialogue on DRM issues with the country and verified that the operation is
                         successfully supporting two key policy areas of El Salvador Disaster Risk Management Program: (i) strengthening of the DRM institutional and legal framework, and (ii)
                         mainstreaming disaster risk in the National Development and Investment Programs.

                         From December 2010 to the present, the GOES has made significant progress on its DRM program: (a) Setting up the Secretary of Vulnerability Affairs (SAV), under the Presidency
                         of the Republic and the implementation of sectoral emergency plans previously approved by the National Committee of Civil Protection, Prevention and Mitigation; (b) Several key
                         ministries are incorporating risk management considerations in their work agenda, e.g. (i) MARN: significant progress in the implementation of the National Risk Reduction Plan, and
                         formulation of a new Environmental Policy that includes Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management; (ii) MOP: the Directorate for Adaptation to Climate Change and
                         Risk Management (DACGER) was established, it works in coordination with other Ministries to implement risk reduction projects in the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador; (iii) The
                         Ministry of Health and Education: the incorporation of risk management considerations into their agendas has continued.
