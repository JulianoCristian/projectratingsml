                         requests on October 17 and 27, 2011, to provide necessary resources to respond to the impact of the tropical depression 12E that affected the whole Central America region and
                         more seriously El Salvador. The Project continues to make significant progress towards its Development Objective (PDO) to enhance the capacity of the Government to implement its
                         disaster risk management program. The Bank has maintained an open dialog on DRM issues with the country and verified that the operation is successfully supporting two key policy
                         areas of El Salvador's Disaster Risk Management Program: (i) strengthening of the DRM institutional and legal framework, and (ii) mainstreaming disaster risk in the National
                         Development and Investment Programs.

                         From September 2012 to April 2013, the GoES has continued to make significant progress on its DRM program. Among other things, the Civil Protection, Prevention and Mitigation
                         National Plan has been updated, and SAV supported the creation and training of civil protection commission at the departmental, municipal and community levels. Key ministries
                         such as MARN, MOP, MINED, MINSAL and MH are incorporating risk management considerations in their work agenda and coordinate their DRM work.
