REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
2iECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE FOR AN
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Singapore for the equivalent of US$25 million to help finance
an Environmental Control Project. The loan would have a term of 19 years
including a grace period of four years with interest at 8-1/2 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Singapore" (No. 263a-SI) was distributed on January 31, 1974.
More recent information on the position of the Singapore economy is given
below. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since Singapore achieved self-government in 1959, it has
overcome a series of political and economic difficulties, including the
confrontation with Indonesia between 1963 and 1965 and the separation
from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965. With entrepot trade contributing
a significant portion of GDP in the early sixties (17.4 percent in 1961),
Singapore was highly exposed to the fluctuations of international trade. In
the mid-1960's, Singapore experienced severe unemployment, which was subse-
quently compounded by the withdrawal of British forces and the resultant
loss of about 50,000 jobs. The Government's response was to adopt a policy
aimed at the rapid development of the manufacturing and service sectors,
encouraging a labor-intensive, but preferably high skilled export-oriented
industry and service mix. To this end it encouraged foreign investment
through the use of fiscal incentives, duty-free import of capital goods and
raw material requirements, and limited tariff protection. Changes in labor
legislation in 1968 ensured a high degree of wage stability and minimized
the possibility of labor unrest.
4.        These policies resulted in rapid growth during the second half
of the 1960's and the early 1970's: GDP grew at an average annual rate of
12 to 13 percent in real terms during the period 1966 to 1972. The manu-
facturing sector increased its share of GDP from 13 percent in 1960 to
22 percent in 1973. Direct foreign investment played the leading role in
this growth, reflecting a high degree of international confidence in Singa-
pore's growth potential. Growth in exports of domestic products has also
been impressive, averaging 26 percent annually in real terms between 1968
and 1974. Meanwhile the share of entrepot trade has declined steadily; this
reflects the growing diversity of the economy, which has resulted in a sub-
stantial increase in retained imports and in domestic exports.
5.        Recently, Singapore's growth has been affected by the worldwide
inflation and recession. In 1973, the rate of growth of GDP in real terms



was 11 percent, but in 1974 it fell to 6.8 percent. The consumer price
index was 26 percent higher in 1973 than in 1972 and increased by 22 percent
in 1974. During 1974, almost 17,000 Singaporean workers lost their jobs.
Unemployment among Singaporeans now stands at about 4 percent. In addition,
of the 100,000 foreign workers on temporary work permits, a substantial
number left for lack of employment. While Singapore is vulnerable to the
economic situation of its trade partners, the impact of the higher oil prices
has been relatively modest. Singapore's balance in the petroleum trade
changed from a 1973 surplus of US$67 million to a deficit of US$44 million
in 1974.
6.        The main conceni of economic policy i-n Singapore is to combat
recession without creating further inflationary pressures. The FY1974
budget showed an estimated deceleration of the revenue growth rate, coupled
with an almost doubling of expenditures, largely because of a threefold in-
crease (in current terms) in allocations to statutory authorities. The re-
sult is an overall budgetary deficit for the first time of US$318 million.
This is a sharp drop from the FY1972 surplus of US$54 million and US$18 mil-
lion in FY1973. The budgett for FY1975 is counter-recessionary in its allo-
cation of more funds for development purposes, with development estimates
of US$968 million, up fromi US$691 million in FY1974. Seventy percent of
these investments is to be undertaken by a group of well run and financially
sound statutory authorities.
7.        The Government has set up a Committee on Profiteering and Inflation
to formulate, coordinate, and implement anti-inflationary and anti-profit-
eering measures. Steps taken include identifying new and cheaper sources of
essential commodities, abolishing import duties on a number of commodities,
official stockpiling of rice and sugar, and instituting a program of consumer
education and information. In addition, the National Trade Union Congress
and other individual groups have opened cooperative supermarkets, with prices
lower than at other retail outlets.
8.        In early 1974, monetary measures taken to check inflation in-
cluded the raising of interest rates and the introduction of selective credit
controls. By mid-1974, the slowdown in growth and tight international li-
quidity induced the authorities to reduce the minimum cash balance for banks
and finance companies, to provide more funds for economic activity, and to
increase interest rates in order to reduce capital outflows from Singapore.
In the fourth quarter, the minimum cash balance was lowered once more, and
interest rates were lowered to align domestic rates with the downward trend
in interest rates abroad. In spite of these expansionary measures, the growth
in money supply, due to a declining demand of the private sector, slowed from
an annual rate of 15 percent at the end of 1973 to 8 percent at the end of
1974.
9.        In an attemp: to control imported inflation, without sacrificing
the basic openness of the economy, the Singapore dollar was allowed to
float, beginning in Jwne 1973. This move has exposed the lack of adequate



-3-
forward exchange facilities, which has forced Singapore's traders to as-
sume considerable exchange risks.
10.       Trade is an important part of Singapore's economy.    In 1974, the
value of imports and exports together was about two and one-half times
the value of GDP. Recession in Singapore's markets has had a negative
impact on Singapore's export earnings. While growing trade deficits have
been offset by surpluses from services and by long-term capital inflows,
the foreign exchange reserves ratio was reduced from six months' worth of
imports in 1973 to about four months in 1974.
11.       Singapore's external public debt position shows US$642 million
outstanding (including undisbursed) as of December 31, 1974. About 21 per-
cent of this is due to the Bank, 16 percent to the Asian Development Bank,
and 17 percent to the UK Government; suppliers' credits represent about
10 percent. The debt service burden was US$40.5 million in 1974, of which
US$12.5 million, or about 31 percent, was due to the Bank. The total debt
service in 1974 represented about 1 percent of domestic exports. By 1978
Singapore's outstanding external debt (including undisbursed) is expected
to reach US$1 billion, and the annual debt service burden is projected to
reach US$120 million, or about 5 percent of domestic exports. Of the pro-
jected total outstanding external debt in 1978, about 20 percent will be
due to the Bank, giving rise to about 22 percent of Singapore's total debt
service in that year. Singapore is creditworthy for external borrowing on
conventional terms.
12.       Singapore's growth has been in considerable part a function of the
size of long-term private capital inflows. The current outlook for foreign
investment is somewhat uncertain. Certain factors which in the past have
favored Singapore as a venue for foreign investment continue to prevail,
namely, stable politics, a good communications network, an effective and
disciplined work force and a minimum of red tape. However, inflation and
the possibility of skilled labor shortage could become serious further
deterrents to the future growth of foreign investment. Long-term capital
inflows fell from US$263 million in 1972 to US$254 million in 1973, a 16
percent drop in real terms. With the further development of the financial
sector it is likely that local capital will play an increasingly important
role in the expansion of existing industries.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SINGAPORE
13.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourteenth operation in
Singapore. The previous loans were for power, telecommunications, port
modernization and expansion, water supply and sewerage, education and, through
the Development Bank of Singapore, for industrial development. As of April
30, 1975, the loans to Singapore held by the Bank amounted to US$136.1 mil-
lion. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of April 30,
1975, and notes on the execution of on-going projects. Ten of the previous
loans have been fully disbursed.



-4-
14.       While Singapore' s per capita GNP of $1,300 (in 1972) is high for
a less developed country, a large part of the income accrues to foreigners.
As a result, per capita GNP figures for Singapore overstate the level of
goods and services available to the indigenous population. The need for
Bank lending will, nevertheless, be kept under review in line with our
policy of gradually phasing out operations in higher income countries.   For
the time being, however, given the budget deficit, the decline in the for-
eign reserve ratio, and the vulnerability of the economy to external in-
fluences, the continuation. of lending on a limited scale seems justified.
Some of the institutions to which we have lent have become technically and
administratively mature and are able to finance future expansion from their
own resources or by commercial borrowing abroad. Future Bank lending will
therefore be directed to projects in fields where the Bank's technical
assistance continues to be valuable. These include mass transit and environ-
mental control, including solid waste disposal and sewerage.
15.       The Bank is currently serving as the Executing Agency for a UNDP-
financed project to study Singapore's mass transit requirements. This study
and the resultant investment program could lead to one or more Bank loans.
The Bank, as part of its research effort, has also been conductirng a traffic
restraint study in Singapore. The study would assist in making Singapore's
traffic restraint measures more effective and would facilitate transfer of
Singapore's experience to other urban environments.
16.       Si'ngapore's Ministry of Environment would be the Executing Agency
for the proposed project. It was established in 1972 and is responsible for
coordinating and implementing Singapore's programs related to environmental
control. Since it is a newly established organization and one dealing with
areas in which Singapore has limited experience, the Singapore Government
considers the Bank's assistance of crucial importance.
PART TII - SINGAPORE's ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL PROGRAM
Background
17.       Singapore has an area of only 225 square miles.   Its present pop-
ulation of about 2.2 million, which is concentrated mainly in the urban
areas ir. the south central part of the island, is expected to grow to about
3 million by t'ne turn of the century.  With tsh  l-mited area of the island,
land-use planning has asstuned hnigh priority and measures to conserve land
to meet the growing needs of population, industry and agriculture have
become urgent.



-5-
18.       The Government is intent on improving the quality of life of the
population and has undertaken a number of legislative, financial and admin-
istrative actions to implement its policy of environmental and sanitation
control, conservation of resources and improvement of public health standards.
The Environmental Public Health Act has been supported by regulations governing
littering, public cleansing and the activities of hawkers. Air pollution is
governed by the Clean Air Act and subsequent regulations setting standards
for emissions. Water pollution is controlled under the Local Government
Integration Act and supporting regulations. To coordinate the efforts in
the environmental field, as mentioned above, the Ministry of the Environment
was formed in 1972 by absorbing those departments of other Ministries dealing
with environmental health services and pollution control.
19.       Singapore has a well-planned and successful housing development
program. The total number of units completed by the Housing Development
Board (HDB) to the end of 1974 is about 175,000 and the construction of
an additional 30,000 to 35,000 units are planned for the next five years.
In this context, facilities for the supply of water and the disposal of
sewage are essential. Bank loans to the Public Utilities Board (405-MA
and 503-SI) helped to increase the production, treatment and distribution
of water. Also, the Asian Development Bank has made a loan for water
supply.
20.       The Bank has also assisted the expansion of Singapore's sewerage
system with two loans (547-SI and 918-SI) which helped strengthen the Sewer-
age Department (SD) of the Ministry of Environment. While SD was heavily
subsidized by the Government until 1969, it has now become financially self-
supporting.
21.       The Ministry of Environment's (MOE) activities include the
extension and expansion of Singapore's sewerage and storm water drainage
systems, development of the solid waste collection and disposal arrange-
ments, and construction of hygienic public food centers. It has a General
Administration headquarters and two divisions: the Environmental Public
Health Division and the Environmental Engineering Division. They are
briefly described below.
i)   The Environmental Public Health Division
22.       The Environmental Public Health Division has eight operating
departments responsible for such tasks as vector control (mainly anti-
malaria measures), control of epidemiological diseases, quarantine, the
planning and maintenance of cemeteries and crematoria, and food hygiene
and sanitation. The country is divided into seven districts, each with
its own office responsible for street cleaning, vector control, refuse
collection and, where a refuse tipping area lies within a district, opera-
tion of the tip. The supervision of these offices is carried out by the
Environmental Health Headquarters.



- 6 -
23.       Food hygiene and sanitation are the responsibility of the Hawkers'
and the Food Departments. The Hawkers' Department is responsible for super-
vising some 31,000 hawkers and for the operation of MOE hawkers' centers.
it has 53 food centers and markets in operation, 4 under construction and
7 planned for 1975-76 through 1979-80. In Singapore, as in other Southeast
Asian countries, mobile harwkers selling food present a potential health
hazard, as it is extremely difficult to exercise control over their standards
of hygiene and cleanliness. In addition, disposal of their solid waste can
cause pollution of drains and water courses. To eliminate these hazards
and yet allow the hawkers to continue their important social services as
suppliers of cheap food, the Government has adopted an innovative and prac-
tical approach. All hawkers will be moved into centers where relatively
low-cost food can be provided in hygienic conditions and pleasant surround-
ings. The centers will provide water, electricity, gas and facilities for
the sanitary disposal of solid and liquid wastes. MOE inspectors of the
Food Department exercise control over hygienic standards in the preparation,
storage and sale of food.
ii)   The Environmental Engineering Division
24.       The Environmental Engineering Division, which plans and imple-
ments development projects, consists of the Drainage Department, the Sewerage
Department, referred to in paragraph 20, and the Engineering Services Depart-
ment (ESD).
25.       The Drainage Department is responsible for surface water drain-
age. Adequate drainage is a prequisite of urban development. It ensures
maximum use of available land, prevents flood damages, improves living
conditions and reduces the disruption to trade and conmmunications. Housing
and land developers provide the roadside and estate drains within their
projects, but the Drainage Department is responsible for the provision of
the main drainage system to convey the discharges to the sea. Ln addition,
the Drainage Departmernt has the task of reviewing tne older drainage sys-
tems which, due to the progressive development and increase in paved area,
have become inadequate to cope with the increased runoff.
26.       ESD provides engineering services for no---engin eering units iri
the Ministry.  It is also responsible for the 2lanning and implementation
of solid' waste disposal facilities.  The tota:& recorded 7olume of solid
waste - .t.erated in Singapore averaged about 1. "iO - ;:1.nas/6ay in 1974, and
is projected to increase to about 2,600 tonnes/day in 1980 and to about
3,800 tonnes/day in 1986. At present the domestic and commercial refuse is
collected and transported by 1DE's vehicles daily for disposal by sanitary
landfill at three sites. Due to limited land resources and high priority
accorded to industrial and residential use, reduction in volume of solid
waste before disposal becomes important.   Aftec- a thorough comparison of
alterna_ives, incineratio hkas been selectec.  s most appropriate to Singapore's
needs.  A!thou,g7h incineration has been used a- a riajor sol4 d waste disposal
method i man-  ,arts of the world, Singapore i-ias no experience in the area.



-7-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The project is one of the most important parts of Singapore's
Environmental Control Program and comprises (i) the construction of an
incineration plant at Ulu Pandan, (ii) the purchase of about 200 refuse
collection vehicles and dump trucks and (iii) staff training and consult-
ing services.
28.       It has been prepared with the help of consultants, but various
Bank missions have given considerable advice and assistance in the concep-
tion of the project and in its scope. The project was appraised in
November 1974 and February 1975. Loan negotiations were held in May 1975;
the Singapore delegation was led by Mr. Lee Yong Siang, Director, Environ-
mental Engineering Division, Ministry of the Environment. The appraisal
report No. 772-SI dated May 29, 1975, is being circulated separately; a
loan and project smimary is provided in Annex III.
29.       The incineration plant, which will be fully operational by early
1979, will be capable of receiving, handling and incinerating an average of
about 1,200 tonnes of refuse per day in three units. The plant design will
permit addition of another unit later, raising the capacity to about 1,600
tonnes per day. The unit capacity of about 400 tonnes has been selected
on the basis of proven units of this size operating in other parts of the
world. The plant will be intended primarily for the incineration of domes-
tic and trade refuse but will also be designed to incinerate a certain
amount of waste oil and other suitable industrial solid wastes. About 10.5
MW of electric power will be generated from the waste heat of the incinera-
tion plant of which about 20 percent will be used to meet the operational
needs of the plant. The surplus balance of about 56 million KWh a year will
be fed into the public electricity supply.
Project Costs and Financing
30.       Total cost of the project is estimated at about US$55 million
with a foreign exchange component of about US$40 million. The estimates
include a physical contingency of about 10 percent and price contingencies
of about 19 percent.
31.       The proposed Bank loan of US$25 million would finance about 62
percent of the estimated foreign exchange cost and about 45 percent of the
total project cost. The balance of the expenditures will be financed by
the Government.



Implementation
32.       The Engineering Services Department (ESD) of the Ministry of
Environment will be responsible for the execution of the project.   However,
refuse collection and operation of tips are in the hands of the Environmen-
tal Public Health Division.   A study will be carried out to determine whether
a more effective use of personnel and resources can be made by combining all
solid waste management functions into one department. The study will be
completed by October 1, 1976, and results will be reviewed with the Bank
(see Section 4.04 oc the Loan Agreement).
33.       ESD has a team of young, qualified and energetic engineers, but
they lack practical experience in waste incineration. Therefore, to strength-
en ESD, the Ministry of Environment would establish an incinerator operation
section which will be heacded by a senior Executive Engineer with adequate
experience in incineratiorn operation. Arrangements will also be made for
training of staff in the operation and maintenance of the incinerator and
the training program will be reviewed with the Bank.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       All constructiorl and supply contracts will be awarded on the
basis of international competiti've bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines for procurement. Local contractors are likely to win the
contracts for civil works, probably sub-contracting the construction of
the chimney to a foreign specialist firm. The major mechanical and elec-
trical equipment for the incinerator plant and vehicles are not manufac-
tured locally and will be procured from abroad.
35.       Disbursements would be made against (a) 80 percent of the total
expenditures for supply and installation of imported equipment; (b) 25 per-
cent of the cost of civil works; (c) 100 percent of the foreign exchange
costs of consul tants' services; and (d) 100 percent of the foreign exchange
costs of staff training.   The consultants' contract has already been signed.
However, no retroactive fi:nancing is proposed anc' disbursements would be made
only for services renderedl after loan signing.  No disbursements are con-
templated against the cost of vehicles.
Billina E _ a.   Co lection
36.       tl-ng and collect`on of fees for rio-.zal o' so;_d wastes will'
be handled by PUB, hinch is also responsible for billing and collecting
fees on behalf of the Sewerage Department.   PUB has a strong accounting
organization and its billing work is computerizedl.  A single bill is issued
to a customer for electricity, water, gas, sewerage, --nu solid waste re-
moval.   hncollectable accounts are insignificant since PPUB can disconnect
power, wa-er and gas conncections in the event of default is. avment of bills.



-9-
Accounting
37.       Government accounting is on a cash basis.   All expenditures are
met from budget allocations and all receipts go into the Government trea-
sury. The Accountant General, working under the Ministry of Finance, is
responsible for maintaining these accounts.
38.       A major shortcoming of this system is that it does not provide
adequate information for determining the costs of the services or for
financial evaluation and control of the operations. It is for this reason
that a commercial accounting system for the solid waste operations will be
established, as in the case of sewerage services.
Financial Position
39.       The solid waste services are highly subsidized at present.   As
of January 1975, after a revision in the tariff structure, the revenue
for these services consisted mainly of (a) a fee of S$1.00 per month per
residential unit, and (b) a fee of about S$10.00 per month for every 3 cu
ft of solid waste collected daily from non-residential units (shops, hotels,
etc.). At present, fees are levied only on wastes collected by MOE. No
charge is made by MOE for accepting industrial and institutional wastes
which are dumped by private contractors and Government agencies respectively.
40.       The current tariff is inadequate to meet the present operating
costs, which will be more than doubled by the time the incineration plant
goes into operation. While, due to the danger of encouraging private
waste disposal activity and the difficulties of measurement, it is not
feasible to charge domestic premises on the basis of the amount of waste
they individually create and the costs thereby imposed on communal dis-
posal facilities, it is important that commercial and industrial waste
creators should be so charged. In order that the commercial and indus-
trial establishmants be discouraged from creating an undue amount of
waste--or encouraged to recycle it--they should be faced with a charge
that reflects the cost to the community of disposing of it for them.
The problem is further aggravated by allowing private haulers to collect
industrial wastes and to dump them at no charge at MOE tip sites, thereby
consuming scarce disposal capacity. MOE will undertake a study of its
charges for solid waste management services and by April 1, 1976, revise
its tariffs to cover at least its operating costs, including adequate
provisions for the depreciation of its fixed assets and debt service
charges to the extent they exceed the provisions for depreciation. MOE's
revised tariffs will also include a disposal levy for industrial,
commercial and other institutional waste producers designed to discourage
excessive generation of solid waste (see Section 4.05 of the Loan
Agreement).



- 10 -
Ecological Aspects
41.       The incinerator will be located on high ground adjacent to the
sewage treat'ment works in an area reserved for noxious or offensive trades
and industries. Adequate safeguards against air pollution are included in
the incinerator design to ensure that emissions will comply with the Clean
Air Act of Singapore. The design also incorporates standard noise abate-
ment measures. Before the plant is put into operation the Government will
establish a monitoring system to determine the effect of the plant operations
on the environment.
Justification
42.       Solid waste generated by domestic, commercial, industrial and
other institutional source.s has increased from 1,150 tonnes/day in 1969 to
about 1,790 tonnes/day in 1974.  Given the projected growth of the population
and the economy, solid waste output is expected to grow to about 2,600 tonnes/
day in 1980 and to abou. 3,800 tonnes/day in 1986.
43.       In Singapore's state of development it is not practicable to allow
each individual to dispose of his own solid waste. In the absence of a
generally acceptable method of quantifying the benefits, project justifi-
cation rests essentially on the achievement of the least cost solution for
the centralized disposal of solid wastes. There are two aspects to be
considered, (1) the least cost solution of disposing of a given volume of
waste and (2) the extent to which the community can be induced to reduce
the amount of waste produced.
44.       In the keen competition for the limited land resources the Govern-
ment has accorded high priority to industrial and residential use.   As devel-
opment progresses, less land will be available for waste disposal while waste
production will increase.  The Government has therefore considered alterna-
tive methods of disposal, and the choice has narrrowed down to volume reduction
methods, including composting, compaction, and irLcineration. There is already
a small composting plant in Singapore.  With the exception of the Government's
Park and Recreation Department, there is no market for the compost produced.
A larger plant is, therafore, not economically justified. The capital cost
of a compaction plant is lower than that of an incinerator.   However, it is
also less effective in reducing volume, and disposal costs and land require-
ments are higher. Under these ci rcumstances, incineration presents the least
cost solution.
45.       Singapore is conscious of the hazards t:o the quality of life and
the social cost of pollution and environmental decay that can result from
unchecked growth. To minimize such costs, Singapore has shown considerable
will and preparedness to x:ake appropriate action.  Tnis project is a reflec-
tion of such concerns.  it provides a solution for the problems that exist
and that are expected withLin the next five to ten years.  In the longer
term, however, the Government will have to take further steps to cope with
the problem.  The construction of additional incinerators, sea disposal or



- 11 -
the allocation of additional land (perhaps some of the offshore islands)
will have to be considered in conjunction with the tariff incentives men-
tioned above. The Bank, through involvement in this project and possible
future contacts with the Ministry of Environment and the Government of
Singapore as a whole, will be able to assist Singapore in devising policy
measures that will respond to its short and long-term environmental require-
ments.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Singapore and
the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION;-
Loan No. 802-SI     Singapore Education Project; US$9.5 Million Loan of
February 25, 1972; Closing Date: June 30. 1977
Loan No. 964-SI     Second Education Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of
February 14, 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1980
The implementation of the first Education Project is behind
schedule by about twelve months and the second one by about eight months.
The delays have been mainly due to changes in building priorities and short-
ages of staff in the Development Unit of the University of Singapore. As
the staffing deficiency has now been remedied, no further delays are expected
to occur in the future. However, there are substantial cost overruns in
both projects. The total costs of the first and second projects are now
estimated to be, respectively, 97 percent and 80 percent higher than the
appraisal estimates. Cost overruns have resulted from a 33 percent revalu-
ation of the Singapore dollar and recent world-wide inflationary pressures.
Loan No, 918-SI     Second Sewerage Project; US$12 Million Loan of
July 13, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This loan was expected to finance the foreign exchange component
of Singapore's sewerage development program during 1974-79. At the time
of appraisal, the program was estimated to cost S$75 million. However,
the Government has now decided to accelerate its sewerage development pro-
gram. Therefore, the Bank loan will be disbursed earlier than expected.
The revised 1974-79 program will cost S$250 million. Part of this reflects
increases in costs since appraisal.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
