WEST BANK AND GAZA
SECOND MUNICIPAL INFRASTRURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL MLANAGEMENT PLAN
A. Background
1. Introduction. The MIDP II project will build on the achievements and experience of
MIDP I, and will continue to focus on high priority infrastructure rehabilitation and
encourage further municipal reform and increase capacity building within the Ministry of
Local Government (MLG) and the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). In addition to the
municipalities that were served in MIDP I, this project will tackle six new selected
municipalities: Jabalia, Khan Younis (Gaza), Tulkarem, Al Ram, Jericho and Tarqumia
(West Bank). Similar to MIDP I, MII)P II will continue to work with Palestinian Water
Authority (PWA) on water related sub-projects.
2. Environmental Category. The proposed project supports environmental improvements
through rehabilitation of roads and water supply systems in the West Bank and Gaza.
Potential adverse environmental impacts have been summarized in Table 1. These risks can
be effectively anticipated in advance of project implementation and addressed by direct
mitigation activities in the design, planning and construction process. Since most of the
investment  activities  to  be  supported  by  the  proposed  Project  deal  with
rehabilitation/improvements of existing infrastructure, and since the projects do not involve
issues such as land acquisition or resettlement, the project is rated a category "B" in
accordance with World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 (January 1998) and requires the
preparation and implementation of an Environmental Management plan (EMP).
3. Investment Components. The $17 million project will consist of the following main
components:
One)      Improve Infrastructure Services ($14 million): - roads (73%) and water
networks (9%): Implementation of infrastructure projects, costing between US$0.2 million
and US$2.8 million each, identified by LGUs and implemented through MPW and PWA in
coordination with MLG. Such works will mainly include rehabilitation and improvement of
existing roads, and to a far lesser extent rehabilitation of existing water networks.
Two)      Strengthen local and central municipal capacity ($2.5 million): Investment
and development programming, improving accounting systems, revenue mobilization,
management and service delivery (12%); and build the institutional capacity of the MPW
(3%) with regard to road maintenance program, planning, programming and project
development, management and monitoring. Subcontract agreements with qualified firms or
individuals to provide training to MPW, MLG and LGUs to ensure good quality.
Three)    Incremental Operational Support ($0.5 million): Supplemental operating
costs for MLG and MPW, including vehicles, comununications and other equipment,
beneficiary impact studies needed by the implementing agency for project execution and
management.
4. Institutional Structure. The MIDP II project will be coordinated and implemented



through the MPW in close cooperation with MLG. Rehabilitation of water networks falls
under the mandate of the PWA.
5. The Ministry of Environmental Affairs (MEnA) is in the early stages of developing
environmental policies that allow monitoring of road construction and renovation. As such,
they do not at present have the institutional know-how or the capacity, to supervise the MIDP
II project or inspect the sites to enforce regulations. Therefore, the project will support the
establishment of a MIDP project team that consists of a dedicated staff member of MEnA and
MPW. Both employees will be working closely with local municipal engineers and sector
ministries to ensure the development and enforcement of guidelines to mitigate the
environmental impacts of the proposed sub-projects. As the Bank and other bilateral donors
are already contributing to capacity building at MEnA and MLG, the main focus of the
technical assistance activities with respect to environmental protection will focus on MPW.
The technical assistance will make use of lessons leamed from the MIDP I and CDP I
project, and the expert advisor/trainer will work closely with MEnA to develop guidelines
relevant to the MIDP II activities.
6. Environmental Audit of projects under MIIDP I. A rapid environmental audit was
conducted on a sample of projects implemented under MIDP I. The findings showed that for
the most part, the projects contributed to positive environmental impacts. The positive
impacts with regard to road rehabilitation included the following: road and sidewalk projects
reduced amount of dust, increased road safety, drainage has been improved, all municipal
roads rehabilitation included (where appropriate) installation of sewers and street lightning,
and most obstacles have been removed from the public right of way. Tree planting especially
in the Gaza municipality will rapidly improve the quality of life in the urban areas.
Nevertheless, the audit also identified areas needing improvements. In various locations
garbage containers are blocking part of the road, traffic signs are not adequate considering
the increase in vehicular speeds after road have been rehabilitated. Main pedestrian crossings,
especially near schools and cross roads need to made safe. The quality of paint used for road
marks is often inferior. Semi urban and rural roads shoulders could be planted with trees
which will strengthen the shoulders and have a general positive environmental impact. It was
noted that the road maintenance program needs a stronger emphasis on environment issues, in
particular with respect to road cleaning. More attention is needed in design and construction
of shoulders outside the cities. On various location shoulders were to narrow or blocked.
Though the improvement of drainage has been a major focus of attention of MIDP I, its
importance can not be underestimated and will need special attention due to the topography,
especially in the West Bank. Random garbage disposal is the most frequent recorded
environmental problem associated with the roads.
B. Environmental Management Plan
7. Environment Management Plan. The EMP has been prepared to integrate enviromnental
concerns into the design and implementation of the proposed MIDP II Project. It would
support: a) site-specific environmental screening of road rehabilitation and environmental
assessment of water network projects; b) training staff/contractors involved in Project
implementation; c) monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures identified during
site-specific reviews; d) and involvement of the public in monitoring environmental impact
during and after road construction, through the distribution of a complaint form to
municipalities and village councils. All activities related to the EMP will be closely



coordinated with MEnA, MPW and PWA.
8. Site specific Environmental Screening, Review and Assessment. The screening and
review process will be conducted in close cooperation with MEnA, MPW and PWA.
Environmental review of projects will be conducted by special appointed staff member of
MPW. She/he will be assisted by a counterpart of MEnA. Sub-projects that have been
earmarked will be subjected to detailed site review and implementation of construction work
will be closely monitored. A standard appraisal/mitigation form will be part of the specific
specifications for the contractor, and will form the basis of regular monitoring by both the
contractor and the MPW staff. The form will consist of, but in no way limited to a) current
environmental problems; b) potential environmental impacts, if any, due to the project; c)
mitigation measures; d) and schedule. Table 2. is an example of such form based on the rapid
three day appraisal of the projects, and will the basis for further development by MPW. As all
projects are only concemed with rehabilitation, no unrecorded archaeological sites are
expected to be uncovered. Nevertheless, special attention must be paid to historic sites.
Accordingly, "chance find" procedures will be established in close coordination with the
Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.
As for the proposed water projects which will be implemented through the Palestinian Water
Authority (PWA), a site specific environmental assessment will be perfomned. The purpose
of such assessment will be to ensure that cross contaminiation from sewage septic tanks and
cesspools and other sources is avoided.
9. Strengthening Environmental Expertise through MIDP II. Environmental expertise
will be established within MPW for the coordination and supervision of environmental
activities funded through the MIDP II project. The expert wiU work in close coordination
with MEnA and would: a) conduct environmental reviews of projects and monitoring; b)
coordinate environmental training activities for staff, engineers and contractors; and c)
conduct site visits to review progress. The MIDP II Unit will be supported where necessary
by a part time expert envlronmental advisor, contracted through a local consulting firm.
10. Environmental Capacity Building and Training Program. Since there is limited
capacity to undertake such actions within MEnA, the training program would be designed
and implemented with assistance of local or intemational consultants. The training would
target three levels:
One)      On-the-job training of a dedicated MPW and MEnA staff member to direct
road design, planning, implementation and maintenance with respect to environmental
protection,
Two)      Training for staff of sector ministries involved in the project, including one of
two day seminars on environmental awareness and other specific environmental aspects
related to design and implementation of roads rehabilitation and water supply networks. The
training will be open to staff of MEnA, cooperating sector Ministries and participating local
government units (LGUs); and
Three)    Training for contractors would be provided, including one or two day
workshops for local contractors, focusing on: use of environmental guidelines;
implementation of mitigation measures; use of natural materials (stones) for road marking



and (erosion) prevention; road safety for construction workers; proper waste disposal and
cleaning measures during construction
11. Project monitoring. All projects will be subjected to site specific environmental
screening and review process conducted by the MPW approx. 4 times a year. This process
would minimize site-specific environmental impacts. A monitoring plan is shown in Table 2.
12. Reporting. The environmental staff member of MPW would prepare bi-annual reports
outlining progress of EMP  inplementation. 'The reports would  include project findings
(lessons learned); environmental issues, if any; status of the mitigation measures taken and
next steps, if any. The reports would be submitted to the MEnA and the World Bank as part
of the progress report.
13. Project Supervision. The environmental issues including mitigation measures would be
supervised by staff of the World Bank resident mission. Progress on mitigation measures will
be included in regular Bank supervision reports including the Project Status report (PSR)
updates, the mid-term reviews.
14. EMP Cost Estimate and Schedule. It is estimated that EMP implementation would cost
US$ 90,000 for staff, consultants, training activities and site specific assessment and
protection, presented in Table 3. EMP implementation would be integrated into the overall
schedule for, the proposed project and a prelirninary schedule for key activities is provided as
Table 4. The budget and implementation schedule for the EMP would be discussed and
agreed upon with the Borrower.
