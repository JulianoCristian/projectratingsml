Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient

deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized 
Page  6

For replenishment of the Special Account, the

which 
replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such

Account and 
deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Recipient 
shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said 
documents and other 
evidence to have been paid out of 
the Grant Special Account for eligible 
expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Administrator from the Grant 
Account under the respective eligible Category, and in the respective

Agreement; or
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Grant allocated to 
the eligible Category, less the amount of any outstanding special 
commitment entered into by the Administrator pursuant to Section 5.02 of 
the General Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of 
the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Grant Account of the remaining

If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that 
any payment out of the Grant Special Account: (i) was made for an 
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Administrator, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Administrator: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Administrator 
may request; or (B) deposit into the Grant Special Account (or, if the 
Administrator shall so request, refund to the Administrator) an amount 
equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
Page  7
eligible or justified. Unless the Administrator shall otherwise agree, no 
further deposit by the Administrator into the Grant Special Account shall 
be made until the Recipient has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that 
any amount outstanding in the Grant Special Account will not be required 
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Recipient shall,

to the Administrator all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the 
Grant Special Account.
