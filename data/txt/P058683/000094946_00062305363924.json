Mitigating measures address: 1) the\n            establishment of guidelines, and specifications for\n            contractors to control waste disposal, and safety hazards,\n            and enforce environmental, and traffic regulations; 2) soil\n            erosion should be contained, through the installation of\n            guard rails, with reflectors, and proper compaction of\n            shoulders. Re-vegetation, particularly replanting of trees,\n            should take place, as road widening, and improvements\n            require uprooting of existing vegetation; 3) construction,\n            and maintenance of drainage ditches should prevent clogging,\n            caused by erosion, and improper drainage; 4) increased\n            separation of wastewater from consumption waters, to prevent\n            health hazards resulting from inadequate sanitation, and\n            improper sewage, and sludge disposal.
