The primary purpose of this reallocation\n            is to assist the (National Committee for Democratic\n            Development at Sub-national Level) NCDD-Secretariat to\n            ensure that the RILGP is completed as planned under\n            established implementing arrangements. The RILGP-AF project\n            paper (2007) had covered this eventuality, including an\n            allocation of US$450,000 that could be used to support\n            Project to Support Democratic Development (PSDD) Technical\n            Assistance (TA) if it was affected by a reduction in donor\n            support. As this situation has now materialized we are\n            seeking to utilize this allocation and to reallocate from\n            other categories to cover the agreed Bank portion\n            ($1.1million) of the shortfall. The reallocation to cover\n            the PSDD shortfall will fund the TA contract with United\n            Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for provincial advisory\n            services (of approximately $1.1 million) and the ancillary\n            costs for workshops and equipment. The reallocation affects\n            all categories, and all are in accordance with the approved\n            annual work plan and budget."}, "docdt": "2010-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
