2.      Project implementation progress. RILGP-AF closes in December 2010 and the
likelihood of achieving the PDO is moderately satisfactory as measured by the key
performance indicators.

The last supervision Mission (December 2009) acknowledged the effort made by the
National Committee for Democratic Development at Subnational Level (NCDD), as well
as the Provincial level Excom and the Commune/Sangkat Councils in implementing the
Commune/Sangkat Fund, and recognized the challenges involved. The mission
confirmed that project implementation was on track throughout 2009 and assessed project
implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. The project is on track to fully disburse the
undisbursed balance (SDR4,569,212.68) by the December 31, 2010 closing date.


                                           3
Since that Mission, the task team has noted a significant improvement in the rate of
disbursement with the resolution of the tax issue; and the pro-active response by NCDD-
S to the 2008-9 post-review findings.

Despite delays in progress in the planning phase of the 2010 Commune/Sangkat
activities, owing to the impact of the termination of salary supplements to Provincial
Excom staff, the team assessment is that the expected level of reimbursement for 2010
will be met.

The task team also notes the sound performance of the Project in relation to safeguards
and complaints handling through the accountability working group structure, and the
efforts of the NCDD-Secretariat to engage civil society in the final stages of the project
and the ongoing decentralization reforms.

3.    The proposed reallocation is necessary to ensure continuity of RILGP-AF
implementation arrangements up to the closing date of December 31, 2010.

For 3 years, the RILGP-AF has (through a parallel financing arrangement) depended on
the operational support, project management and technical assistance of the UNDP-
managed PSDD (Project to Support Democratic Development through Decentralization
and Deconcentration). PSDD has supported a number of donor D&D operations since
2003, including activities required for the RILGP reimbursement of Commune Sangkat
Fund sub-projects.

In late 2009, DFID announced its decision to gradually withdraw support from
Camabodia as planned, and to focus its final year's assistance in target areas. DFID
notified NCDD and UNDP that it intended to discontinue funding the PSDD project,
creating a shortfall of US$4.7million USD.

Given the operational support and TA provided by the PSDD to a number of
decentralization projects, the NCDD-Secretariat approached donors, including the Bank,
to cover this shortfall for 2010 ­ the final year of implementation. As a result UNDP and
Sida agreed to increase their contributions by US$ 2.2 million and US$1.4 million
respectively; and the Bank agreed to cover the remaining $1.1 million or 25% of the
shortfall through reallocation of the proceeds of the additional Financing.

The primary purpose of this reallocation is to assist the NCDD-Secretariat to ensure that
the RILG project is completed as planned under established implementing arrangements.
The RILGP ­AF Project Paper (2007) had covered this eventuality, including an
allocation of US$450,000 that could be used to support PSDD TA if it was affected by a
reduction in donor support. As this situation has now materialized we are seeking to
utilize this allocation and to reallocate from other categories to cover the agreed Bank
portion ($1.1million) of the shortfall.

The reallocation proposed to cover the PSDD shortfall will fund the TA contract with
UNDP for provincial advisory services (of approximately $1.1 million) and the ancillary
costs for workshops and equipment. The proposed reallocation affects all categories, and
all are in accordance with the approved Annual Work Plan and Budget.


                                            4
To achieve this we have reallocated across categories as follows:

   ·   Category 1 (Works under Part B (2) of the Project) will be reduced by SDR19,303
       with SDR160,697 remaining to cover other expenditures in the final stages of the
       Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB).

   ·   Category 2 (Goods under Part B (2) of the Project) will reallocate SDR66,572 to
       provide for goods associated with the Accountability Working Groups as
       recommended in the Mid-term Review and proposed in the AWPB.

   ·   Category 3 (Consultants' Services)

       Under Part B (1) of the Project (for Institutional Strengthening) will reallocate all
       SDR450,000 to Part B(2) to pay for UNDP from one expenditure category. This is
       the largest reallocation.

       Under Part B (2) of the Project (for policy reform and project management) will be
       increased by SDR587,251 to 3,707, 251. The UNDP contract for supporting services
       will be withdrawn from this sub-category as will those consultancies focused on
       learning and documenting lessons for the RILGP successor operation. SDR1,717,
       648 is currently spent and committed in this category.

   ·   Category 4 (Workshops under part B (2) of the Project) will be increased by
       SDR73,251 in order to pay for workshops and training for the provincial staff
       supported by the UNDP TA and recommended in the mid-term review.

   ·   Category 5 (Sub-project Grants under Part A (2) of the Project) is increased by
       SDR262,055 to SDR18,922,055 to increase the number of commune projects
       supported in the final year of the project.

   ·   Category 6 (Operating Costs under Part B(1) of the Project) is reduced by
       SDR518,826 to allow for the reallocation to both the Consultants' Services under
       Part B (2) of the Project and the Sub-project Grants under Part A (2) of the Project.
