satisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; the Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory; and the borrower's\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: communes can identify local development\n            priorities, and plan and implement community subprojects\n            both efficiently and effectively. Communes have demonstrated\n            that with appropriate technical support and oversight,\n            involving rigorous reviews and clearances, they can plan and\n            implement small sub-projects each year. Institutional\n            capacity development is achieved most effectively through\n            practical experience and 'learning by doing.'\n            Appropriate procedures should be utilized to balance varying\n            levels of capacity with required fiduciary controls and\n            safeguards. The most common comments from clients, including\n            commune council members, concerned the time-consuming\n            procurement reviews and safeguards clearances. Nearly\n            everyone commune councilors, government officials and\n            consultant admitted that clear, strict procedures were\n            beneficial. Attention still needs to be given to improving\n            participation, transparency, competitiveness and\n            accountability. Working through country systems directly\n            influences government policy and practice and better ensures\n            sustainability. The project design envisioned the\n            establishment and development of country systems and the\n            project supported an on-going program of developing\n            government systems that continued to evolve over the life of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2011-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
