Also the population will be sensitized\n            to the dangers posed by contact with medical waste, and\n            health and support personnel as well as patients will\n            receive training. The plan also calls for identifying all\n            the actors, determining their domains for intervention, and\n            designating responsibilities. Contractors will be engaged\n            for waste collection and disposal. Best practices will be\n            identified and followed.
