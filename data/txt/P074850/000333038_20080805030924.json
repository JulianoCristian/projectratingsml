Transport Corridor Project for Benin were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Bank played\n            a catalytic role in supporting an innovative initiative by\n            taking high risks. The project documents indicate that at\n            initiation, with the exception of Joint United Nations\n            Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), other development partners did\n            not show interest in joining the project. On the other hand,\n            UNAIDS, on behalf of other United Nations (UN) agencies,\n            provided a solid technical and financial support to bring\n            the project concept to fruition. Strong partnership between\n            the Bank and UNAIDS was a critical factor in the design and\n            delivery of the project. It is critical that strong\n            partnership is built prior to initiating the project design.\n            Emphasizing the facilitation and coordination role of the\n            Executive Secretariat was essential for ensuring that civil\n            society organizations be empowered. Contracting out the\n            fiduciary and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) aspects of\n            project implementation to a management consultant proved\n            highly positive. The Executive Secretariat focused heavily\n            on community development, training staff, and disseminating\n            management tools. This was the recipe for success and highly\n            appreciated by all stakeholders. Preparation of the baseline\n            survey was delayed for a variety of reasons, including two\n            failed attempts to contract consultants before project\n            appraisal and, the delay to set up the institutional\n            framework for project implementation. In the absence of a\n            survey before appraisal of the project, it was difficult to\n            set a realistic value for project indicators in the project\n            appraisal document (PAD)."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
