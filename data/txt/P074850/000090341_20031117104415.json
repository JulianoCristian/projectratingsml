Particular\n            attention is to be given to the transport sector workers,\n            the migrant population, commercial sex workers and the local\n            populations living along the corridor, especially at the\n            border towns. The project has the following three\n            components: Component 1) will support: (a) the\n            implementation of an integrated HIV/AIDS Information,\n            Education, and Communication/Behavior change communication\n            (IEC/BCC) policy along the transport corridor; and (b) the\n            social marketing of condoms in the 8 geographic border\n            communities and along the entire corridor. Both public\n            sector and civil society organizations including NGOs and\n            the private sector will participate in the implementation of\n            both parts of this component. Component 2) will support: (a)\n            strengthening of public and private (where applicable)\n            health care facilities identified along the corridor to\n            provide services in the areas of Voluntary Counseling and\n            Testing (VCT), treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections\n            (STIs) (with promotion of the syndromic approach) and\n            HIV/AIDS opportunistic infections; and (b) the provision of\n            grants to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), including NGOs\n            and the private sector, to undertake community based\n            initiatives in HIV/AIDS care and support and; (c) support\n            the disposal of medical waste related to the project. Due to\n            the complexity of the logistical and organizational\n            requirements for anti-retroviral drugs, this project, with\n            its regional nature and type of target groups, will not\n            provide these drugs to the target groups. The project will\n            also support the collection and analysis of information (not\n            including private patient identifiable information) on\n            patterns of utilization of HIV/AIDS treatment, care and\n            support services along the corridor. Component 3) will\n            support: (a) the development of strong HIV/AIDS\n            inter-country coordination and partnerships among the\n            governments and other project stakeholders of the five\n            participating countries; (b) capacity building among\n            implementing partners and (c) the implementation of\n            transport sector policies favorable to arresting the erosion\n            of social capital, including for smooth movement of\n            commercial traffic along the corridor."}, "docdt": "2003-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
