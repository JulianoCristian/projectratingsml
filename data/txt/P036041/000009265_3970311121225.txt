MIIEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THIE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELP1MENT
AND TJHE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A FISCAL TECBNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the follownng memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan for the eauivalent of $25 million and an IDA credit for SDR 16.8
million, the equivalent of $25 million, to the People's Republic of China to help finance
technical assistance to improve tax administration and fiscal management in China. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
ncluding 5 years of grace. The credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity
of 35 years. The proceeds of the loan/credit would be made available as grant
contibutions to State Admtation of Taxation.
2.          Background. China's fiscal system has been under strain since the reforms
began in 1978. The reforms initiated a major shift of the tax base away from the sectors
traditionally taed by the revenue system, and the share of government revenues in GNP
fell from over 34 percent in 1978 to less fian 16 percent in 1993. The tax strucure was
complex, with 33 taxes, a multitude of rates in many taxes, and enterprise income taxes
(ElTs) that vaned by ownership and carried high margin  rates. Competition among
enterprises was further distorted by tax contracting between govemment and sat-owned
enterprses (SEs), which also undermined buoyancy of tax revenues. Central government
revenues were increasingly eroded by the intergovernmental fiscal contracts that left an
increasng share of revenues to local governments, and by tax exemptions granted by local
governments that controlled the tax administration.  The effectiveness of the tax
administation has been restricted by inadequate procedures, organizational arrangements,
and data processing systems. The budgetary system has not kept pace with the reforms
in the rest of the economy.  The budget coverage, classification and procedures
insufficienty served policy analysis, intnal management, and control over budgetary
outlays.
3.         In 1993, China embarked on a major reform of its fiscal institutions and
practices in order to adapt them to a market-based economy. These reforms were endorsed
in the 'Decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth Central Committee of the
Communist Party of Chinaw in November 1993. The reforms can broadly be divided into
four parts: (a) a major overhaul of the tax system, including a broadening and
simplificaton of the value added tax (VAI) and unification of domestic ETs; (b) the
creation of separate tax administrations for centaml and shared taxes (National Tax Service,
NTS) and local taxes (the Local Tax Serice, LS); (c) a restructuring of
intergovernmental fiscal relations, designed to gradually increase the centmal govemment's



-2-
revenue share; and (d) the passng of a Budget Law, which codifies procedures and
responsibilities in the budget process.
4.          The Government has requested the Bank Group and IMF to assist in
implementing the fiscal refonns. In Tax Administration, the implementation of the NTS
requires the development of new procedures, new organizational arrangements, and modem
coniputer systems.  The tax administration reforms are led by the central State
Administration of Taxation (SAT), a ministenal-level agency independent of the Ministry
of Finance (MOF).  SAT's strategy-developed with IMF assistanc-cals for the
introduction of reforns on a pilot basis before a phased nationwide implementation over
a period of five to seven years. in Tax Policy, the reforms introduced in 1993 require
refinement and expansion in the medium term, and, consequently, the Govenment intends
to develop its capacity for tax policy analysis. The State Council has assigned prmary
responsibility for tax policy to MOF. The authonties are considering increased autonomy
for subnational governments in setting tax rates. They therefore intend to build tax policy
analysis capacty at the provincial level. in Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations, the
Govenmnent's pTiority is to design and implement a grants scheme that redistrbutes the
expected increasing surplus of central revenues over expenditures to the provinces. The
authonties are considering a grants scheme that would take both revenue capacity and
expenditure needs into account, and would be implemented on a pilot basis in 1997. The
Government's priority in ie area of Budget System and Procedures is to implement the
Budget Law, which encompasses reforms m the treasury function, the budget accounting
system, and budget preparation and implementation methods.
5.          Project Objectives. The prcject would support the implementation of recent
fiscal and tax refonns and the preparation of future reforms by: (a) developing and
implementing a new national tax administraton; (b) improving capacity for tax policy
analysis; (c) develoiping and implementing a central-provincial grants scheme; and
(d) improving budgetary processes and practices. The project would increase the
productivity of the tadmistration, contribute to improvements in the management of
public resources, and promote more equitable distribution of fiscal resources among
provinces.
6.          Project Description.  The project would finance consultancies (CS),
taining, studies, and equipment at central and provincial levels. (The figures in
parentheses are the base costs without contingencies.)
7.          Tax Admiation ($76.3 million equivalent). This component would
support the development of a national tax administration capable of implementing current
and futue tax reforms. The project would develop nevw administrative procedures,
organizational angements, and information systems in four pilot cities (Phase 1), which,
after evaluation, would be expanded to 18 cities (Phase D;) on the basis of a roll-out plan
developed under the project The SAT will develop and implement the information system
pnmarily in-house, with consultant's support for systems design. Data processing would
be concentrated at the district and oDunty levels, but city and national level systems are
also envisioned. The project would support (a) CS for tax aminion procedures and



- 3 -
information systems development; (b) training in systems development, and in crucial
administrative and managerial functions; and (c) equipment and software for the
information system in 18 cities, at the national office, and in a training center.
8.          Tax Policy Analysis ($4.8 million equivalent). This component would
improve the tax policy analysis capacity of the Govemment. The project would support
the gradual transfer of the tax policy function fiom SAT to MOP, and create tax policy
analysis capacity at the provincial level. The project would finance: (a) the design of
approriate databases for tax policy analysis; (b) computer equipment for processing the
databases; (c) training for government officials in tax policy analysis at the central and the
provincial level; and (d) studies to prepare future tax reforms. Among others, the studies
will address: (i) unification of foreign and domestic EITs; (ii) broadening of the tax base
for the personal income tax (PIT); (iii) tax assignment and local tax autonomy; and (Wv) the
scope for environmental and resource taxes in China. The studies are included in the work
program for the ninth five-year plan (1996-2000).
9.         Intergovemental iscal Relations ($2.9 million equivalent).  This
component would support the development and implementation of an efficient and equitable
central-provncial grants scheme. The project would develop a detailed grants scheme
design, and administrative procedures and an infonnation system for its implementation.
The grants scheme would be tested in six pilot provinces. The project would provide:
(a) CS for the detailed design of the center-provincial grants scheme, and the development
of an information system; (3) training for the implementation of the grants scheme; and
gc) equipment for the information system.
10.        Budget System ($4.3 million equivalent). This component would increase
the MOF's instittional capacity to admiister the Budget aw, and prepare a reform
strategy for the budget system. The component would improve budget accounting and
audit; trsury management; and budget analysis and implementation. The component
would finance: (a) studies for the assessment of the current budget system; (b) study tours
and workshops to compare the Chinese budget system with intenational best practice;
(c) CS for improving budgetary procedures and practices; and (d) CS, training and
computer equipment for improving the treasury's information network, managed by the
People's Bank of China (PBC).
11.        Project Costs and Financing. Total project cost including contingencies
is estimated at $105.5 million. In addition, the IMF will contribute staff resources for TA
and supervison of the tax administration component  Of the total expenditures,
14.8 percent finances institutional development, 0.9 percent project implementation,
2.5 percent policy support, 45.4 percent automation, and the remainder (36.3 percent)
consists of (five-year) incremental operating costs financed by the Government. The Bank
Group will finance 92 percent of foreign exchange costs, 5.3 percent of local costs, and
47.4 percent of overall costs. Retroactive financing of SDR 3.1 million, or about $4.5
million, is recommended for purchases since March 1, 1995, which would cover
procurement of Phase I equipment and the urgent needs in Consultancies and Training.

12.        Project Implementation.  For overall project coordination, a Project
Coordination Team (PCI) has been set up, consisting of representatives from SAT and
MOF. The MOF World Bank Department will coordinate the implementation team, and
administer the project's Special Account. Three component-specific implementation teams
have been established under the PCT. SAT will be responsible for the tax administration
component. SAT has set up a Steering Commitee to lead the reform efforts, and created
a Tax Administration Reform Office to administer the component. The Tax Policy
Department of MOF and the Tax Reform and Legislation Department of SAT have set up
a joint tax policy unit that will implement the tax policy component. The Budget
Department of MOF will be responsible for the intergovernmental fiscal component and
the budget systems component. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Technical Annex, Report No. P-6552-CHA dated April 3, 1995, is
attached.
13.        The Bank Group and IMF will continue close cooperation in supervison of
the prqject. The IMF plans to assist the Bank Group in supervising the substantive aspects
of tax administration and systems design and implementation. The Bank Group would
retain overall supervision responsibility, including procurement and disbursements.
14.        Project Sustainability. Total project costs are about 0.2 percent of annual
tax collection, and about 2 percent of collection in the districts directly financed under the
project. Thus, only a marginal improvement in collection efficiency would make the
project sustainable and financially viable.
15.        Lessons Learned from Previous BankIIDA Involvement. Bank Group and
IMF involvement in tax administration projects suggests four key factors for success:
(a) high political commitment; (b) a clear reform strategy; (c) a strong implementation
team; and (d) use of pilot projects to test new systems and procedures before nationwide
implementation. This experience also shows that procedural and organizational change
should precede computerization, and that taxpayers' self-assessment combined with
effective organizational arangements are key to an efficient tax administration. Bank
Group experience in budget systems reforms shows that such reforms require a long lead
time, and that a clear strategy for a revised budget system should precede implementation
of reforms.
16.         The Bank Group has no previous project experience in China's fiscal
management, but there have been seven technical assistance projects: two Technical
Cooperation Projects (Cr. 1412-CHA, Cr. 1664-CHA), a Planng Support and Special
Studies Project (Cr. 1835-CHA), a Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project
(Cr. 2447-CHA), a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2423-CHA), an
Envionmental Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2522-CHA) and an Economic Law
Reform Project (Cr. 2654-CHA). Among the lessons learned are the need: (a) to ensure



- 5 -
pohitical commitment to the goals of the project; (b) to avoid excessive financing of
hardware; and (c) for finn implementation modalities, including for onlending.
17.         The political commitment to fiscal reforms is high. The hardware is mainly
procured for the tax administration, and is firmly supported by the overall reform strategy
in that area. SAT's strategy aims to revise procedures and organization before new
computer systems are developed, and includes pilot testing of the new tax administration
before roll-out. The budget systems component intends to develop a long-term strategy
for reforms in the budget system, and to build capacity to implement these reforns. The
PCT and component implementation teams would provide effective implementation. MOF
has provided assurances that it will allocate the required loan/credit funds to SAT and PBC
free of charge.
18.         Rationale for Bank/IDA Involvement. The current fiscal reforms are a
high priority for the authorities, and the Minister of Finance has directly requested Bank
Group and HIF assistance in the implementation of the reforms. The proposed project is
consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for China as presented to the Board
in August 1993. Fiscal reforms are central to the strategy: improveri fiscal management
would serve as a catalyst for reforms in other sectors such as banking and SEs, because
increased and better-managed fiscal resources can relieve these sectors of government
functions. Moreover, the Government's reform program corresponds closely with the
recommendations the Bank Group has made in economic and sector work, and policy
dialogue. The tax adminstration and intergovernmental fiscal components directly aim to
implement current reforms. The project's tax policy and budget systems component would
prepare future reforms complementary to the current refonns.
19.         The Bank Group has significant expertise in the fiscal sector, and published
two sector reports and a discussion paper on tax policy and tax adminishtation,
intergovernmental fiscal relations and budget policy, and is working on studies in the field
of Public Investment and Municipal Finance.
20.         Environment Aspects. The project falls under environmental category C.
21.         Project Benefits. The project would: (a) contribute to increased efficiency
in revenue generation and government expenditure; (b) enhance the productivity of the tax
administration and reduce burdens on the taxpayer; (c) increase the efficiency of the tax
stucture; (d) improve the equitable distribution of govemment resources among provinces;
and (e) improve allocation of budget resources.
22.         Risks. The Government is very anxious to reform the tax administration
quickly, and SAT may be pressured to rush the implementation of the project. This risk
has been addressed by agreeing with SAT on a realistic timetable, and by the phased
project design, which requires satisfactory implementation of one phase, before the next
phase starts.  Poor coordination among participating Chinese agencies may delay
implementation. The structure of the implementaion teams would serve as a means to
resolve potential conflict among these agencies, and minimize te risk. A third risk lies



- 6 -
in overburdening key officials in MOF and SAT. This has been reduced by hiring local
consultants under the project to supplement the staff of the participating agencies, and by
phasing the activities over time.
23.         Agreements Obtained at Negotiations. During negotiations, the Bank
Group obtained agreements with the Borrower on: (a) proper phasing and realistic
planning of the tax administration reforms; (b) systems assessment and improvements
before procurement of equipment for the PBC treasury; (c) Borrower allocation of the
credit/loan proceeds to the vaxious implementing agencies free of charge; (d) the modalities
of project management, implementation and monitoring; and (e) adequate maintenance of
equipment procured under the project.
24.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association, and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve them.
