to the maximum extent possible - the relocation of\n            housing structures, and/or economic activities, and that the\n            resettlement compensation plan be designed to mitigate its\n            effects, especially among vulnerable populations. The\n            government decided to relocate the population of the Ambouli\n            Oued to Cite Gargaar not only because of project activities\n            but also for their own security as they are periodically\n            victimized by flooding. This report aims to ensure that this\n            population's standard of living will be improved as it\n            ensures the integration of the newly resettled families\n            within existing socio-economic structures, and activities.\n            This report identifies 127 affected households inhabiting\n            105 structures in the Ambouli Oued area. Although among them\n            are non-nationals, this group may be accorded compensation\n            so they can be relocated to a place of their choosing. The\n            report describes the bolstering of the existing regulatory\n            and legal framework for resettlement, the mechanisms for\n            public consultation, the two compensation options (land or\n            monthly payments) for land, transport assistance,\n            construction of housing assistance, commercial\n            infrastructure supports (potable water and electricity,\n            roads, markets, etc.) and social and educational\n            infrastructure (health centers, community development\n            centers, police stations, etc.)."}, "docdt": "2006-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
