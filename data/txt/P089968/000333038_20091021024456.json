DJIBOUTI: A\n            RISK MAP FOR DJIBOUTI-VILLE", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Flood Emergency\n            Rehabilitation Project for Djibouti were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to entrust implementation of a post-disaster operation to a\n            well established agency, with good knowledge of Bank\n            procedures and adequate procurement and financial management\n            capacity. ADETIP (National Executing Agency for Public Works\n            - Agence Djiboutienne d'Execution des Travaux\n            d'Interet Public) did a good job in coordinating\n            implementation of a large number of components. The lack of\n            government reaction to the encroachment on public domain in\n            a sensitive area is puzzling and needs to be discussed\n            within the country dialogue context. Sooner or later, the\n            Government will have to address the problem, hopefully\n            before a severe flood. The Bank policy on involuntary\n            resettlement is difficult to accept by governments in\n            countries where squatters include illegal immigrants from\n            neighboring countries. They consider it as too generous and\n            are afraid of creating precedents. This is a sensitive issue\n            which should be discussed openly with the recipient\n            countries. Sustainability of the dike and of the\n            surveillance system is a major issue. The Bank hired a\n            consultant to review this issue and make appropriate\n            recommendations. This was most useful. It is important now\n            to sensitize key stakeholders to the findings and\n            recommendations of the report. Resources should be made\n            available for that purpose."}, "docdt": "2009-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
