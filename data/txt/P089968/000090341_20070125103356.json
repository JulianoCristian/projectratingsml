Because\n            of the emergency nature of the FERP, the technical design\n            and specifications of the dike were prepared after\n            appraisal, and the updated estimated cost for its\n            reconstruction has increased significantly. Estimates for\n            the road rehabilitation works have also increased, mainly\n            because of the increasing oil prices, which contribute\n            significantly to the construction costs.
