The main benefits would be the restoration of\n            services, through the rehabilitation of roads, bridges,\n            flood control works, health centers, and schools. Despite\n            its benefits, possible risks include: a) institutional\n            overlap and lack of coordination in the Ambouli Oued\n            rehabilitation project among government ministries, and\n            donor agencies, but mitigation measures include expansion of\n            the Djiboutian Agency for Implementation of Publics Works -\n            ADETIP - through the steering committee to ensure government\n            coordination among line ministries and agencies, and,\n            coordination with th European Union (EU), the United Nations\n            Development Programme (UNDP) and the African Development\n            Bank (AfDB); b) minor relocation and resettlement risks as a\n            result of the Oued rehabilitation project; mitigation\n            includes that as a condition for the no-objection to proceed\n            with the Oued rehabilitation component, the Bank requested\n            that the protection dyke design and the widening/leveling of\n            the Oued riverbed, avoid - to the maximum extent possible -\n            the relocation of housing structures, and/or economic\n            activities, and that a resettlement compensation plan be\n            designed appropriately; c) the selling by flood victims of\n            their lands and houses prompted the following mitigation\n            measures: a rapid socio-economic study will be conducted to\n            determine the extent of flood victims' willingness to\n            remain in place, although the proximity to Port Doraleh, and\n            its benefiting from several donor-financed projects, makes\n            it a more viable, livable place. ADETIP will also ensure the\n            integration of newly resettled families within existing\n            socio-economic structures, and activities."}, "docdt": "2004-07-20T00:00:00Z"}
