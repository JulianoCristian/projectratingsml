as satisfactory. However,\n            the project's overall sustainability is rated as\n            unlikely. This is due, in part, to country conditions beyond\n            the control of the sector as well as because much of the\n            reform agenda still remains to be implemented. Overall, Bank\n            performance is adjudged satisfactory although it could have\n            been more effective regarding institutional strengthening\n            and donor coordination. Similarly, Borrower performance is\n            rated as satisfactory. Lessons relevant for other emergency\n            reconstruction projects are: Although projects of this type\n            tend to focus on the more urgent physical investment\n            interventions, their eventual sustainability is affected by\n            achieving the necessary institutional and policy\n            improvements. Project design should therefore include\n            explicit objectives to be achieved in a phased manner,\n            including improving the financial state of the utilities and\n            strengthening management and operations. The Bank should\n            take the lead in seeking and achieving donor coordination\n            and consistency in key project matters, including the design\n            and implementation of the policy and institutional\n            framework. The project's content and impact should be\n            assessed conservatively, close to the core of Bank financing\n            allocated. Implementation arrangements should build on\n            locally available expertise, and expatriate technical\n            assistance should be limited."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
