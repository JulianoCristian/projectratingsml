is moderately satisfactory, the\n            project's sustainability is unlikely, the institutional\n            development impact is modest, and the Bank and Borrower\n            performance are both satisfactory overall. Two main lessons\n            emerge from this project experience: 1) In an emergency\n            reconstruction program, it is essential to have a workable\n            coordination system in place to avoid duplication of effort\n            and inconsistent applications of policy that lead to\n            different treatment.  regimes. The objectives of this\n            project were not attained at the planned level, as most\n            funding aid-agencies opted to work on their own (instead of\n            contributing to the agreed upon Sector Recovery Program\n            (SRP)). The use of differing sets of policy and procedures\n            caused confusion during project implementation, and\n            unplanned overlaps in donor activities led to a reduction in\n            the overall program scope. In the end, lack of coordination\n            weakened sector reform activities, and prevented the phased\n            implementation of the rest of the SRP operations within the\n            anticipated timeframe. 2) The rapid post-emergency appraisal\n            of operations sometimes requires flexibility, but it is\n            still necessary that key components be fully defined within\n            the project implementation period. In this case,\n            institutional strengthening should have included\n            well-specified and realistic activities that would have\n            assisted sector agencies to improve operational efficiency\n            in incremental steps. In the midst of hectic repair and\n            rehabilitation efforts, institutional development measures\n            such as reducing unaccounted water, improving efficiency and\n            skills of staff and improving collection of bills, received\n            lower priority. A stepwise package of the most urgent\n            measures should have been defined in the project documents\n            to ensure that the various entities could take needed first\n            steps to return to normal operations after the crisis."}, "docdt": "2003-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
