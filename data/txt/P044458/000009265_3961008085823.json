areas; (ii) develop a long term sector strategy and\n            the details of an emergency project consistent with the\n            strategy; (iii) rebuild and strengthen sector institutions\n            so that the improvements will be sustainable; and (iv)\n            prepare final designs and bidding documents for the\n            rehabilitation project. The project consists of five parts:\n            (a) the supply of equipment and materials, including pipe,\n            fittings, spare parts and rolling stock for water, sewerage\n            and solid waste disposal operating organizations to meet\n            urgent requirements for systems operations; (b) urgent works\n            for the provision of water supply, sanitation and solid\n            waste services for municipalities, including rehabilitation\n            and repair of water sources and distribution networks; (c)\n            emergency development plan for the water management sector;\n            (d) institutional strengthening, focusing on strategic\n            planning and sector organization, project, financial and\n            maintenance management, computer skills and reduction of\n            unaccounted-for water; and (e) preparation of the water,\n            sanitation and solid waste rehabilitation project."}, "docdt": "1996-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
