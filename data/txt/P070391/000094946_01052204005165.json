the rural population in Yemen. The components\n            will: 1) test, and demonstrate new technical standards for\n            rural access roads, selected as pilot projects in different\n            Governorates with high poverty incidences. Supervision, and\n            civil works will feature road width, and slope\n            stabilization; bituminous surfacing; embankment design, and\n            wadi hydrology; measures to prevent terrace destruction, and\n            erosion; and, local participation/consultation in the\n            planning process; 2) test rural accessibility in at least\n            fifty km of village access roads, through planning methods\n            for civil works, and construction supervision, and,\n            consultations with beneficiaries will be conducted. It\n            includes technical designs, and water harvesting techniques,\n            with specific environmental measures; 3) establish\n            participatory processes on rural access planning, and\n            support the technical preparation work for civil works to be\n            executed during the second phase of the project, including\n            design studies, and bidding documents; 4) establish\n            institutional frameworks, and capacity building to support\n            the decentralized management of rural access improvements.\n            Institutional arrangements will lay the foundation for\n            revised technical, and environmental standards, and\n            procedures, and, consolidate the national budget for rural\n            roads, through training, workshops, and studies, as well as\n            technical assistance; 5) finance supplemental operating\n            costs, and equipment, including staff salaries, and\n            vehicles; and, 6) finance the rehabilitation of the Al Ahmar\n            - An Naqbah Road, including repair works, drainage\n            improvements, and protection works."}, "docdt": "2001-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
