Some lessons learned included:\n            it has been generally observed that contract management is\n            at present the main weakness of local contractors. This\n            should be carefully considered when designing future\n            projects in Yemen, especially when assessing the capacity of\n            the local construction industry and estimating the\n            contracts' implementation periods. The environment in\n            Yemen is in general very difficult for contractors and small\n            works in isolated rural areas are unlikely to be financially\n            attractive, even for large Yemeni contractors, because of\n            the high mobilization and administration costs of contracts\n            and the high risks. The use of preliminary designs (and not\n            final designs as was done for this project for two thirds of\n            the contracts) should be limited as much as possible. Local\n            consultation and participation in the design and\n            implementation process have proved to be highly effective in\n            making designs more relevant and in facilitating\n            implementation. The experience of this project has shown\n            that it is a rather complex exercise to set specific outcome\n            targets and that it should be done on a case by case basis\n            with a careful analysis of potential improvements."}, "docdt": "2007-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
