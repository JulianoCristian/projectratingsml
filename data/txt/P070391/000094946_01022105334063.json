three-phased Adaptable Lending Program. The\n            pilot roads in Phase I will be purposefully selected to\n            minimize adverse environmental and social impacts and avoid\n            resettlement and land acquisition. Four main issues have\n            been identified to improve and create environmentally-sound\n            technical designs: water harvesting on mountain roads to\n            reduce road surface degradation, narrower platforms to avoid\n            deep cuts into the mountainside, road surfacing to be\n            stabilized on steep slopes to avoid erosion, slope\n            stabilization on sections of the roads where slopes are\n            unstable, and controlled disposal at designated sites of\n            material cut from the hillside slopes. The project will\n            address these issues by assisting the Government to revise\n            the design standards for rural roads and try out new\n            standards for rural roads. Specific measures to reduce\n            potential impacts of physical works will be taken regarding\n            the detailed design, construction tenders, construction\n            process, and contractor performance monitoring. Contracts\n            will contain requirements for proper management of\n            construction waste; control measures for waste fuel, oil\n            and, lubricants; reduction of noise and dust levels; and\n            rehabilitation of areas used for construction detours and\n            sites used to temporarily store construction materials.\n            Contractors will be required to provide and maintain\n            equipment with proper noise abatement controls."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
