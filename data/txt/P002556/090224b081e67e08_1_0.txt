units each of about 30 MW rated capacity operating
under a head ranging from 17 to 48 meters, together
with associated electrical and mechanical equipment;
(b) (i) the construction of a 220 KY transmission system
consisting of a single circuit 220 KV transmission line,
about 490 km long, fron the power house to Khartoum
and substation equipment for the Khartoum and
Meringan substations, and (ii) the extension of the
existing 110 KV transmission system consisting of a
double circuit 110 KV transmission line, about 16 im
long, from the Khartoum substation to a new substa-

equipment for these substations;
(c) the installation of a gas turbine generating unit of
