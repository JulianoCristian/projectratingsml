It includes (a) construction of a 70\n            meter high earth dam on the Guatape River, inlet and\n            discharge tunnels, and an underground power station with\n            four generating units, as well as related transmission\n            facilities; (b) consultant services for engineering, civil\n            works and supervision; and (c) a study of power losses to\n            ascertain their nature, size and occurrence as a basis for\n            recommending a program to minimize them. Once completed, the\n            San Carlos I station will be the largest power generating\n            facility within the integrated system, with an installed\n            capacity of 620 MW. The second phase, to be constructed at a\n            future date, will permit installation of an additional 930\n            MW. The project will continue the Bank's institution\n            building efforts in the sector started in 1950. In\n            particular, it will strengthen centralized planning, as well\n            as the management and operations of two of ISA's\n            shareholders. The 500KV Interconnection Project will achieve\n            the long-standing objective of interconnecting the\n            country's major power systems. It includes (a) a 523\n            km, single circuit 500 kV transmission line between the\n            Central and Atlantic regions, two terminal and two\n            intermediate substations, and (b) consultant services for\n            engineering, civilworks and supervision. Once completed, the\n            interconnection line will ease projected energy deficits\n            under adverse hydrological conditions by providing thermal\n            backup to the Central system. It will also contribute to\n            substantial fuel savings (amounting to over US$1.3 billion\n            in end-1976 prices over the life of the project, or about\n            US$160 million at present value) which will result from the\n            Atlantic system's having access to hydro-electricity\n            during periods of normal hydrology. The project is subject\n            to risks normally associated with construction of high\n            voltage lines in mountainous terrain, but adequate\n            safeguards have been taken to minimize them."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
