It includes (a) construction of a 70\n            meter high earth dam on the Guatape River, inlet and\n            discharge tunnels, and an underground power station with\n            four generating units, as well as related transmission\n            facilities; (b) consultant services for engineering, civil\n            works and supervision; and (c) a study of power losses to\n            ascertain their nature, size and occurrence as a basis for\n            recommending a program to minimize them. Once completed, the\n            San Carlos I station will be the largest power generating\n            facility within the integrated system, with an installed\n            capacity of 620 MW. The second phase, to be constructed at a\n            future date, will permit installation of an additional 930\n            MW. The project will continue the Bank's institution\n            building efforts in the sector started in 1950. In\n            particular, it will strengthen centralized planning, as well\n            as the management and operations of two of ISA's shareholders."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
