NORTHERN GRID EXTENSION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republfc of Ghana
Beneficiary:        Volta River Authority
Amount:             SDR 5.2 million (US$6.3 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard
Relending Terms:    The Government would relend the full amount of the
Credit to VRA at the prevailing (currently 8.23%)
Bank interest rate for 20 years including 5 years of
grace. VRA would bear the foreign exchange risk on
the Credit.
Project
Description:        The proposed project would assist Ghana to provide a
reliable and economical electricity supply by
reinforcing the southern grid, by extending the
transmission system to economically important
northern areas of the country, and by reinforcing
and expanding distribution facilities in these
areas. The proposed project consists of:
(4) construction of 161 km of single circuit 161 kV
transmission lines on the southern grid
(Akosombo-Tafo and Akwratia-New Obuasi) to
alleviate load shedding, increase transfer
capabilities to C8te d'lvoire and reduce system
losses;
(b) construction of 581 km of single-circuit 161 kV
transmission lines (Kumasi-Techiman-Tamale-
Bolgatanga, with a spur to Sunyani) to extend
the grid to the north;
(c) construction of 161 kV substations at Sunyani,
Techiman, Tamale and Bolgatanga with provision
at the Bolgatanga substation for a possible
future line to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso;
(d) construction of 60 km of single-circuit 161 kV
light transmission lines (Sunyani-Mim) for
initial 33 kV operation;



(e) construction of 33 kV subtransmission lines and
stepdown substations to connect presently
isolated diesel systems to the grid;
(f) installation of distribution facilities and
associated equipment to expand supply in 10
towns; and
(g) associated engineering and project management
services.
Project Benefits
and Risks:          The main benefit of the project would be the
provision of reliable power supply at lower cost to
ten agricultural and commercial centers in the
northern areas, thus significantly reducing present
infrastructural bottlenecks to growth. There are no
unusual risks associated with the proposed project.

NORTHERN GRID EXTENSION PROJECT
I. ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. Energy Resources and Consumption
1.1       Ghana has substantial energy resources, of which fuelwood and
hydropower are the most important. Forests cover about 8.8 million
hectares, three quarters of the country's land area, and are concentrated
in the high forest zone in the southwest, where most of the timber industry
is located. The northern savanna woodland has less timber potential, but
is the most important source of domestic fuelwood. Deforestation is a
growing problem in this area and fuelwood scarcities are beginning to
develop as a result. A Forestry Sector Review is currently under
preparation.
1.2       Ghana's hydroelectric potential has been the subject of many
studies, some dating from the 1920s but which have mainly covered specific
projects or regions. The country's total technically exploitable hydro
potential is estimated at 10,000 GWh annually (2,000 MW), derived mainly
from three major river systems (Volta, Tano, Pra) in the central and
western regions. The presently installed hydro plant capacity is 1,072 MW,
based on two dams on the Volta River. Other sites on the Black Volta, Pra,
Tano and Oti rivers have been studied to pre-feasibility stage and one of
these, Bui (450 MW and 1,175 GWh) has been studied to full feasibility
level. However, the cost of developing these sites is higher than that of
thermal alternatives. There has been no comprehensive, country-wide survey
of small hydro potential, although some of 40 recently identified sites
could possibly provide an economic supply to isolated centers.
1.3       Proven reserves of petroleum are less than 2.5 million barrels;
offshore deposits of both crude oil and natural gas have been identified at
Saltpond, Tano and Cape Three Points, but their size remains to be
confirmed. Further field evaluation work is being carried out under the
ongoing Energy Project (Credit 1373-GH, May 1983). Ghana has no known
depos4ts of solid hydrocarbons. Solar energy is plentiful with most
regions receiving in excess of 1,900 kours of annual sunshine. This
potential has not yet been exploited to any extent. Wind regimes are
moderate, and insufficient for energy purposes based on existing
technology.
1.4       Net energy consumption in 1985 is estimated at 3.1 million toe,
rather low given the structure of the economy and its favorable energy
resource endowment. The bulk of consumption is fuelwood (70%) followed by
petroleum products (22%), agricultural residues (5%) and electricity (3%).
Commercial energy consumption increased steadily throughout the 1970s and
early 1980s despite the deteriorating economy, spurred by subsidized
petroleum products and low real prices for electricity. However, consump-
tion declined sharply after 1982 because of shortages of both petroleum and
electricity, but recovered as supply conditions normalized in 1985. The
transport (43%), industry and mining (20%) and household (18%) sectors
account for most commercial energy consumption. An overall energy balance



for Ghana is contained in Annex 1-1. Energy sector issues have been
examined in considerable detail as part of the UNDP/World Bank Energy/
Sector Assessment Program. This sector review report (Ref. No. 16) - was
discussed with the Government of Ghana (GOG) in September 1986.
B. Enerty Sector Or anization
1.5       The Ministry of Fuel and Power (MFP) has principal responsibility
for petroleum and electricity. It supervises the state-owned Ghana
National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), Ghana Oil Corporation (GOIL), and
the refining company Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Corporation (GHAIP), which
deal with the full range of oil related activities, as well as the two
power sector entities -- the Volta River Authority (VRA) and the
Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG). VRA supplies electricity in bulk
to ECG, the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), several mines, the Akosombo
Textile Company (AKOTEX), and Akosombo Township. VRA also exports
electricity .o Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB) and Energi.e Electrique
de la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI). ECG distributes the electricity it receives
from VRA, and also operates 19 isolated diesel stations. To strengthen
overall energy sector planning, GOG has recently created the National
Energy Board (NEB).
1.6       MFP is responsible for establishing and supervising implementa-
tion of overall policy for the sector and is currently preparing a
statement of sectoral development policy for inclusion in the proposed
structural adjustment program. MFP has recently submitted to IDA a
preliminary statement of financial objectives for the power sector which
will provide the basis for regulating the future performance of ECG and VRA
(para. 1.36).
1.7       Since its foundation in 1961, VRA has operated as a quasi-enclave
within Ghana, has been well managed and has largely met its responsi-
bilities within the sector. ECG, set up in 1967 to succeed the Electricity
Division of the Ministry of Works and Housing, has somewhat more complex
responsibilities than those of VRA, but has suffered from ineffective
management and has failed to perform satisfactorily. In an effort to
improve overall sector effectiveness, the Electricity Supply Board of
Ireland (ESB), acting as consultant to GOG, studied the situation and
concluded that a merger of VRA and ECG offered the best prospect for the
future development of the sector (Ref. No. 1). GOG, with the concurrence
of IDA, considered the merger to be premature, but retained it as a
long-term objective. In the short term, attention will be focussed upon
improving the efficiency of ECG.
1.8       Subsequently, to enhance cooperation between ECG and VRA, GOG
announced the setting up of joint committees covering the use of services
and facilities in areas such as computing, transportation, procurement and
training. A mechanism whereby ECG could purchase foreign exchange from VRA
has also been established. ESB has also carried out a complete diagnostic
11   Selected documents available in the Project File are listed in pages
iii-iv, and are referred to in this report by their reference numbers
in that listing.



study (Ref. No. 2) of ECG's organization, management, operations and
personnel needs under the ongoing Power Sector Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1628-GH, September 1985). The study provides the basis for
improving ECG's performance and, following discussion with IDA in July
1986, ESB is assisting ECG to impl_ment the agreed recommendations.
1.9       In order for the proposed project to be successful, substantial
distribution investment is needed in the project area. Traditionally, this
component would be implemented by ECG. However, as ECG is about to embark
upon a major rehabilitation of its existing system and improvement to its
internal management, the involvement of ECG in the proposed project would
risk both deflecting ECG from these tasks and the timely implementation of
the proposed project. Although the project area (Brong Ahafo, Northern,
Upper East and Upper West regions), is geographically large and diverse,
its electricity consumers comprise less than 2% of ECG's present market.
In order to maximize the return on investment, the benefits oI
electrification need to be secured as soon as the project is completed.
This will require a considerable strengthening of the present distribution
arrangements in the project area. Furthermore, considerable skill and
resources will be required to maintain the existing diesel-based service
through 1990, particularly to enhance generating efficiency and
reliability, to coordinate the new interim diesel investments that are
likely to be required and to ensure their consistency with longer-term
needs.
1.10      Consequently, GOG, VRA and ECG have agreed that the projtLt will
be implemented by VRA and that VRA will take over from ECG the
responsibility for all power sector activities in the project area from
January 1, 1987. As it will not be possible for VRA to take physical
charge of all power operations in the project area on this date, the
transfer will be phased over the first half of 1987 using ECG's services on
an agency basis.  VRA has established a separate department or "profit
centre" for its new responsibilities to which will be transferred the
existing fixed assets of ECG in the project area, at an agreed valuation.
This transfer would not prejudice the longer-term organization of the power
sector and would be reviewed by GOG, VRA and RCG after 3 years (i.e. during
1990). In staffing the new department VRA is giving priority to ECG staff
in the project area; satisfactory arrangements would be made for staff not
so recruited, either by transfer within ECG, preferential consideration by
contractors involved in project construction, or by severance. Some
redundancies are accepted as inevitable but explicit local cost provision
could not be made in the proposed project as the exact numbers and their
entitlements to severance pay are not yet known. It was agreed at
negotiations that this matter would be addressed in the context of ongoing
structural adjustment discussions. VRA's consultants have already carried
out a survey of ECG's installation in the project area as a basis for their
valuation and to determine the resources required to maintain power supply
in the project area till completion of the proposed project. Cost
estimates will be available by December 1986 and VRA will then present a
proposal for their financing to the Kuwait Fund for Development which has
already agreed in principle to finance these investments. At negotiations
GOG submitted a satisfactory program and timetable to implement the
transfer of responsibility, including drafts of the minor legal amendments
to the VRA and ECG Acts.

C.  Energy Policy and Pricing
1.11      Government energy policy is designed to: (i) reduce the cost of
energy supplies to the economy in the short term through rehabilitation of
installations in the petroleum and electricity sub-sectors; (ii) reduce
dependence on petroleum imports; and (iii) improve forestry management to
provide an adequate long-term supply of fuelwood. Other sector objectives
include promotion of more efficient energy use through demand management
and strengthening of institutions and the planning process in the sector.
1.12      Prices of petroleum products and electricity fell sharply in real
terms from the mid 1970s till 1983, as a result of high domestic inflation
and over-valued exchange rates during that period. After the major deval-
uation of the cedi in 1983, domestic energy prices were increased very
sharply to bring them back into line with their international equivalents.
Subsequent increases have generally kept up with the successive devalua-
tions since then. With the exception of kerosene and LPG, petroleum
product prices are now above international levels but are still lower than
those in neighboring countries. Some inter-product price distortions also
exist, particularly with regard to kerosene. A product pricing study is
underway, financed by UNID0, and is expected to be completed by end-1986.
This will establish a mechanism for future adjustments of petroleum product
prices. Electricity pricing policy and tariffs are discussed in
paras. 1.35-1.37.
D. Existing BlectricitY Supply Facilities
1.13      Ghana's total installed public generating capacity (detailed in
Annex 1-2) is about 1,122 MW of which 1,072 MW (95%) is hydroelectric. Two
stations on the Volta River, owned by VRA, at Akosombo (912 MW), and Kpong
(160 MW), provide 95% of installed capacity. Both stations are in good
condition and are capable of providing firm energy (in 49 years out of 50)
of 4,792 GWh/year and can deliver 6,055 GWh/year on average. The remainder
comprises diesel units installed in 19 stations varying in size from 118 kV
to 30 MW which are generally in poor condition.
1.14      Ghana's transmission system is shown on Map 19767, and comprises
over 1,300 km of 161 kV lines. Eight circuits of 67 km each connect the
Akosombo and Kpong hydro plants to the VALCO smelter at Tema and other
industrial loads, while a 650 km transmission loop supplies ECG and mines
in southern Ghana. A 161 kV double circuit line provides an inter-
connection with CEB, connecting Akosombo to Lome, Togo. The Cote d'Ivoire
was interconnected in 1983 through a 225 kV transmission line capable of
supplying a peak demand of 100 MW.
1.15      ECG distributes power in the urban centers located within an
interconnected grid in the southern part of Ghana, and operates a number of
diesel plants that supply power to isolated towns. ECG's distribution
facilities comprise 33 kV and 11 kV lines and underground cables with
33/11/0.4 kV substatlons feeding power from VRA's transmission system or
ECG's diesel plants. ECG's distribution losses (at least 15%) are
unsatisfactory. In recent years service within the interconnected grid has
deteriorated due largely to poor mitintenance and inadequate reinforcement
of the distribution system. The isolated systems serving small towns have
even more serious problems, arising from the age of the generating units



- 5 -
and lack of fuel and spare parts. Most of these centers do not have
24-hour supply and there is a high level of suppressed demand (para. 2.16
and Ref. No. 19).
1.16      Total captive generation capacity (Annex 1-2) is estimated at
about 30 MW, of which about 23 MW is installed in six organizations in the
mining and timber industries, hospitals, the Water and Sewerage Corporation
and some commercial enterprises. With the exception of Mim Timber Company
(installed capacity 2.3 MW) and the other sawmills, it is mainly used for
standby purposes in the event of power failures.
E.   Access to Service
1.17      ECG has about 240,000 customer connections of which about 70% are
concentrated in the five cities of Accra, Kumasi, Tema, Takoradi and Cape
Coast. There are about 20,000 customers in tho towns north of Kumasi who
are not connected to the VRA grid. As about 75% of ECG's customers are
classified as/domestic, the degree of access to electricity is 15% of the
population. -   In 1981, when ECG's residential sales were at their
all-time high, average consumption per domestic consumer was 2,700 kWh,
with an average consumption in Accra of nearly 3,900 kWh.
F.   Trend and Pattern of Consumption
1.18      ECG's sales since 1975 are detailed in Annex 1-3;  peak sales
were achieved in 1978, but have since declined. Sales fell sharply in the
period 1982-84, mainly because of the severe drought that necessitated a
program of load shedding for almost nine months during 1983-84, but have
since recovered following the lifting of restrictions on consumption in
September 1984. However, ECG's 1985 sales of 946 GWh were still below
their all-time peak level.
1.19      ECG's commercial and industrial customers account for about 20%
and 34% respectively of its sales. Their consumption grew up to the mid-
1970s and declined thereafter, while domestic coiumption continued to
increase both in absolute and percentage terms. -   This is the result of
the failure of electricity rates to keep up with inflation and the high
demand for electricity even in the face of large reductions in real incomes.
G. Electricity Exports
1.20      Ghana is an important exporter of electricity through its sales
to its neighbors and to the enclave aluminum smelter owned by VALCO, that
was set up to take advantage of the plentiful hydropower from Akosombo.
Prior to the recent drought, about 75% of electricity sales were for
export. VRA's sales to VALCO which peaked at 3,300 GWh/year in 1980 and
1981 are shown in Annex 1-3; they were on a "take or pay" basis for energy
up to agreed power ceilings until 1984, but have since been determined on
2/   Using a total population of 12.2 million and a 1C person household.
3/   Up till the time consumption patterns were distorted by load shedding.



- 6 -
the basis of an arithmetical formula that is applied to generation from the
Akosombo plant. The unprecedented drought of 1982-83 forced a complete
shutdown of the smelter for over 18 months, but supplies to CEB were main-
tained, albeit at a sharply reduced level. These were restored to their
normal level of around 500 GWh per year in late 1984. After completion of
a tie-line in 1983, Ghana was able to start exporting to Cote d'Ivoire,
which was also suffering power shortages arising from the drought. The
large storage volume available in the Volta Lake also enables VRA to
reverse the energy flow between the two countries and store hydro energy
for EECI in wet years, such as 1985.
H.   Sector Development. Planning and Investment Program
Onsoing Rehabilitation
1.21      Rehabilitation of the distribution system, the rebuilding of ECG
into an efficient utility and the restoration of VRA's generating capacity
and financial strength are essential elements of the overall economic
recovery in Ghana. They are being tackled in a number of complementary
ways and the process will be further reinforced by the proposed project.
The ongoing project (Credit 1628-GH) has as its principal objective the
rehabilitation of ECG's distribution system. It also includes a package of
technical assistance and training that would improve ECG's metering,
billing and revenue collection performance. ECG has a serious problem of
-very large accounts receivable which had been compounded by the recent
large tariff increases and the breakdown of billing procedures. The
problem of inter-public enterprise indebtedness is being tackled with the
assistance of the Bank of Ghana and will also be addressed under the
forthcoming structural adjustment program and public enterprise reform
project.
1.22      In 1984 VRA improved its future financial prospects by negotia-
ting higher prices for its sales to VALCO and CEB. The floor price for
sales to VALCO is now USil/kWh and to CEB it is USW4/kWh.  VRA also reduced
the quantity of electricity it is obliged to sell to VALCO, particularly in
years of poor rainfall, thereby protecting the domestic market from load
shedding and releasing electricity for sale to neighboring utilities which
are willing to pay significantly higher prices than VALCO. The contract
with VALCO is discussed in more depth in the SAR for Credit 1628-GH (Ref.
No. 21). The good rains in 1985 have also substantially restored VRA's
generating capacity by partially refilling the Volta Lake, and the greater
flexibility offered by the new contract with VALCO should help to ensure
that electricity rationing on the scale of 1984 can be avoided in future.
Future Sector Needs
1.23      Now that the decline in the economy has been reversed, attention
has turned to the medium term, and priorities are being adjusted to promote
expansion. In 1984, VRA's consultants (Acres International, Canada),
carried out a comprehensive 20-year system expansion planning study
(Ref. No. 3) defining a medium term investment program for the electricity
sector. In 1985, thk Bank also undertook a review of VRA's investment
options for the period 1986-1995 (Ref. No. 16). Briefly, these studies
determined that:



(i) for generation (a) there is no imminent capacity constraint,
(b) no available hydrosite in Ghana appears to be economically
competitive with thermal alternatives during the period up to the
end of the century; and (c) thermal capacity will be needed in
the 1990s to complement hydro generation as the domestic load
grows; and
(ii) for transmission, several priority projects have been identified
to reinforce the existing grid and extend it northwards to supply
towns now on diesel-based supply and eventually to link up with
Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso.
1.24      GOG's approved sector investment program through 1990 (at
constant prices) would comprise principally the ongoing rehabilitation
project (US$39 million) and the proposed project (US$110 million). VRA's
capital expenditure program (Annex 1-4) includes additional works, some of
which are in progress, and some possible future projects (para. 1.39).
1.25      VRA is discussing with SONABEL (Burkina Faso) the possibility of
interconnecting the VRA and SONABEL systems by extending the 161 kV system
from Bolgatanga to Ouagadougou, a distance of 200 km including 25 km within
Ghana. SONABEL is currently developing the 15 MW Kompienga hydro project,
and is considering development of the 16 MW Bagre hydrosite. Even with
these projects, Ouagadougou could still absorb 10 MW (80 GWh annually) of
electricity from Ghana, starting in the mid-1990s. Preliminary studies
(Ref. Nos. 10, 16) indicate that Ghanaian hydropower would be more economic
than the present diesel generation in Ouagadougou. From Ghana's perspec-
tive such a line would not only increase export revenues, but also the
returns to the proposed project by increasing capacity utilization in the
early years.
I. VRA - The Implementina ARency
1.26      The 1961 Volta River Development Act (VRD) (Ref. No. 4), requires
VRA not only to operate its plants according to sound public utility prac-
tices, but also to develop the Volta Lake for transportation, fishing and
tourism. VRA is presently authorized to sell the electricity it generates
from any source in bulk to any public corporation or government department.
The VRD Act will be amended to permit VRA to play an expanded role in the
sector as envisaged in the proposed project (para. 1.10). VRA is governed
by a Board appointed by the Head of State, and is composed of a Chairman
and seven other members, including VRA's Chief Executive, the Managing
Directors of ECG and VALCO, and a VRA staff member. VRA's organization and
management is satisfactory; an organization chart is shown in Annex 1-5.
1.27      At the end of 1985, VRA had 2,429 employees of which 1,588 were
directly engaged in electricity operations. VRA has been able to build up
and retain good staff in spite of low salaries because of its financial and
managerial independence, and relatively good working conditions. It has an
active program of staff training at its own school, and staff are also sent
on management programs botlh in Ghana and abroad. In addition it has
recently started sending younger professional staff for longer periods of
on-the-job training with a Canadian utility.



-8-
J. VRA's Financial Position
Accounting and Audit
1.28      VRA's accounting and budgeting systems are generally satisfactory
and provide timely and reliable financial information. VRA's electricity
operations are financially separate from the other (lake transport, reset-
tlement and other lake activities) operations for which it is responsible
and for which separate accounts are kept. As part of a continuing process
of strengthening its management, VRA plans to appoint a Deputy Chief
Executive (Finance) and is seeking a highly qualified and suitably
experienced person from outside VRA for the post.
1.29      VRA maintains its accounts in accordance with appropriate inter-
national standards and, in particular, undertakes an annual revaluation of
fixed assets using an indexation formula agreed with the Bank Group; VRA
has also adjusted satisfactorily the cedi value of its long-term foreign
debt, following recent devaluations.
1.30      VRA's accounts have always been audited without qualification and
the audited accounts have been submitted to the Bank Group within the
agreed 6 months of the fiscal year end. VRA has aRreed to continue to do
this under the proposed project. VRA's present auditors (Coopers and
Lybrand, Accra) are satisfactory. VRA has, in recent years, charged to its
revenue account both depreciation, based on currently valued fixed assets,
and an amount representing the amortization of exchange rate losses on its
long-term foreign debt. While such accounting treatment is acceptable, the
amortization is a non-operating expense which should be disregarded in rate
fixing and in calculations for purposes of Bank Group covenants. VRA's
accounts for FYs 1983-1985 as presented here have been adjusted accordingly.
Past Financial Performance
1.31      VRA's Income and Funds Flow statements and Balance Sheets are set
out in Annexes 1-6 through 1-8. VRA's financial performance from the start
of operations in 1968 through 1981 was generally satisfactory with rates of
return on average equity in the range of 5-6%, slightly below the level
agreed with the Bank Group at that time. Since 1981, VRA's sales have been
adversely affected by the deteriorating economy and prolonged drought,
while the impact on VRA's operations of substantial cedi devaluations were
not offset by timely and adequate rate increases. The drought forced VRA
to cut off supplies to VALCO for 18 months from June 1983, to reduce
exports to CEB and to introduce domestic rationing. Consequently, VRA's
rate of return in 1983 was negative. Subsequently, VRA was able to raise
rates charged to domestic consumers and CEB, and to renegotiate its con-
tract with VALCO in such a way as to raise the rate to at least USil/kWh
while giving priority to the domestic market. Following these rate
increases and improved rainfall, VRA's rate of return on average equity
rose to about 3% in 1984 and 6% in 1985, with similar rates of return on
revalued net fixed assets.
1.32      Between 1983-1985 VRA was able to contribute 57% of a modest
investment program from internal funds, after meeting debt service, because
of retroactive billings to VALCO and revenue arising from currency adjust-
ments; in 1985 debt service coverage was a comfortable 1.8 times.



- 9 -
1.33      As of December 31, 1985, VRA's capitalization was US$369 million
equivalent; the debt/equity ratio was satisfactory at 32/68 but liquidity
(the current ratio was 1.1) needed to be improved. Accounts receivable
were excessive, at almost 6 months' billings, and much of the problem rests
with ECG, whose billing and collection arrangements have been in disarray
(para. 1.21). Under the power supply agreement between VRA and ECG, ECG
should settle its bills within 30 days of receipt. Under the ongoing power
project (Credit 1628-GH), ECG has agreed to clear its overdue bills to VRA
and an action plan has been formulated to achieve this in 1987. VRA agreed
during negotiations to ensure that future billings to all its custMe rs are
settled in accordance with the respective power supply agreements -
1.34      VRA is permitted to operate a US dollar account in New York, into
which are paid dollar revenues from VALCO and from exports, and from which
VRA services its foreign debt and finances operational and capital foreign
exchange requirements. Following a poor year in 1983, VRA had to obtain a
US$6 million short-term loan from its US bankers to meet foreign exchange
commitments; US$3 million of this was outstanding on December 31, 1985.
However, given average rainfall from 1986 onwards, this account is forecast
to be in surplus through the project period (Annex 1-9). Under adverse
hydrological conditions, on the other hand, VRA could again be faced with a
shortage of foreign exchange to cover debt service. Consequently, VRA has
aareed to set aside funds (a Contingency Fund) in foreign exchange,
equivalent to not less than its future annual foreign debt service
obligations. This fund would be built-up initially by annual
appropriations from VRA's earnings through 1990 to an amount equivalent to
about US$35 willion and would then be adjusted in accordance with the level
of VRA's debt service obligations.
Tariffs and Financial Obiectives
1.35      VRA requests rate increases from MFP.  After proposals have been
reviewed and accepted by MFP, final approval is sought from the PNDC
Committee of Secretaries. Full details of both ECG's and VRA's cnrrent
tariffs are set out in Annex 1-10.  VRA's average rate is expected to be
about C 1.7/kWh (USd1.9/kWh) in 1986 following substantial domestic tariff
increases from April 1986. Current average prices to Ghanaian consumers
range from C 2.7/kWh for ECG and the mines, to C 4.1/kWh for AXOTEX. VRA's
domestic bulk supply rates include the recovery of the cost of diesel
generation in provincial centers, which VRA reimburses to ECG so that the
burden of these costs is spread amongst all domestic consumers.  VL's from
supplies to VALCO are presently billed at slightly over USl1/kWh. -  The
price of sales to CEB is USA4/kWh until March 31, 1988 when the contract is
due for renegotiation. Up to October 1985 supplies to Cate d'Ivoire were
billed at US44/kWh, but a new long-term contract remains to be negotiated.
ECG's average rate in 1986 is expected to be C 5/kWh (US.5.6/kWh).
4/   The contractual period for settlement of bills rendered to VALCO and
EECI is 30 days, and 60 days for CEB.
5/   US41/kWh is the base price to which an escalation formula, related to
the quantity sold and the world aluminum price, is applied.



- 10 -
1.36       The need to ensure an adequate level of financial resources,
including foreign exchange, to meet the operational, maintenance and
developmental needs of the power sector as a whole, led to an agreement
under the ongoing power project (Credit 1628-GH) to undertake a tariff
study. The study would also examine the extent and the method of "taxing"
the consumer surplus enjoyed as a result of the low economic and financial
cost of electricity in Ghana so as to enhance GOG's resource mobilization
efforts and assist broader national developmental objectives. Based on the
original timetable for the tariff study, an agreement should have been
reacbed with the Bank Group by June 30, 1986 on appropriate financial
objectives and earnings requirements for VRA and ECG. However, delays in
selecting and appointing consultants (Coopers & Lybrand, UK) to undertake
the tariff study, meant that they were unable to commence work till October
1986. Pending the outcome of the tariff study Government has, however,
identified a number of broad but satisfactory measures that will form the
basis for formulating objectives consistent with the aim of providing an
efficient, economic and affordable national supply of electricity: the
highest priority will be given to resource mobilization by charging a
national tariff that covers supply costs and a reasonable contribution to
the sector's investment requirements, and that also produces a dividend on
equity; the present 10% tax on residential electricity consumption will be
extended to all Ghanaian customers and VRA's foreign currency earnings will
be subject to power sector priorities - VRA debt servicing and ECG's and
VRA's operation and maintenance requirements. As part of its current
review of public enterprises, Government would also establish performance
targets for VRA and ECG.
1.37      Under the ongoing power project (Credit 1628-GH) and pending the
outcome of the tariff study, both VRA and ECG are required to generate at
least a 25% internal contribution to investment. However, for VRA a better
measure of the efficiency with which it manages its large currently-valued
fixed asset base would be a rate of return on such assets. In order to
ensure adequate liquidity over this period, VRA has agreed to earn a rate
of return of at least 8% annually on its currently valued net fixed assets
in operation. The appropriateness of this level of earnings would be
re-examined following completion of the tariff study.
Future Financial Position
1.38      VRA's estimated capital requirements during the implementation
period of the proposed project (1986-90) amount to US$253.5 million
equivalent, of which 67% consists of the ongoing project (Credit 1628-GH)
and the proposed project. Of the amount required about 48% would be raised
from donors, including IDA. At current (1986) tariff levels and assuming
average hydrological conditions, VRA should be able to generate the
remaining 52% from internal funds after providing for debt service, an
annual dividend to GOG (at present 10% of net income), working capital, and
contributions to the proposed contingency fund. A financing plan for the
period 1986-90 is set out in Annex 1-7.
1.39      VRA has several projects in the capital program for water supply
and housing. While they are not direct power expenditures, VRA considers
them vital for continued efficient operations. The costs of these works
include foreign exchange components to be financed from VRA's foreign



- 11 -
exchange account. Furthermore, an annual provision of US$5 million was
included in VRA's capital expenditure program from 1988 rising to US$8
million from 1991 onwards to finance future distribution system expansion,
following completion of the ongoing power project (Credit 1628-GH). VRA
may also wish to embark upon further projects, as yet undefined. There-
fore, VRA has aBreed to review with IDA, three months before the
commencement of each fiscal year until the project is completed, the
composition of its capital expenditure program for the following five
years, together with a related financing plan.
1.40      Under average hydrological conditions, VRA's future financial
position should be satisfactory: full details are set out in Annexes 1-6
through 1-9. Assumptions made in preparing VRA's financial projections are
detailed in Annex 1-11. VRA's current (1986) tariffs are adequate, under
present inflation and exchange rate assumptions, to produce an annual rate
of return on currently valued net fixed assets ranging from about 13% in
1986 to 8% in 1990. Thereafter, rates may need to be increased. However,
VRA's export contracts are due to be renegotiated in the coming years,
which could improve its financial position. VRA's debt/equity ratio should
improve from 27/73 in 1986 to 25/75 in 1990 as a result of a continuing
high level of earnings and fixed asset revaluation. Liquidity indicators
(debt service coverage, current ratio) should also be satisfactory through
1990. Foreign exchange shortages after 1991 arise from financing
"additional works" from VRA's own resources; when the time comes,
borrowing to finance foreign costs could be arranged, thereby eliminating
any deficit. However, to protect VRA's future viability, in addition to
agreements in respect of the foreign debt contingency fund (para. 1.34) and
future earnings (para. 1.37), VRA has agreed during negotiations not to
incur: (a) future long-term borrowings without IDA agreement, unless
future debt service is estimated to be covered at least 1.5 times by future
net revenues; and (b) short-term borrowings in excess of 10% of cash
operating expenses.
1.41      VRA's financial projections were examined, using a low rainfall
scenario between 1989 and 1991. Despite an adverse impact on sales and
revenues, VRA should have adequate cedi resources to meet the local costs
of the proposed project, whose financing should therefore be secure.
However, in order to meet foreign debt service VRA might have to postpone
"additional works" in its capital program and, as-in 1983, arrange short
term finance.
Proiect Area Finances
1.42      Following the proposed transfer of generation and distribution
responsibility in the project area to VRA (para. 1.10), VRA has agreed to
maintain separate accounts for the project area. An income statement
showing the expected financial results from operations in the project area
from 1986 through 1993 is given in Annex 1-12. The poor results, which are
aggravated by the recent devaluation of the Cedi, reflect the high cost of
diesel-based supply, the low load, and a uniform national tariff. VRA has
agreed to meet the unavoidable operating losses from the high cost of
supply through 1990. While there is a need for a tariff increase, which
will be addressed in the ongoing tariff study, improvement in the financial
results can only be expected after the project has become fully operative
in 1991. Assuming adequate tariff levels, once the new facilities are



- 12 -
installed and the load begins to develop the area will show positive rates
of return, which are expected to progressively improve.
K. Bank Group Role in the Power Sector
History of Involvement
1.43      The Bank Group has been closely involved in the development of
Ghana's power sector for nearly 30 years. The first of three Bank loans to
VRA was made in 1961 to assist in the financing of the Akosombo dam and
power plant. Lending to ECG began soon after its formation in 1967 and the
ongoing power system rehabilitation project (Credit 1628-GH) is the seventh
operation in the sector. The amount of Bank group lending for power
projects in Ghana to date (US$150 million) exceeds that for any other
sector and has helped finance virtually all the major sector investments
since Ghana's independence.  The Bank's participation in the Akosombo and
Kpong hydro generation projects was especially important in mobilizing the
large amounts of cofinancing needed for these ambitious projects.
1.44      Two Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) have been prepared
on Ghanaian power projects. An early PPAR covered the first four projects.
The second PPAR of June 6, 1985, covering the fifth (VRA's Kpong
hydroelectric project, Loan 1380-GH) and sixth (ECG's Third Power project,
Loan 1381-GH and Credit 689-GH), emphasized the need to fully utilize
existing facilities ; fore investing in additional capacity; this is a
major objective of t* ongoing power project.
Strategy and Rational.  Jr Involvement
1.45     The Bank's continued association with the sector is essential to
secure the implementation of the necessary institutional reforms and
financial strengthening started under the ongoing power project (Credit
1628-GH). Bank Group participation in the proposed project is important to
the success of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in the northern areas of
Ghana, and would help to remove infrastrue'ture bottlenecks in that region.
Furthermore, Bank Group participation would assist GOG to obtain timely
funding for the sector's 1986-90 investment program. As the proposed
project would lay the basis for an eventual interconnection with Burkina
Paso, it is also consistent with the Bank's efforts to promote regional
cooperation in the electricity sector.
II. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives
2.1       The proposed pro4-ct would assist Ghana:
(i) to improve the reliability of the country's power supply,
reduce system losses and increase its electricity export
potential by reinforcing the southern transmission grid;
(Hi) to accelerate the economic development of the north by
bringing hydro-based grid supply to the main centers in the



- 13 -
three northern regions, which at present have only limited
supply from diesels;
(iii) to strengthen the sector's institutional arrangements by
consolidating in VRA responsibility for implementation and
operation of all aspects including distribution of the
northern grid extension project, leaving ECG free to concen-
trate on the rehabilitation of the southern system; and,
(iv) to lay the basis for an eventual interconnection with
Burkina Faso that would permit the export of additional
Ghanaian hydro-energy.
B. Project Description
2.2       The proposed project consists of the following components at
locations shown on Map 19767:
(a) Transmission
(i) construction of 161 km of single circuit 161 kV transmission
lines between Akosombo and Tafo (61 km) and Akwatia and New
Obuasi (100 km) to reinforce the southern transmission
system;
(ii) construction of 581 km of single circuit 161 kV transmission
lines to extend grid supply to the north including the
following line sections: Kumasi to Techiman (115 km),
Techiman to Sunyani (56 km), Techiman to Tamale (250 km),
Tamale to Bolgatanga (160 km);
(iii) installation of 161 kV substation facilities including: line
connections at the existing Akosombo, Tafo, Akwatia, New
Obuasi and Kumasi stations; new stations providing
161/33/11 kV stepdown transformation and switching with two
16/10/10 MVA transformers at Sunyani and Tamale and single
transformers at Techiman and Bolgatanga; four variable (7.5
to 15 MVAR) 161 kV reactors (Techiman 1, Tamale 2,
Bolgatanga 1) to provide voltage control; and
(iv) construction of 60 km of single circuit 161 kV light
transmission line (fot initial 33 kV operation) between
Sunyani and Him and installation of associated 33/11/0.4 kV
substations in the Mim area.
(b) Subtransmission and Distribution

- 14 -
load growth through about 1993 in ten northern towns --
Techiman, Sunyani, Berekum, Wenchi, Mim (Brong Ahafo
Region); Tamalse Pong Tamale (Northern Region);,Bolgatanga,
Navrongo, Bawku (Upper Region); and
(iii) adaptation of the shield wires on the 161 kV transmission
lines for 33 kV use so as to supply various smaller urban
centers.
(c) Engineerint. Management and Consulting Services
provision of consulting engineering and management services
and training for the project.
C. Project Cost
2.3       The total proje,pt cost (excluding interest during construction)
is estimated at US$130.5 million equivalent of which 78% (US$101.5 million)
is the foreign component. The estimate is based on 1986 prices and
includes a physical contingency of 10% and price escalation averaging 7%
and 10% annually for foreign and local costs, respectively (detailed in
Annex 1-11). Detailed project cost estimates by region and by system
component are set out in Annex 2-1. VRA is exempt from all taxes and
duties. Background information and technical details on the project are
given in Annex 2-2.
D. Proiect Financint
2.4       An IDA Credit of US$6.3 million is proposed which would finance
the foreign costs of engineering and management services and a part of the
distribution component, amounting to about 5% of the project cost. The IDA
Credit would be onlent by GOG to VRA for 20 years including 5 years of
grace at the prevailing (presently 8.23%) IBRD interest rate. GOG would be
repaid in US dollars, and VRA would also be responsible for the foreign
exchange risk on the IDA Creeit. VRA has agreed to bear any cost overruns,
including any extra costs associated with any implementation delays
(para. 2.11). The execution of a satisfactory subsidiary financing
agreement between GOG and VRA is a condition of Credit effectiveness.
2.5       Cofinancing of US$87.5 million equivalent has been arranged and a
detailed project financing plan is given at Annex 2-3. US$38.3 million
equivalent financing for the first phase of the project (grid reinforcement
and extension to Techiman and Sunyani /was approved by the African
Development Bank (AfDB) in iyne 1986 - . CDC and RIB will jointly provide
US$36.7 million equivalent - and CIDA US$7.5 million equivalent to finance
6/   35 million SDR loan to VRA at 9.75% for 20 years including 5 years
grace.
7/  The loan to VRA would be for 17 years including 5 years grace.  The
interest rate on the RIB portion would be 5% while CDC would charge
8.5% on its share.



- 15 -
other94ransmission and subtransmission works. 8/  The Japanese Ex-Im
Bank - has agreed to finance US$5 million equivalent of the distribution
component. The rest of the foreign cost (US$7.7 million equivalent) would
be financed by VRA, unless additional financing is arranged. (The Saudi
Fund has indicated that it may provide up to US$5 million equivalent to
finance a part of the distribution component.) VRA would also finance all
the local costs (US$29.0 million equivalent) of the project and interest
during construction (US$17.4 million equivalent). The effectiveness of
cofinancing is a condition of Credit effectiveness.
E. Prolect Implementation
Status of Preparation and Execution
2.6       The transmission and subtransmission components of the proposed
project are fully designed, based on over three years of studies covering
the technical and economic feasibility of extending grid supply to northern
Ghana, prepared by Italconsult (Italy) and Acres (Canada) (Ref. Nos. 6, 7).
Substation sites have already been selected and no problems are foreseen in
arranging line rights-of-way which parallel existing roads between the
towns on land largely controlled by the Government. The main project
component is a long transmission line through flat country, where the line
route is readily accessible from existing roads. Line construction can
proceed on several sections simultaneously, and in parallel with substation
and distribution work which is physically independent.   Preparation of the
distribution component by VRA with assistance of Merz and McClellan (U.K.)
is underway. As the required lead time for distribution works is less than
for transmission, there is adequate time for VRA to complete the
preparation of the distribution component. The distribution bidding
documents already prepared for ECG under the ongoing power project (Credit
1628-GH) may be used for the proposed project.
2.7       VRA, which would be the executing agency for the entire project
has proven to be effective at meeting schedules on past Bank projects. VRA
has assigned responsibility for project execution to its Engineering
Department, comprising about 20 engineers supported by an expatriate
consultant. VRA has engaged Acres International (Canada) to assist in bid
evaluation, monitor procurement, and provide consulting services as
required during project execution. The northern grid extension is the only
major VRA project in progress at present, so the Engineering Department
resources will not be diverted. Local consultants will also be used as
necessary. The VRA implementation schedule covering slightly more than 4
years for the overall project is shown at Annex 2-4.
8/   Grant to GOG to be onlent to VRA on terms not yet agreed.
9/   Terms: 10 years including 3 years grace at 6.4% on civil works; 3
years at 6.4% for supply of goods.

Procurement
2.8       VRA intends to base procurement for the transmission and
subtransmission components of the project on supply and erect contracts as
much as possible to shorten the schedule, minimize unit costs, and lessen
the need for external consultants. VRA recently advertised the following
packages:
(i) supply 161 kV line conductors, shield wires, insulators,
hardware, etc.;
(ii) supply 161 kV line towers and erect complete line including
conductor stringing;
(iii) supply 161 kV transformers and reactors;
(iv) supply 161 kV breakers;
(v) supply the remaining 161 kV substation equipment and erect
substations; and
(vi) supply and erect 33 kV lines and 33/11 kV substations.
Bids are to be submitted by February 3, 1987, in accordance with ICB,
dividing the work into two phases:
Phase 1 - System reinforcement and Brong Ahafo Region, to be
financed by AfDB, and
Phase 2 - Northern and Upper Regions, to be financed by CDC/EIB
and CIDA.
2.9       Distribution materials and equipment will be procured through a
combination of ICB, international shopping and tied Japanese bidding.
Distribution installations in new areas will be made by contractors
appointed following LCB procedures while VRA staff will be responsible for
the rehabilitation of existing facilities and connection of customers.
Housing would also be erected by local contractors and financed by VRA.
Foreign engineering and management services would be provided in accordance
with IDA guidelines.

2.11      Disbursements.  The proposed Credit would be disbursed against
100% of foreign expenditures for vehicles, equipment and supplies to
establish VRA's distribution operations in the project area and for
consultant engineering and management services and training, as explained
in Annex 2-2. A provision has been made for retroactive financing of up to
US$0.6 million in respect of consultant services for project preparation
since May 1, 1986. As there is no standard profile for West Africa power
projects, the disbursement schedule (Annex 2-5) for the Credit has been
based on a standard East Africa Power Specific Investment profile, which is
appropriate for this project. Disbursements are expected to be completed
by end-1991.
2.12      Monitoring and Reporting.  VRA has established a Project
Execution Unit within its Engineering Department, reporting to the
Director, Engineering. VRA is familiar with the Bank's reporting require-
ments, from earlier and ongoing projects. VRA will submit project progress
reports satisfactory to all cofinanciers and during project implementation
IDA would liaise as appropriate with cofinanciers.
2.13      Environmental Aspects.  The proposed project would not have any
major adverse environmental effects. Most of the 161 kV and 33 kV trans-
mission lines will traverse relatively sparsely populated areas. It is
expected that sawmillers will utilize any larger logs cleared from
transmission rights-of-way. Provision of grid supply will eliminate air
and noise pollution caused by diesel generation in the 10 towns now served
only by diesels.

F. Prolect Justification. Benefits and Risks
Justification
2.14      Grid Reinforcement.  Demand growth in the western and southern
areas of VRA's existing grid and the interconnection with EECI have nearly
fully loaded the present grid, and reinforcement of some sections is
necessary to meet demand reliably in the late 1980s. Due to the indivisi-
bility of transmission projects, these AfDB investments will significantly
raise the capacity of the network, giving VRA the means to reliably
transmit additional energy to both its 'omestic and export markets.
2.15      Grid Extension.  The project would serve economically important
urban centers in the Brong Ahafo, Northern and Upper regions of the country
with combined populations of over 2 million people. These are the fastest
growing urban areas in Ghana, accounting for 27X of the urban population
outside Accra and 25% of all urban population growth between 1970 and 1984.
Brong Ahafo is a major timber and cocoa producing region of the country,
while the Northern and Upper regions are important food producing areas.
The urban centers in all three regions are expected to experience
significant economic growth under the influence of the ERP, since they are
the major marketing and processing centers for timber, cocoa, rice, yams,
etc., and suppliers of a range of non-food goods and services; banking
services in support of agricultural and commercial activities in these
regions are also well established in the urban centers.
2.16      At present, electricity supply in the project area is provided by
diesel powered generating stations owned and operated by ECG. Supply is
unreliable and costly: many generators are over 20 years old; utilization
factors vary from 8% to 30%; only one-third of the potential peak load is
served, and less than one-sixth of the energy demand; hours of service are
generally 12-18 hours per day, sometimes less, excluding unplanned inter-
ruptions which are frequent; and there is widespread use of autogenera-
tion. The present cost of this unsatisfactory and inefficient supply
exceeds USi20/kWh, of which fuel accounts for almost US.15/kWh, compared to
a generation cost of US41-4/kWh for hydro power from the grid (depending on
water conditions), and a US44-6/kWh fuel cost using new diesels. At the
time of appraisal, ECG was seeking to replace over 15 MW of diesel capacity
in regional stations, in order to reduce costs and improve reliability of
service; this would still be insufficient to meet demands, which would be
about 25-30 MW by 1992, growing at 8% per year. In several major centers
(Tamale, Bolgatanga and Sunyani) there is a 5-year backlog in new consumer
connections, due to ECG not having the generation capacity to meet demand.

- 19 -
partial measure of the consumer surplus from reliable grid supplied elec-
tricity in the project area, the average willingness to pay, after
adjusting for the impact of higher costs on effective demand, was estimated
at USJ14/kWh. On this basis, the IERR of the overall project would be
about 18%. This would rise should exports to Burkina Faso take place in
the early 1990s. The IERRs by line section are: Kumasi-Techiman/Sunyani
24%, Techiman-Tamale 18% and Tamale-Bolgatanga 14%.
2.18      A 10% increase in project costs would reduce the IERR to about
16.5%; a 10% higher than forecast load at commissioning would raise the
IERR to 19%, while a 10% lower load would reduce it to 17%. A two-year
delay in completion reduces the IERR to 15%. Further sensitivity tests and
details of the economic analysis can be found in Annex 2-6. The system
load factor for the project would be quite good (around 50%) once the grid
is fully operational, given that the towns to be connected to the grid are
all fairly large and already receive some electricity supply.
Reinforcements to the grid extensions would be needed sometime in the late
1990s, depending on the pace of demand growth; these have been excluded
from the analysis.
Risks
2.19      Risks are normal for this type of project.  A satisfactory
solution (the installation of variable reactors) has been proposed by VRA's
consultants to deal with the technical problems of voltage control arising
on a long lightly-loaded transmission line. The coordination of project
implementation and the maintenance of satisfactory future service in the
project area require improved institutional (para. 1.10) and operational
(Annex 2-2) arrangements, which would be introduced under the project.
III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.01      The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
(i)  VRA responsibility for project implementation with the
formation of a separate department for the project area
(para. 1.10);
(ii) Audit of VRA's accounts (para. 1.30);
(iii) Level of VRA's receivables (para. 1.33);
(iv) VRA to set up a contingency fund against future foreign debt
service obligations (para. 1.34);
(v)  VRA to earn at least 8% ROR on currently valued net fixed
assets (para. 1.37);



- 20 -
(vi) Annual review with IDA of VRA's five-year capital
expenditure program, and related financing plan
(para. 1.39);
(vii) Limitation on VRA's short-term and long-term borrowings
(para. 1.40);
(viii) VRA to keep separate accounts for project area distribution
activities, and meet any interim deficits (para. 1.42); and
(ix)    VRA to meet any cost overruns (para. 2.4).
3.02      The followingt are conditions of Credit effectiveness:
(i) Signing of subsidiary loan agreement (para. 2.4); and
(ii) Effectiveness of cofinancing (para. 2.5).
3.03      Subject to the conditions above, the proposed project is suitable
for an IDA Credit of US$6.3 million equivalent.

Income Statements
2.        VRA's audited Income Statements for FY83-85 were adjusted
for the amortization of deferred charges on accumulated exchange
losses.
3.        Revenue:  Sales forecasts and revenues were based on VRA's
1986 budget and forecasts through 1993; these assume average water
flows into the Volta Lake. Sales forecasts take into account existing
bulk supply contracts and reasonable domestic demand forecasts. 1986
Revenue is based on current kWh prices in long-term supply contracts
and present bulk tariffs to ECG and other domestic consumers; prices
have been maintained at constant levels after 1986 (see Attachment 1).
Revenues (and Expenses) were tested using low water flows into the
Lake, and the summary results are given in Attacbment 4.

Other revenues consist of rents, service charges, sales of materials,
ani miscellaneous receipts.
Operating Expenses
4.        Salaries are based on VRA's 1986 forecasts, which take into
account revised salary scales. Projections after 1986 include
allowance for merit increases, staff additions and inflation.
5.        Materials, Transport and General Exenses Forecasts were
based on VRA's 1986 budget figures; projections to 1993 include the
increases for annual inflation and likely additional operating
expenses.
6.        Generation Costs relate to ECG's diesel generation costs,
reimbursed by VRA. These charges were based on amended 1986 budget
figures and projected until 1990, with additions for annual inflation.
With the expected extension of the National Grid, the costs have been
reduced in 1991 to t.ike into account the substitution of diesel
generation by supplies from the Grid.
7.        Depreciation  has been calculated at 2.2% on average
revalued gross fixed assets in operation.
8.        Other Income:  a charge of ¢40 million per year has been
included for contributions to a Staff Pension Fund, which is expected
to be established outside VRA. These annual charges, when
accumulated, are to cover the Fund's liability for past service of
existing staff members.
9.        Interest:  Details are given in Attachment 3.
10.       Dividends  VRA's Board has under consideration the payment
of an annual dividend to Government of 10% of net income, payable when
possible 50% in foreign currency and 50% in Cedis. A provision has
been made in the projections for these payments.
11.       Debt Contintency Fund  VRA are considering setting up a Fund
from an allocation of net income to provide for foreign debt service



ANNE 1-11
Page 3 of 4
payments in times of drought. In the forecasts, allocations
equivalent in total to one year's debt service have been made from net
income.
Balance Sheet
12.       Fixed Assets in Service and Accumulated Depreciation were
revalued to take into account the devaluations of the cedi in January
and October 1986, and thereafter annually by related local and foreign
inflation rates.
13.       Debt Contingency Fund Investments:  these amounts relate to
the investment of funds set aside from net income for the payment of
foreign debt service -.n times of drought.
14.       Cash  VRA would normally require the equivalent of 15-20
days cash operating expenses as a daily balance; however the cash
account in the forecast Balance Sheets includes surplus cash.
15.       Inventories have been estimated annually at 0.4% of gross
fixed assets in operation.
16.       Receivables  have been estimated as 3 months' billing.
17.       Long-Term Debt  is given in detail in Attachment 2.
18.       Accounts Payable  were estimated as 8.3% of annual cash
operating expenses, plus 5% of capital expenditure.
19.       Loan Interest  was estimated at 3 months' annual interest.
Funds Flow Statement
20.       Debt Service calculations (including Interest during
Construction) are given in detail in Attachment 3.
21.       Capital Investment:  details of VRA's construction program
are given in Annex 1-4.
22.       BorrowinRs:  details are given in Attachment 2.
Foreign Exchange Account
23.       VRA's estimated foreign currency transactions for the period
1986-93 are set out in detail in Annex 1-9.
VRA's Proposed ProJect Area Income Statement
24.       VRA is expected to take over all operations in the three
regions - Brong Ahafo, Northern and Upper -- effective January 1,
1987. To undertaka its new duties, VRA intends to set up a
Distribution Wing (DW), for which separate accounts will be kept.
Existing assets which are owned by ECG will be transferred to DW, and
additional new facilities will be brought into service from the
proposed projects The Pro forma Income Statements (given in



ANNEX 1-11
Page 4 of 4
Attachment 4) set out the estimated revenues and operating expenses
for the DW through 1993.
25.       Sales and Revenues:  Diesel sales are based on ECG's
existing 1986 forecast and have been projected to take into account
increased demand from improvements and extensions to the distribution
system to be made in the three regions through 1990.   After 1990
supply will come mainly from the Grid and only a few isolated diesel
stations will remain. With regular supplies from the Grid and new
distribution facilities, it is expected that demand will show an
immediate significant increase in 1990 and then progressively
increase.
26.       Other Revenues relate to miscellaneous services to consumers
and are expected to increase with the development of the system.
Operating Expenses
27.       Bulk purchases:  These charges relate to VRA's bulk supplies
to the DW and have been calculated at the same rates as those for
VRA's supplies to ECG.
28.       Generation Costs  relate to DW's cost of diesel generation.
As in the case of ECG, a large proportion of these charges are
refunded by VRA (see deduction from operating costs). 1986 costs are
based on ECG's budgets for the three regions, and for future years the
figures have been adjusted to take into account changes in the load
and inflation.
29.       Distribution, Transportation and Administration:  For 1986
these charges have been based on ECG's budget costs; for subsequent
years additions have been made for inflation and the extension of the

ANNEX 2-2

GHANA - NORTHERN GRID EXTENSION PROJECT
Background And Technical Details
1.        This Annex provides background information on the technical
aspects of the project.
Background
2.        Electricity supply in Ghana was all from diesels (including
the 30 MW Tema diesel station) with 33 kV as the highest voltage until
Akosombo hydro plant was constructed in the mid 19609 using
multi-circuit 161 kV transmission to connect to the VALCO smelter at
Tema and the Accra load. Since then the transmission system has been
extended to form a 161 kV single circuit loop supplying most of southern
Ghana, a 225 kV interconnection with Cote d'Ivoire and a 161 kV double
circuit line to supply Togo and Benin. Over the past 20 years reliable
central grid supply has been provided in the main urban centers in
southern Ghana. However, the three northern regions of the country
having a total population of over 2 million and two-thirds of Ghana's
land area receive very limited electricity supply from 13 isolated
diesel systems which supply only 20,000 ECG customers. Service is
intermittent and unreliable due to old equipment, lack of spare parts,
shortage of fuel and lube oil, inadequate cooling systems, cooling water
shortages, poor maintenance and resource limitations in general. The
total costs on these systems is in the USJ15 to 20/kWh range.
Preparation
3.        The Northern Grid Extension Project has gradually evolved
through several studies by VRA and its consultants, Italconsult (Italy),
Acres International (Canada) and Professor Iliceto of Rome University.
Several transmission alternatives were studied including 161 kV or 220
kV transmission from Akosombo to Tamale via a route east of Lake Volta,
161 kV single and double circuit transmission from Kumasi to Tamale via
Techiman (west of Lake Volta) and various modifications of these plans.
Given the long distances and the relatively small load the investment
must be minimized, so the solution recommended by the consultants is a
single circuit 161 kV line from Kumasi to Techiman, Sunyani, Tamale, and
Bolgatanga. This line plus related substations and subtransmission will
permit connecting 10 of the 13 isolated systems in northern Ghana to the
central grid. As loads increase it will become economic in future to
connect the remaining 3 systems and other towns presently without any
form of electricity supply.
System Reinforcement
4.        The consultants' studies have shown that the southern 161 kV
transmission system is fully loaded using voltage as a criterion. If
certain line sections are out of service due to planned or forced
outages low voltages and load shedding will result at some points.
System reinforcement is therefore necessary, particularly in light of



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2 of 6
the planned grid extension to the North and the prospect of increased
power transfers to Cote d'Ivoire.
5.        A second single *ircuit 61 km line with bundled conductors
will be built between Akosombo and Tafo, to strengthen the 161 kV supply
to Kumasi (point of connection of northern line). A single circuit 115
km line with single conductors will be built between Akwatia and New
Obuasi, to strengthen the western side of the 161 kV loop. The towers
will be self-supporting steel lattice and the necessary line entrance
bays will be installed at existing substations.
Northern Grid Extension
6.        The grid will be extended from Kumasi using single circuit
161 kV on self-supporting steel lattice towers as follows:
Section                       Distance        Conductor
Kumasi to Techiman             115 km         bundled
Techiman to Sunyani            56 km          single
Techiman to Tamale             250 km         bundled
Tamale to Bolgatanga           160 km         single
Total          581 km
7.        Provision will be made at substations for 161 kV breakers and
161/33/11 kV stepdown transformation with two 16/10/10 MVA transformers
at Sunyani and Taxmale, and single 16/10/10 MVA transformers at Techiman
and Bolgatanga. The reactive power supplied by line capacitance on an
unloaded '.umasi to Bolgatanga 161 kV line would be almost 60 MVAR, so
reactors must be provided to absorb this reactive and prevent
unacceptably high voltage. A total of fouT variable (7.5 to 15.0 MVAR)
shunt reactors will be connected by 161 kV breakers, one on the 161 kV
bus at Techiman, one on the Techiman line and one on the 161 kV bus at
Tamale, and one on the 161 kV bus at Bolgatanga. Appropriate 33 kV and
11 kV switching will be included. Provision will be made at the
Bolgatanga substation for a future 161 kV line to Ouagadougou in Burkina
Faso.
8.        Subtransmission lines will be extended from the four 161 kV
substations to supply 33/11 kV stepdown substations to connect the grid
to the isolated systems now supplied by diesels. The subtransmission
will include a 161 kV transmission line from Sunyani to Mim constructed
with lighter towers and conductors for initial 33 kV operation and
adapting the shield wires on some 161 kV lines by insulating to use as
33 kV subtransmission for supply to various small centers including Pong
Tamale. The subtransmission therefore comprises:

(Total: 60 km of 161 kV at 33 kV, 172 km of 33 kV line and at least
35 km of shield wire)
Voltage Control
9.        The long 161 kV line extending about 750 km from Akosombo to
Bolgatanga via Kumasi poses a difficult voltage control problem because
of the line capacitance. Studies by Italconsult have shown the voltage
at Bolgatanga on an unloaded northern line without transformers and
reactors connected would be over 200 kV. Four 15 MVA reactors will
provide up to 100% line compensation and will permit controlling the
line voltage within 5% of the nominal 161 kV line voltage. The static
reactors will have tapped windings and conventional under-load-
tap-changers connected in the neutral point to provide variable reactive
output. Voltage and stability considerations will also limit the line
carrying capability. Load flow and transient stability studies have
shown the line capability is limited to a total load of about 50 MW.
Beyond this load level synchronous condensers will be necessary at
Tamale and a second line must be added, first between Kumasi and
Techiman and later between Techiman and Tamale.
Line Security
10.       The northern line will be designed for high security with all
towers capable of withstanding a broken conductor. The number of
recorded conductor breakages for 1650 km of 161 kV lines in Ghana over
15 years is only 10 (0.04 per 100 km per year) of which 8 were due to
melting of all-aluminum conductors during arcing to ground in forested
areas. The ACSR conductor to be used on the northern line will not be
as vulnerable. Stocks of spare towers and line materials will be kept
in readiness for any line failures. The line route is close to roads
throughout its length so there is no access problem. The existing
diesels and any diesels installed as interim generation will remain as
standby capacity for any planned or forced transmission outages.
Existing Isolated Systems
11.       The existing diesel systems in the project area are so rundown



ANNEX 2-2
Page 4 of 6
that it is impossible to consider such a form of electric service as a
satisfactory alternative to grid supply. Some diesel sets are 35 years
old and have been moved several times. At all locations only 1 or 2
sets are operable, although several sets are usually installed. The
intermittent periods of operation are not only aggravating and costly to
consumers, particularly small industries, but also endanger customer
equipment due to variations in voltage and frequency during unit starts
and stops. Some idea of the cost can be gained from the alternative
water costs to consumers at Tamale. The normal water tariff is 200
cedis per 1000 gallons for piped water, but electricity shortages have
completely cut this supply and instead water is sold by water haulers at
20-40 cedis per 35 gallon barrel for domestic use, depending on the
season. The peak load at Tamale was about 4 MW in 1981 compared to a
suppressed peak of only 1.6 MW during appraisal in April 1986. This
reduction and the 5 MW of autoproducer capacity in the Tamale area
demonstrate the extent of the electricity shortage on the isolated
systems.
Power Market
12.       The following is an estimate of the total peak load on the 10
systems that will be supplied by the project when the distribution
facilities are fully loaded about 1993:

Distribution
13.       VRA has made a survey of the distribution requirements with
the assistance of its distribution consultant (Merz and McClellan, U.K.)
and planning of the distribution expansion is underway with the
assistance of the same consultant. A full set of distribution bidding
documents has already been prepared by ESB (Ireland) for the
rehabilitation project to (Credit 1628-GH) and can be used for this
project. The 4-year transmission implementation period gives ample time
to design, procure and install the distribution facilities. The
existing distribution systems in the 10 towns are mainly overhead so
rehabilitation and expansion can be effected quite rapidly.
14.       The foreign component of the cost of distribution materials,
equipment and services totals US$13 million, summarized as follows:
US$ Mn
Equipment and materials for, and                                   4.5

Total                       13.0
15.       VRA is already arranging to equip its future distribution
crews in the three northern regions with vehicles and equipment to
establish effective distribution operations. These goods would be
financed by IDA and include the following:
Items                                                           Cost US$ Mn

Ratio of Transmission/Distribution
16.       The project is necessarily transmission intensive because long



ANNEX 2-2
Page 6 of 6
distances are being covered to pick up relatively small loads. The 33
kV subtransmission really constitutes part of the distribution system in
the conventional VRA/ECG split of facilities as in the Ghanaian southern
system. On this basis, and without the southern grid reinforcement, the
investment is roughly 2/3 transmission and 1/3 distribution, which is a
reasonable asset split for a low density load area such as northern
Ghana.
Interim Diesel Capacity
17.       VRA's consultant Merz and McClellan has just completed a
survey of the condition of existing diesel generation in the project
area to assess the need for rehabilitation of existing plant and
installation of new capacity to improve supply until the 161 kV
transmission input from the grid is available, to serve as standby to
the single line supply, and to provide supply in centers not presently
served. The detailed results of the survey are not yet available but it
is estimated about 10 MW of new diesel capacity may be required,
including 4.5 MW at Tamale in a new powerhouse and 3.0 MW at Bolgatanga.
VRA has approached the Kuwait Fund for Economic Development for
financing of these diesel requirements and the latter has indicated its
readiness to do so on the basis of adequate justification for the
proposed investments.
IDA-Financed Consulting Services
18.       The proposed Credit would finance the foreign expenditure for
goods and services for consulting services related to project
preparation and implementation and also for technical assistance and
training activities to prepare VRA staff for their new role in
distribution operations. Financing would be retroactive to May 1, 1986
to reimburse VRA for expenditures incurred in preparing the project.
The breakdown of expected costs for consulting, training and technical
assistance is as follows:
Item                                                                  US$ Mn
Finalization of transmission design                                    0.2
Preparation of transmission specifications and

GHANA - NORTHERN GRID EXTENSION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
A.   Demand Forecasts and Present Supply Capacities
1.        Electricity in the project area is currently supplied by private
autogenerators and 13 small diesel generating stations operated by ECG.
The total installed capacity of ECG's stations in the regions is about 15
MW, while there is another 15 MW or more of autogeneration. However, the
available capacity of ECG's stations is only 6 MW since one third of the
units are broken down while several of the units still operating are more
than 25 years old (the three 1.6 MW units in Tamale are 30 years old, 15
years beyond their economic lifetime); in consequence, demand shedding is
extensive, with supplies being restricted to 12-18 hours a day in most
regions, and, in some towns, to 12 hours/day on alternate days. Load
factors are in the range 6 to 30%, averaging less than 20%, as compared to
50-60% that are more typical on grid systems where supplies are reliable.
In total about half of the MW demands on the present systems are being shed
daily, and over 80% of the GWh demands (as can be inferred from the low
load factors). Moreover, these estimates ignore the potential demands that
are not served at all, owing to generating capacity shortages and problems
of keeping the remaining generators running (two-thirds of ECG regional
managers' time is spent on this, leaving little time to attend to
distribution and customer affairs). Hence, the backlog in requests for new
connections is over five years in Tamale and Bolgatanga. Private
autogenerators have helped to reduce the demands on ECG stations, but
visits to several users show that these units too, with the notable
exception of the Mim Timber Co in Brong Ahafo, are operated on a restricted
basis owing to the cost of fuel, supply shortages and equipment breakdowns;
the waterworks in Tamale and Bolgatanga, for example, have their own units,
but are operated infrequently because of lack of funds to purchase diesel.
2.        The following table summarizes the present demand and supply
situation at ECG's stations in the project area, and provides
estimates of the 1990/91 demand, (the first year of the project) used in
the economic analysis:

3.        For purposes of forecasting, the consumption trends have been
divided into three compohlents: (i) the effects of population growth; a
rate of 4% per year was used (actual urban population growth rates in
the regional towns have ranged from 4% to 8% over the past 25 years);
(ii) Rising per capita consumption, for which a figure of 2% per year
was taken, based on observed rates in towns in Southern Ghana; and
(iii) "Backlog" The above estimates for 1990 assume only about 60% of
the population would be served, assuming the present five-year backlog
in requests for new corrections is met by the time the grid supplies are
introduced. The other 40% would gradually become connected, raising the
demand growth rate by another 2% during the following five years. In
sum, an 8% trend is taken for the first five years after the project is
completed, and 6% afterwards. The forecast of energy demands by region
is shown in Table 2, attached. They assume a load factor of 50%.
B. Unit Cost and Benefit Assumations
4.        Investment Costs  In constant 1986 prices taken from Annex
2-1. Local costs have been converted to US dollars at the shadow
exchange rate of 150 Cedis   US$1.  Neither the costs nor the benefits
of reinforcing the southern grid have been included in the calculations.
The costs relating to maintaining the power supply in the project area
before commissioning of the transmission lines have also been excluded.
5.        Operating and Maintenance Costs  Taken to be 1.5% of the total
investment costs of the project.
6.        Incremental Sales  Based on a load forecast for the project
area prepared by VRA and revised by the appraisal mission (Section A
above), to allow for a concerted program of distribution expansion to
meet suppressed demands upon commissioning of the grid supply. The
sales have been capped at a level which corresponds to 50 MW of peak
load (approximately the line capacity before reinforcement) at an annual
load factor of 50%.
7.        Value of Sales.  The actual tariffs consumers pay for grid
supplies (and also for supplies from EGG diesel stations), currently
average about US43.5/kWh. Such tariffs are appreciably lower than those
prevailing in other countries, on account of the remarkably low cost of
generation in Ghana - which is why electricity exports from Ghana are
beneficial both to Ghana and to the importing countries. Tariffs in
some other West African countries are as follows:
Average electricity tariffs in other W.African countries

Observed willingness to pay for electricity in tbese countries thus
ranges from USJ 10/kWh in Cameroon to USJ16/kWh in Togo and Benin (both
major customers of VRA) and USJ22/kWh in Burkina (another potential
customer).
8.       Hence the main benefits of bringing grid supplies to Northern
Ghana arise from an appreciable lowering of electricity costs, both to
customers currently relying on private autogenerators, and through the
displacement of high cost diesel plants operated by ECG. Quality of
supply is also greatly improved and is reflected in the higher load
factors observed in towns connected to the grid system. To estimate the
benefits, the costs of grid supplies are thus compared witb the costs of
diesel supplies, assuming the demand would be lower (on account of
higher costs and lower reliability) in the latter case (see I below).
These estimates do not capture some of the less easily quantifiable
benefits such as those arising from the ensuing provision of adequate
supplies of piped water (unobtainable in Tamale and restricted to one
day per week in Bolgatanga). The calculations are as follows (note that
the term "consumer surplus" represents the benefits to consumers arising
from lower cost and more reliable supplies being available to them, and
the term "willingness-to-pay" equals the consumer surplus plus the
amount they actually pay, i.e. the tariffs times consumption):
In US cents/kwh

Ghana under "ideal" conditions                    13.2

C.  Cost of distribution                                2.0
D.  Present average tariff                              3.3

I.  Average Willinaness to gay (Base Case)             14.2
Notes
(A) US$600/kW for high speed diesel units, 100% reserve (4 units with
one under maintenance and the other for standby), 20% annual cost of
capital, operations and maintenmce gives US69.1/kWh for capital and
O & M. US$150/ton (US$15/bbl plus transport) was taken as the delivered
cost of diesel to Tamale, 640km by road from the refinery. The fuel
rate was taken as 250 gm/kWh plus 10% to cover low load operation and
losses. The resulting fuel costs is US44.1/kWh, giving a total



ANNEX 2-6
Page 4 of 5
generation cost of USJ13.2/kWh. In practice, local diesel generating
costs, allowing for breakdowns, maintenance and other problems have been
appreciably in excess of these figures, as are the costs of private
autogeneration.
(B) Given the extreme variability in hydrological coriditions in Ghana,
the cost of generation from the VRA system can vary from near zero at
times of plentiful water and high lake levels to over US44/kWh at times
of scarcity.
(C) Calculated assuming capital costs of US$500/kW, 12% annuity and
4000 hours annual utilization, giving US41.5/kWh plus US40.5/kWh for
0 & M.
(D) The average ECG tariff of about 5 cedis/kWh converted to US cents
at the shadow exchange rate.
(K) Total costs (A+C) less present tariff. This represents an "upper
case", considered here because electricity demand is often observed to
be highly inelastic with respect to price.
(F) If the price elasticity of demand is unity (a conservative
assumption), then following standard cost-benefit practice, the consumer
surplus is the sum of cost savings relative to the diesel alternatives
and the average value of the extra demand that would be met by public
supply.
Hence:
0.22(15.2-3.3) = 2.6i/kWh for the value of the cost savings,
assuming demand would be about 22% of that for grid supplies (given
unit elasticity of demand and diesel based costs being about four
and one-half times those of grid supplies). The average value of
the extra demand would be 0.78((15.2+3.3)t2) = 7.2, giving a total
consumer surplus of 2.6+7.2-9.84IkWh.
(G) & (H) Consumer surplus per kWh plus present tariff.
(I) Average of G & H, i.e., of the elastic and inelastic cases. Note
that this estimate of willingness to pay falls within the observed
values in other countries (see table on page 2) with both higher and
lower per capita incomes than Ghana.
C.   Economic Rates of Return
9.        The cost-benefit calculations were undertaken separately for
each of the three main sections of the project, with the following
results:

(18.4)     (16.0)       (17.4)        (19.4)
a/    Figures in parentheses indicate ROR with Burkina Load.
10.       These estimates are based on the  demand forecasts and unit costs
and benefits discussed above. The highest return, as is to be expected, is
in Brong Ahafo on account of the shorter transmission distances in the
region and higher loaded densities; the rate of return is 24%. The
Techiman-Tamale link also shows prospects of high returns (18%),
notwithstanding the long transmission distance involved, on account of the
size (150,000 inhabitants) and economic importance of the towns. The link
to Bolgatanga shows a return of 16% if expected exports to Burkina
materialize in the mid-1990s, but is somewhat lower (13%) otherwise. The
net benefits of the Burkina load (80 GWh/year) would naturally depend on
the tariff. The present calculations assume a USJ2/kWh benefit in excess
of the marginal supply costs in Ghana.
D.   Sensitivity Analysis
11.       The IERR in the base case has been calculated using US414/kWh as
a measure of the benefits. This is based on oil prices at US$15/bbl in
real terms throughout the period, and on the average of the elastic and
inelastic demand cases. The impact of assuming unit elasticity of demand
is to lower the IERR to 17%. This represents a very conservative estimate
of the returns to the project. Conversely, assuming demand to be inelastic
raises the IERR to 19%. The base case analysis assumes that the project
would be completed on schedule in four years. The effect of a two-year
delay in completing the project is to lower the base case IERR to 15%. In
sum, the range of returns to the overall project is 15 to 19%.
