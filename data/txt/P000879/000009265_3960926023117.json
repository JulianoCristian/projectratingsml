assist Ghana to provide a reliable and economical\n            electricity supply by reinforcing the southern grid, by\n            extending the transmission system to economically important\n            northern areas of the country, and by reinforcing and\n            expanding distribution facilities in these areas.  The\n            proposed project consists of:  (a) construction of 161 km of\n            single circuit transmission lines on the southern grid to\n            alleviate load shedding, increase transfer capabilities to\n            Cote d'Ivoire and reduce system losses; and (b)\n            construction of 581 km of single-circuit 161 kV transmission\n            lines to extend the grid to the north.  Further to this, the\n            project involves (c) construction of 161 kV substations at\n            Sunyani, Techiman, Tamale and Bolgatanga with provision at\n            the Bolgatanga substation for a possible future line to\n            Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso; (d) construction of 60 km of\n            single-circuit 161 kV light transmission lines (Sunyani-Mim)\n            for initial 33 kV operation; and (e) construction of 33 kV\n            subtransmission lines and stepdown substations to connect\n            presently isolated diesel systems to the grid. Finally, the\n            project provides (f) installation of distribution facilities\n            and associated equipment to expand supply in 10 towns; and\n            (g) associated engineering and project management services."}, "docdt": "1987-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
