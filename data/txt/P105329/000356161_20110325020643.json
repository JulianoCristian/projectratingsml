associated with transmission\n            lines; 2) Identify design, construction and maintenance\n            measures to avoid or mitigate potential adverse\n            environmental impacts, to be incorporated into the final\n            design; 3) Develop an environmental management plan and\n            associated monitoring plan for project construction and\n            operation; and 4) Assess the organizational capacity of the\n            implementing agency and provide recommendations for\n            enhancement. In addition, the objective of the Detailed\n            Environmental Management plan (DEMP) is to determine the\n            necessary practical mitigation measures for avoiding, and/or\n            minimizing negative impacts caused by the Project. This\n            project has a number of potential negative impacts\n            including: a) Land acquisition; b) Disruption of farming\n            activities and the disturbance of crops, bunds, canals and\n            drains; c) Wildlife will be affected by transmission line\n            construction and operation through the loss of habitat from\n            vegetation clearing; d) Exhaust emissions from machinery\n            used for tower and substation construction will be minor,\n            localized and of short duration; e) soil erosion and water\n            pollution. Different mitigating approaches could be\n            considered for some of the negative impacts, depending on\n            the timing of the Project."}, "docdt": "2010-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
