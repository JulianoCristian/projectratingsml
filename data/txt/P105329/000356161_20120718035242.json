risk to development outcome was also not\n            applicable; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory;\n            and borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            A two-year closing date extension was included in the Royal\n            Government of Cambodia's (RGC's) official\n            restructuring request in August 2010. Initially, the Bank\n            informed RGC that it would confirm the project restructuring\n            only if the implementing agency could demonstrate concrete\n            progress in preparing the new 230 kV transmission line\n            (notably processing the necessary procurement that would\n            ensure project completion by December 31, 2013). In June\n            2011, Bank management informed Electricite du Cambodge (EDC)\n            that the RGC's request for project\n            restructuring-including the closing date extension and a\n            change in the project development objective to remove\n            reference to Vietnam-could not be processed due to country\n            program conditions. Without the two year extension of the\n            closing date, EDC could not proceed with International\n            Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement for the supply and\n            installation of the 230 kV line because it could not afford\n            to self-finance the associated works. EDC would also suffer\n            huge financial losses if it did finance the line and then\n            Lao PDR was unable to meet the agreed schedule. Seeing no\n            viable options, RGC requested a full cancellation of the\n            grant for this project on October 4, 2011."}, "docdt": "2012-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
