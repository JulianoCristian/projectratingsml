Overall, the Project has the following main\n            components: Component 1: Development of cross-border 115 kV\n            Transmission Line linking Lao PDR (Ban Hat) and Cambodia\n            (Stung Treng) to facilitate import of lower cost electricity\n            from Lao PDR to displace higher cost diesel-fueled\n            generation sources in Cambodia; Component 2: Development of\n            cross-border 115 kV Transmission Line linking Vietnam (Tan\n            Bien) and Cambodia (Kampong Cham) for bilateral power\n            exchanges, beginning with imports of lower cost electricity\n            from Vietnam to displace diesel-fueled generation in\n            Cambodia, and leading over the long term to the transfer of\n            surplus hydropower from Cambodia to Vietnam; Component 3:\n            Development of the Xeset 1 to Saravan segment of the\n            proposed 115 kV Transmission Link that would eventually\n            interconnect electricity grids from (western) Thailand\n            through (southern) Laos to (southern) Cambodia; Component 4:\n            Development (feasibility, design, building, commissioning)\n            of a modern Load Dispatch Center (LDC) for Lao PDR to\n            facilitate regional power trade. An LDC, from a regional\n            perspective, is essential for bringing: (i) voltage and\n            frequency control; (ii) system protection and reliability;\n            and (iii) technical information on exchange and dispatching,\n            up to the minimum standards required for security of the\n            grids in neighboring countries that are connected, or will\n            be connected, to Electricite du Laos (EdL's) system. By\n            doing so, development of grid-to-grid interconnections and\n            the security of a future integrated GMS power grid would be\n            enhanced; and Component 5: TA activities in support of: (i)\n            development, through a regional perspective, of feasibility\n            study for hydropower generation for facilitating regional\n            power trade; (ii) consulting services for project\n            implementation; and (iii) consulting services for\n            institutional strengthening."}, "docdt": "2007-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
