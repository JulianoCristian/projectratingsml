                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The GMS-PT Projects have the development objective of enhancing regional power trade within the Greater Mekong Sub-Region with a view to also: (i) bringing
                         affordable grid-based electricity to selected provinces in Cambodia through import of power from Lao PDR and Vietnam; and (ii) bringing reliable electricity to
                         the Saravan province in Lao PDR, while creating the conditions for eventual interconnections of Lao PDR with other countries of the region. [PDO (i) relates to
                         Cambodia and PDO(ii) relates to Lao PDR. Since it is a regional project, the PDOs reflect the objectives of the beneficiary countries in addition to the regional
                         dimension of the project.]

                         Electricite du Laos jointly requested a project restructuring which entails: (a) cancellation of the 115kV transmission system from Vietnam to Kampong Cham, as Vietnam no longer
                         has surplus power to export to Cambodia; and (b) with the savings from this cancellation, upgrading of the 115kV transmission line from the Lao border to Stung Treng to a 230kV

                         line in order to increase line capacity and meet demand. As part of the restructuring, systems designs and technical specifications have been updated and the necessary bidding
                         documents are being drafted. The necessary safeguards work has been completed, including local disclosure of updated safeguard instruments. As part of the restructuring, the
                         reference to "Vietnam" in the PDO will be removed and a two-year extension of the Grant closing date will be included.
