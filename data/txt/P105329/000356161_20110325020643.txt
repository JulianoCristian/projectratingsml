Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) 
Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line 
Project 
 
INTRODUCTION 
This Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Report has been updated based on the IEE of Ban 
Hat-Stung Treng 115 kV Transmission Line prepared in 2006, which was approved and certified 
by WREA in April 2007. 
With requirement of more power to Cambodia, Lao government is requesting World Bank to 
support upgrading from 115 kV to 230 kV power transmission line project. 
The team of SSAFE Consultant with assistants of Environment Office of EdL, Khong district 
and Department of Energy and Mines of Champasack province was carried out the field re-
survey in September and December 2010 in order to verify and obtain the confirmation from the 
new and old owners of impacted assets and local authorities. The change of environmental and 
social impacts was investigated, considered and assessed in accordance with GoL guidelines 
requirements.

Background 
Power Trade in the Greater Mekong Sub-region is presently limited to a few bilateral 
agreements, relatively small in scale. However, the region is stepping on to a new stage with the 
formation of the Region Power Trade Coordinating Committee (RPTCC) in 2004 and significant 
process in a number of proposed regional investments. Despite these developments, integration 
of the national power networks is expected to happen gradually over the medium to long term, 
and for the foreseeable future trade will occur on the basis of bilateral trade arrangements. 
The Power Trade Import and Export Study funded by Policy and Human Resource Development 
Fund (PHRD Fund) through the World Bank, is the first step toward ensuring that these 
arrangements are rationally developed and financed in Lao PDR. One of the measure 
components of Power Import and Export Study is to complete the feasibility study of 
interconnection from the southern region of Lao PDR to the northern part of Cambodia in order 
to replace local high-cost diesel generation in Cambodia with Lao hydropower. The Bank is 
considering to finance the interconnection, Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV 
Transmission Line Project. 
Ban Hat 
–
to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project, would be the first 
project by the Lao government to supply the power to Cambodia for the high voltage.  Once 
completed it would not only foster further friendship, but it would also bring mutual benefits and 
better socio-economic conditions to the people on both sides of the border.  
To realize the above objectives and commitment while at the same time ensuring that the 
environmental and socio economic conditions of the project area are protected or preserved, 
TEPCO was engaged by World Bank to carry out the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) 
study of 115 kV Transmission Line in 2007 and now for proposed 230 kV, Initial Environmental 
Examination (IEE) will have to update accordingly. 
This report presents the IEE results of Laos side of the Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV 
Transmission Line Project, reflecting the above environmental regulatory requirement for power 
project development, in accordance with the local and international Environmental Protection 
Law, Regulations and Guidelines.

Description of the project 
 
2.1 Objectives of the Project 
Under support of the GMS power trade project of WB, the objectives of this project are to 
extend the electrical grid in southern Lao PDR and to export power to Stung-Treng Province in 
northern Cambodia, providing stable electricity with reasonable price. This will meet GOL’s 
policy in rural electrification in southern Laos and at the same time strengthen the power export 
sector in Lao PDR.  
In addition to an increase in export earning and local economic growth, the transmission line 
would also bring about a sense of cooperation, friendship, mutual understanding among the 
government and the people on both sides of the border. 
 
2.2 Need for the Project 
Lao PDR has one of the least developed economies in Southeast Asia with average annual 
income of about US$ 290 per capita, and has limited resources except hydropower potentials. 
Therefore, the promotion of hydropower to export electricity to neighboring countries is one of 
the GOL’s policies to obtain foreign currency. 
On the other hand, there is currently no electricity supply, but the installation of a diesel engine 
at the maximum output of 5 MW is underway under construction in Stung Treng Province in 
Cambodia. In order to recover the operation costs of such diesel engines, the tariff is likely to be 
set at a considerably high level. Also, the reliability of electricity supply by single unit of the 
diesel engine seems meager. By transmitting the power produced in the southern Lao PDR, 
which has significant hydropower potential resources, it will drastically save the overall 
generation cost and improve the quality of power supply in Stung Treng and other provinces in 
Cambodia.  
Therefore, this project will meet the needs of both countries, Lao PDR and Cambodia, and 
promote the economic and energy cooperation in the region. 
 
2.3 Scope of the Project 
This project consists of mainly two construction works. One is construction of 230 kV 
transmission line from Ban Hat Substation to Stung Treng Substation in total length of about 82 
km. Responsibility of Laotian side is between Ban Hat Substation and the Lao-Cambodia 
Page  8

7
boarder in length of 27.09 km. The alignment generally follows existing National Road No. 13 
South and mostly locates on the Eastern side of the road. During construction, 40 m width 
clearance (trees, bushes and remove 2 
paddy field’ huts) along the transmission line Right-of-
Way will be carried out.  Trees, if any higher than 3 meters, along the transmission line Right-
of-Way will be removed. 
Another work is expansion of the existing Ban Hat Substation to connect the above mentioned 
transmission line. 
During the operation of the transmission line, periodic inspection and maintenance work will be 
done. 
2.4 Project Study Area 
The project study area covers approximately 275 ha – with 100 m wide strip and stretches 27,56 
km long, encompasses 1,973 households with total population of 10,728 in 8 villages within 
Khong district, Champasak province 
see Table 1.
 
The project area constitutes various types of land-use and forest as shown in detailed in Tables 4 
and Figure 1.   Project location has been shown in the Map.

2.1. Project 
Activities, 
Timing/Sequence/Construction 
Period 
The details project activities are as follow: 
 
a). Detail Design Stage:
(2.5 months) 
b). Bidding and Selection of Contractors:
(6 months) 
c). Construction of transmission line (TL):
(12 months) 
d). Substation Facilities:
(will be started at the same time with TL works) 
2.2. 
Quantity and Quality of Raw Material to be used 
The following are land areas and other materials required for the implementation of the Project: 
o
Approximately 110 ha of land (40 m wide and approximately 27.56 Km long) 
along 230 kV Right-Of-Way from Ban Hat sub-station to Lao-Cambodia Border. However 
some land acquisition is needed for tower foundation and clearance during the construction 
period.  Trees, if higher than 3 meters, along the transmission line Right-of-Way will be 
removed. Cultivation of any kinds will be permitted unless the height of the produces 
exceeds three meters. Perennial crops such as rice, corn etc. will not have any interference to 
transmission line, hence their cultivation will be permitted.    
o
It was estimated that an approximately 2,148m
2
(0,214ha) of land is required for 
the construction of 110 tower bases (10 Angle Towers and 101 Suspension Towers, 
in the 
case that the tower types are A1 for Suspension Tower and A2 for Angle Tower
), these lands 
are of permanent occupation by the project and will be compensated for. The compensation 
will be in accordance with the relevant GoL’s policy, laws and regulations. 
The Standard for each type of tower based on “
The study on Master Plan of Transmission 
Line and Substation System in Lao PDR, Final Report, by JICA, 2002”.

All electrical components and other materials required for project construction were estimated 
by TEPCO in collaboration with project owner (EdL), they may include transformers, conductor 
wires, insulators, steel towers, concrete for tower bases, and others.  The detailed quantities of 
materials are as follow: 
 
o
Towers  110  units 
o
Concrete Volume for Tower Foundations: 0.3-0.5 m
3
(dependent on so condition) 
 
Complying with the Lao Electric Power Technical Standard 2004, any electrical facilities shall 
be installed in such a manner so as not to cause no pollution, air, water, noise, vibration, 
discharging of insulating oil and otherwise which may endanger the human body and damage 
other objects. Particularly, in this Project, any use of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) is 
prohibited, and use of herbicides and pesticides for clearing and controlling Right of Way 
(ROW) is also prohibited. Contractor must use materials, which are complied with the standard.  
 
Please note that the land of the Ban Hat substation is belong to EDL already, So there is no need 
Page  13
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
12
to acquire more land. 
 
2.3. 
Quantity of Waste Products generated by the Project 
From previous similar projects and according to the site survey, the majority of wastes generated 
from the project would mainly be from clearing vegetation from the 230 kV transmission line 
rights-of-
way.  However, some of these “wastes” will not be without its usefulness. The local 
villagers living along the alignment could make use some of these wastes e.g. for firewood, raw 
materials for charcoal production, fencing component as well as using in constructions of farm 
buildings and animal sheds.   In the case where  the alignment passes through the forests (where 
commercial timbers are present),  the trees with more than 30cm diameters will be identified, 
logged and sold off by  the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry -(provincial and district forestry 
staff), prior to the clearing is taking place. As part of the environmental protection procedure, 
and in order to protect surrounding forests and other natural resources, burning off is not 
permitted.   
The other waste materials anticipated from the project is excess soil excavated from the tower 
foundations.  It is estimated that there will be approximately 1 m
3
to 1.5 m
3
of soil excavated for 
each tower. However most of these soils will be used as back fill materials for the foundation; 
only minor portions will be left behind. The excess soil will be spread around the tower bases to 
facilitate natural re-vegetation and or use as fill in nearby depressions so as to minimize 
sedimentation of nearby watercourses. Overall the generated wastes are of minimal quantities, 
therefore will not have any adverse impact to the environment. 
 
2.4. Project 
Cost 
The Total Project cost is estimated at US$ 8.5 Million, this includes: 
-
Transmission line: approximately US$ 5 Million. 
-
Sub-station facilities: approximately US$ 3.5 Million. 
-
Land and ROW Compensation is included in part of Lao (EDL) contribution. 
 
2.5. Executing 
Agency 
EDL is the Executing Agency for the project as well as the project owner.   
Project detailed design, including detailed transmission line surveys, preparation and evaluation 
of tenders, and construction supervision, will be carried out by consultants in accordance with 
the MEM and EdL’s regulation and guidelines.   
Construction of the transmission line and associated sub-station work will, likewise, be 
contracted out under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedure. 
Management of the project will be the responsibility of the general manager of EdL, with day-
to-day implementation carried out by an EdL’s project management team, under the direction of 
the Distribution Manager.  Environmental and socio-economic aspects of the project will be the 
responsibility of EdL’s Environmental Management and Monitoring Unit (EMMU).   
 
2.6. 
Scope of the Study 
Pursuant to Lao PDR Environmental Protection Law and Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) decree 112/PO and other concerned regulations,   an initial environmental examination 
(IEE) (and/or EIA) is required for every project undertaken in Lao PDR. This is designed to

2.7. 
Methodology for Field Survey and Data Collection 
The field survey and data collection was carried out in every affected village along the 
transmission line from Ban Hat Sub-station to Lao-Cambodia Border. The field survey team 
with total member of six personnel was formed as a unit with one unit leader (also a specialist), 
who together with the project team leader was in charge of all field survey activities 
–
Village 
consultation, liaison with local authorities, interviews, investigations and data collections etc.., 
Prior to the arrival of the field survey units, the local district authorities of the project areas were 
officially notified of the objectives, the timing of the field work activities to be conducted in 
their districts. They were also informed about their roles and responsibilities in assisting the field 
survey activities of the units.     
In every affected village and prior to the households or the head of the village being interviewed, 
all the villagers were requested to assemble, mostly at the village temple or at the residence of 
the village head. 
At the assembly, aspects such as 
what, where
 and 
why
 was to be constructed, the potential 
benefits as well as the adverse impact to the environment, communities’ social economic 
conditions and their overall livelihood. Assets relocation and compensation requirement, as well 
as villagers’ perception of the proposed project were specifically consulted and discussed. 
At all time during the consultation and discussion session, particular effort was made so the 
villagers were aware that the project, as proposed, was in no way an imposition to the villagers 
and that they had every right in determining the outcome of the project.  
The primary data collection (required for the study) was obtained through the questionnaire 
survey of residents including chief of villages and villagers at every village who have land 
within potential project affected areas.  All head of the villages and almost all of the head of the 
families or households who have affected land and houses within 25m width along the 
Page  15
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
14
transmission line from the first sub-station to the last sub-station were interviewed.  In addition 
an on-site (face-to-face) interview was also conducted within the project sites. The survey 
focused on the attitude of local villagers, regarding the proposed project and its potential impact 
on current status of land and forest usage, income generation activities, land  acquisition, 
wildlife conditions, resettlement and compensation ; current status of unexploded ordinance 
(UXO) as well as potential impacts on social, economic and environment.   
Before conducting the field survey, list of families/households especially for those people who 
have been affected by the project were acquired from the head of the villages.  Similarly some 
relevant secondary data such as total number of population, houses, households, the amount of 
land and name of the owners were also collected. In case of head of families/households were 
absent either at work or at other engagement, another reliable senior member the family would 
be interviewed instead. To keep the interviewee from being influenced by each other, the 
interview session was kept separately and private. 
In terms of relevant data for Natural Environment around project affected areas, it was also 
collected during the field survey, this included the interview and observation such as the 
characteristics of water or rivers, aspect of the flora and fauna including rare or endangered 
species, list of protected areas, and some related data were gathered from the previous studies 
and/or reports and several published papers by the government agencies and the ministries 
concerned.   
2.8. 
Limitations of the Study 
In the process of our study and in particular the field data collections the limitations and 
assumptions as stated below were observed. Therefore it must be noted all the results presented 
in this report shall be viewed in light of these perspectives, rather than the absolute statistical 
information.  
·
The proposed transmission line alignment giv
en was “a line” drawn on 1:100,000 
topographic map there were very limited “physical” on site identification, hence 
making the designated alignment not very accurate to locate and consequently 
affecting, to a degree the accuracy of all collected data. 
·
The study was conducted in rainy season (September, 2010), the majority of the villagers 
were occupied with other activities. The study created some burdens for them and 
resulted in limited cooperation in our interviews as well as in a consultation sessions. 
Most of the interviews were conducted at the night time. 
·
Some of the lands in the affected area belong to owners in some distant villages; 
therefore it was difficult to meet, make contact and interview.   
 
Review of literatures, laws and regulations concerned 
 
2.1   Lao PDR Institutional and Legislation Frameworks 
Measures for monitoring and managing potential environmental and socio-economic impacts 
have been developed based on Lao PDR legislation, regulations, decrees, standards and 
guidelines. 
The following legislation now in force, and supporting regulations (promulgated or in draft) in 
Lao PDR are relevant to ensuring environmental and socio-economic issues are addressed 
during design, construction, and operation of the project: 
 
-
Prime Minister’s Decree No. 164/1993
established eighteen protected areas and 
required that the government develop management plans for each area.  Two additional 
Page  16
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
15
protected areas, referred to now as National Biodiversity Conservation Areas (NBCAs), have 
since been added.  The cur
rent area totals 3.4 million hectares or 14.3% of the country’s area.  
In addition, provinces and districts have also designated their own conservation areas and 
protection forests bringing the overall national total to 5.3 million hectares or 22.6% of the 
total land area. 
-
The Electricity Law 
(2008)
 requires that:  
ß
EIAs need to be carried out on larger hydroelectric dam projects (as a minimum).   
ß
Electricity projects, including transmission and distribution projects, be licensed by the 
GOL, and as a precondition to the granting of a license, the project demonstrate that 
national socio-economic development objectives will be satisfied, and that there will be 
no detrimental environmental impacts 
ß
The licensee (in this case EdL) is responsible for ensuring that the environment is 
protected or damages paid for environmental degradation, and that residents are 
compensated in cash or in kind for lost property, diminished living conditions, relocation 
or resettlement. 
ß
Inspection and enforcement be carried out for project activities. 
In accordance with the EIA provision of the Electricity Law (2008), the Law on Environmental 
Protection (03 May 1999), the Environmental Protection Law Implementation Decree (04 June 
2001), and the Regulation on Environmental Assessment in the Lao PDR (03 October 2000), the 
GOL enacted the Regulation on Implementing Environmental Assessment for Electricity 
Projects in Lao PDR (No: 447/MIH, dated 20 November 2001).  The following noteworthy 
information is contained in the Regulation regarding development and review of an Initial 
Environmental Evaluation (IEE) for electricity projects: 
ß
The Ministry of Energy and Mines, under which the Department of Electricity resides, is 
required to ensure that environmental assessment is included in its decision to approve, 
finance or undertake any type of electricity project in Lao PDR. 
ß
Upon receiving a description of an electricity project from the project owner (i.e., EdL or 
its consultants on behalf of EdL for the Rural Power Distribution Project),, the 
Department of Environment (DoE), which resides within the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines, has 30 days to complete project screening to determine whether an IEE or more 
exhaustive EIA is required.  WREA has an additional 15 days to signify its concurrence 
with this decision, after which DoE has 7 days to provide the screening decision to the 
project owner.  The content of an IEE is determined through the screening process. 
ß
An IEE is prepared by the project owner, and submitted to the DoE for review and 
decision making.  Within 7 days of receiving the IEE, the DoE must circulate the report 
to other line agencies, local government authorities, and the public that may be affected 
by the project to comment on the IEE.  Government agencies and the concerned public 
have 30 days to provide their comments.   
ß
Within 40 days of acting on the IEE report (i.e., from the date the report was submitted 
to the DoE by the project owner), DoE must provide a written decision on the IEE to 
WREA.  DoE may recommend that: a) the IEE and its conclusions be revised; b) the IEE 
be accepted and the project approved; c) the EMP be revised; or d) terms of reference be 
developed for an EIA.  Within 10 days of receiving the IEE, WREA must approve the 
IEE and issue an Environmental Compliance Certificate, agree with DoE that an EIA is 
required, or indicate in writing to DoE that WREA disagrees with the DoE decision.  
The GOL has also enacted five additional legislative instruments (one policy and four standards) 
for managing environmental affairs in the power sector of Lao PDR.  The first of these is the 
Power Sector Environmental Policy (No. 581/MIH.DOE, dated 04 October 2001), which 
Page  17
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
16
requires the power sector to assist the GOL in meeting its social and economic objectives by 
managing its activities in an environmentally responsible manner.  This includes requiring 
appropriate environmental assessment and management be undertaken to international 
standards.  
The environmental management standard addressing Environmental Management Documents 
for the Department of Electricity (No: 582/MIH.DOE, dated 04 October 2001) establishes the 
process for developing various environmental management documents, including environmental 
management standards and guidelines.  This documents standard also identifies such things as 
the requirements for authorizing standards, consultation, and document control. 
The environmental management standard addressing Department of Electricity Environmental 
Records Management (No: 583/MIH.DOE, dated 04 October 2001), requires that an 
environmental records management system be established within the Department of Electricity.  
The standard identifies the types and formats of environmental records that will be kept, requires 
that a database be created and that records be stored in one central, easily accessible location, 
such as the Environmental Management Unit’s main office, and that record be available for 
borrowing during working hours.  
The environmental management standard addressing Environmental Impact Assessment for 
Electricity Projects (No: 585/MIH.DOE, dated 04 October 2001), sets out the requirements for 
EIA for electricity projects in Lao PDR.  The following noteworthy information is provided in 
the standard: 
ß
An EIA cannot proceed without an Environmental Screening and an IEE being first 
carried out. The extent of the EIA and its content depend on the project’s Environmental 
Screening and IEE, with the screening and IEE determining the content and terms of 
reference of the EIA; 
ß
The contents and requirements of an EIA for an electricity project, including 
requirements for public involvement and development of an EMP, are specified.  
Regarding public involvement, the standard indicates that the process for public 
involvement for any follow-up EIA that may be required by a decision rendered by 
WREA, is scoped during the IEE.  Otherwise, public involvement for an IEE is limited to 
the DoE requesting comments on the IEE from project affected persons. 
The environmental management standard addressing Environmental Management Plans for 
Electricity Projects (No: 584/MIH.DOE, dated 04 October 2001), sets out the requirements for 
preparing EMPs for electricity projects.  The standard indicates that: 
ß
An EMP is to be part of a Project Screening Report, IEE report and EIA report, 
whichever is determined to be required for a project; 
ß
An EMP must cover all environmental management measures that are to be implemented 
during the project’s pre-construction, construction, operation and decommissioning, 
and is to address all significant
environmental issues identified in the Project Screening, 
IEE or EIA, including a social action plan or resettlement action plan, if required; 
ß
The EMP must be prepared so as to be able to be used as a stand-alone document for use 
in implementation; and 
ß
A
two-stage public involvement process is to be developed and implemented.  The first 
stage is the process established for Screening, IEE or EIA, when the EMP is under 
development.  The second stage is the process for implementation of the EMP. 
 
-
Environmental Management Standard for Electricity Project No.0366/ MIH.DOE, 
(2003)
states that: 
Page  18
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
17
ß
Environmental screening is a preliminary assessment of a project’s potential 
environmental impact.  It is normally completed at a projects identification stage.  
Screening is used to decide whether a project’s impacts are of a significant nature to 
warrant further environmental assessment. 
ß
The IEE will determine the scope of the EIA.  This will include the scope and plan 
for conducting the study to meet the requirements of an SIA. 
ß
The IEE shall identify the expected social impacts of the project, and a plan to obtain 
the necessary information for determining the magnitude of the impact and the potential 
measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate or compensate for the effects. 
ß
The IEE shall include the following information related to SIA: 
·
Discussion of consistency with governmental regulatory requirement. 
·
Brief description of the social conditions in the project area including an estimate 
of the number of people to be relocated, distribution of population in project area, a 
brief discussion of the local economy and primary source of income, the presence 
of significant cultural and infrastructure facilities that will be affected and a list of 
issues to be discussed in the SIA relative to the social conditions. 
·
Preliminary plan for relocating the affected persons (Preliminary Resettlement 
Plan-PRP).  The PRP may provide budget and technical feasibility proposals 
(availability of relocation sites, etc.) for more than one technical design. 
·
A
preliminary assessment of land acquisition requirements and a determination of 
whether the land required for the project fall into forest/tribal or other special areas. 
·
Description of indigenous groups in the project area (if any) to include status of 
the population from the perspective of the GOL, significant unique characteristics 
of the cultural tradition of the groups, special economic resources of the group.  
·
Preliminary plans for protecting and enhancing the integrity of the indigenous 
groups. 
·
Evidence for consulting with governmental agencies, local authorities, NGOs in 
the project area, and the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) including name of 
participants, date, location, subjects discussed, discussion results, agreed 
conclusions, and actions to be taken. 
ß
The Regulation for implementing environmental assessment for Electricity Projects 
requires all electricity projects in Lao PDR to be environmentally screened according to 
the amount of impact they will or will likely have on the environment.  A project must 
meet the following criteria to justify no further environment assessment:  
“Because of 
its nature, size and location, the project can be expected to have immeasurable or 
insignificant environmental impact on natural resources, ecological resources, public 
health and public welfare. 
 
-
Environmental Protection Law No.02/99/NA, (1999)
does the following: 
ß
Assigns the Science, Technology and Environmental Agency
1
(WREA) the rights and 
primary responsibilities for protection, mitigation and restoration of the environment in 
Lao PDR. 
ß
Defines the environmental conservation responsibilities of other GOL agencies such as 
the Department of Electricity, Department of Forestry, etc. 
1
Created by Decree No. 63/PM, which was superceded by Decree No. 68/PM in 1999. 
Page  19
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
18
ß
States that environmental conservation comes before mitigation and restoration 
ß
Stipulates that those who generate an environmental impact are  responsible for the 
resulting damage caused 
ß
Directs that environmental management and monitoring units (EMMUs) be established 
at all levels of government, with responsibilities to include such things as: establishing 
and enforcing sector environmental plans; taking action to abate environmental 
damage; issuing orders to adjust, suspend, remove or close down activities that cause 
negative impacts 
The Law on Environmental Protection also establishes the authority to make environmental 
regulations.  To this end, the GOL has enacted the Regulation on Environment Assessment in 
the Lao PDR (No: 1770/STEA dated 3/10/2000).  Key features of the Regulation include: 
ß
Each Development Project Responsible Agency (DPRA) must ensure that any 
development project in the Lao PDR carries out EA in accordance with the content 
determined in this Regulation, and any regulation of its own line ministry. 
The Environment Assessment must include at least a Project Description to enable DPRA 
to perform a project environment screening under Article 7 of this Regulation. If the 
project is not exempt under Article 8 of this Regulation, the EA must include an Initial 
Environment Examination (IEE) as specified in Article 9 of this Regulation. For some 
projects, through the findings of the IEE, an Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is 
required as specified in Articles 11, 12, 13, and 14 of this Regulation. 
ß
All project proposals that are submitted to a Development Project Responsible 
Agency (DPRA) by a project owner, and all project proposals that are prepared by a 
DPRA must be included a brief description of the project, which include the following 
information: 
·
Project owner 
·
Project type 
·
Project size 
·
Project location 
·
Intended product 
·
Raw materials to be used 
·
Estimate of the quantity and quality of any solid, liquid, or air-borne wastes 
resulting from project construction or operation 
·
Number and origin of project’s intended labour force for construction and 
operation 
·
Anticipated positive and negative environmental and social impacts of the project 
·
Environmental mitigation measures that will be implemented during the project 
construction, operation and closure (if applicable). 
 
ß
The DPRA must circulate the project proposal document to relevant government sectors 
and local authorities, and must consider their comments in its environmental screening 
decision.  Line ministries may specify additional information to be required in project 
descriptions in their internal EA procedures. 
ß
Within 30 days of receiving a project description, the DPRA must complete the 
screening and explain the screening decision in writing to national WREA in the case 
of national projects or to the Provincial, Municipal or Special Zone Science, 
Technology and Environment Office for local projects.  Within 15 days of receiving the 
screening findings the respective environment office referred to above shall either 
notify the DPRA that it concurs with the decision, or shall instruct the DPRA to 
reconsider, taking into account relevant information or guidance.  Within 7 days after 
Page  20
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
19
receiving the record of decision from the respective environment office, the DPRA 
must notify project owners of the result of the project screening to abide by the record 
of decision.  The DPRA must also notify the Environmental Management and 
Monitoring Unit of the concerned line ministries or local administration authorities for 
information and monitoring purposes. 
ß
For those projects found by screening to be exempt from further EA, WREA must issue 
an environmental compliance certificate within 15 days after receiving the screening 
record of decision from DPRA.  There are two types of certificate; one with conditions 
and another without conditions.  Those projects determined to be non-exempt from EA 
must proceed to conduct IEE. 
ß
For foreign investment projects, the IEE report must be written in Lao and English.  Line 
ministries in their internal EA guidelines may set additional requirements for the 
contents of IEE reports and the number of copies of reports that are to be submitted.   
ß
If the IEE report concludes that no EIA is needed, an EMP must be developed within the 
IEE report, which must have the following contents: 
·
measures to prevent and minimize environmental impacts 
·
programs for environment control and monitoring 
·
responsibilities, organization, schedule and budget for implementation of the 
EMMP and other issues that the DPRA may deem necessary for the protection of 
the environment. 
ß
During the IEE process, if it is found that the project needs an EIA, the IEE report must 
contain Terms of Reference for the scooping of a subsequent EIA. 
ß
The process for reviewing an IEE report and issuing an Environmental Compliance 
Certificate is the same for both the EA Regulation at the national level and for the 
Electricity Sector (see discussion on Regulation on Implementing Environmental 
Assessment for Electricity Projects in Lao PDR below). 
ß
The IEE report and the IEE’s EMMP must receive approval from the DPRA before 
WREA can issue the environmental compliance certificate to the project owner.  For 
projects requiring EIA, the project owner must, during the detailed design phase, 
prepare the detailed EMP based on the general EMMP of the IEE already approved by 
WREA. 
ß
The project owner is directly responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the 
EMMP.  The central government DPRAs are responsible for the inspection of the 
implementation of the monitoring and evaluation for the project environment where 
projects are approved at the central level. 
ß
In order to ensure the effective implementation, the project must establish an 
environmental unit.  The members of such unit may come from the company itself, 
hired staff, from an outside organization or be entities working on contractual basis. 
ß
The project owner of the Environmental Unit must establish monthly reports on project 
environmental monitoring to be sent to the concerned agency(ies), which are: WREA 
and/or Provincial, Municipal or Special Zone Science, Technology and Environment 
Office, and the Environmental Management and Monitoring Units (EMMUs) of the 
concerned line ministries for information and supervision. 
ß
WREA and/or provincial, municipal or special zone Science, Technology and 
Environment Office and the responsible line agency Environmental Management and 
Monitoring Unit retain authority to directly control project activities, in order to ensure 
that project owners carry out effectively and regularly their environmental protection

and conservation of watersheds, guarding against soil erosion, and protecting plant and 
wildlife species and the environment 
ß
Five categories of forest (Protection, Conservation, Production, Regeneration, and 
Degraded) 
i
Production Forests
 are forests and forestlands used in regularly providing for 
national economic and social development requirements and for people’s livelihoods, 
timber and other forest products on a sustainable basis and without significant 
negative environmental impacts. 
i
Conservation Forests
 
are forests and forest lands classified for the purpose of 
protecting and conserving animal and plant species, natural habitats and various other 
entities of historical, cultural, touristic, environmental, educational or scientific value 
i
Protection Forests
 
are forests and forestland classified for the protection of watershed 
areas and prevention of soil erosion.  They also include areas of forestland with 
national security significance, areas for protecting against natural disaster and areas 
for protection of the environment.  
i
Regeneration Forests
 are young or fallow areas of forest classified for regeneration 
and maintenance of forest cover with a view reaching a natural equilibrium as trees 
increase in maturity. 
i
Degraded Forests
 are forests that have been heavily damaged, to the extent they are 
without forest or barren, that are classified for tree planting and/or allocation to 
individuals or organizations for tree planting, permanent agriculture and livestock 
production or other purposes in accordance with national economic development 
plans 
i
Unstocked Forests
 are previously forested areas in which the crown density has been 
reduced to less than 20% because of logging,  shifting cultivation or other heavy 
disturbance. If the area is left to grow undisturbed it becomes forest again.

An individual or organization given permission to convert forest to another use is 
responsible for payment of a conversion fee, land reclamation and tree planting 
™
Provision for allowing long practiced activities such as collecting wood for fences and 
fuel, non-timber forest products (NTFP), hunting and fishing for non-protected species 
for household consumption, and other customary uses 
™
Provision for setting up a fund for activities such as protection and conversion of forests, 
tree planting, and forest regeneration to protect and conserve watersheds, the 
environment and wildlife 
The issue of compensation for removal of forests is dealt with in Forestry Law.  Compensation 
is based on the volume of timber (m
3
)
of
a
given class or species of tree that will be cut down.  
Compensation is only paid for timber removed from private forestry plantations.  No 
compensation is paid for timber removed from natural forests on public lands.  Nor is any 
compensation paid for removal of any kind of NTFPs such as bamboo, mushrooms, etc. except 
for villagers’ bamboo plantation. 
There is no requirement to replant trees on degraded land located away from a transmission line 
corridor, as compensation for removing trees to create a transmission line right-of-way.  Such 
forms of compensation only apply to reservoir clearing projects, where it is necessary to plant 
trees to stabilize slopes that could otherwise fail through a process of mass wasting.  
Compensation rates range from US$23/m3 for lesser qualities and grade of timber species, up to 
a
maximum of US$999/m3 for superior qualities of timber species.  These rates are established 
by the Government of Lao PDR (GOL) as a schedule within regulations under the Forestry Law. 
During the alignment survey, the Provincial or District forest office staff will assess the volume 
of natural or plantation forest that will be removed by a project.  An assessment report is 
prepared and sent to the central office of the Department of Forestry in Vientiane, which is 
responsible for evaluating requests for timber removal and providing approvals.   
Timber removed from a transmission line right-of-way by project will be sold, and the proceeds 
provided to the GOL.  Where timber is removed from a private tree plantation, then project 
proponent is responsible for compensating the owner of the plantation.   
During transmission line construction, the Provincial or District forestry office staff will scale 
and mark all timber cut from the right-of-way.  Fines will be levied against the contractor for 
any timber that is cut and does not receive a timber mark from the forestry department.  This 
helps to limit illegal timber harvesting. 
EDL is responsible for paying for all costs incurred by the Department of Forestry, including 
costs of preparing timber cutting assessments during alignment surveys, and timber scaling and 
marking during construction.

2.2 Word Bank Policies and Safeguards 
2.2.1 World Bank Operational Policies 
Relevant World Bank Safeguard Policies, include: 
+
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) 
The Bank requires environmental assessment (EA) of projects proposed for Bank financing to 
help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus to improve decision 
making. The EA should evaluate a project’s potential environmental risks and impacts in its area 
of influence; examine project alternatives; identify ways of improving project selection, siting, 
planning, design, and implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating 
for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and include the process of 
mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout project implementation. 
+
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) 
This policy addresses the conservation of natural habitats, which like other measures that protect 
and enhance the environment, is essential for long-term sustainable development. The policy 
supports the protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their functions in 
its economic and sector work, project financing, and policy dialogue. The conservation of 
natural habitats, like other measures that protect and enhance the environment, is essential for 
long-term sustainable development. The Bank therefore supports the protection, maintenance, 
and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their functions in its economic and sector work, project 
financing, and policy dialogue. The Bank supports, and expects borrowers to apply, a 
precautionary approach to natural resource management to ensure opportunities for 
environmentally sustainable development. To apply a precautionary approach to natural resource 
management to ensure opportunities for environmentally sustainable development. 
+
Pest Management(OP 4.09) 
This policy requires adherence to a strategy that promotes the use of biological or environmental 
control methods and reduces reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. In Bank-financed 
projects,
 
the borrower should address any pest management issues
 
in the context of the project’s 
environmental assessment. 
+
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) 
These instruments outline the safeguards required of World Bank funded projects to ensure that 
impoverishment risks due to involuntary resettlement are addresses and minimized. The policy 
has the objectives to: 
·
Avoid resettlement where possible, and otherwise minimized through alternative project 
designs 
·
Resettlement should be conceived and executed as a sustainable development program 
·
Affected people should be meaningfully consulted, and be facilitated to participate in 
planning and implementing resettlement plans 
·
Displaced people should be assisted to improve, or at least restore their livelihoods and 
standards of living

+
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) 
These instruments represents the World Bank’s commitment to poverty reduction and 
sustainable development by enshrining respect for the cultures, environments, economies and 
rights of indigenous peoples. Under the OP and BP, projects affecting indigenous peoples (IP) 
must ensure: 
·
IPs are engaged in an a process of free, prior and informed consultation 
·
The consultation process results in broad community support for the project 
·
Social analysis is undertaken to ensure potential impacts on IPs are identified 
·
An IP plan is developed to ensure IPs receive culturally appropriate project benefits, and 
that adverse impacts are avoided, minimized, mitigated, or compensated. 
The OP and BP also mention that where IPs are the sole or overwhelming majority of project 
beneficiaries, a separate IP Plan is not required, and that requirements outlined above be integral 
to the project documents (Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and SIA). 
+
Forests (OP 4.36) 
The objective of this policy is to assist borrowers to harness the potential of forests to reduce 
poverty in a sustainable manner, integrate forests effectively into sustainable economic 
development, and protect the vital local and global environmental services and values of forests. 
In accordance with the requirements for the environmental assessment (EA) for an investment 
project, the project design should address the potential impact of the project on forests and/or the 
rights and welfare of local communities. 
Two other Operational Policies, 
Projects in Disputed Areas
 (OP 7.60) and 
International 
Waterways
 (OP 7.50) have limited relevance to the project. 
This EIA’s responses to the requirements of the relevant World Bank safeguard policies are 
shown in the table below.

Operational Policy 
Actions and/or Responses 
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
Reservoir biomass clearance will be by mechanical means. 
No chemicals will be used. Similarly, use of pesticides will 
be minimised in resettlement site preparation. 
Livelihood programs in the resettlement plan and Watershed 
Management Plan will teach biological and environmental 
pest control measures. 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 
4.12) 
A
Resettlement Action Plan complying with World Bank 
guidelines and Lao legislative requirements has been 
prepared and submitted to rounds of AP and other 
stakeholder participation and AP approval. 
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) 
All APs are from the same ethnic minority group (Katu). 
Therefore an Ethnic Minorities People’s Plan (which 
complies with World Bank and Lao PDR guidelines) has 
been incorporated into the resettlement plan to produce a 
Resettlement and Ethnic minorities People’s Plan (REMPP), 
Forests (OP 4.36) 
The Watershed Management Plan will protect the catchment 
forests as a priority. 
The project will impact on a minimal area of natural forest. 
The project includes management measures to minimise 
exploitation of NTFPs by the construction work force. 
The REMPP includes the retention of NTFP collection rights 
for resettlers. 
Safety of Dams (OP 4.37) 
Dam safety, including an assessment of seismic potential, 
has been fully covered in the technical and economic 
component. 
2.2.2 Comparison of Lao PDR Law and World and Safeguard Policies 
 
The 2005 changes to GoL legislation related to compensation and resettlement in development 
represents a significant improvement in the rights of citizens when their livelihoods, possessions 
and society are affected by development projects. Both Lao PDR law and World Bank policies 
entitle affected people to compensation for land and non-land assets at replacement cost, and for 
livelihood restoration support. Lao legislation defines such livelihood restoration measures as 
being applicable only to severely affected people, defined as those with more than 20 percent of 
their income generating assets affected, whilst World Bank policy does not differentiate. Decree 
192/PM (Article 6) also entitles all affected people to economic rehabilitation assistance to 
ensure they are not made worse off due to the Project. The legal framework does therefore 
provide the potential for parity with WB social safeguards on resettlement. 
2.3 Previous Studies on IEE 
-
The IEE study
for an alternative 115Kv transmission line which linked the Nam Leuk 
Hydropower Project to Nam Ngum Switchyard, conducted by SOGREAH Ingenierie 
(1997) stated that: 
The screening of impacts carried out for the alternative Transmission Line lead to the 
conclusion that environmental impacts anticipated are all of limited importance and 
magnitude and can be well mitigated by appropriate measures.  The result of the study 
also showed that no area of exceptional ecological values is affected either directly or 
indirectly and no resettlement or alienation of private properties is anticipated.  Only 
about 10 towers were located in paddy field which is not affected long-term agricultural 
Page  27

26
production and owners have received a compensation for the disruption during 
construction and the loss of land.  Clearing of degraded forest within and outside the 
Phou Khao Khouay NBCA have been compensated by a provision for the reforestation 
of about 60 ha.  Taking into consideration the findings of the impact screening, no 
additional detailed study is needed, meaning that no follow-up EIA is required for this 
Project.  
 
-
The IEE study
conducted by Acres International Ltd in the Northern of Lao PDR (2002) 
concluded that: 
The Northern Area Rural Power Distribution Project which was conducted IEE study in 
the northern provinces, Lao PDR by Acres in November 2000 generated only minor 
environmental impacts.  This is because the project was involve construction of 
transmission lines along alignments on which the forestry and wildlife resources have 
largely been removed as a result of past and recent logging activities, and the practice of 
shifting cultivation (slash and burn).  The transmission line routes and substation sites 
were chosen to avoid remaining environmentally sensitive areas, villages, and valuable 
agriculture land.  The results of the study also showed that no resettlement is required, so 
social cohesion, community structure, administrative and community organizations, 
religious and cultural systems was not adversely affected as a result of having to relocate 
villages.  However, mitigation and compensation measures were formulated to ensure 
that potential impacts can be satisfactorily addressed.  The IEE study, including the 
environmental management plan and monitoring program was considered sufficient to 
meet the needs of an environmental impact assessment for the Lao PDR Northern Area 
Rural Power Distribution Project.  Therefore, no follow-up Environmental Impact 
Assessment is recommended. 
 
ƒ
The study on IEE
for Thakhek-Xepone 115 kV Transmission Line conducted by 
Dongsay Consultants (2003) concluded that: 
 
The Transmission Line Construction Project only generated minor environmental 
impacts, which was offset considerably by the positive benefits that accrued from the 
project.  This was because the project involved construction of transmission line along 
alignment on which the forestry and wildlife resources have largely been removed as a 
result of past and recent logging activities, and the practice of shifting (slash and burn) 
cultivation.  The line route and substation sites were selected on the basis that avoided 
environmentally sensitive areas and important view-scapes such as national park, 
National Biodiversity Conservation Areas, protected areas, protection forests, research 
areas, outdoor recreation sites, waterfall, religious and cultural/heritage sites, and 
wetland.  Along the route where transmission line traversed, there were some village 
cemeteries and holy forests 
(Pasar and Pamahesak)
,
and some forest areas which 
classified as current forest including 
Lower Dry Evergreen Forests, Mixed Deciduous 
Forests, Dry Depterocarp Forests
.
However, some high commercial value species of 
tree within such forests were already removed.  Mitigation and compensation measures 
have been formulated to ensure that potential impacts could be satisfactorily addressed.  
The compensation for the loss of village cemeteries and holy forests was suitably 
considered. 
 
Resettlement was required for some houses and rice huts at some villages, so 
compensation cost have been discussed and paid.  However, social cohesion, community 
structure, administrative and community organizations, religious and cultural systems 
was not adversely affected as a result of having to relocate some of the houses.

27
The IEE study, including the RAP, EMP and monitoring program was considered 
sufficient to meet the needs of EIA’s regulations for the Lao PDR.  Therefore, it was 
considered that an EIA was not required and the IEE study conducted by DSC was the 
completed EIA. 
 
ƒ
The IEE study
for Pakse-Khone Phapheng Power Transmission Line conducted by STS 
Consultants (2003) stated that: 
The Project generated only minor impacts including socio-economic and environmental 
impacts due to the alignment has been appropriately selected based on the following 
principles: 
·
Avoided existing settlements, public and private structures. 
·
Avoided encroachment into the corridor of the Dong Houa Sao and Xe  Pien 
NBCAs. 
·
Facilitated the access to the Project site during construction, operation and 
maintenance phases. 
·
Minimized the extent of visual instruction. 
ƒ
The study on IEE
for Pakxanh-Pakbor 115 kV Transmission Line conducted by 
Dongsay Consultants (2004) concluded that: 
The project will generate only minor environmental impacts.  This is because the project 
will involve construction of transmission lines along alignments on which the forestry 
and wildlife resources have largely been removed as a result of past and recent logging 
activities, and the practice of shifting (slash and burn) cultivation.  The transmission line 
routes have been chosen to avoid remaining environmentally sensitive areas and 
important view-scape areas such as NBCAs, Protection Forest; recreation areas, 
waterfall, research areas, religious and cultural/heritage sites, and high valued wetland 
except for some houses, rice huts, village cemeteries and village holy forests.  Mitigation 
and compensation measures have been formulated to ensure that potential impacts could 
be satisfactorily addressed.  The IEE report, including the environmental management 
plan (EMP) and monitoring program and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were 
considered sufficient to meet the EA requirements for the Project.  Therefore, it was 
concluded that further more detailed assessment by way of an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) was not required for the project. 
 
Environmental Description of the project area 
 
3.1 Physical Resources  
 
3.1.1 General Topography  
The southern province, particularly in the Khong district Champasack, in which the project 
locates the topography of the land is generally flat and in part low laying which had formed part 
of the overall Mekong flood plain. However, some rugged terrains and mountains stretching 
predominantly in parallel and on the east side of the Road 13 and the transmission line and are 
well outside the Xepian NBCA which situates some distances away from the project area. 
The proposed transmission line right of way traverses mainly through flat areas comprises of 
Page  29

28
rice paddy fields, lowland cropping and rice cultivation by villagers. Because of these flood and 
fertile plain, Champasack Province is known as one of the Rice Plains of the Country (
“Ou 
Khao - Ou Pa” or 
Cradle of Rice) as well as having high potential for other agricultural 
production.  
 
3.1.2 Affected Villages along the Proposed Transmission Line 
The Project covers only 8 villages, under one district of Champasack province.  It means that 
only 8 villages are affected by the project.  The total numbers of affected household is 64 (these 
include only those households of 8 villages who use the land for agricultural production such as 
paddy fields and.  Apart from these lands use types, along the line, there are some Village Used 
Forests.   The affected Districts and villages are shown in table below.

3.1.3 Topography along the Transmission Line 
The topographic description along the transmission line alignment we used 1:100,000 scale 
contour map as the reference as well as alignment map supplied by EdL for identification of the 
transmission line right of way. Both maps were used for on the ground identification of the 
“exact” location of the centerline (IPs) of the transmission line to which all measurements were 
referred. 
It must be noted that at the time of the study, the alignment was yet to be finalized and was not 
marked or had no on site identification, only line on map. Alignment identification was an 
approximation based on these maps. In addition our survey team, prior to field survey, the 
transmission line alignment (as given by EdL) was superimposed on the Land Use Type and 
Forest Cover Map based on the 1:100,000 contour map.   The field check has been conducted 
based on the Land Use Type and Forest Cover Map 
(see Figure 1).
 
In each portion reference will be made to existing land characteristic, types of vegetation, forest, 
water resources and types of land use.  
See Annex for diagrammatic description of the 
topography along the right of way of the transmission line  
 
3.1.4 Soils 
Page  30
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project
.
29
The altitude of the lowlands within Khong District varies from 100 to 200 m, the southern most 
district of the country lies on triassic volcanic.  The sediment consisted of sandstone and red 
shale is deposited in the intra-mountain sedimentary basins which were formed during the late 
Indonesian orogenic movement. The soil is less fertile when one moves away from the Mekong 
River, particularly the area on the left hand side of the National road No. 13 South, starting from 
Ban Hat Substation along the ROW. 
 
3.1.5 Water resources 
The steep terrain of Sai Phou Louang (or Troung Son Mountain) in the eastern part of central-
southern Lao PDR is part of an intricate system of rivers and streams that form the Mekong 
River watershed.  As mentioned early, Southern part of Lao PDR is consisted of many Plains of 
the Mekong River which is called as a Plain of Rice (Cradle of Rice) where has high potential 
for rice and other agricultural production.  During the field reconnaissance, within and around 
the project area from Ban Hat Substation to Lao-Cambodia border, there are some significant 
stream and wetland areas where the proposed transmission line will cross; Houay Jik and two 
small unknown name creeks.  However, that stream the water is available in both dry and rainy 
seasons, but on the dry season the water nearly dry up and no any significant species were found 
there (according villagers reported). Since the Southern part has more vegetation than northern 
part, with its quite thick layers of soils and flatland are particularly not prone to erosion except 
for some areas (e.g. along the foothill of high slope mountain) where most vegetation is removed 
due to heavy logging, slash and burn cultivation and that soils are exposed to rainfall and surface 
water flows.  Nevertheless, water quality in the mountain streams and rivers is generally quite 
good especially in the dry season, but can be rapidly degraded when soils that are eroded or 
wasted from exposed slopes enter streams and increase turbidity, thereby reducing the quality of 
water for aquatic organisms, and domestic and livestock consumption especially in the rainy 
season.  As mentioned above, most of the streams within and around the area have serious 
problem with water condition (dry) in the dry season.   Therefore most villagers supplement 
their diets with natural fish, freshwater crabs, and other aquatic animals caught not from stream, 
but from the Mekong River. 
 
3.1.6 Climate 
The climate of Southern provinces is tropical and strongly influenced by the annual southwest 
monsoon rains that affect the region from April/May to September (mean annual rainfall at 
Pakxe is 1,977.9mm, at Attapeu is 1,954.4mm and at Xekong is 1,274.5mm).  The period of the 
dry season between the three Provinces; Champasack, Attapeu and Xekong is not different 
(October to April) no rain may fall in some months.  The monsoon rains are variable from year 
to year, resulting in recurring years with weak monsoon systems (MCTPC-IUCN 2000a and 
2000b). The hottest month is April (36.1

3.2 Biological Resources  
 
Lao PDR is located in the center of Indochina, sharing borders with China to the north, 
Myanmar to the northwest, Thailand to the west, Cambodia to the south and Vietnam to the east.  
The total area of Laos is 236,800 square kilometres.  Around 70% of its terrain is mountainous, 
reaching a maximum elevation of 2,820 metres in the Xieng Khouang province.  The Mekong 
River, which flows through nearly 1,900 kilometres of Lao territory, is the main geographical 
feature in the west, and in fact, forms a natural border with Thailand in some areas.   
Lao PDR has one of the most pristine forest ecosystems in Southeast Asia.  It is estimated that 
half of its woodlands consist of tropical forest, in particular the primary forest.  In addition to the 
fascinating vegetation, Laos plays host to a very diverse animal kingdom.
 
According to the initial result of the survey and the study on Forest/vegetation Cover and Land 
Use by plot sampling on SPOT Satellite images maps conducted by Forest Inventory and 
Planning Division, Department of Forestry (DoF, 2002) for the Southern Lao provinces, 56.5% 
of the total land area is covered by forest.  Champasack province is the second province which 
mostly covered by natural forests (54% of total provincial land area).  Most of the forest type is 
Current Forest
2
which includes Dry Dipterocarp Forest (DD), Upper Dry Evergreen Forest 
(UDE), Lower and Upper Mixed Deciduous Forest (LMD and UMD) and Mixed Coniferous and 
Broadleaved. 
 
2
Current Forest
 
includes natural forests and plantation forests.  It is used to refer to land with a tree canopy cover of more 
than 20% and area of more than 0.5 ha. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 m
.
The basis for the 
distinction between forest and other land use groups is the crown density.  In this study the natural forests are classified into 
forest types which compose Upper and Lower Dry Evergreen Forests, Upper and Lower Mixed Deciduous Forests, Gallery 
Forest, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Broadleaved and Coniferous Forest, and Dry Dipterocarp Forest (FIPD, DOF, 2002).

3.2.1 Vegetation Cover along Proposed Transmission Line Routes 
Based on a review of the 2002 Forest and Land Cover maps for the regions through which the 
proposed transmission lines will be constructed, and from the villagers interview as well as 
observations made during the field reconnaissance survey, the following observations are made 
regarding the conditions of forest and wildlife habitat along the proposed 230 kV alignments 
(see Annex Pictures)
.
The 2002 Land Use Types and Forest Cover maps show that along the proposed alignment from 
Ban Hat Village to Lao-Cambodia Border, Khong District, Champasack Province, about 51.7 % 
is forest which mainly includes Dry Dipterocarp Forest ( Protection 8.85%), about 47 % is 
seasonal paddy field, and the other is swamp and water body which covers about 3%. Total 
affected land will be about 110 ha,
 see Table 3. 
Reference to the Decree No. 333 (June, 2010) on 
Protection Forest, some part of the project is laying in the District Protection Area (9.788 ha or 
2.447 m length by 40 m width).

Dry Dipterocarp Forest (DD):
 
The Dry Dipterocarp Forest occurs in open stands. The 
tree diameter is comparably small and the height of the stand varies from 8 to 25 meters. 
The crowns do not spread out widely.  This type of forest is normally found in places 
with shallow soil, where the hard pan emerges above the ground, and on latirized soil. 
On the most poor and shallow soils the trees are crooked and do not exceed 10 meters in 
height: If the crown cover is less than 20% and the stand is undisturbed the vegetation 
type should be classified as Savannah. 
·
The Gallery Forest (GF): 
 is not characterized by tree species composition but could be 
i.e. either deciduous or evergreen. Clues used for identification of this forest type are the 
occurrence of some other land use types in its vicinity such as streams and villages. In 
areas where streams are likely to overflow seriously, the forest is often left along the low 
bank of the streams (both persistent and intermittent ones) forming a long band of forest 
with the stream bed on one side and, for, example, paddy fields on the other. The width 
of the Gallery Forest will not be more than 100 m.

·
Swamps (SW):  
are areas where the soil is saturated with water. The soil may basically 
be fertile but the lack of oxygen limits it's agriculture or forest-production capacity. The 
Swamp could have a high ecological or environmental value and the flora and fauna may 
be rich. 
The typical tree species found in the Swamps are trees which can grow in water, i.e. Adina 
cordifolia, Rhus succedanea and Barringtonia acutangula. 
·
Rice Paddy (RP):  
Areas permanently being used for rice cultivation.  Old paddy that has 
been abandoned and not been in use for more than one year should not be classified as 
Rice Paddy.
 
3.2.2 Wildlife and Aquatic Animals 
Generally, Lao PDR still harbors a rich fauna, with many species’ populations and their habitats 
probably being less depleted within Lao PDR than within several other countries of the region.
 
At least 166 species of reptile and amphibian, 700 bird species, and 100 mammal species occur 
in Lao PDR.  As an example, more than 430 bird species found in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA 
represent one twenty fifth of all bird species found world-wide and more than half of all bird 
species in the Lower Mekong system.  Similarly, there are eighty-seven known families of fish 
in the Indochina region, whilst 74 families have been identified in the whole African continent, 
and 60 families in South America.   
Currently, the richness of Lao PDR’s wildlife has less to do with conservation efforts than with 
the country’s low population density and consequently extensive forest cover.  Although hunting 
pressure in the country is still widely, the relative abundance of habitat and, in some areas, its 
long distance from human settlements, has provided partial protection for the country’s wildlife.  
However, human population and development pressures are rising, especially since 1990.  
Therefore, wildlife population is dramatically declining throughout the country.  
Indeed, Wildlife is the undomesticated animals and plants, which are living in nature.
 
They are 
including many types and species of a very small size up to a very big size of vertebrates or 
invertebrates or any type of habitats, such as: mammals, birds, reptile, amphibian, fishes, insects 
and all type of plant’s communities.   
Threatened species recorded in Lao PDR, based upon November 1998 data from the WCMC, 
comprised 220 plants and 150 animals.  Numbers of threatened animals are shown in the table 
below.  Categories of threat follow those of IUCN.

Apart from referring the records mentioned above, wildlife conditions within the Project Area 
were surveyed and assessed by visual inspection and villagers’ interview.  When the study team 
conducted the site survey in daytime in dry season, they visually observed wildlife along the 
alignment. Most villagers within affected villages were interviewed regarding their perceptions 
on wildlife conditions within and around their village areas.  According to the survey and 
villagers’ interview, the results showed that only significant habitats remaining occurred on the 
steep inaccessible areas of Dong Hua Sao, Xepian and other NBCAs outside the study or project 
area.   All wildlife is extensively hunted and the majority of all significant wildlife species have 
either been eliminated from the study area or they have retreated to the comparative safety 
afforded by the higher and comparatively inaccessible habitats on Dong Hua Sao, Xepian and 
other NBCAs due to the project area was involved construction of many infrastructures which 
the forestry resources and wildlife habitats have largely been destroyed and removed as a result 
of past and recent development activities.  
According to interviews with local authorities and local people during the site investigation, 
there are some big birds flying in this area, especially in the area about two kilometers close to 
Lao-Cambodia border. By investigation with local people this kind of birds is Ibis species. 
The White-shouldered Ibis, Pseudibis davisoni, is a species of wading bird of the ibis family, 
Threskiornithidae. It occurs at a few sites in northern Cambodia, southern Vietnam, extreme 
southern Laos and East Kalimantan in Indonesia. 
This Giant Ibis is a bird rarely recorded during the last 100 years. Scientists presumed that the 
species has become extinct in Vietnam already and that only Cambodia and Laos still hold some 
isolated flocks. This species was recently declared Cambodia's national bird. 
However, they believed that the birds must have flown from Cambodia's Mondolkiri province 
where a globally significant remaining population of probably less than 500 individuals is 
making its last stand.  
The White-shouldered Ibis occurs in lakes, pools, marshes and slow-flowing rivers in open 
lowland forest. It also inhabits sparsely wooded, dry or wet grasslands and wide rivers with sand 
and gravel bars. 
Page  35
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
34
Therefore the design of the high of transmission line in this section should be considered in 
order to do not disturbing the flying route of those Ibises. 
3.2.3 National Biodiversity Conservation Areas (NBCAs) and/or Protected Areas 
The Government of Lao PDR, with the technical assistance of IUCN (through the Lao-Swedish 
Forestry Programme) and other international agencies have developed a national protected area 
system for several years (Salter and Phanthavong 1989, Salter 
et al
.
1991,
Berkmüller 
et al
.
1993, 1995a, 1995b). Surveys towards this aim began in 1988, and in 1993, 18 areas covering 
approximately 10% of the land area of the country were decreed as National Biodiversity 
Conservation Areas (NBCAs).  A further two (Dong Phou Vieng and Xe Sap) were added in 
1995-1996, meaning that NBCAs currently cover about 12.5% of total land area of Lao PDR.   
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has overall responsibility for management of all 
categories of forest including those NBCAs.  Responsibility is delegated to the Department of 
Forestry (DoF), with the Forest Resource Conservation Division (FRCD) in the role of technical 
unit.  From DOF (FRCD) decentralized responsibilities are with the Provincial Agriculture and 
Forestry Division (PAFO) and the District Agriculture and Forestry Offices (DAFO) who 
manage the conservation forests, aquatic animals and wildlife within their jurisdiction. The 
DAFOs themselves must in turn cooperate with people living inside and on the periphery of the 
relevant forests. 
Amongst 20 NBCAs and two corridors throughout the country, Champasack province that the 
Transmission Line located consist of 2 NBCAs such as Dong Hua Sao (110,00 ha) and Xepian 
(240,000 ha) NBCAs with the total area is about 350,000 ha.   
In addition to the NBCAs, the provinces and districts have also established a number of 
Provincial and District Protected Areas (PPAs and DPAs) including protection forests.  The 
location of these PPAs and DPAs is quite difficult to confirm especially in the field areas, as the 
Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Division (PAFOs) have no accurate maps of these areas 
except for the lists and numbers of PPA and DPA.  
None of the proposed alignments pass through any NBCAs within the province.  As noted 
above, the closest that an alignment comes to an NBCA is the transmission line from Ban Hat 
Sub-station to Ban Hin Hong village at its closest point is about 4 km the line will pass to the 
west of Xepian NBCA.  At this point the line will run parallel on the left hand side with the 
National Road 13 South. 
(
Picture 3)
.
However, as the alignment will closely follow and parallel the main road from Ban Hat Sub-
station to Lao-Cambodia border, and as the land and forest adjacent to the main road has been 
affected by human activities (logging, slash and burn cultivation and others) since the road was 
completed, the transmission line will not impinge on any environmentally sensitive areas that 
may be part of the PPAs and DPAs except for some Village Used Forests.   
The pre-survey for selecting of the alignment was conducted and determined by the other survey 
teams (during preparing of a long-term power development plan in the Lao PDR) before 
conducting IEE survey, the specific location of naturally vegetated areas, or areas of secondary 
species-rich vegetation cover like NBCAs, PPAs, DPAs as well as protection forests was 
confirmed in advance before the alignment has been sited and that the transmission line would 
be located so as to avoid such important areas, wherever possible.  
Reference to the Decree No. 333 (June, 2010) on Protection Forest, about 9.78 ha or 2.447 m 
length by 40 m width of the project is lying in the District Protection Forest. This Protection 
Forest Area is established with objective to be the Corridor of the Country Border. Before the 
Page  36

starting of Project Construction, the change of Protection Forest utilization should get the 
permission from Champasack Province Authority.

3.3 Socio-economic and cultural conditions  
The demographic, ethnic, socio-economic and cultural conditions within the Project area have 
been documented using a variety of primary and secondary sources.  In order to provide data for 
Page  38

37
load forecasting as well as the social analysis of the Project, the survey and interview were 
carried out for every affected village and households  in 8 villages in Khong District,  shown in 
Table 1
 (of those, 64 affected households from 8 villages).  Before conducting survey and 
interview, a consultation process was also carried out with the local organizations concerned 
such as District Administration Office, DAFO and village authorities. During the site survey, the 
study teams visited 8 villages and had consultations with village heads and affected villagers. 
Details of the consultations are shown in the “Record of Consultation with Local Villagers and 
Village Authorities”. (See Annex-3) 
Secondary sources of data/information included extensive district annual reports; demographic 
and other data collected directly from district and village authorities in the Project area; and, 
numerous studies, reports and other documents related to the project. 
 
3.3.1 Population and Demographics 
The total population of Laos stands at 5.5 million (National Statistical Center, 2002).  At 2.6 
million, the proportion of people aged 15-54 years is 48% of the total.  The national average for 
life expectancy at birth is 54 years (World Bank, 2000).  This means that the population is very 
young, with more than 40% aged less than 15 years.   
Lao PDR is a rural landlocked country.  In 1998, 78% of Lao lived in rural areas and 22% lived 
in urban areas (World Bank, 2000).  The rural village is the basic social unit of the country.  
According to the 1995 census, across the country there were nearly 11,400 villages.  The 
average village population was 400, although actual settlements may range from as few as 10-15 
households, or approximately 70 people, to larger villages of more than 300 households. 
The predominantly rural nature of Lao PDR means population densities are very low.  The 
national average in 2002 is 23 persons/km
2
.
The average population density in rural areas was 
21 persons/km
2
and in urban areas, 25 persons/km
2
.
The regional distribution of population 
densities with central region is 27 persons/ km
2
,
while northern and southern regions are 19 
persons/km
2
and 24 persons/km
2
respectively (CPC-NSC, 2002). 
As mentioned earlier, the project covers only 8 villages within one district; namely Khong 
district, Champasak Province.  According to the field survey conducted by the team survey we 
see that among 8 villages within the project areas, the total population is 10,728 people with 
5,713 female and total of 2,016 families and 1,938 households as shown in table 1. 
 
3.3.2 Ethnic Composition 
Ethnically, Lao PDR is highly diverse, both in terms of number of ethno-linguistic groups and in 
the breadth of their higher linguistic diversity.  More than 230 spoken languages, belonging to 
four language super stocks, have been identified, making Lao one of the world’s most diverse 
countries.  With respect to location, the areas of highest diversity are often in the remotest 
upland areas, particularly within and around NBCAs.  The 2000 Census identified 49 different 
groups with sub-groups totaling over 200 (ADB, 2000).  Ethnic groups within the Lao territory 
are grouped in four major ethno linguistic families.  These families commonly grouped into 
three categories that reflect the dominant languages, settlement patterns and agricultural 
practices.

Page  39
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
38
are grouped in four major ethno linguistic families.  These families commonly grouped into 
three categories that reflect the dominant languages, settlement patterns and agricultural 
practices.  
One of the main characteristics of the Lao PDR is its cultural diversity. Although there have been 
differing numbers given for the groups, specialists mostly agree on the ethno linguistic 
classification of the ethnic groups. For the purposes of the 1995 census, GOL recognized 47 main 
ethnic groups or categories and 149 sub-groups, but the last revision of this list by the LFNC 
contained 49 categories, and over 160 subgroups. The National Assembly has ratified this list in 
the Agreement No. 213/NA dated 24 November 2008.  
a)  The Tai-Lao groups living in the lowland regions of the country that for the most 
part cultivate paddy rice, practice Buddhism and are integrated into the national 
economy. This group includes the Tai-Lao, which is the dominant group, and 
various other related ethnic groups such as the Tai-Dam, Tai Lue, Phuan and 
other Tai speaking groups. These correspond to the Lao-Tai group and represent 
approximately 60% of the population. 
b)  The Mon-Khmer groups dominating the middle hills that for the most part 
practice swidden agriculture, are reliant on forest products and to some extent are 
isolated from the dominant lowland culture. Many groups, however, exhibit 
varying degrees of assimilation and adaptation to Tai-Lao culture. These groups: 
Khmou, Makong, Kata, Yrou and other smaller groups are the original inhabitants of 
South-East Asia and consist of the Austro-Asiatic or Mon-Khmer ethnic groups 
approximately 25% of the population. 
c)  The Sino-Tibetan groups living in the highland areas practicing swidden agriculture 
and include the Sino-Tibetan and Hmong-Mien ethnic groups. These groups include 
the Akha, Lahu, Lisu, Pounoy and others. Many of these groups are relatively 
recent arrivals from Southern China and Vietnam and form about 5 % of the 
population, residing mainly in northern areas of Lao PDR. 
d)  The Hmong-Iumien groups, including the Hmong and Yao, are also referred to as 
Lao Soung in the former since they tend to inhabit highland areas in the northern and 
central provinces of Lao PDR. They also practice swidden agriculture. These groups 
are also recent arrivals from Southern China and comprise about 10% of population 
in the Lao PDR. 
 
As stated previously the project area encompasses 10 villages, and only covers one district 
(Champasak) in Champasack province, while 128 households are affected by the project which 
consists of only one ethnic group namely 
Lao 
which is under
 
the Tai-Kadai family that also 
referred to as Lao-Loum
.
As the majority of predominant Lao Loom way of life, almost all of 
them practice paddy rice cultivation, 
Base on GoL’s and WB’s guidelines on ethnic composition of villages, the project affected 
villages are 
not
ethnic villages; hence Ethnic Development Plan (EDP) is not warranted neither 
required. 
3.3.4 Economic Conditions 
According to the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES, January, 2004), 
generally, poverty has indeed decreased dramatically over the last decade, as shown through the 
Lao Expenditure and Consumption Surveys (LECS).  LECS-I in 1992/93 showed that 45% of 
Page  40
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
39
the population was living below the poverty line.  In 1997/98 (LECS-II) this proportion declined 
to 38.6% of the population a significant reduction in the incidence of poverty  
Agriculture and forestry including cultivation of rice, vegetables and other cash and permanent 
crops, animal husbandry, harvesting of non-timber forestry products and fishing, are the major 
economic sectors in Lao PDR.    
Based on the NGPES (2004), Khong district is not considered as poor district.   However, 
according to the information gathered from field survey, the Table below shows the economic 
conditions among the different affected villages. 1/10 of the total families are defined as 
insufficient in term of their economic status.

3.3.5 Agricultural Production and Livelihood Systems 
As mentioned above, most of the Lao people especially rural population, involve their livelihood 
mainly with agricultural productions which include a diversity of cultivation such as paddy rice 
cultivation, swidden cultivation, upland cultivation, cultivation of vegetable and crash crops, 
animal raising, fishing, harvesting of NTFPs and others.   
 
+
Rice cultivation:
In Lao PDR there are two main agro-systems such as 
paddy
rice cultivation
 and 
swidden 
cultivation
 which included shifting cultivation and rotational cultivation. The most common are 
paddy rice cultivation method and are widely practiced among the lowlanders, with availability 
of irrigation system double cropping per year are normally achieved. The swidden methods are 
most common among the highlanders-mainly ethnic minorities (Shifting Cultivation Status 
Report for FS 2020 Formulation, MAF-DOF, 2003).   In Khong district, most people are relied 
on paddy rice cultivation.  Dry season irrigated agriculture development in the district is still 
limited as electricity is required for pumping water from the Mekong and most streams lack of 
water in the dry season.  
 
+
Cash Crops:
Page  41
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
40
Most lowland households maintain permanent vegetable gardens near streams and springs where 
they grow a wide variety of vegetables and fruits for sales as well as household consumption.  
Swidden farmers also grow a wide diversity of crops during the rainy season, either intercropped 
with rice during the rainy season or in separate plots during both rainy and dry seasons.  
Throughout parts of Southern Lao PDR, different tree plantations are extensively cultivated as 
cash crops, as are various other crops, but in a very small scale by small holders.  These cash 
crops include, depending on the region within the Project area, such as 
Acacia, Teak, 
Eucalyptus
,
cotton, bananas, orange, mango, jackfruit, tamarind, pineapple, sugar cane, 
peanuts, groundnuts, cardamom and vegetables
.
However, there are plantation (teak wood) area   
to be affected by the project. 
Subsistence households consume the majority of their crops, to vary diets and, during rice 
shortages, to meet basic needs; or, they use them as animal feed.  Surplus rice, vegetables and 
cash crops are sold in local markets.  Because they tend to live nearer to markets and urban 
centers, 30% of lowland households sell some of their agricultural products (NSC, 2000).  Due 
to lower levels of productivity and greater distances to markets, ethnic minority groups sell 
much less of their agricultural production.  
 
+
Animal raising:
As stated previously, nearly 90% of rural households raise one or more kinds of livestock, the 
sale of which constitutes a major source of cash incomes.  Nearly all households involve in this 
activity, for consumption as well as for sale, which is the most important source of cash income, 
especially for those who own limited agricultural land. 
On average, each household raises one or more kinds of livestock that include buffaloes, cattle 
and pigs.  In general, buffalo are used are draught animals in rice paddies.  Manure from these 
large animals is often the only fertilizer used in the production of rice and other crops.  Rural 
households also raise pigs and poultry such as chicken and ducks, for their own consumption 
and for occasional sale.  
 
+
Fishing and NTFPs harvesting:
Fishing is an important secondary activity for many rural households, with fish often supplying 
as much as 70% of the protein in the household diet as well as being a source of cash income 
(Chagnon, 1996).  While some households maintain fishponds, the majority fish come from 
Mekong River (using simple casting nets and other traditional fishing equipment) and some 
from other streams, lakes especially in the dry season and seasonal floodplains.  Most 
households consume the bulk of their catch, but the sale of fresh and dried fish is also a source 
of household cash income. 
In Khong District fishing are the most important activities and being steadily developed. Fishing 
activity is primarily for subsistence need of the people living along the Mekong River and its 
major tributaries. While fishing in the Mekong and streams habitats is practiced throughout the 
year fishing in non-river habitats such as ponds and rice fields, even it is most intensively 
utilized, last only for some months of the rainy season. Of these fishing habitats, the Mekong is 
the most productive both in terms quantity and quality. The non-river habitats are considered to 
be subsidiary fishing. People settled in the area have developed over the centuries a very rich 
capture fisheries tradition.  
Generally, NTFPs play a central role in the rural economy, as they provide: 1) animal proteins 
(from wild meat, fish, frogs, shrimp, soft-shelled turtles, crabs and molluscs), 2) calories, 
vitamins and dietary fiber (from mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fruits and vegetables, honey), 3) 
materials for house construction and handicraft production (bamboo, rattan, pandanus, broom 
grass, paper mulberry), 4) traditional medicines and 5) cash income (from the sale of NTFP 
Page  42
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
41
species).  However, NTFPs collection among the affected villages is only for daily food and 
household utilization, not for sale.  
Food is considered by villagers as the most important product from the forest; and wild meat 
and fish are the main source of protein in most people’s diet. In many villages, all foods except 
for rice are collected from the forest and river.  It has been estimated that wild foods contribute 
60-80% of non-rice food consumption, and provide an average of 4% of energy intake, 40% of 
calcium, 25% of iron, and 40% of vitamins A and C.  The importance of NTFP foods increases 
in times of emergency, when crops fail and villagers use tubers and other NTFPs as a substitute 
for rice.  Rural people also depend on NTFPs for other needs such as medicines and 
construction materials.  Main NTFPs are available within and around the affected villages and 
have also high potential for generate family income include: Rattan, Yang resin 
(Dipterocarpus 
alatus)
,
mushrooms, bamboo shoot, wild fruits, wild vegetables, Khisi resin, 
Nhot-Nhe 
(Calumus sp.), Nhot-Boun (Daemonorops schmidtii)
 and others. 
 
+
Handicrafts and home businesses:
Traditional handicrafts meet practical household needs and to generate cash income.  Some of 
these include weaving, particularly among Lao, Phou-Tai and other lowland groups; basketry 
and string bags made by Phou-Tai, Ma-Kong and Ka-Leung groups, the embroidery, however, 
within the Project area is very rare, only for household use in some villages.  Small home 
businesses tend to focus on activities that relate to or complement the agricultural activities of 
the household.  These frequently include rice mills, making or repairing clothes or, adjacent to a 
road, a small kiosk selling drinks and fruit.  In some instances, members of a household may be 
exclusively engaged in a more substantial household business, such as a temporary garage or 
other small-scale services.  
 
+
Income and Sources of income:
Based on the results of our on-site survey and villagers’ interview, it indicated as shown in Table 
4.3.4a below that villagers who live within affected areas have different sources of income.  
However, the main source of income of most villagers is agricultural production/livestock and 
fishing/fishery due to almost all of the villages within project areas are located along the 
National Road 13 South and not far away from Mekong River.  Meanwhile, the other sources 
are seen as minor such as small business/services and daily employee/workers.  The sources of 
income in this case do not mean that one household has only one source, it means that one 
household may have many sources of income which implied the multiple occupations and 
livelihoods system of the villagers within the affected areas.

3.3.6 
Commercial and Industrial Activities 
In terms of Commercial activities
,
based on available information, within and around the project 
area particularly the villages located in the town, in addition to the temporary village market 
there are also small 2-3 shops for each village in the town center that selling food, consumptive 
goods; and, a few restaurants.   
Some rural villages have no commercial facilities due to lack of electricity.  Other villages on 
well-access road or at road intersections have some small kiosks that sell drinks, fruit, cigarettes 
and other small items.  They also have shops that prepare and sell food.  In terms of industrial 
activities, within the project area, there is no factory of any kind or even small scale industries.  
 
3.3.7 
Health and Educational Conditions within the Project Area 
The social well-being of a country relates to its ability to meet basic human needs as indicated 
by health, including, maternal and child health, nutrition and access to safe drinking water, 
sanitation and, education, including educational achievement and literacy.  Overall, the levels of 
social well-being in Lao PDR tend to be low, in absolute terms and in comparison with other 
countries.   
 
+
Health and disease conditions within the project area: 
Based on the information gathered from villagers’ interview regarding the health and disease 
conditions during the last three years within the affected area of the project, the result shows that 
there is no any dangerous disease broken-out within the project area except for 
Malaria 
which 
seen as very familiar with the Lao local people particularly who live in the remote areas.   
However, it needs to be closely and carefully monitored in order to avoid such disease. 
 
+
Education:
In terms of educational achievement and literacy, the deficiencies in educational achievement 
are reflected in literacy rates for adults over 15 years of age.  The national average of 60% 
compares poorly with a rate of 83% in the East Asian region (World Bank, 2000).  More 
significant are the variations in educational achievement across geographic regions in Lao PDR, 
in urban and rural areas and between sexes that indicate systemic problems regarding access to 
education in Lao PDR.  The literacy rates among ethnic minority groups, for both men and 
women, are substantially lower than for ethnic Lao and other lowland groups.  
Educational conditions within the Project area (affected villages), based on the on-site interview 
of Villages Chief, the results in the Table 9 below shows that the educational levels of the 
villagers within the affected villages are quite different.  It was also found for some villages; 
quite large numbers of illiteracy are still existed, despite some claims of total literacy 
achievement.

old persons more than 55 are not included. 
 
+
Labour Force:  
Based on 2000 census data (NSC, 2000), the Lao labour force
3
includes 69.5% of men and 
71.1% of women.  The proportion of employed men and women in rural areas is 15-50% higher 
than in urban areas.  Only 1.7% of the population is unemployed.  Unemployment rates in rural 
areas are 2-4 times lower than in urban areas in the same province. 
Within the Project area (the affected villages), based on the results of survey, each village is 
available in terms of labour force for Project construction.  The Table 10 below is the summary 
of number of the main and secondary labours which are available for conducting of any 
activities during the Project construction within each affected village.

Note:  This focused only within the affected Villages along the Transmission Line. 
 
3.3.8 Infrastructures and Facilities within Project Area 
Infrastructures and/or facilities are seen as very important factor in boosting of socio-economic 
development.  Since the transmission line alignment runs parallel with the National Road 13 
South where most of the lands along the two sides of the road have been developed/developing 
and converted/converting into other used purposes.  Therefore, some infrastructures and 
facilities within the project area are available.  Table 11 below indicates the existing condition of 
infrastructures and facilities within the affected villages along the Transmission Line.

is focused only within the affected Villages along the Transmission Line.                                                        
NA = Not Available. 
3.3.9 Energy Consumption and Existing Generation 
Rural households in Lao PDR use a combination of traditional, intermediate and modern energy 
resources and technologies.  In areas where there is no electricity, the main source of energy for 
cooking, heating and process activities is firewood.  According to FAO, 1999, the consumption 
of fuel-wood including wood for charcoal in Lao PDR in 1999 is averaged at 0.775m
3
per year 
per person.   
Electricity:
 
Within the project area, all villages are provided electricity especially, while some 
remote villages which locate quite far away from these areas have no access to electricity, 
(see 
Table 11)
.
3.3.10 UXO Conditions  
UXO contamination is a very serious problem for the Lao PDR.  In addition to the human 
suffering and loss of life, UXO contamination blocks development in large areas of the country.  
Thus the National UXO Decontamination Programme addresses an important factor in fighting 
poverty.

During a ten-year period (1964 to 1973), the Lao PDR experienced intense ground battles and 
aerial bombings.  It is estimated that over 500,000 bombing missions were launched over Lao 
PDR, and more than 2 million tons of ordnance was dropped during the 1964-1973 in Lao PDR, 
while about 30% of ordnance failed to explode, leaving large areas of the country littered with 
unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Severe UXO contamination still affects 15 provinces, 
Champasack is among them (NGPES, 2004).  The areas affected represent over 50% of all 
agricultural land (MAF/JICA, 2001).  
Three decades after the Indochina War, many people are still being killed or badly crippled from 
ordnance.  The litter of highly dangerous ordnance denies access to much needed land, deters the 
planting of crops and grazing of livestock, and hinders collecting fuel and water.  It also 
discourages movement between villages and slows transport and communication works, and 
generally undermines social and development activities.    
According to the information gathered from the UXO office as shown in the following UXO 
map, UXO scarcely still remain on some areas within the project area.  Paying particular 
attention to the mentioned portions of the Transmission Line, we investigated-by interviewing 
the appropriate villagers, according to the results from the interview of villagers within the 
Project Area especially along the transmission line.  It was found that the portions have no UXO 
contamination and also there is no any villages have severe UXO contamination along the 
ROW, due to these areas have been developed and most lands have been converted into other 
used purposes.  There is very limited UXO in Khong district as shown in figure below:

Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and 
Environment Management Plan 
 
4.1 Potential Impact and Mitigation Measures 
4.1.1 Impact Matrix 
Potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts related to the transmission line project 
during construction, and operations and maintenance are summarized below, and presented in 
Table 12. 
4.1.2 Transmission Line Consideration 
Unlike other types of linear corridor developments (e.g., roads, railways), where the 
transmission lines are severely limited by physical constraints of gradient, length of river 
crossing, etc., transmission lines afford considerably more flexibility, thereby enabling the 
designers to avoid areas of sensitivity.  Preliminary route selection for the transmission lines was 
based on a review of 1:100,000 scale a topographic map which was determined by the 
engineering study team 
together with EdL’s staffs before the IEE study is conducted. 
The consideration and selection of transmission line was based on the following engineering 
principles: 
-
Construct a total of 110 towers, however, to keep the alignment as straight as reasonably 
possible between the start and end points (at least between first PI or angle tower and next 
angle towers) so as to minimize the costs of construction and imported materials; 
-
Wherever possible locate the alignment more or less parallel, and in close proximity of an 
existing road to facilitate construction access and access for maintenance and repairs 
during operation; 
According to the existing conditions of the project area, the following environmental and social 
principles of route consideration and selection were used in addition to the engineering 
principles listed above: 
-
Avoid existing settlements, private and community structures, particularly houses and/or 
built-up areas,  to ensure that resettlement would not be required; 
-
Minimize the need to expropriate valuable land areas, particularly village holy forest, 
village cemetery, agriculture land, farm land, etc.; 
-
Avoid areas of mature forest and other environmentally sensitive areas including NBCAs, 
PPAs, DPAs, NPAs and eco-tourism sites; 
-
Avoid any cultural/historical monuments/sites. 
-
In addition, wherever possible considerations were given to minimizing the extent of 
visual intrusion upon viewscapes considered as unique or valuable as tourist resources.   
For this project a preliminary survey and field visit to identify the alignment was carried out by 
engineering study team together with EdL’s staff before the IEE study is conducted.  However, 
the alignment is identified only on the topography map, but not in the field yet.  The detailed 
alignment survey which involved cutting survey lines through vegetation to enable the cadastral 
survey team to take unimpeded shots along sight-lines with their survey instruments was 
conducted as well as the tower locations were marked on the ground along with the centerline of 
the alignment.  As part of the detailed survey, further refinements to the transmission line were 
based on site specific information collected in the field, including concerns raised in public 
Page  52
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
51
meetings held with affected villagers living along the line as well as information and 
recommendation from this study report. 
As mentioned in the previous chapter, complying with the Lao Electric Power Technical 
Standard 2004, any electrical facilities shall be installed in such a manner so as not to cause no 
pollution, air, water, noise, vibration, discharging of insulating oil and otherwise which may 
endanger the human body and damage other objects. Particularly, in this Project, any use of 
Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) is prohibited, and use of herbicides and pesticides for clearing 
and controlling Right of Way (ROW) is also prohibited. Contractor must use materials, which 
are complied with the standard. 
4.1.3 Vegetation and Wildlife 
Generally, the clearance of vegetation along the presence of the alignment can lead to 
fragmentation of already diminishing areas of natural forests and wildlife habitats.  Overall, the 
existence value, as well as the ecological research value of the ecosystem will be diminished.  
Rare and/or threatened vegetation or wildlife species may also be affected by the alignment.  
The permanently maintenance of the ROW during and after construction will eliminate the 
ability of the land on which the ROW is situated to re-grow to species-rich secondary forest.   
However, for this project, as the habitat is severely degraded over most of the project area due to 
from time to time exploitation of forest and land resources and the alignment is running parallel 
with the National Road 13 South for most of the line length, the construction of access roads to 
the ROW is not much required, except for some areas that the alignment set far away from the 
main road, in such cases the alignment itself can be used as an access road and existing feeder 
roads can also be used as access roads for transporting construction materials to the ROW.  
Therefore forests/vegetations and wildlife habitats will not be significantly affected. 
Although forests and wildlife habitats will not be affected significantly by the Project, some 
patches of primeval forests such as village used forests will be affected.  However, in the cases 
of village used forests are affected by the project; i.e. the alignment from Settaolek village to 
Beunggnam until Cambodia border where it is necessary to remove vegetation, only a narrow 
right-of-way will be cleared, before clearing the ROW, village forest authority in collaboration 
with district forestry unit will conduct detail survey for preparing of removal of big trees.   
The alignment will more or less parallel, and be in relatively close proximity to (i.e., no more 
than 0.5 to 1 km) from existing road, thereby minimizing the disruption that would be caused by 
having to construct lengthy access ways.  No new roads will be constructed, only small access 
tracks to facilitate movement by light tractors or pickup trucks to tower sites.  The potential of 
moving materials to construct towers onto the sites may be small tractors by using old village 
tracks or feeder roads/trails. Those access r
oads will be selected by EdL’s staff members to 
make impacts minimum before commence of the construction. 
To ensure that the alignment and new access tracks are sited to avoid areas of environmental 
sensitivity, a member of EdL’s EMU will conduct detailed site survey and review the alignment 
on this report and conducted monitoring since early stage of construction. 
In order to avoid for project staff and workers of the project to do hunting and poaching wildlife 
in the project area, strict rules against such hunting and poaching with penalties should be 
imposed. 
4.1.4 Land Use and Settlements 
Resettlement and/or removal of houses and other construction can lead to disruption of 
community cohesion and social structure, change life style and livelihood pattern of villagers, 
Page  53
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
52
may also create a bad impression and poverty to villagers if compensation is improper.  Since 
the alignment is not exactly identified in the field, however, from the filed survey, which was 
conducted within 50m of width along the TL, we see that there is no any resettlement is 
required. 
As for permanently affected land by towers, its types are summarized in Table 13. Land to be 
compensated is only 2568 m
2
of paddy fields. 
However, during the detailed alignment survey and identification in the filed, villagers along the 
route should be consulted again regarding their attitudes and opinions as well as value of their 
properties and resources.

4.1.5 Cultural and Heritage Sites 
Cultural and heritage sites are national property.  Running a high voltage transmission line 
within close proximity of an important cultural or heritage feature can reduce the esthetics of the 
site, as well as reduce its existence value, i.e., the value that it exists without being affected by 
external influences.  Relocation of monuments may be culturally unacceptable and result in 
hostility being directed toward the project. 
The proposed alignment will be altered if, as a result of the detailed alignment survey, any 
property removals are unacceptable and unsatisfactory by villagers who are seen as the owners 
of the properties and heretofore-unknown cultural/heritage monuments are discovered or 
identified by villagers.  From the result of field survey, there is no cultural and heritage property 
located along the alignment. 
 
4.1.6 Safety in Health, Other Utilities and Traffic 
 
+
Safety Clearances to Live Conductors 
The GoL has established the Lao Electric Power Technical Standards in 2004, which is referring 
Japanese technical standards as well as other international standards. The EdL have adopted the 
Lao technical standards for for minimum clearance distances for high, medium and low voltage 
conductors.  Minimum clearances are prescribed between conductors and the ground, navigable 
and un-navigable waterways, road crossings, buildings, antennae, telecommunications lines and 
other types of utilities. 
The proposed the Transmission line will cross approximately ten of farm access track and 
village access roads and also cross 4 small and medium streams and one wetland area, but would 
have minimal impacts on their flow system as well as their ecosystem  
Table 15
 
provides a summary of the clearance distances used by EdL for the 115 kv line.  The 
proposed alignment will avoid existing utilities wherever possible.  Otherwise, the minimum 
safety clearances need to be used. 
 
+
Electric and Magnetic Fields by the Transmission Line Project 
A
standard on electric field is prescribed in the Lao Electric Power Technical Standard 2004 that 
electric field strength should be lower than 3kV/m at any points of 1m above ground level. 
Meanwhile, there is no standard on magnetic fields for safety. However, at least, the safety 
clearances to live conductors must be complied to avoid any impacts on human health, which 
might be affected. In case for 230 kV transmission line, if the implementation of the 
transmission line is complied with the safety clearances to live conductors mentioned above, the 
strength of electric fields at boundary of ROW is estimated no less than 145 cm  (Lao PDR 
Technical standard, Referred to IEC 60383-1). 
 
As for expansion of the Ban Hat Substation, its expansion will be within the land area of the 
existing substation. Estimation of electric fields and magnetic fields are not practical because of 
intervention effects of equipment and lines. No one except EdL staff without permission can be 
close to the transformers and other facilities.

4.2 Environmental Impacts related to Design and Construction 
4.2.1 Construction Activities 
Generally, construction of the 230 kV transmission lines will typically involve the following 
tasks: 
-
Clearing of vegetation from the 40 m ROW by felling and lopping of trees, shrubs and 
bamboo including disposal of waste from site clearing to provide adequate clearance 
between vegetation and the conductor wires. Only manual or mechanical methods will be 
used to clear vegetation. Using of herbicides, pesticides and other chemical poison along the 
ROW which can contribute to contamination of watercourses and threaten people, beneficial 
insects, birds and other wildlife will not be allowed. 
-
To gain access to the alignment, access tracks will be cut from various points along the 
main roads to which the TL runs more or less parallel.  Where soil conditions dictate, the 
tracks will be surfaced with suitable road topping material. 
-
The sites for lattice steel towers will be cleared and grubbed, and holes dug to permit 
construction of each of the four tower footings.  At locations where rock or densely 
compacted soil is encountered, rock drills will be used to create holes for the tower anchor 
bolts.  In such cases, compressors will be required on site to provide compressed air for the 
pneumatic drills.  
-
Cement and aggregates will be carried to the each tower site to make concrete that will 
be poured into the holes to serve as the tower footings.   
Page  58
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
57
-
The steel components and bolts for the lattice steel towers will be carried to each tower 
site, where the tower will be assembled and erected manually.   
-
When once the towers are in place, the insulators will be installed and pulling wheels 
will be hung from each insulator string.  Nylon ropes will be run along the centerline of the 
alignment from tower to tower.  Drums of conductor wire will be transported to strategic 
locations on the alignment, connected to the nylon ropes, which will then be connected to 
(gasoline) powered winch that is secured further along the alignment.  Conductor wire will 
be secured to the nylon rope, which will be winched in one at a time to string the conductors 
from tower to tower, through the wheels suspended from the insulators.  The conductor wires 
will be secured to the insulators with the appropriate tension and sag.   
-
Grounding rods and/or continuous buried “counterpoise” (grounding) wires will be 
installed as required.   
-
Temporary equipment stockyards, work camps and field mobile offices will be 
constructed.  The main stockyards will be located near existing towns where advantage can 
be taken of transportation systems, existing vacant level land and, wherever possible, fenced 
off secure areas.  Work camps along the transmission line will generally consist of temporary 
tent camps that will be moved as the construction proceeds along the alignment.  Camps will 
house small work crews and will, therefore, not require any significant infrastructure. Water 
for the camps will be provided by villagers, otherwise purchased from cities. Sewage and 
solid waste will be stored; sediments will be deposited at a temporarily made pond or tank 
near the camps. Garbage from the camps will be buried and other trash will be brought to 
outside for disposal. 
-
When once construction has been completed, sites that are no longer required (e.g., 
access tracks, storage and camp sites) will be reinstated.  This will include removing debris 
or other contaminants, and returning the site to the same (or better) condition in which it was 
found.  Where it was necessary to gain access to the alignment across agricultural lands, 
these areas will be reinstated to ensure future productivity. 
-
Substation Construction  
-
The substation upgrades involve adding new equipment, modifying existing 
equipment, or replacing existing equipment with new equipment. All construction work 
for the 
-
Ban Hat expansion would occur within the existing substation property. 
-
The substations would be built or upgraded in compliance with the applicable 
requirements of the Policy and Standard on Safety and Labour Protection (EdL 2007). 
The final design of upgraded substations would take the local conditions of the sites into 
consideration and, where warranted, would include safety provisions beyond the 
minimum requirements established in the various applicable safety methods. Contractors 
would be required to adhere to all such safe working practices. The new and upgraded 
substations would be designed to allow future maintenance to be done with minimum 
impact to substation operation and with the necessary clearance from energized 
equipment to ensure safety. 
-
Construction of expansion of existing substation would include site grading, 
installation of concrete foundations for substation equipment, installation of a fence 
along the substation perimeter to contain substation equipment and secure the facility, 
installation of gravel surfacing material within the fenced area, and installation of 
substation equipment. Sites for a substation expansion area would be graded and leveled 
to ensure both a stable base for the substation equipment and proper drainage and runoff 
control.  Depending upon soil characteristics specific to each site, soil may need to be 
Page  59
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
58
replaced to ensure stability and drainage. Topsoil would be removed, stockpiled, and re-
spread on-site. Excess soil would be removed from the site. Once the site is graded, a 
perimeter fence, typically a chain link fence, is installed to contain the substation 
equipment. After installation of the fence, concrete foundations are placed to support the 
substation equipment and gravel is laid throughout the fenced area. After the surface area 
is prepared, substation components would be delivered on tractor-trailer trucks and 
installed on their foundations. 
 
-
Substation Maintenance and Operation 
Inspections would be performed regularly over the life of the substations to maintain 
equipment and make necessary repairs. Routine maintenance would be conducted as 
required to remove undesirable vegetation that may interfere with the safe and reliable 
operation of the substations. 
 
4.2.2 Clearing Vegetation along ROW 
Only manual or mechanical methods will be used to clear vegetation. Using of herbicides, 
pesticides and other chemical poison along the ROW which can contribute to contamination of 
watercourses and threaten people, beneficial insects, birds and other wildlife will not be allowed. 
Burning to clear and control vegetation will be prohibited
 
and eliminating potential cause of 
bushfire.  
Trees and bushes cleared shall be disposed properly and only to areas permitted by authorities 
concerned. In order to avoid illegal cutting trees and dealing with logs, before ROW clearing, 
detailed survey will be conducted by provincial forestry section and district forestry unit to list 
and mark commercial tree species. The local authorities have rights to conduct logging and logs 
selling based on the relevant laws and regulations. 
 
4.1.7 Waste from the Project 
Work camps along the transmission line will generally consist of temporary tent camps that will 
be moved as the construction proceeds along the alignment.  Camps will house small work 
crews and will, therefore, not require any significant infrastructure. Water for the camps will be 
provided by villagers, otherwise purchased from cities. Sewage and solid waste will be stored; 
sediments will be deposited at a temporarily made pond or tank near the camps. Garbage from 
the camps will be buried and other trash will be brought outside for disposal. 
Main waste will be vegetation debris from ROW clearances. Debris will be stacked outside area 
of the ROW and burning off shall not be permitted. Wherever possible and where safety is 
assured, villagers will be permitted to remove vegetation such as bamboo and small trees that 
have an economic or practical value. Packaging wastes from electrical equipment will be 
recycled wherever possible (making them accessible to villages, otherwise it will be disposed of 
in local approved landfills). 
 
4.2.4 Vegetation and Wildlife 
Based on the review of forest cover maps, field reconna
issance and villagers’ interview, it is 
indicated that most of the vegetation that will be affected is included some commercial tree 
species, herbaceous and woody stemmed shrubs and bamboo.  However, most of big trees and 
commercial species were exploited by conducting development activities, logging, clearing and 
burning for shifting cultivation.  It is also evident that any areas of old forest such as national 
biodiversity conservation areas (NBCAs) and protection forests are not encountered along the 
Page  60
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
59
proposed line ROW except for some types of forest such as 
Dry Depterocarp Forests
 especially 
along the TL from Settao Lek to Lao-Cambodia border 
(see Table 3 and Annex D)
.
In some areas that trees may need to be cut through second growth stands, the overall impact of 
such tree removal is deemed to be minor, as only a few areas are likely to be encountered.  In 
some areas it may also be necessary to remove individual trees or large tree branches that lean 
into or overhang the 40 m ROW corridor, if they are deemed to pose a threat to the integrity of 
the transmission line particularly where the TL crossed the 
Dry Depterocarp Forests
.
The Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Department (PAFO) especially Provincial Forestry 
Section (PFS) together with District Agriculture and Forestry Extension Office (DAFEO) have 
responsibility to monitor the implementation of compensatory tree planting.  ROW clearing will 
be carried out by a contractor, whose work will be strictly defined by the contract specifications 
and special provisions.   
A
monitoring program will be implemented that involves DAFOE, other authorities concerned, 
village forest Organization (VFO), and an independent third party, who will audit the 
environmental performance of the project.  Strict rules against wildlife hunting (if any) and 
poaching will be imposed on project staff, workers, and all contractors engaged to the Project, 
with penalties levied for anyone caught carrying and using fire arms, or using animal snares and 
traps.   Project owner shall be directly responsible for dissemination of all regulations and 
information concerned to its staff and/or employees as well as for any misconduct made by its 
staff and workers. 
4.2.5 Land Use and Settlements     
As principally said, the alignments will be sited so as to avoid crossing villages and other areas 
of settlement.  Instead, the transmission lines will be routed behind, around or between villages.  
In case the construction of transmission line could not avoid crossing villages, houses and/or 
other constructions 
(there is no resettlement on this project)
,
such houses and other 
constructions e.g. rice huts, within 40 m along the line need to be removed, resettlement and 
compensation must be considered based on the laws and regulations concerned.  While the 
compensation cost for the losses will be paid appropriately by EdL to villagers according to the 
existing conditions of the affected properties, the final resettled amount will also be based on 
negotiation agreement of both sides.   
Consultation with local authority and local villagers is necessary and compensation process will 
be confirmed before the construction.  The basic principle of compensation for the losses of land 
is that landowners have their choice between accepting cash payment and compensation by land 
of equivalent value at other location.  The previous experiences from other projects indicated 
that most affected people preferred compensation by land.   
Where it is necessary to construct transmission lines and or substation over and on agricultural 
land, or any other land, in particular the land on which the tower is to be situated will be 
permanently acquired by EdL.  It was estimated that amongst 110 towers in total, 39 towers will 
be constructed on rice paddy fields and 2 towers will be on unused paddy-field which is still 
classified as other agricultural lands.  For standard lattice towers 36 m
2
of land is required per 
tower (105 towers) and for angle towers require at least 64 m
2
of land,
 see table 14
.
However, 
most of the project will be constructed during the dry season, when there will be fewer crops 
that could be damaged.  If crops are damaged, compensation will be paid properly.  Likewise, 
compensation will be paid by EdL to farmers for lost value of crops if farmers are prevented in 
advance from cultivating an affected piece of land because construction is planned to proceed 
during or part of the cropping season.   
Page  61
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
60
The land compensation for construction of towers is based on the loss of existing properties on 
the land that the towers will be situated.   
As mentioned earlier, in order to reduce impact during access roads construction, construction in 
the dry season (from October to May) and/or after the harvesting season (paddy rice and other 
crops) (November to January) is recommended. 
It is, therefore, anticipated that existing or dry season farm roads will be used to gain access to 
the alignments.  While the existing logging tracks and/or village roads (numerous village roads 
were observed during field survey) can be used for accessing the alignment. In an exceptional 
situation if temporary access tracks need to be constructed over sensitive agricultural lands, the 
contractor will take appropriate measure to lessen the impact to such land. Placing bamboo mats 
on top of the soil where temporary access tracks need to be constructed over agricultural lands, 
is one such practice that has been used economically and effectively (Geo-textile materials are 
rarely used due to their prohibitive cost). The bamboo mats and road base materials will be 
removed after completion of the construction and the contractor will make sure that previous 
conditions of such land are practically restored
.
Dust may be a negative impact to villagers and wildlife.  In dry and windy conditions, water 
spraying will be carried out on all local roads where construction machinery and trucks use for 
gaining access into transmission alignment or construction area.
 
Another issue during the construction is the noise of trucks and heavy equipment. In order to 
reduce impacts to local villagers and wildlife, the construction would basically be limited only 
during daytime (from 7.00AM to 6.00PM), and noise level limited up to 55dB of the noise limit 
in daytime at boundary of the residence. If it is exceeding the noise limit, measure such as 
installing protection walls will be taken. In case that construction during evening is required, the 
local affected people will first be consulted sufficiently in advance. 
4.2.6. Historical, Cultural and Archeological Property 
In case that any historical, cultural or archeological assets are found during excavation, the 
excavation work shall be stopped to avoid losses of important properties. The provincial culture 
and touring Directorate shall be informed thereof. The construction work will be resumed after 
inspection by the authorities and reaching an agreement. 
4.2.7. Health and Safety  
To protect worker health and safety, the Contractor or Constructor will be required to prepare 
and submit a worker health and safety plan for approval, prior to commencement of construction 
activities.  Workers will undergo pre-employment medical screening and be certified as fit for 
work.  Workers will receive health and safety training, including a training component on UXO 
recognition and management.  UXO specialists, if necessary, will be needed to carry out surveys 
of sites that are to be excavated, and will remove and destroy any UXO encountered especially 
within the areas that the map suggests the remain of UXO.  Areas that have been given the “all-
clear” for construction will be demarcated.  UXO pathfinders will accompany transmission line 
corridor clearing crews to sweep for, identify, and dispose of UXO.  Local villagers will receive 
public health education that focuses on prevention of mosquito borne diseases as mentioned in 
section 4.3.6 such as malaria as well as hygiene
 
and sexually transmitted diseases. 
The construction work force faces the principal risks to health and safety.  The main health and 
safety risks include: 
-
Inadequate sanitation facilities in worker camps 
-
Introduction of vector borne diseases such as malaria and others 
Page  62
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
61
-
Other epidemic or sexually transmitted diseases introduced by migrant workers 
-
Serious injury or death as a result of a fall from a tower 
-
Serious injury of death resulting from accidental collapse of a tower, or from being 
struck by a falling object from a tower 
-
Hand, eye and foot injuries from falling or falling objects 
-
Serious injury or death from unexploded ordinance (UXO). 
-
Safety and Health for Substation works
·
Use Best Management Plan (BMPs) to minimize the potential for spills or leaks from 
equipment during construction, including frequent inspections of equipment; requiring 
portable spill containment kits for construction equipment; ensuring that equipment 
operations are present at the nozzle at all times when fueling is in progress; and 
prohibiting the refueling of equipment in wetlands. 
·
Use of protective devices (e.g., breakers and relays) that would de-energize the 
transmission line in the event of an emergency. 
·
Use of fences at substations to prevent access. 
·
Ground metal buildings, fences, and other large, permanent conductive objects in close 
proximity or parallel to the line to prevent electric field discharge. 
 
The public may also be at risk from the construction phase of the project, primarily as a result 
of: 
-
Objects falling onto or across public roads during tower/power pole erection or 
conductor stringing 
-
Spread of epidemic or sexually transmitted diseases from the migrant work force. 
4.2.8. Erosion and Silt control  
During the construction, the project will involve only minimal excavation that could contribute 
to soil erosion and the potential for sedimentation of watercourses.  Excavation will be limited to 
the following: 
-
Digging four holes for each of the lattice tower concrete support bases (115 kv system) 
-
Clearing, excavating and leveling tracks to access the transmission line alignment or 
tower base construction sites 
The towers should be, principally, located so that to avoid high slope areas.  In case that can not 
avoid such areas, excavations for tower bases must be limited to the immediate area of the tower 
legs.  It is recommended that on sloped land, the legs of the tower be designed so that the 
downhill legs are longer than the uphill legs (i.e., staggered legs).  This will enable the towers to 
be sited without having to excavate a level cut into the slope, which could create future problems 
with slope stability and erosion.  However, for this project there is no high slope within the 
proposed construction areas particularly along ROW.  Most construction will proceed during the 
dry season.  This will avoid difficulties that would otherwise be encountered during the rainy 
season.   
The number of access tracks used will be limited to approximately one every three transmission 
towers (approximately one every kilometer).  Access tracks will be selected at a closest point 
and should be an average not more than 1 km in length.  The tracks will be no wider than 2.5 
Page  63
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
62
meters and will be covered with suitable road topping material such as geotextile in areas where 
moist soil conditions or the potential for water borne soil erosion could lead to problems.  
However, using of existing or dry season farm roads/tracks to gain access to the alignments is 
highly recommended. 
In case of access tracks that are not required for permanent use
4
will be decommissioned by 
rehabilitation, re-contouring the slope and seeding the surface to encourage rapid re-vegetation.  
Internationally accepted best environmental management practices will be used to assess the risk 
of slope failure and erosion, and prevent and control potential problems.  It is anticipated that 
existing sources of aggregate will be available for use by the project.  Therefore, no major 
borrow sites, and no quarries will be developed for the purposes of the project. 
The re-vegetation after construction within the transmission line towers is not necessary due to 
the footprint for a 230 kV tower 
(
36
m
2
for suspension towers and 64 m
2
for angle towers)
 and 
the project area is flat land, low slope, therefore, the area that would be exposed to the forces of 
erosion is limited; and natural plants regeneration occurs quite quickly during the early part of 
the rainy season, thereby the possibility that soil erosion within the transmission line towers will 
be insignificant.  
4.2.9. Interference with Other Infrastructure  
As transmission line construction, particularly tower erection and conductor stringing, moves 
from location to location as the work progresses, traffic disruption along the roads where 
erection crews are unloading materials from heavy trucks will be minor.  Constructor should 
adhere to its established practices of posting warning signs and managing traffic to protect the 
traveling public and its workers.  In the event that stringing conductors presents a possible risk 
to traffic on roads or rivers, bamboo scaffolds will be constructed across the roads and rivers to 
protect pedestrians, vehicles, boats (and the conductor itself) from potential injury/damage 
during conductor stringing.  In case of over weight of construction materials that will be 
transported to the construction and/or substation sites, it may be necessary to temporarily 
reinforce some of the weaker roads or bridges. 
 
4.2.10. Overview of Approach to Compensation 
The following are the key principles and objectives that have been adopted for electricity 
development projects in Lao PDR and it is applicable to this project: 
·
Involuntary displacement shall be avoided or minimized wherever possible by 
exploring all viable alternative project designs and locations. 
·
Land acquisition and resettlement shall be planned and implemented in such a way as 
to cause least possible amount of social, cultural and economic disruption. 
·
Affected people shall be (i) compensated as per the compensation principles, (ii) 
assisted directly and indirectly in the transfer of residence, if required, and during the 
transition period at the relocation site, (iii) assisted directly and indirectly in their 
efforts to improve their living standards, in a sustainable manner at the new location. 
·
Livelihoods shall be restored and be done so without detriment to the environment and 
the social fabric of the surrounding areas. 
·
Existing cultural and religious practices shall be respected and, to the maximum extent 
practical, preserved. 
4
If necessary, only those tracks that provide access to ‘corner’ towers will be constructed for permanent use 
Page  64
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
63
·
Special measures shall be implemented to protect socially and economically vulnerable 
groups such as ethnic groups, women headed families children and aged people without 
support structures and people living in extreme poverty. 
·
All people residing cultivating or making a living within the areas acquired for project 
prior to a formally recognized cut off date shall be considered as affected people and 
will be entitled to resettlement and rehabilitation assistance sufficient to assist them to 
improve or at least maintain their pre-project living standards, income earning capacity 
and production levels.  Lack of legal titles to the land a person is cultivating or to the 
place residence will not be a bar to resettlement entitlements. 
·
Replacement residential and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the land 
that was lost, and acceptable to the affected persons (APs). 
·
Temporarily affected land and communal infrastructure will be restored to pre-project 
conditions. 
·
The compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and 
rehabilitation measures in place before approval for construction or civil works. 
·
The previous
 
level of community services and resources shall be improved after 
resettlement. 
·
An affected persons shall not be dispossessed of his/her property nor displaced from 
his/her place of residence or employment without payment of full compensation and/or 
without making arrangements for relocation and rehabilitation. 
·
The Executing Agency shall see that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure 
effective and timely design, planning, consultation, and implementation of the 
Resettlement Plan. 
·
The entire cost of resettlement program shall be considered as an integral part of the 
project cost and accordingly shall be budgeted in annual and overall implementation 
plans of the project. 
·
The resettlement programs shall be planned and implemented with the consent and 
agreement of the affected people and host population and shall encourage their active 
participation.  A full participatory public involvement process shall be implemented. 
·
There shall be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during the 
implementation of resettlement programs. 
·
Prior to loan appraisal, details of the Resettlement Plan shall be disclosed to the APs in 
a
form and manner that they can understand. 
+
The principles for compensation are as follows: 
·
All affected persons, housing, land, and other assets registered at the time of the 
population survey and asset inventory, and all who can demonstrate a loss, have the 
right to adequate compensation for loss and to income restoration in conformity with 
these principles. 
·
Compensation for affected houses, other structures, and for land loss shall be at 
replacement cost and provided prior to relocation. 
·
The replacement of housing plots, housing and agricultural land shall be of acceptable 
standard, use and value to the satisfaction of the affected owner. 
Page  65
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
64
·
Where relocation is required, the transition period shall be as short as possible. The 
affected person must receive land as compensation prior to relocation, although under 
special circumstances cash may substitute for land. 
·
Prior to the approval of the resettlement program, public consultation must be carried 
out with the affected persons to ascertain their opinions. 
·
Prior to settling into new resettlement areas, infrastructure and services shall be 
replaced to a level of service higher than before. 
·
Material and tools to be used at the new site or for the new occupation, or for 
rehabilitation, shall be supplied in a timely manner.
 
If compensation alone is not adequate to improve the livelihood of affected persons, additional 
rehabilitation measures shall be developed for this purpose. 
However, during conducting the field survey for this Study, initial assessments of potential 
losses to be compensated has been made especially to various land and assets likely to be 
affected by the project.  These assessments are based on the field survey and villagers’ 
interview.  However, based on this report, before starting of project construction, construction 
contractor, under supervision and guidance of environmental management committee, need to 
coordinate and work in collaboration with local authorities to collect detail data concerning the 
loss of assets, issue formula which will be applied for cost estimation of construction and 
negotiation with affected villagers to ensure understanding and agree on compensation cost in 
order to avoid subsequent impacts.  Project Environmental Management Committee (PEMC) 
needs to be established at province level in order to be responsible for the implementation of 
relevant tasks and activities and convene meeting to discuss on detailed compensation 
procedures and cost with affected village representatives and affected villagers 
(See Figure 1)
.
The estimation of compensation will be based on the following categories of the loss: 
+
Permanent Losses 
For this project, permanent losses especially the land and/or paddy field that the towers and the 
sub station
 
will be located 
(see Annex Dand Table 13) 
need to be compensated as soon as the 
land is required for construction or before construction is started.  The compensation cost for 
permanent losses must be sufficient to actually replace the lost of land/paddy field and other 
assets, if any.  The permanent losses may include the loss of products or assets on the land and 
the compensation shall be with land of equal productivity or asset value. 
+
Temporary Losses 
Temporary losses of land and/or products on the land are areas that can be returned to the owner, 
more or less, in their original previous condition after conducting any activity relating to the 
implementation of the project.  The compensation cost for temporary loss of land will be as a 
rental cost (or subsistence cost) including the cost of lost products (if any) exist on the land 
based on the local market value in the year of compensation payment.  The rental cost of the 
land will be based on the period of land rental and the real situation of productivity or quality of 
such land which will be assessed again at the end of rental period.  If the land has no adverse 
impact, then the land can be returned to the owner without any additional cost concerning land 
quality loss.  However, if the land has been significantly impacted, then the landowner will be 
compensated properly and satisfactorily.  Section 5.2.1 lists construction activities which would 
have temporary impact on land for which compensations, in the form of rent and rehabilitation 
costs are required.   
+
Estimation of Compensation Cost  
Page  66
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
65
The methods used to estimate indicative compensation costs for this project were broadly 
applied in other similar previous power projects and have been satisfactory for both sides 
(project owner and affected villagers).  However, for this project, the methods and rates will 
need to be refined closer to actual period of compensation and especially when it is clearly 
understood what type of compensation package the  Affected Persons (APs) want and what is 
actually available.   
According to the other similar previous projects, the compensation cost especially for the lost of 
land including seasonal and irrigated rice paddy field, swidden/cultivation areas and other 
agricultural land was estimated based on the total of average productive value of land in the past 
ten years and the actual area of the land.  Cash compensation will be normally considered when 
the affected land and assets are relatively small proportion of the APs livelihood and a suitable 
or equivalent alternative asset is not available. 
The formulas below
 were used for the calculation of 
Permanent loss and Temporary loss
 of 
land in other similar previous EdL power projects. They were specifically used in the 
compensation of the rice paddy field and other farmland or garden which have been satisfactory 
for both sides (project owner and affected villagers). 
However, the actual methodology for compensation estimate needs to be agreed upon and 
finalized by PEMC in consultation with the concerned local authorities and villagers as well as 
APs and it will be set-up in a final compensation agreement, well before the construction is 
taking place. The actual final cost for compensation varies from place to place and from district 
to district

66
In addition to the above methodology, compensation for crops will be at prevailing current local 
market price. The value of house garden will vary tremendously depending on what type of 
crops are grown on the garden.  Many small temporary or seasonal gardens are located around 
the house and along the riverbank where water is easily accessible; in case of this project the so 
called house’ gardens are located outside of the TL ROW and not anticipated to be affected.   
According to the Technical Guideline for Resettlement and Compensation of the Lao PDR, this 
states that 
“due to a virtual non-existence of rural land markets the compensation should be 
determined based on the average productive values of land based on the past three to four years 
of production, and should be equivalent to at least 6-7 years of harvest value”.
 
Most of shifting cultivation areas (including rotational and pioneering shifting cultivation) in 
Lao PDR especially in the northern part is used for upland rice production.  The use of land in 
upland area of local people is unlikely to have a legal right to the land except for those villages 
which have been allocated land and forest that conducted by GoL’ Land Allocation Program 
with at least three hectares of land for one household.  Therefore, it is an aspect that 
compensation entitlements need to be carefully considered to ensure that APs are compensated 
so that they can restore their land and other assets as well as their livelihood.   
In terms of swidden and cultivation area (rotational cultivation), compensate of one third of total 
cost of paddy field (with the same area) has been applied for the similar previous projects.  
However, there is no clear guidance regarding compensation entitlements for areas of fallow 
upland and/or natural grassland which are likely to be areas of previous shifting cultivation; 
impact on these land areas will have an impact on the livelihoods of APs.  
The Technical Guideline for Resettlement and Compensation also states that 
“Compensation 
entitlements to illegal occupiers of state or public land are generally unrecognized.  Where the 
AP do not possess any legal rights to the affected occupied land, and the entitlement to 
compensation for such land is not acceptable, some alternate development options should be 
looked into”.
 
In terms of planted fruit trees and industrial trees, the following methods have been broadly 
applied for similar previous projects: 
 
+
For Planted Industrial Trees
Compensation Cost = [Land Clearing Cost + Cost of Seedling] + [(Maintenance Cost) * 
(Year of Maintenance)] 
+
For Planted Fruit Trees
Compensation unit Cost
1. 
Paddy land =  80 kip/m
2
2. 
Garden land =  60 kip/m
2
3. 
Swidden land = 50 kip/m
2
4.  Non productive/unused land = 30kip/m
2
Note:
the unit cost above were based on previous similar project in Champasak and Saravan  Province 
Page  68
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
67
Compensation Cost = [Land Clearing Cost + Cost of Seedling] + [(Maintenance Cost) * 
(Year of Maintenance)] + [(Average Harvesting Value/year) * 
(Years of Harvesting)] 
Note:  Years of Harvesting for Fruit Trees may range from 1 to 7 years depending on Fruit 
Tree Species. 
The Regulation of Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry No. 0196/MAF.2000, dated 15 August 
2000, Article 23 identified the formula for compensation for the loss of plantation tree as follow: 
Cost of Tree Plantation Farm = Land Use Cost + Land Development Cost + Cost of Existing 
Planted Tree + Cost of Agricultural Produces (if any) 
In terms of forest and non-timber forest products (NTFPs), generally, they play an important 
role in the livelihood of many local people especially the poor.
 
Most rural households, 
especially the poorest, depend heavily on forests not only for timber for house construction and 
other purposes but also for food, fodder, fencing materials, medicines and condiments.  Villagers 
also often derive cash income from sale of NFTPs and, in many local areas, harvesting of forest 
resources is one of the few available economic activities.  NTFP consumption and sales often 
equate to more than half of family income.  Impact on these resources will have also an 
significant impact on the livelihoods of APs,  Although there is no clear guidance regarding 
compensation entitlement for village used forests as well as lost NTFP source within the village 
forests or in case of there is adverse impact on NTFPs, however, to ensure that villages and/or 
villagers will be compensated so that they can restore their forest land and assets livelihood, it 
may be necessary to provide compensation for forest land more broadly than only for village 
forest land.  Where village forest land is lost and has significant impact in large area then new 
forest will presumably need to be allocated.   
Based on the result of site survey during the IEE study, no people will be resettled, only two 
paddy field’s huts under TL line will be affected and needed to relocate. There are about 5,250 
trees with diameter at breast height equal to 20 cm will be cut for transmission line construction. 
About 250 of these trees will be compensated as they are owned by villagers. The compensation 
cost will be provide 10,000 kip/tree for cutting down labor wage  only, because the owners can 
use those cut timber for their further needs.  
Compensation for temporary land occupation, crop damages or missing seasonal production are 
considered based on the given above formula, derived from previous practices on similar EDL 
projects. 
However due to the nature of the construction, it is anticipated there will be no  crop damage as 
a
result of temporary occupation of land, because all of the construction work will be conducted 
during dry season or after harvesting season.  
Once the detailed survey was finalized, prior to the construction work, additional compensation 
might be identified, which will unavoidably increase the compensation costs. Therefore 
provision of budgetary contingency is necessary. Based on the scope of the impacts and 
compensation measures above, the compensation budget is calculated and shown in Table 16, 
17and 18 below.

The total estimation of 
paddy field land under towers compensation is LAK 10,492,780
kip  
Note
:
The above amounts are calculated based on the Formula as indicated in Section 5.2.7 
for the permanent loss of the rice paddy field where the towers will be located only.  In 
this case, the productivity of rice (husk) per one hectare for one season is 2,500 
kilograms (or 2.5 tons/ha).  The market price for 1 kilogram of husk rice is 3,000 Kip. It 
means that the cost of compensation for one Angle tower foundation is 240,000 LAK and 
375,000 LAK for Suspension Tower.

The temporary land areas shown (include access roads/tracks, machinery yards and camping areas) 
were estimated based on site observation of availability of existing tracks as well as from previous 
similar projects within the project proximity. Unit cost used for the estimate of temporary land of various 
types (shown above in (iii)  For temporary loss of land
)
were obtained from previous similar projects. 
 
4.2 Environmental Impacts during Operation and Maintenance 
4.2.1 Transmission Line Maintenance  
EdL carries out corridor maintenance using manual means of trimming the vegetation.  In the 
current practice, EdL is conducted inspection of transmission line at least twice per year with 
aiming to check the condition of towers, conductors, insulators as well as clearing or trimming 
vegetation and cut any tree with higher than 3 meters in order to avoid electrical arching or 
service interruption.  Using of herbicides, pesticides and other chemical poison along the ROW 
which can contribute to contamination of watercourses and threaten people, beneficial insects, 
birds and other wildlife will not be allowed.  Burning to control vegetation along the ROW is 
also prohibited.  Any crop cultivation of local people under transmission line is allowed.  Rather, 
local people living along routes will be participated under contract to manually clear and cut 
vegetation/trees along ROW under supervision of EdL technical staff.  
However, villagers’ 
participation in maintenance of Transmission Line is more recommended.
 
EDL’s EMU will be responsible for monitoring environmental and social aspects of project 
during operations and maintenance activities. Therefore, EDL will provide training on 
Page  71
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
70
environmental aspects to substation and transmission lines crews. Also, involvement of local 
villages in operation and maintenance as employees will be of great socio benefit. 
4.2.2 Substation Maintenance 
Substations should be well operated and maintained. So, operation and inspection procedures 
will be defined and training of operators on the procedures will be conducted. 
One of the issues of substation is contamination of watercourses and soils by leakage of oils 
from transformers. In order to avoid such contamination, oil containment systems such as oil 
separators will be installed close to transformers. The oil separator has functions to tentatively 
store leaked oils and to separate the oil from water. 
Particularly, in order to avoid contamination by PCBs, use of equipment containing PCBs will 
be prohibited. Bidding document shall specify no equipment containing PCBs will be permitted. 
4.2.3 Land Use and Settlements 
The availability of a reliable source of 24-hour electricity to supply to the energy consumption 
for Southern and Central 2 region, over time, will significantly contribute to the quality of life of 
local people and contribute to the development of regional industry, agricultural production and 
commercial activities, in the near future may increase the attraction of people migration to the 
area especially those who want to improve their living.  This may result in a process of induced 
development along the corridor served by electrification, leading to increased exploitation of 
remaining forest resources.  Other potential negative impacts could include land speculation by 
investors, and displacement of long time residents.  However, cultivation of crops along the 
ROW is allowed as long as not to be higher than 3 meters. 
4.2.4 Disturbance to Residents and Wildlife 
Transmission line “hissing” may be noticeable at the place very close to the line. Since 
transmission line ROW is sired away from residential areas, direct impacts of the noise to 
residents will be minor.  
One of the concerns on impacts to residents is interference with communications such as 
Telephone and Televisions. Even though the transmission line has clearance with residential 
areas, the impact should be monitored and consulted with local villagers. If necessary, necessary 
measures such as erecting additional antenna will be taken, otherwise it should be compensated. 
Another issue is an impact to migratory birds. During preparation and construction of the 
project, it will be observed and surveyed if there are migratory gird routes crossing the 
transmission line. If such routes are found, warning signs will be put on the wires on the 
migratory routes. 
4.2.5 Health and Safety 
Health and safety plan will be prepared and implemented by EdL throughout operation phase of 
the project. The health and safety plan includes periodic health and safety training and practice 
drills.  
Sign boards (Dangerous Warning Signs) need to be put on every tower as well as on the 
conductors where those are crossing roads and rivers. 
As for electric and magnetic field, as mentioned above, electric fields by the transmission line 
will not exceed the safety standards if the line is constructed complying with the safety 
clearance. In the case of the substations, no one without permission will not be allowed to enter 
substation and close to transformers.   
4.2.6 Disposal of Wet Cell Batteries 
There is the potential that when areas that are currently off-grid are connected to the grid, 
residents who presently use wet cell (lead-acid) batteries for lighting may dispose of them in 
large numbers.  Uncontrolled disposal of wet cell battery may cause threat to the environment.  
Normally, unused or old batteries have value for their lead content, and batteries with useful life 
have value for other uses other than for lighting and operating small home appliances.  
Page  72
IEE Study for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
71
Therefore, it would appear there is a financial incentive not to discard unused and usable wet 
cell batteries into the receiving environment.  An added mitigation issue is that the number of 
wet cell batteries involved in providing electricity to off-grid villages, relative to the total 
number in service throughout the country (in automobiles, trucks, farm vehicles) is very small.  
The primary issue relating to battery disposal in Lao PDR, particularly in the project areas, is the 
way scrap dealers process the batteries.  However, the number of unused batteries will not be 
high as most villages within the project area have already been connected to 22 KV line.

INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITES AND PROCEDURE 
 
EDL and its EMU will be responsible for ensuring the project complies with the environmental 
policies, procedures, and best practices of the GoL and World Bank, and the specifications and 
special provisions that are set out in the construction contract. EDL will be responsible for 
ensuring, on a day-to-day basis, that the mitigation measures and monitoring activities identified 
in the EMP. 
EdL will be required to assign two environmental specialists to the EMU in (Champasak 
Provincial Branch Operations Unit) Province during the construction phase and one permanent 
environmental specialist during project implementation to efficiently implement the required 
environmental monitoring and evaluation works at the site.  This Officer will be in charge of all 
coordination of the concerned environmental work of this project. He/she is, who was at least 
trained on Environmental Safeguard. This person may be from the EDL branch office. 
Environmental procedures to be followed are described below:

Most data collection would be performed by the EMU in the GMS PMO in Champasak 
Province. For some activities (see Monitoring Plan, Table 6) the local village head will 
participate in the monitoring activities and report his findings to the EMU. In addition, some 
monitoring activities are the responsibility of government authorities (e.g. DAFO/PAFO for 
forestry and PCTD for cultural properties), again these are specified in the Monitoring Plan. 
 
+
Operation 
 
The EMU local office has full responsibility for data collection 
5.2 Data Analysis 
For both construction and operation activities
,
data will be provided by the EMU to the GMS 
PMO. The GMS PMO will include one environmental specialist assigned to analyze all the 
environmental data collected 
 
5.3 Reporting 
 
The Environmental and Social Office at EdL Headquarters (EMO) will prepare environmental 
reports and any recommendations for further actions based upon on the data analysis performed 
by the GMS PMO and issue reports as follows: 
 
ƒ
During construction, quarterly reports to DOE and WREA 
ƒ
During construction, weekly reports to the EdL Deputy Manager 
ƒ
During operation, EdL Provincial Branch Manager will receive reports as required, but at 
least annually.

Reporting to the World Bank will be done as part of the EdL regular reporting requirements. 
Each report to the World Bank will be required to include a separate section on environment, 
which will include a summary of the findings, any environmental issues that occurred during the 
reporting period and how they were managed, or how they will be managed, and a schedule for 
completion. 
 
5.4 Management 
 
Both the EdL Project Manager (construction) and the EdL Provincial Branch Manager 
(operation) have the authority to implement any actions based upon the recommendations in the 
environmental reports.

6.1 
Objective of Consultation and Public Participation 
Information dissemination to, consultation with and participation of APs and involved agencies and 
stakeholders reduce the potential for conflicts, minimize the risk of Project delays, and enable the 
Project to design resettlement and rehabilitation as a comprehensive development program to suit the 
needs and priorities of the APs, thereby maximizing the economic  
and social benefits of the investment.  Specific objectives of public consultation are as follows: 
ƒ
To establish a clear, easily accessible and effective complaints and grievance procedure 
ƒ
To share fully the information about the proposed Project, its components and its activities, 
with the APs 
ƒ
To obtain information about the needs and priorities of the APs, as well as information 
about their reactions to proposed policies and activities 
ƒ
To inform about various options for relocation and rehabilitation measures available to the 
APs 
ƒ
To obtain the cooperation and participation of the APs and communities in activities 
required to be undertaken for resettlement planning and implementation.  
ƒ
To ensure transparency in all activities related to land acquisition, resettlement and 
rehabilitation.  
 
6.2 
Consultation during the IEE Study 
+
Methodology of Consultation 
(a) 
In every affected village and prior to the affected household individuals or the head of the village 
were being interviewed, all the villagers were requested to assemble in a centrally located place 
in the village; mostly at the village temple, school or at the residence of the village head. Place 
and location of the assembly was chosen by village committee. 
(b) 
At the assembly, the villagers were officially informed about the general objective of the project 
as well as the survey. The aspects such as 
w
hat, where
 and 
why
 are to be constructed was 
discussed. General topographical map (1:100,000) on which the proposed transmission line 
alignment is shown, was used for visual reference. 
The potential benefits as well as the adverse impact to the environment, communities’ social 
economic conditions and their overall livelihood were also thoroughly discussed. Assets 
relocation and compensation requirement, their rights and responsibilities as well as villagers’ 
perception of the proposed project were specifically consulted, discussed. Minute of the 
consultation, especially their requests were recorded. 
At all time during the consultation and discussion session, particular effort was made so the 
villagers were aware that the project, as proposed, was in no way an imposition to the villagers, 
and that they had every right in determining the outcome of the project.  
(c) 
By the end of the assembly session, the affected properties and the property owners would be 
known and only these household individuals were asked to stay for more detailed interviews (by 
using preset questionnaires). The affected households were shown “on site” where the proposed 
transmission line alignment would be situated, relative to the land and village. Even though the 
field survey was carried out in mid March at which time the villagers were not involved with rice 
cultivation or harvesting activity, but some villagers were not present due to other engagements, 
therefore in some villages the rate of participation in consultative process are low.

Place of Consultation 
Usually at Houses of heads of the affected villages, but in some villages these were not possible due to 
“rice transplanting season” and most of the families stayed in the farms and some families were gone to 
work away from village.  Therefore, the consultations were carried out at individual‘s farms.  
+
Main discussion points 
Outline of the Project was explained to the representative villages and villagers concerned. Alignments 
of the transmission line and affected land are discussed.  
Since the impacts and affected land by the Project will be minimal, all of participants basically agreed to 
the implementation of the Project with few comments. They expressed their willingness to participate in 
the construction work of the Project as labors to get income from the Project. Only in some villages, 
participants mentioned that proper compensation for affected lands should be ensured. Most villages 
that were not connected to main power line expressed their desires to have electricity for their villages. 
 
6.3 
Further Consultation and Participation  
During the IEE report preparation and drafting plans, many consultations and discussions were also 
conducted with the WB during the mission. Many advices and suggestions made by the mission 
improved of the proposed environment management and the mitigation plans result from this IEE. After 
completion final draft the IEE report, EMP and RAP, the consultation meeting will be held in Khong 
District, Champasak Province for presenting the results of IEE to the Local authorities, the APs 
representatives and other concerned provincial line agency representatives. The project impacts and its 
mitigation, compensation implications will be explained at this meeting, while interests and feed backs 
from the attendants will be taken into account for further effectiveness of the plans. 
Further consultation with and participation of APs will be considered as follows: 
¾
Disclosure of  final RAP to APs: 
 
Once this RAP is approved by the Bank and WREA, it will be translated into Lao language and 
then disclosed to APs and opened in public for further public consultation. 
¾
Information to APs about Compensation Payment: 
 
EdL through the districts and villages authorities has to notify and consulted each AP with the 
time and procedures for compensation payment.   
¾
Information to APs regarding Site Clearance and Construction: 
 
APs will be informed and consulted about the schedule for the Project ROW clearance and 
tower construction and stringing.  
¾
Information to the General Public about Schedule of Physical Works: 
 
The local authorities will notify the general public along with APs about the schedule of 
physical works.  Public announcements will be made in village meetings. 
 
Feedback from APs related to the Transmission Project should be accepted anytime on the course of the 
procedures and EdL should reply to them.

8. clusion and Recommendations 
 
Overall, the Banhat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project will only generate 
minor environmental impacts, which will be offset considerably by the positive benefits that will accrue 
from the project.  This evaluation is supported by the following: 
·
Along the route where transmission line will be traversed, there are some forest areas which 
classified as Current Forest which include Dry Dipterocarp Forest.  However, some high commercial 
value species, big trees and wildlife habitat were already removed.  
·
The 230 kV transmission line routes have been selected on the basis that they will avoid as possible 
as environmentally sensitive areas and important view-scapes such as national park, National 
Biodiversity Conservation Areas, recreation areas, waterfall, protected areas, research areas, 
religious and cultural/heritage sites, and high valued wetland. 
·
The transmission line will traverse some part of Protection Forest, near to the country border. The 
permission from the province authority should be taken. 
·
The biophysical resources in the areas through which the transmission lines will be routed have been 
extensively exploited over the recent past by human activities such as logging, fuel wood collection, 
and slash and burn for cultivation, leaving degraded land that is only just recovering in some areas. 
·
The transmission line will traverse through some village used forests that is considered as a 
temporally and minor impact (during construction), so that compensation for the losses will not be 
required. 
·
Resettlement is not required for any property along the alignment except for rice paddy field which 
will be temporary in the construction phase only.  However, social cohesion, community structure, 
administrative and community organizations, religious and cultural systems will not be adversely 
affected as a result of losing such things.  
·
Legislative and regulatory mechanisms are in place, which ensure the project will be subjected to a 
thorough environmental review, including review of the EMP. 
·
Legislative and regulatory mechanisms are also in project affected people will be compensated for 
any crop losses (if any), damage to land, or loss of land that results from the project.  Permanent 
losses of all properties along the TL (e.g. such properties lie on where the towers are located) will be 
compensated by project owner (EdL), while temporally losses of  land, fruit trees, crops and others 
during construction phase will be compensated by constructor.   
·
Mitigation measures have been proposed that will, if implemented effectively, ensure that any 
adverse impacts that may accrue as a result of the project, will be satisfactorily addressed.  A 
monitoring plan will be developed, which will be executed by a third party to ensure that 
environmental mitigation is undertaken to address negative impacts. 
·
Conducting construction in the dry season (from October to May) and/or after the time that the farm 
productions (paddy rice and other crops) are harvested (in from November to January) is highly 
recommended. 
·
During the construction and maintenance especially during the clearance of vegetation along the 
line, labour force from numbers of affected village is available, and hiring of villagers labour 
within the affected villages is highly recommended in order to have participation and promote 
them to have additional income.

From this study, it is anticipated that the project will generate only minor environmental impacts.  This 
is because the project will involve construction of transmission lines along alignments on which the 
forestry and wildlife resources have largely been removed as a result of past and recent logging 
activities, and the practice of shifting (slash and burn) cultivation.  The transmission line routes have 
been chosen to avoid remaining environmentally sensitive areas and important view-scape areas such as 
NBCAs, Protection Forest; recreation areas, waterfall, research areas, religious and cultural/heritage 
sites, and high valued wetland except for some rice paddy field.  Mitigation and compensation measures 
have been formulated to ensure that potential impacts can be satisfactorily addressed.  This IEE, 
including the environmental management plan and monitoring program as discussed above is 
considered sufficient to meet the Environmental Assessment requirements for this Project.  Therefore, 
further more detailed assessment by way of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not required 
for this project.
