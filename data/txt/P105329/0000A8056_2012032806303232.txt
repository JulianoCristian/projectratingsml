                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The GMS-PT Projects have the development objective of enhancing regional power trade within the Greater Mekong Sub-Region with a view to also: (i) bringing
                         affordable grid-based electricity to selected provinces in Cambodia through import of power from Lao PDR and Vietnam; and (ii) bringing reliable electricity to the
                         Saravan province in Lao PDR, while creating the conditions for eventual interconnections of Lao PDR with other countries of the region. [PDO (i) relates to Cambodia
                         and PDO(ii) relates to Lao PDR. Since it is a regional project, the PDOs reflect the objectives of the beneficiary countries in addition to the regional dimension of the
                         project.]
