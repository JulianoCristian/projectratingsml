Introduction 
 
Background 
 
Power Trade in the Greater Mekong Sub-region is presently limited to a few bilateral 
agreements, relatively small in scale. However, the region is stepping on to a new stage with 
the formation of the Region Power Trade Coordinating Committee (RPTCC) in 2004 and 
significant process in a number of proposed regional investments. Despite these 
developments, integration of the national power networks is expected to happen gradually 
over the medium to long term, and for the foreseeable future trade will occur on the basis of 
bilateral trade arrangements. 
 
The Power Trade Import and Export Study funded by Policy and Human Resource 
Development Fund (PHRD Fund) through the World Bank, is the first step toward ensuring 
that these arrangements are rationally developed and financed in Lao PDR. One of the 
measure components of Power Import and Export Study is to complete the feasibility study of 
interconnection from the southern region of Lao PDR to the northern part of Cambodia in 
order to replace local high-cost diesel generation in Cambodia with Lao hydropower. The 
Bank is considering financing the interconnection, Ban Hat 
–
Veunkham – Stung Treng 230 
kV Transmission Line Project. This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was drafted under the 
above-mentioned study and finalized by the Environmental Management Unit of EDL in 
coordination with the Bank. 
 
This resettlement action plan (RAP) report, forms part of the IEE study, presents the RAP 
reflecting the above regulatory requirement for resettlement and compensation, in accordance 
with the local and international Socio and Environmental Protection Laws, Regulations and 
Guidelines. 
 
Project Extent 
 
The proposed 230 kV transmission line within Lao PDR has features that the voltage 230 kV 
is high voltage transmission line; the length is 27.09 km along the east side of the National 
Road No. 13 South where there are no residents to be resettled, limited valuable forest and 
wildlife affected, no cultural and heritage sites affected. The line alignment was also selected 
to minimize impacts to such important objects as much as possible. Therefore, only 
insignificant impacts can be anticipated.  
 
Methodology for Field Survey and Data Collection 
 
The field survey and data collection was carried out in every affected village along the 
transmission line from Ban-Hat Substation to Cambodian border. The field survey team with 
a
total member of nine
 
personnel was formed. The team was led by a unit leader (also a 
specialist), who together with the project team leader was in charge of all field survey 
activities – Village consultation, liaison with local authorities, interviews with villagers and 
head of affected villages, carrying out investigations and observation and general data 
collections etc., 
 
Prior to the arrival of the field survey team, the local district authorities of the project areas 
were officially notified by EDL Vientiane head office
.
They
 
were informed of the objectives, 
the timing of the field work activities to be conducted in the district.  
 
Page  9
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
9
They were also informed about their roles and responsibilities in assisting the field survey 
activities of the survey team. 
 
In every affected village and prior to the households or the head of the village being 
interviewed, all the villagers were requested to assemble in a centrally located place in the 
village, mostly at the village temple, school or at the residence of the village head. 
 
At the assembly, the villagers were officially informed about the general objective of the 
project as well as the survey. The aspects such as 
what, where
 and 
why
 is to be constructed 
was discussed. The potential benefits as well as the adverse impacts to the environment, 
communities’ social economic conditions and their overall livelihood were also thoroughly 
discussed. Assets relocation and compensation requirement, as well as villagers’ perception 
of the proposed project were specifically consulted, discussed and recorded. (See main for 
signed consultation records) 
 
At all time during the consultation and discussion session, particular effort was made so the 
villagers were aware that the project, as proposed, was in no way an imposition to the 
villagers, and that they had every right in determining the outcome of the project. 
 
The primary data (required for the study) was obtained through the survey (face-to-face 
interview using preset questionnaires) of affected villagers (villagers whose properties situate 
within the transmission right of way), including head of villages. (See Annex 2
 
for sample of 
Questionnaire forms)D 
 
The survey focused on the attitude of local villagers, regarding the proposed project and its 
potential adverse and beneficial impacts. It also focused on current status of land and forest 
usage, income generation activities, land acquisition, wildlife conditions, resettlement and 
compensation. The current status of unexploded ordinance (UXO) as well as potential 
impacts on social, economic and environment were also assessed. These data are summarized 
and annexed to this report (See Annex 1). 
 
Before conducting the field survey, list of families/households especially for those people 
who have been affected by the project, were acquired from the head of the villages.  Similarly 
some relevant secondary data such as total number of population, houses, households, and the 
amount of land and name of the owners were also collected. In case of head of 
families/households were absent either at work or at other engagement, another reliable 
senior member the family would be interviewed in WREA. To keep the interviewee from 
being influenced by each other, the interview session was kept separately and private. 
 
Other relevant data on general environment- Forests, flora and fauna, land use, water and 
streams etc., in and around project affected areas, was also collected during the field survey. 
List of rare or endangered wildlife species, list of protected areas, and some related data were 
obtained (from the previous studies and/or reports and published papers by the government 
agencies and the ministries concerned) prior to the commencement of the field survey.   
 
Definition 
 
“
Compensation
”
means payment in cash or in kind for an asset to be acquired or affected by a 
project at replacement cost. 
 
Page  10
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
10
“Cut-off Date”
 is the date prior to which the occupation or use of the project area makes 
residents/users of the project area eligible to be categorized as affected persons.  The cut-off date 
coincides with the date of the census of affected persons within the project area boundaries.  
Persons not covered in the census, because they were not residing, having assets, or deriving an 
income from the project area, are not eligible for compensation and other entitlements. 
 
“Entitlement”
 means a range of measures comprising compensation, income restoration 
support, transfer assistance, income substitution, and relocation support which are due to 
affected people, depending on the nature of their losses, to restore their economic and social 
base.   
 
“Project Authorities”
 refer to both Electricite du Laos (EDL) and Ministry of Energy and 
Mines (MEM), with EDL in charge of grid extension.  
 
“Displaced Persons (DP)”
 includes any person or persons, households, a firm,  or private or 
public institution who, in the context of acquisition of assets and change in land usage, as of 
the cut-off date, on account of the execution of the project, or any of its subcomponents or 
part, would have their: 
 
(i) 
Standard of living adversely affected; 
(ii) 
 Right, title, or interest in any house, land (including residential, commercial, 
agricultural and grazing land) or any other moveable or fixed assets acquired 
or possessed, in full or in part, permanently or temporarily adversely affected; 
or 
(iii) 
 Business, occupation, places of work or residence or habitat adversely 
affected, with or without displacement.   
 
DPs include persons or affected household and consist of all members of a household 
residing under one roof and operating as a single economic unit, who are adversely affected 
by a project or any of its components.  For resettlement purposes, displaced persons will be 
considered as members of displaced households.   
 
“Rehabilitation”
 means assistance provided to DPs seriously affected due to the loss of 
productive assets, incomes, employment or sources of living, to supplement payment of 
compensation for acquired assets, in order to improve, or at least achieve full restoration of 
living standards and quality of life to pre-project level. 
 
“Relocation”
 means the physical shifting of a DP from his/her pre-project place of residence, 
place of work or business premises.   
“Replacement Cost” is the amount needed to replace an asset and is the value determined as 
compensation for: 
(i) 
Agricultural land the pre-project or pre-displacement, whichever is higher, 
market value of land of equal productive potential or use located in the vicinity 
of the affected land, plus the cost of preparing the land to levels similar to those 
of the affected land, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes;   
(ii) 
Land in urban areas, it is the pre-displacement market value of land of equal 
size and use, with similar or improved public infrastructure facilities and 
services and located in the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of any 
registration and transfer taxes;   
(iii) 
Houses and other related structures based on current market prices of materials, 
transportation of material to construction site, cost of labor and contractor’s fee, 
and cost of any registration and transfer taxes. In determining replacement cost, 
depreciation of the assets and value of salvaged building materials are not taken 
Page  11
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
11
into account and no deductions are made for the value of benefits to be derived 
from the project;  
(iv) 
Crops, trees and other perennials based on current market value; and  
(v) 
Other assets (i.e. income, cultural, aesthetic) based on replacement cost or cost 
of mitigating measures. 
 
“Resettlement”
 means all measures taken to mitigate any and all adverse impacts of a 
project on DPs property and/or livelihoods, including compensation, relocation (where 
relevant) and rehabilitation as needed. 
 
“Vulnerable Group”
 are distinct groups of people who might suffer disproportionately or 
face the risk of being marginalized from the effects of resettlement and specifically include:  
(i) 
Female headed households with dependents,  
(ii) 
Disabled household heads,  
(iii) 
Households falling under the generally accepted indicator for poverty, 
(iv) 
Elderly households with no means of support and landlessness, and  
(v) Indigenous 
minorities. 
 
Policy Objectives 
 
The objectives of the Resettlement Action Plan will include the following elements:  Involuntary 
resettlement should be avoided or minimized through design efforts. Where involuntary 
resettlement is unavoidable, resettlement activities should be conceived and executed as 
sustainable development programs, providing sufficient compensation, assistance and 
rehabilitation to the DPs so that they would be at least as well off as they would have been in the 
absence of the project. DPs will benefit from the project. 
 
Project stakeholders (including DPs) are consulted and given the opportunity to participate, 
as practicable, in the design, implementation, and operation of the project, and 
DPs should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standard of living or at 
least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels. 
 
The proposed resettlement plan should apply to all components under the project funded by the 
Bank and directly related projects funded by other sources. The compensation and entitlement 
policy should apply to all displaced persons regardless of the total number affected or the 
severity of impact. Particular attention is paid to the needs of vulnerable groups among those 
displaced: especially those below the poverty line, the elderly, women and children, and ethnic 
minorities. 
 
Project Scope  
 
This project consists of mainly two construction works. One is construction of 230 kV 
transmission line from Ban Hat Substation to Stung Treng Substation in total length of about 
82 km. Responsibility of Laotian side is between Ban Hat Substation and the Lao-Cambodia 
border in length of 27.09 km. The alignment generally follows existing National Road No. 13 
South and mostly locates on 500-700 m Eastern side of the road. During construction, 40 m 
width clearance (trees, bushes and paddy 
field’ huts) along the transmission line Right-of-
Way (ROW) will be carried out.  Trees, if any higher than 3 meters, along the transmission 
line ROW will be removed.    
 
Page  12
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line

Another work is expansion of the existing Ban Hat Substation to connect the above 
mentioned transmission line. The expansion will be within the land of the existing substation, 
where additional clearance of land acquisition is not required. The workers camp is not yet 
finalized by EdL and the Contractor. But as the line route is not so long EDL will advice to 
contractor to rent some land in some village along the line to be their warehouse and 
temporary camp as this is a practice of the most of the transmission line contractor working in 
Lao. After work completion all of this area will be clear up and use by the owners. 
 
Socio-economic Condition 
 
The demographic, ethnic, socio-economic and cultural conditions within the Project area 
have been documented using a variety of primary and secondary sources.  In order to provide 
data for load forecasting as well as the social analysis of the Project, the survey and interview 
were carried out for every affected village and households as mentioned in Table 1 (76 
affected households from 8 villages in Khong district).  Before conducting survey and 
interview, a consultation process was also carried out with the local organizations concerned 
such as District Administration Office, Land Administration Office, DAFO and village 
authorities. During the site survey, the study teams visited the 8 villages and had 
consultations with village heads and affected villagers.  
 
Secondary sources of data/information included extensive district annual reports; 
demographic and other data collected directly from district and village authorities in the 
Project area; and, numerous studies, reports and other documents related to the project. 
 
Population and Demographics 
 
The total population of Laos stands at 5.5 million (National Statistical Center, 2002).  At 2.6 
million, the proportion of people aged 15-54 years is 48% of the total.  The national average 
for life expectancy at birth is 54 years (World Bank, 2000).  This means that the population is 
very young, with more than 40% aged less than 15 years.   
 
Lao PDR is a rural landlocked country.  In 1998, 78% of Lao lived in rural areas and 22% 
lived in urban areas (World Bank, 2000).  The rural village is the basic social unit of the 
country.  According to the 1995 census, across the country there were nearly 11,400 villages.  
The average village population was 400, although actual settlements may range from as few 
as 10-15 households, or approximately 70 people, to larger villages of more than 300 
households. 
 
The predominantly rural nature of Lao PDR means population densities are very low.  The 
national average in 2002 is 23 persons/km
2
.
The average population density in rural areas 
was 21 persons/km
2
and in urban areas, 25 persons/km
2
.
The regional distribution of 
population densities with central region is 27 persons/ km
2
,
while northern and southern 
regions are 19 persons/km
2
and 24 persons/km
2
respectively (CPC-NSC, 2002). 
 
As mentioned earlier, the project covers only 8 villages within one district; namely Khong 
district, Champasak Province.  According to the field survey conducted by the team survey 
we see that among 8 villages within the project areas, the total population is 10,728 people 
with 5,713 female and total of 2,016 families of 1,973  households, table below shows the 
distribution of population among the affected villages.

Ethnically, Lao PDR is highly diverse, both in terms of number of ethno-linguistic groups 
and in the breadth of their higher linguistic diversity.  More than 230 spoken languages, 
bel
onging to four language super stocks, have been identified, making Lao one of the world’s 
most diverse countries.  With respect to location, the areas of highest diversity are often in the 
remotest upland areas, particularly within and around NBCAs.  The 2000 Census identified 
49 different groups with sub-groups totaling over 200 (ADB, 2000).  Ethnic groups within the 
Lao territory are grouped in four major ethno linguistic families.  These families commonly 
grouped into three categories that reflect the dominant languages, settlement patterns and 
agricultural practices.  
One of the main characteristics of the Lao PDR is its cultural diversity. Although there have 
been differing numbers given for the groups, specialists mostly agree on the ethno linguistic 
classification of the ethnic groups. For the purposes of the 1995 census, GOL recognized 47 
main ethnic groups or categories and 149 sub-groups, but the last revision of this list by the 
LFNC contained 49 categories, and over 160 subgroups. The National Assembly has ratified 
this list in the Agreement No. 213/NA dated 24 November 2008.

a) The Tai-Lao groups living in the lowland regions of the country that for the 
most part cultivate paddy rice, practice Buddhism and are integrated into the 
national economy. This group includes the Tai-Lao, which is the dominant 
group, and various other related ethnic groups such as the Tai-Dam, Tai Lue, 
Phuan and other Tai speaking groups. These correspond to the Lao-Tai group 
and represent approximately 60% of the population. 
b) The Mon-Khmer groups dominating the middle hills that for the most part 
practice swidden agriculture are reliant on forest products and to some extent 
are isolated from the dominant lowland culture. Many groups, however, 
exhibit varying degrees of assimilation and adaptation to Tai-Lao culture. 
These groups: Khmou, Makong, Kata, Yrou and other smaller groups are the 
original inhabitants of South-East Asia and consist of the Austro-Asiatic or 
Mon-Khmer ethnic groups approximately 25% of the population. 
c) 
The Sino-Tibetan groups living in the highland areas practicing swidden 
agriculture and include the Sino-Tibetan and Hmong-Mien ethnic groups. These 
groups include the Akha, Lahu, Lisu, Pounoy and others. Many of these groups 
are relatively recent arrivals from Southern China and Vietnam and form about 5 
%
of the population, residing mainly in northern areas of Lao PDR. 
d) The Hmong-Iumien groups, including the Hmong and Yao, are also referred to as 
Lao Soung since they tend to inhabit highland areas in the northern and central 
provinces of Lao PDR. They also practice swidden agriculture. These groups are 
also recent arrivals from Southern China and comprise about 10% of population 
in the Lao PDR. 
 
As stated previously the project area encompasses 8 villages, and only covers one district 
(Khong) in Champasack province, while 76 households are affected by the project which 
consists of only one ethnic group namely 
Lao 
which is under
 
the Tai-Kadai family that also 
referred to as Lao
.
As the majority of predominant Lao way of life, almost all of them 
practice paddy rice cultivation. 
 
Base on GoL’s and WB’s guidelines on ethnic composition of villages, the project affected 
villages are 
not
 ethnic villages; hence Ethnic Development Plan (EDP) is not warranted 
neither required. 
 
Economic Conditions 
 
According to the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES, January, 
2004), generally, poverty has indeed decreased dramatically over the last decade, as shown 
through the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Surveys (LECS).  LECS-I in 1992/93 showed 
that 45% of the populations were living below the poverty line.  In 1997/98 (LECS-II) this 
proportion declined to 38.6% of the population a significant reduction in the incidence of 
poverty. 
 
Agriculture and forestry including cultivation of rice, vegetables and other cash and 
permanent crops, animal husbandry, harvesting of non-timber forestry products and fishing, 
are the major economic sectors in Lao PDR. 
 
Based on the NGPES (2004), Khong district is not considered as poor district.   However, 
according to the information gathered from field survey, the table below shows the economic 
conditions among the different affected villages.

Agricultural Production and Livelihood Systems 
 
As mentioned above, most of the Lao people especially rural population, involve their 
livelihood mainly with agricultural productions which include a diversity of cultivation such 
as paddy rice cultivation, swidden cultivation, upland cultivation, cultivation of vegetable and 
cash crops, animal raising, fishing, harvesting of NTFPs and others.   
 
5.4.1 Rice cultivation: 
 
In Lao PDR there are two main agro-systems such as 
paddy rice cultivation
 and 
swidden 
cultivation
 which included shifting cultivation and rotational cultivation. The most common 
are paddy rice cultivation method and are widely practiced among the lowlanders, with 
availability of irrigation system double cropping per year are normally achieved. The 
swidden methods are most common among the highlanders-mainly ethnic minorities 
(Shifting Cultivation Status Report for FS 2020 Formulation, MAF-DOF, 2003).   In Khong 
district, most people are relied on paddy rice cultivation.  Dry season irrigated agriculture 
development in the district is still limited as electricity is required for pumping water from 
the Mekong and most streams lack of water in the dry season.  
 
5.4.2 Cash Crops: 
 
Most lowland households maintain permanent vegetable gardens near streams and springs 
where they grow a wide variety of vegetables and fruits for sales as well as household 
consumption.  Swidden farmers also grow a wide diversity of crops during the rainy season, 
either intercropped with rice during the rainy season or in separate plots during both rainy 
and dry seasons.  Throughout parts of Southern Lao PDR, different tree plantations are 
extensively cultivated as cash crops, as are various other crops, but in a very small scale by 
small holders.  These cash crops include, depending on the region within the Project area, 
such as 
Acacia, Teak, Eucalyptus
,
cotton, bananas, orange, mango, jackfruit, tamarind, 
pineapple, sugar cane, peanuts, groundnuts, cardamom and vegetables
.
However, there is no 
any plantation area and/or farmland to be affected by the project.

Subsistence households consume the majority of their crops, to vary diets and, during rice 
shortages, to meet basic needs; or, they use them as animal feed.  Surplus rice, vegetables and 
cash crops are sold in local markets.  Because they tend to live nearer to markets and urban 
centers, 40% of lowland households sell some of their agricultural products (NSC, 2000).  
Due to lower levels of productivity and greater distances to markets, ethnic minority groups 
sell much less of their agricultural production.  
 
5.4.3 Animal raising: 
 
As stated previously, nearly 90% of rural households raise one or more kinds of livestock, the 
sale of which constitutes a major source of cash incomes.  Nearly all households involve in 
this activity, for consumption as well as for sale, which is the most important source of cash 
income, especially for those who own limited agricultural land. On average, each household 
raises one or more kinds of livestock that include buffaloes, cattle and pigs.  In general, 
buffalo are used are draught animals in rice paddies.  Manure from these large animals is 
often the only fertilizer used in the production of rice and other crops.  Rural households also 
raise pigs and poultry such as chicken and ducks, for their own consumption and for 
occasional sale.  
 
5.4.4  Fishing and NTFPs harvesting: 
 
Fishing is an important secondary activity for many rural households, with fish often 
supplying as much as 70% of the protein in the household diet as well as being a source of 
cash income (Chagnon, 1996).  While some households maintain fishponds, the majority fish 
come from Mekong River (using simple casting nets and other traditional fishing equipment) 
and some from other streams, lakes especially in the dry season and seasonal floodplains.  
Most households consume the bulk of their catch, but the sale of fresh and dried fish is also a 
source of household cash income. 
 
In Khong District fishing are the most important activities and being steadily developed. 
Fishing activity is primarily for subsistence need of the people living along the Mekong River 
and its major tributaries. While fishing in the Mekong and streams habitats is practiced 
throughout the year fishing in non-river habitats such as ponds and rice fields, even it is most 
intensively utilized, last only for some months of the rainy season. Of these fishing habitats, 
the Mekong is the most productive both in terms quantity and quality. The non-river habitats 
are considered to be subsidiary fishing. People settled in the area have developed over the 
centuries a very rich capture fisheries tradition. 
 
Generally, NTFPs play a central role in the rural economy, as they provide: 1) animal 
proteins (from wild meat, fish, frogs, shrimp, soft-shelled turtles, crabs and molasses), 2) 
calories, vitamins and dietary fiber (from mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fruits and vegetables, 
honey), 3) materials for house construction and handicraft production (bamboo, rattan, 
pandanus, broom grass, paper mulberry), 4) traditional medicines and 5) cash income (from 
the sale of NTFP species).  However, NTFPs collection among the affected villages is only 
for daily food and household utilization, not for sale.  
 
Food is considered by villagers as the most important product from the forest; and wild meat 
and fish are the main source of protein in most people’s diet. In many villages, all foods 
except for rice are collected from the forest and river.  It has been estimated that wild foods 
contribute 60-80% of non-rice food consumption, and provide an average of 4% of energy 
intake, 40% of calcium, 25% of iron, and 40% of vitamins A and C.  The importance of 
Page  17
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
17
NTFP foods increases in times of emergency, when crops fail and villagers use tubers and 
other NTFPs as a substitute for rice.  Rural people also depend on NTFPs for other needs 
such as medicines and construction materials.  Main NTFPs are available within and around 
the affected villages and have also high potential for generate family income include: Rattan, 
Yang resin 
(Dipterocarpus alatus)
,
mushrooms, bamboo shoot, wild fruits, wild vegetables, 
Khisi resin, 
Nhot-Nhe (Calumus sp.), Nhot-Boun (Daemonorops schmidtii)
 and others. 
 
5.4.5 Handicrafts and home businesses: 
 
Traditional handicrafts meet practical household needs and to generate cash income.  Some of 
these include weaving, particularly among Lao, Phou-Tai and other lowland groups; basketry 
and string bags made by Phou-Tai, Ma-Kong and Ka-Leung groups, the embroidery, 
however, within the Project area is very rare, only for household use in some villages.  Small 
home businesses tend to focus on activities that relate to or complement the agricultural 
activities of the household.  These frequently include rice mills, making or repairing clothes 
or, adjacent to a road, a small kiosk selling drinks and fruit.  In some instances, members of a 
household may be exclusively engaged in a more substantial household business, such as a 
temporary garage or other small-scale services.   
 
5.4.6 Income and Sources of income: 
 
Based on the results of our on-
site survey and villagers’ interview, it indicated as shown in 
table 3 below that villagers who live within affected areas have different sources of income.  
However, the main source of income of most villagers is agricultural production/livestock 
and fishing/fishery due to almost all of the villages within project areas are located along the 
National Road 13 South and not far away from Mekong River.  Meanwhile, the other sources 
are seen as minor such as small business/services and daily employee/workers.  The sources 
of income in this case do not mean that one household has only one source, it means that one 
household may have many sources of income which implied the multiple occupations and 
livelihoods system of the villagers within the affected areas.

Commercial and Industrial Activities 
 
In terms of Commercial activities
,
based on available information, within and around the project 
area particularly the villages located in the town, in addition to the temporary village market there 
are also small 2-3 shops for each village in the town center that selling food, consumptive goods; 
and, a few restaurants.   
Some rural villages have no commercial facilities due to lack of electricity.  Other villages on 
well-access road or at road intersections have some small kiosks that sell drinks, fruit, cigarettes 
and other small items.  They also have shops that prepare and sell food.  In terms of industrial 
activities, within the project area, there is no any factory or even small scale industries.  
 
Health and Educational Conditions within the Project Area 
 
The social well-being of a country relates to its ability to meet basic human needs as indicated by 
health, including, maternal and child health, nutrition and access to safe drinking water, sanitation 
and, education, including educational achievement and literacy.  Overall, the levels of social well-
being in Lao PDR tend to be low, in absolute terms and in comparison with other countries.   
 
5.6.1 Health and disease conditions within the project area:  
 
Based on the information gathered from villagers’ interview regarding the health and disease 
conditions during the last three years within the affected area of the project, the result shows that 
there is no any dangerous disease broken-out within the project area except for 
Malaria 
which 
seen as very familiar with the Lao local people particularly who live in the remote areas.   
However, it needs to be closely and carefully monitored in order to avoid such disease. 
 
5.6.2 Education: 
 
 
In terms of educational achievement and literacy, the deficiencies in educational achievement are 
reflected in literacy rates for adults over 15 years of age.  The national average of 60% compares 
poorly with a rate of 83% in the East Asian region (World Bank, 2000).  More significant are the 
variations in educational achievement across geographic regions in Lao PDR, in urban and rural 
areas and between sexes that indicate systemic problems regarding access to education in Lao 
PDR.  The literacy rates among ethnic minority groups, for both men and women, are 
substantially lower than for ethnic Lao and other lowland groups.  
 
Educational conditions within the Project area (affected villages), based on the on-site interview 
of Villages Chief, the results in the table 5 below shows that the educational levels of the villagers 
within the affected villages are 100% (between 15 years old to 45 years old) are   literacy 
achievement and in primary level.

5.6.3  Labour Force:   
 
Based on 2000 census data (NSC, 2000), the Lao labour force
1
includes 69.5% of men and 71.1% 
of women.  The proportion of employed men and women in rural areas is 15-50% higher than in 
urban areas.  Only 1.7% of the population is unemployed.  Unemployment rates in rural areas are 
2-4 times lower than in urban areas in the same province. 
 
Within the Project area (the affected villages), based on the results of survey, each village is 
available in terms of labour force for Project construction.  The table below is the summary of 
number of the main and secondary labours which are available for conducting of any activities 
during the Project construction within each affected village.

Infrastructures and Facilities within Project Area 
 
Infrastructures and/or facilities are seen as very important factor in boosting of socio-economic 
development.  Since the transmission line alignment runs parallel with the National Road 13 
South where most of the lands along the two sides of the road have been developed/developing 
and converted/converting into other used purposes.  Therefore, some infrastructures and facilities 
within the project area are available.  Table 7 below indicates the existing condition of 
infrastructures and facilities within the affected villages along the Transmission Line.

Energy Consumption and Existing Generation 
 
Rural households in Lao PDR use a combination of traditional, intermediate and modern energy 
resources and technologies.  In areas where there is no electricity, the main source of energy for 
cooking, heating and process activities is firewood.  According to FAO, 1999, the consumption of 
fuel-wood including wood for charcoal in Lao PDR in 1999 is averaged at 0.775m
3
per year per 
person.   
 
Page  23
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
23
Electricity:
 
Within the project area, all villages are provided electricity, while some remote 
villages which locate quite far away from these areas have no access to electricity yet.  
 
UXO Conditions  
 
UXO contamination is a very serious problem for the Lao PDR.  In addition to the human 
suffering and loss of life, UXO contamination blocks development in large areas of the country.  
Thus the National UXO Decontamination Programme addresses an important factor in fighting 
poverty.  
 
During a ten-year period (1964 to 1973), the Lao PDR experienced intense ground battles and 
aerial bombings.  It is estimated that over 500,000 bombing missions were launched over Lao 
PDR, and more than 2 million tons of ordnance was dropped during the 1964-1973 in Lao PDR, 
while about 30% of ordnance failed to explode, leaving large areas of the country littered with 
unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Severe UXO contamination still affects 15 provinces, Champasak 
is among them (NGPES, 2004).  The areas affected represent over 50% of all agricultural land 
(MAF/JICA, 2001).  
 
Three decades after the Indochina War, many people are still being killed or badly crippled from 
ordnance.  The litter of highly dangerous ordnance denies access to much needed land, deters the 
planting of crops and grazing of livestock, and hinders collecting fuel and water.  It also 
discourages movement between villages and slows transport and communication works, and 
generally undermines social and development activities.   
 
According to the information gathered from the UXO office as shown in the following UXO map, 
UXO scarcely still remain on some areas within the project area.  Paying particular attention to 
the mentioned portions of the Transmission Line, we investigated-by interviewing the appropriate 
villagers, according to the results from the interview of villagers within the Project Area 
especially along the transmission line.  It was found that the portions have no UXO contamination 
and also there is no  village has severe UXO contamination along the ROW, due to these areas 
have been developed and most lands have been converted into other used purposes.

Figure 1:  Map shows the Area of UXO Impact
 
Resettlement Impacts 
 
It is anticipated that the project will generate only very minor social and environmental impacts. 
The forestry and wildlife resources along the alignment ROW have largely been removed, due to 
past and recent logging as well as clearing for agricultural activities, and in particular the practice 
of shifting (slash and burn) cultivation.  The transmission line route has been chosen to avoid 
villages, the environmentally sensitive areas and important view-scape areas such as NBCAs, 
Protection Forest, place of high recreational value and religious and cultural/heritage sites. The 
selected route passed mainly through rice paddy fields and degraded forests. 
 
Project Area
Page  25
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
25
As mentioned earlier, the project covers only 8 villages within one district; namely Khong district, 
Champasak Province.  According to the field survey conducted by the team survey, we see that 
among 8 villages within the project areas, the total population is 10,728 people with 5,713 female 
and total of 2,016 families of 1,973 households.  
 
Compensation for temporary land occupation (including rental cost land as well as crop damages 
etc..,) all of data
 
is considered based on field work observation, and the unit costs which were 
based on previous similar projects carried out within the same province or district. Because the 
construction work will be conducted during the dry season and well after harvesting period, it is 
anticipated that the costs for temporary land would be minimal. Under EDL
’s contract for the 
construction of the transmission line, it stipulates that access roads to construction sites shall 
utilize the existing roads or tracks. If new access roads are constructed on either private or public 
land written approval from EDL must be obtained. 
 
The affected properties along the ROW include Rice Paddy Land 
(
2,120 m
2
permanently loss
), 
and Non-Rice Paddy Land (consists of Dry Dipterocarp and Unstock forest and Mix Deciduous 
forests  -
permanently 
 
and temporarily loss)
 for which they will be compensated.  
 
Only 356 m
2
of unstocked forests, 2,120 m
2
of paddy land, 2,988 m
2
of  dry dipterocarp forests,  
and 1,280 m
2
of mix deciduous forests would be permanently occupied by the towers. They will 
be no compensation for common land that use by government.  
 
A
total of 5,200 trees (natural trees) of various sizes (
 
10 cm of diameter) 
will be removed. 
These trees are including inside holed tree and approximately 110 ha of lands will be temporary 
occupied during construction period.  According to forestry law, trees along the line will be 
ownership of the government which EDL will make a request letter to government for survey and 
make a tree list which including tree type and volume.  
 
However, about 250 of these trees with diameter at breast height equal to 20 cm is in the area of 
the villagers but villagers could request government for using right for those trees.  
The above mentioned properties represent only a very small portion of the overall Village Used 
Forests areas (Non- rice paddy land) in the vicinity of the transmission line Row. Therefore the 
villagers are not gravely affected. Forest clearing along the ROW, may have some negative 
impact due to loss of trees or habitat, but it will increase the grazing areas of the villages, hence 
increasing livestock production potential for the villagers. 
 
Total area of lands and land use types, which will be permanently affected are shown in the table 
8

Legal Frameworks for Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
 
The following legislation now in force and supporting regulations (promulgated or in draft) are 
relevant to developing the resettlement policy framework or the resettlement action plan for the 
Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project, which will ensure that 
impacts of land acquisition and resettlement for the project will be adequately addressed during 
project planning and implementation.  
 
Laws 
 
7.1. Electricity Law (2008) 
 
Requires that Project proponent (EDL) is responsible for ensuring that environment is protected, and 
that residents are compensated in cash or in kind for lost property, diminished living conditions, 
relocation and resettlement. 
 
7.1.2 The Land Law (2003) 
 
Stipulates that in case of the public infrastructure development projects cause damage to the trees, 
crops or buildings of the private owner, the land and structure owners have the right to be 
compensated for the damage  
 
7.1.3 The Forestry Law (2007) 
 
States that forest land can be converted to other uses when necessary and if in the public interest, 
and subject to approval from responsible authorities. An individual or organization given 
permission to convert forest to another use is responsible for payment of a conversion fee, land 
reclamation and tree planting.   
 
Regulation and Decree 
 
7.2.1 Environmental Management Standard 
 
In addition to above laws, Department of Electricity, Ministry of Energy and Mines also issued 
Environmental Management Standard Documents
,
which provide more details guidance on how 
Page  27
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
27
to prepare power sector projects, which requires the project owner to prepare IEE to be approved 
by Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) and WREA. 
 
7.2.2 Prime Minister Decree No192 on Resettlement and Compensation (2005) 
 
The decree which was adopted in 2005 becomes an important instrument in guiding resettlement 
and land acquisition activities in Lao PDR at the present time and in the future. The key 
compensation and resettlement principles of this decree are listed below, which are in general 
agreement with the requirements of ADB and the World Bank. 
 
·
Project Affected Persons will be provided compensation for their lost assets affected in 
full or in part, at full replacement cost. 
·
In case of compensation for the affected to type of land (agriculture, residential or 
commercial) will be through provision of “land to land” arrangement of equivalent size 
or productivity and at the location acceptable to the Affected Persons. If the land not 
available, cash compensation at full replacement cost is applied. 
·
If the house or structure is partially being affected by the project but the remaining 
structure is rendered unviable or area less than the minimum house size. Affected 
Persons will be entitled to compensation. 
·
In case of the Affected Persons affected by partial loss of structure and remaining still 
viable. The assistance in a form of cash or material to restore the structure is applied. 
·
In case of the temporary affected by the projects, there will be fully compensated of the 
net loss of income. If the temporary use (affected) of the assets less than 6 months there 
will be compensated of 10% of the replacement cost of the affected assets. But if more 
than 6 months compensation should be negotiated with the owner of the assets. 
·
In case of the Persons have leased the house, structure or the form. Compensation 
equivalent of 3 months rental allowance if applied. There will be also assisted in 
finding the alternatives for rental accommodation. 
·
The affected persons without any legal title or ownership right to affected land or assets 
they occupy should be compensated and provide assistance to ensure they are not 
worse-off due to project. 
·
All previous claims and unresolved issues related to tenure status and ownership of 
land and other assets on each sub-project or components will be resolved before land 
acquisition. 
·
Resettlement process should be carry out in a participatory manner following the 
General guidelines for Public Involvement. 
 
World Bank Policies and Safeguards 
World Bank Operational Policies 
 
Relevant World Bank Safeguard Policies, include: 
 
+
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) 
 
These instruments outline the safeguards required of World Bank funded projects to ensure that 
impoverishment risks due to involuntary resettlement are addresses and minimized. The policy 
has the objectives to: 
·
Avoid resettlement where possible, and otherwise minimized through alternative project 
designs 
·
Resettlement should be conceived and executed as a sustainable development program 
Page  28
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
28
·
Affected people should be meaningfully consulted, and be facilitated to participate in 
planning and implementing resettlement plans 
·
Displaced people should be assisted to improve, or at least restore their livelihoods and 
standards of living 
Comparison of Lao PDR Law and World Bank Social Safeguard Policies 
 
The 2005 changes to GoL legislation related to compensation and resettlement in development 
represents a significant improvement in the rights of citizens when their livelihoods, possessions 
and society are affected by development projects. Both Lao PDR law and World Bank policies 
entitle affected people to compensation for land and non-land assets at replacement cost, and for 
livelihood restoration support. Lao legislation defines such livelihood restoration measures as 
being applicable only to severely affected people, defined as those with more than 20 percent of 
their income generating assets affected, whilst World Bank policy does not differentiate. Decree 
192/PM (Article 6) also entitles all affected people to economic rehabilitation assistance to ensure 
they are not made worse off due to the Project. The legal framework does therefore provide the 
potential for parity with WB social safeguards on resettlement. 
 
Criteria and Eligibility for Compensation 
 
The compensation and rehabilitation will be provided for all displaced persons under the  
following conditions: 
 
(i) 
if their land area or income source will be removed due to land acquisition of the 
project;  
(ii) 
if their houses (or residential plots) will be demolished or partly damaged due to the 
land acquisition; 
(iii) 
if their other properties (crops, trees, and other facilities) or access to these properties   
will be removed or damaged due to land acquisition or construction of the project. 
 
Compensation Standards  
 
Based on the above laws, regulations, and compensation principles, and based on successful 
implementation experience of previous projects, a set of compensation standards and valuation 
methods have been developed for the proposed Project as follows:  
 
Permanent Land Acquisition 
 
Given the different yield of paddy and market price in different towns and provinces, the actual 
compensation rate will vary from province to province. For example, in some paddy fields near 
the town, with good irrigation, crops could be harvested twice a year. As a result, the annual yield 
and output value of such paddy land will be much more than those areas with only one time 
harvest each year.  
 
For acquired scrub land and garden land, the compensation rate will be set at one third of 
compensation rate for paddy land.

Based on the previous project experience, such compensation was well received among affected 
people. With limited land loss and adequate compensation, no significant negative impacts are 
expected.  
 
The methods used to estimate indicative compensation costs for this project were broadly applied 
in other similar previous power projects and have been satisfactory for both sides (project owner 
and affected villagers).  However, for this project, the methods and rates will need to be refined 
closer to actual period of compensation and especially when it is clearly understood what type of 
compensation package, the affected Persons (APs) want and what is actually available.   
 
According to the other similar previous projects, the compensation cost especially for the lost of 
land including seasonal and irrigated rice paddy field, swidden/cultivation areas and other 
agricultural land was estimated based on the total of average productive value of land in the past 
ten years and the actual area of the land.  Cash compensation will be normally considered when 
the affected land and assets are relatively small proportion of the APs livelihood and a suitable or 
equivalent alternative asset is not available. 
 
The formulas below
 were used for the calculation of 
Permanent loss and Temporary loss
 of land 
in other similar previous EDL power projects. They were specifically used in the compensation of 
the rice paddy field and other farmland or garden which have been satisfactory for both sides 
(project owner and affected villagers). 
 
However, the actual methodology for compensation estimate needs to be agreed upon and 
finalized by PEMC in consultation with the concerned local authorities and villagers as well as 
PAPs and it will be set-up in a final compensation agreement, well before the construction is 
taking place. The actual final cost for compensation varies from place to place and from district to 
district   
 
For permanent land acquisition, different compensation will be paid based on different types of 
land areas that EDL is acquired. It is agreed that for productive farmland, mainly paddy land, the 
basic compensation will be 10 times of annual output value for lost farmland. Below is principle 
detailed formulae of estimating the unit compensation rate for permanent compensation cost.

Temporary Land Occupation 
 
In addition to the income losses from permanent land acquisition, there will be income losses 
from temporary land occupation or disturbances during project construction. For such losses, 
compensation of lost crops at replacement value and cost of restoring land into original conditions 
will be paid by the project owner. Depending on length of such occupation, most of impacts will 
be limited to one crop loss, but for some cases, such occupation might take up more than one year 
with multiple crop losses. The compensation will be based on average yield and market price of 
lost crops.  Efforts will be made by the project owner to minimize the impacts of temporary land 
occupation by timing the construction after planting season. Under EDL
’s construction contract 
requirement for temporary land occupation such as “access road” is to use existing or developing 
existing track, rather than construction of new one. This is to minimize the impact. 
Refer to 
section 8.6 for unit cost details 
 
Structures and Assets 
 
In Lao PDR there are no unified compensation standards for lost structures and assets. Based on 
relevant laws and regulations, the basic compensation principle is to provide compensation at 
replacement value, which will include (i) cash for lost structures sufficient to replace materials and 
labor to build replacement structures to an equivalent size and standard; (ii) housing plot to build the 
replacement structure; and (iii) allowance for the expense of relocation and lost of income during 
transfer.   
 
For transmission line project, since affected houses are only required to move short distance from the 
right of way, based on experience of EDL from the previous Project, most affected houses with 
small size and traditional wood structure were simply moved by the villagers to nearby locations. In 
this case, the project owner will pay all related cost for such moving event after consultation with 
affected people and villages. There is only potential impact to two huts along the line of the 
project. These huts are only temporary building and could be move out by just carry. Agreement 
will be made with the farmers to settle this. Budget for this moving is estimated. 
 
Economic Trees and Cash Crops 
 
In terms of planted fruit trees and industrial trees, or natural trees the following methods have 
been broadly applied as a base for  tree compensation calculation for  similar previous projects. 
 
However for this project tree compensation unit cost was based on similar previous project 
carried out within Champasak province. Following principle is apply to tree compensation 
estimate.  
 
+
For Planted Industry Trees:
Compensation unit Cost
1.  Paddy land  = 80 kip/m
2
2.  Garden land = 60 kip/m
2
3. Swidden =50 
kip/m
2
4.  Non productive/unused land =30 kip/m
2
Note:
the unit cost above were based on previous similar project in Champasak and Saravan Province 
projects 
 
Page  31
RAP for Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230kV Transmission Line 
 
31
Compensation Cost = [Land Clearing Cost + Cost of Seedling] + [(Maintenance Cost) * 
(Year of Maintenance)] 
+
For Planted Fruit Trees:
Compensation Cost = [Land Clearing Cost + Cost of Seedling] + [(Maintenance Cost) * 
(Year of Maintenance)] + [(Average Harvesting Value/year) * 
(Years of Harvesting)] 
Note:  
Years of Harvesting for Fruit Trees may range from 1 to 7 years depending on Fruit Tree Species. 
 
The Regulation of Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry No. 0196/MAF.2000, dated 15 August 
2000, Article 23 identified the formula for compensation for the loss of plantation tree as follow: 
 
Cost of Tree Plantation Farm = Land Use Cost + Land Development Cost + Cost of 
Existing Planted Tree + Cost of Agricultural Produces (if any) 
In order to ensure that the compensation rates for economic trees are adequate for providing 
replacement value and restoring income and livelihood for the affected people, during 
resettlement preparation for individual subprojects, each province will develop a detail list of 
compensation rates for various trees, which will be based on agreed formula and current yield, 
and market prices of different crops. Compensation rate for this RAP is applied existing projects 
practice in the area that have been used. However, this compensation rate will be consult and 
agree with Project Environment and Management Committee (PEMC) upon is set up. Currently, 
EDL is make a request to Champasack authority for set up this PEMC.  
 
Other Compensation and Assistance 
 
For any loss of infrastructure facilities and community services, such as roads, bridges, schools, 
electricity, water, and so on, EDL will provide in-kind compensation by rebuilding these facilities 
to their original status. Such replacement will be completed prior to the construction of 
transmission projects, so that the daily life of concerned communities will not be affected. 
 
There are no any houses will be affected by this project except two huts in rice fields will be affected 
as maintain before.  
 
There is no any cemetery along the right of way of this project. 
 
Unit Compensation Cost 
 
All displaced persons, regardless of their legal status, will be provided compensation and 
rehabilitation based on the policies adopted by EDL. Lack of legal paper of their customary rights 
of occupancy certificates shall not be an obstacle for obtaining compensation for them. It should 
also cover resettlement resulting from complementary activities that are not part of the Bank-
assisted investment projects, but are necessary to achieve its objectives as set forth in the project 
documents. The policy applies to all displaced persons regardless of the total number affected or 
the severity of impact. Particular attention is to be paid to the needs of vulnerable groups among 
those displaced, especially those below the poverty line, the elderly, women and children, 
indigenous groups and ethnic minorities.

Institutional Arrangement  
 
For the Ban Hat to Lao-Cambodia border 230 kV Transmission Line Project, there will be three  
sections/organisation of various institutions involved in the process of resettlement planning and 
implementation. The first organization is the Project Environmental Management Committee 
(PEMC), which consists of officials from relevant key provincial departments and relevant districts.  
The second is the Environmental Management Office (EMO) of the EDL head quarter which will be 
responsible for overall planning and implementation of environmental management and resettlement 
for the project.  
 
The third organization is Environmental Management Unit (EMU) and Project Management Office 
(PMO) of EDL branch offices in Champasak province, which will be responsible for actual project 
implementation and coordination with local authorities as well as the affected households. 
 
These three organizations will form the institutional network to ensure smooth implementation of 
resettlement activities in according to both resettlement policy framework and resettlement action 
plan approved by the World Bank. Refer to diagram and table below for institutional organizational 
structure and the roles and responsibilities of each unit  
 
Project Environmental Management Committee (PEMC) 
 
Project Environmental Management Committee (PEMC) will be established in the Champasak 
Province to decide compensation conditions, and monitoring social and environmental aspects for 
the project. The PEMC will be consisted of at least 10 persons who are representatives from the 
different authorities concerned such as Provincial EDL Branches of Champasak, Provincial 
WREO, Provincial Energy and Mines Department, Provincial Land Office, Provincial Agriculture 
and Forestry Department (Provincial Forestry Section), Provincial and District Cabinets and other 
related officials. The Committee will have subcommittees such as Environmental management 
Committee, Forest Clearing Committee, Grievance Committee and Compensation Committee. 
PEMC will not only be responsible for the environmental monitoring but assuming the 
compensation role, it will be negotiating with APs and local authorities to determine the final 
compensation costs for all affected assets.

Lao regulations, to monitor and supervise resettlement implementation by the PEMC and provincial 
EMU in order to ensure that the resettlement is complied with this Resettlement Policy Frameworks 
and RAP. In addition, the EMO is also responsible for conducting internal resettlement monitoring 
and preparing resettlement progress report, which will be submitted to DOE, WREA and the Bank and 
well as EDL management each quarter during the project implementation period 
 
Environmental Management Unit (EMU) in Provincial EDL Branch Office 
 
The actual implementation of the project will be managed by Provincial EDL Branch Office. The 
EMU which will be established in the branch office for project monitoring and coordinating 
purposes. At least one official will be assigned for the EMU. The EMU will be responsible for

persons. Act as the first contact on the ground directly for the EMO and indirectly for the PEMC. 
Receive all complaints and grievances arise in the course of the implementation of the EMP and the 
RAP. 
 
Implementation Process 
 
The following steps will be taken in order to ensure the resettlement policy framework is being 
complied. 
 
Detailed Site Survey 
 
Although the project will generate only minor impacts according to the result of the site investigation 
during the IEE study, further detailed site survey is required before starting project construction. 
Contractors for the project under the supervision and guidance of the environmental management 
committee will conduct detailed site survey to identify objects to be compensated and to collect 
detailed data concerning the loss of assets and compensation cost, in collaboration with local 
authorities.  
 
Summary of field data of affected households is given in (Annex 1). Unless the detailed alignment is 
altered the affected household data given will be the accurate base line information for compensation  
 
Review of Resettlement Action Plan 
 
Based on the data and information collected during the detailed site survey, this RAP will be 
reviewed. Following the resettlement policy framework and consultation between EDL and PEMC, 
a
data sheet needs to be prepared which include three basic sections (i) the scope of impacts (name 
and quantities of affected assets) (ii) detailed compensation rates and rehabilitation measures for 
affected assets, and (iii) total amount to pay to the affected people. 
 
The detail of impacted assets and cost of compensation is shown in the table 3.13

local governments, affected villages and individuals. The comments and feedback from local 
governments and affected people will be reviewed by EDL management and considered in the RAP 
finalization. 
 
Disclosure of the RAP policy to the Affected People  
 
After finalization of the RAP or datasheet with detailed compensation standards and rehabilitation 
measures, those documents will be disclosed to the affected people and villages. The public 
disclosure of RAP could be carried out by holding public meeting, putting up notice in the affected 
villages, or distributing resettlement information booklet to the affected people.  
 
This draft RAP will be translated in to Lao language and opened in public for further public 
consultation as soon as the government and the Bank have approved the draft documents. The 
tentative schedule of disclosure of RAP is as follows: 
 
y
EDL will translate the draft RAP into Lao Language.  
y
EDL send the draft RAP to Provincial and District offices. 
y
The draft RAP will be displayed at EDL, Provincial and District offices for 15 days. If 
EDL holds workshops instead of displaying the draft RAP, Public disclosure period 
will be shorten. 
y
If there are no comments, the draft RAP will be submitted to WREA for approval. If 
there are some comments, the draft RAP will be reviewed. 
y
WREA will issue an IEE certificate of compliance.  
y
EDL will implement the RAP 
y
Review and Finalization of RAP 
y
Disclosure of Revised RAP 
 
Since the impacts by this project are not significant, these procedures will take about two months 
after the approval of draft RAP by the World Bank. 
 
Signing of Compensation Contract and Payment of Compensation to the 
Affected People  
 
The final step of resettlement implementation is to sign compensation contract and delivery 
payment to the affected people, which should be completed prior to project implementation. 
However, if house relocation and substantial land loss taking place, such payment need to be 
completed at least three months prior to construction, which will give the affected people 
reasonable time to complete new houses and move their belongings. During the implementation, 
EDL will pay such amount directly to each affected household in the presence of local government 
representatives. 
 
Reporting and Approval 
 
During the feasibility study of the Project, the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was 
conducted. This RAP is prepared as a part of the study. Before start of construction work, detailed 
survey will be conducted in collaboration with local authorities under the supervision of the Project 
Environmental Management Committee (PEMC), and then consultations will be conducted 
between the committee and project-affected people. EDL branch office will prepare all datasheet 
Page  37
RAP for Ban Hat-Lao-Cambodia Border 230 kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
37
and records of consultations with project-affected people. EMU of EDL headquarter will 
summarize all the information to review this RAP and it will be sent to WB for approval. 
 
Resettlement Funding, Cost Estimate, Flow of Funds and 
Contingencies 
 
The cost of potential land acquisition and resettlement will be included in the total project cost for 
the transmission project. EDL will be sure sufficient funding is available to cover all resettlement 
related cost for the Project. 
 
During project implementation, detailed cost estimate of the compensation and resettlement will be 
developed after detailed survey. 
 
The total resettlement budget submitted by EDL branch office will be reviewed and approved by 
EDL Headquarter. After receiving the letter of approval from EDL headquarter, EDL branch office 
will make funds available for implementing land acquisition and resettlement.  
 
Based on the survey during the IEE study and subsequent survey in September 2010, there are, no 
people will be resettled, no structural assets, no spiritual or cultural property will be affected. 
 
Compensation for permanent land losses are detailed in table 10; compensation for trees (fruit and 
industrial trees) and “village forest” are summarized and detailed in table 11; compensation for 
temporary land occupation are estimated based on site observations as well as data from previous 
similar project refers to table 12 showed for details.

The temporary land areas shown (include access roads/tracks, machinery yards and camping areas) were estimated 
based on site observation of availability of existing tracks as well as from previous similar projects within the project 
proximity. Unit cost used for the estimate of temporary land of various types (shown above in (iii) For temporary loss 
of land
)
were obtained from previous similar projects. 
 
During the detailed survey prior to the construction work, however, additional compensation might 
be identified and in order to cover for such uncertainty, the provision of budgetary contingency is 
necessary 
 
Compensation in the form of “Community Assistance” is also provided as part of the overall budget 
provision. It is to meet various community expenses incurred directly or indirectly as a result of 
project implementation. The estimated amount was calculated based on our consultation with 
relevant authorities, affected villagers and previous similar projects carried out within Champasak 
Province. The typical form of community assistance ranges from monitory contribution for 
relocation of spiritual forest to clearing of village forest. 
 
Similarly estimate for rehabilitation work was also calculated based on consultation with affected 
villagers, and an on site assessment or projection of required rehabilitation work. The unit cost was 
based on previous similar work, carried out with the same district or province. 
 
Estimation for consultation workshop is also provided. It is necessary that the workshop will take 
place in Champasak province, and the affected village representatives and relevant authorities will 
attend. The findings from the study will be presented. The discussions and comment from the 
workshop will be reflected in and thus finalized the RAP document.   
 
In addition to compensation funding requirement as shown in the tables below, the estimate for 
monitoring activities of various monitoring bodies are also

Consultations with, and participation of, and disclosure in planning, 
implementation 
 
During the site investigation for the IEE study, consultations were organized with affected persons 
and village representatives. 
 
Information was collected in datasheet in each affected village and consulted with some of 
villagers. Since the impacts and affected land by the Project will be minimal, all of participants 
basically agreed to the implementation of the Project with few comments. They expressed their 
willingness to participate in the construction work of the Project as labors to get income from the 
Project. Only in some villages, participants mentioned that proper compensation for affected lands 
should be ensured. Most villages that were not connected to main power line expressed their desires 
to have electricity for their villages. 
 
This RAP will be translated in to Lao language and opened in public for further public consultation 
as soon as the government and the Bank have approved the draft documents. 
The tentative schedule of disclosure of RAP is as follows: 
 
y
EDL will translate the draft RAP into Lao Language.   
y
EDL send the draft RAP to Provincial and District offices. 
y
The draft RAP will be displayed at EDL, Provincial and District offices for 15 
days. If EDL holds workshops in WREA of displaying the draft RAP, Public 
disclosure period will be shorten. 
y
If there are no comments, the draft RAP will be submitted to WREA for 
approval. If there are some comments, the draft RAP will be reviewed. 
y
WREA will issue an IEE certificate of compliance.  
y
EDL will implement the RAP. 
y
Review and Finalization of RAP. 
y
Disclosure of Revised RAP. 
 
Since the impacts by this project are not significant, these procedures will take about two months 
after the approval of draft RAP by the World Bank. 
 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
 
The affected people will be given many opportunities to review the survey results and 
compensation policies during the process of resettlement planning and implementation. However, 
during implementation, various issues might be encountered by the affected people. In order to 
resolve these concerns effectively and timely, a grievance redress mechanism shall be set up. The 
affected people will be notified about such mechanism before the resettlement implementation. 
 
If a person is not satisfied with his or her compensation or rehabilitation measure, he could voice 
his complaint to the affected village head or directly to the EMO. The village head or the EMO will 
give him an answer within two weeks. If he still does not agree with the solution, he could appeal 
directly to EMU of EDL headquarter, who will give him a reply within two weeks. If he still does 
not agree with the decision, he could appeal to the PEMC where a special grievance committee will 
be established to address these issues. The Grievance Committee will make a final decision within 
two weeks. If he still does not agree with the decision, he could go the court as a last option.

Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangement 
 
Following the requirements of the World Bank, during the project implementation, both internal 
and external resettlement monitoring and evaluation exercises will be carried out in order to 
monitor resettlement implementation and ensure all affected people are compensated adequately 
and their income and livelihood are restored after resettlement and rehabilitation. 
 
Internal Monitoring 
 
The following periodic environmental monitoring will be carried out by EMU, EMO and PEMC 
periodically. During the monitoring, progress of resettlement implementation and compensation for 
affected people will be monitored and evaluated. 
 
Monthly
 monitoring: EDL
’s EMU will send their staff to the project site once a month to consult with 
the EMO and PEMC, participate in field work and conduct interview with the project affected 
villagers. 
 
Three monthly
 monitoring: A joint monitoring and evaluation between EDL’s EMU and Social and 
Environmental Unit (SEU) of Department of Electricity (DOE) of Ministry of Energy and Mines 
(MIH) will be conducted at the project site once in three months. The purpose of the monitoring is to 
work with the EMO and PEMC to review the progress of EMP work, to adjust the EMP effective and 
to consult with village representatives and project affected villagers. 
 
Six monthly
 monitoring: A joint monitoring and evaluation of Provincial WREO, DOE, EDL will be 
conducted once in six months. The purpose of the monitoring is to review the entire recommendation 
made by the monthly and three month monitoring and evaluation reports, to consult with the EMO and 
PEMC, to consult with the project affected villagers and to consider and change the EMP.  
 
External (Independent) Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
Base on the WREA’s guidelines for independent review (or third party review) and the 
requirements of the World Bank, external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by an 
independent third party. EDL will select an independent institution, which consists of social 
specialists, with approval of the Bank. The selected institution should have extensive experience in 
similar activities. It may be from academic institution and/or non-governmental organization (NGO). 
The main objective is by independently monitoring and evaluating the resettlement implementation, to 
see whether the objective of resettlement is achieved; and to provide independent assessment on 
resettlement implementation and restoration of livelihood for the affected people.  
 
The scope of monitoring and evaluation includes the implementation progress, resettlement 
policies, delivery of compensation and replacement land, changes of income and livelihood among 
affected people, consultation and participation and development of local communities. The method 
of resettlement monitoring and evaluation will be based on a combination of sample household survey 
and rapid appraisal in the field.  
 
Post Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
Six months to one year after the end of resettlement activities, the Independent Monitoring Body 
shall conduct an evaluation study of severely affected APs and the vulnerable groups among the 
affected population to determine whether or not the objectives of the RP in terms of restoration of 
incomes and living standards have been achieved. The methodology for the evaluation study will be 
based on the follow up socio-economic survey to determine the impact of the Project on AP income 
Page  44
RAP for Ban Hat-Lao-Cambodia Border 230 kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
44
levels and living standards of those severely affected by the Project.  Survey data at post evaluation 
stage will be compared with the baseline survey at the RAP preparation stage.  The Post 
Implementation Evaluation Study may propose additional assistance to severely affected persons if 
resettlement measures were not adequate and may also provide recommendations for future 
resettlement planning.   
 
Detail Sample Terms of Reference for an External Monitoring Consultant is proposed in the annex 
1.
Page  45
RAP for Ban Hat-Lao-Cambodia Border 230 kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
45
Annex 1 
–
Sample Terms of Reference for an External Monitoring Consultant 
The External Monitoring Consultant (EMC) hired by project owner (EDL), will evaluate the 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) implementation. It will assess whether the activities in the 
resettlement plan were carried out according to the RAP approved by the WREA The evaluation 
will cover but not be limited to: (i) compliance with resettlement compensation policies; (ii) 
adequacy of the organizational mechanism for implementing the RP; and (iii) the handling of 
complaints and grievances. The EMC will see to it that the project affected families (PAFs): (a) 
have been financially compensated for or provided with replacement lands; (b) have re-established 
their structures; and (c) were able to restore their incomes to pre-project levels. It will also evaluate 
whether all compensation and resettlement activities have been satisfactorily completed and 
rehabilitation measures put in place, and that the construction areas are free of all encumbrances 
and turned back to original conditions before the start of construction activities. The EMC will 
submit an External Monitoring and Evaluation report directly to the WREA. 
 
In order to carry out these duties, the selected EMA will be provided with the following by EDL: 
 
·
The Project Resettlement Framework (RF) 
·
Resettlement Plans (RPs) for the sub-project 
·
Completed Census and Inventory of Lost Assets/Socio-Economic Survey forms for each PAF 
·
A
copy of the National  policy on Involuntary Resettlement  
·
Any other project documents necessary to carry out the Terms of Reference. 
 
(a) 
Scope of Activities 
 
Utilizing the information provided as above, the selected EMC will design its own approach to 
conduct the evaluation. Basically, the scope of activities of the EMC will cover the following: 
 
(i) 
Preparation of Evaluation Questionnaires. Two sets of questionnaires will be 
developed for the evaluation of the RAP; one for a representative sample of PAFs, the other 
for the organization responsible for the implementation of the RP. 
(ii) 
Survey of PAFs and Clarifications with
.
From the list
 
of PAFs, the EMA will 
select and establish representative samples that will provide information on the adequacy of 
entitlements, the dates and the manner in which they were compensated as well as 
compliance to project policies. The information obtained from PAFs will be cross-checked 
with project management and other offices involved in the implementation of the RAP.
 
(iii) 
Evaluation of Delivery and Impacts on Entitlements. Based on information from 
PAFs, the EMA will identify the categories of impacts and evaluate the quality and 
timeliness of delivering entitlements (compensation and rehabilitation measures) for each 
category of impact, how entitlements were used and their impacts and adequacy to meet the 
objectives of the RAP. Entitlements and other mitigation measures to be evaluated shall 
include but not limited to: 
a. 
Entitlements as specified in the RP 
b. 
Income restoration measures 
c. 
Development and implementation of any special provisions (if appropriate). 
 
The quality and timeliness of delivery and sufficiency of entitlements shall be verified by 
the EMA from independent sources like the neighbors of PAFs and village leaders. The 
EMA will use appropriate investigative and analytical techniques in assessing the post-
project socio-economic conditions of the PAFs in relation to the baseline socio-economic 
data on income and living standards.  
Page  46
RAP for Ban Hat-Lao-Cambodia Border 230 kV Transmission Line Project. 
 
46
(iv) 
Evaluation of Consultation and Grievance Procedures. The EMC will identify, 
quantify and qualify the types of conflicts and grievances reported and resolved, and the 
consultation and participation procedures utilized. 
(v) 
Declaration of Successful Implementation. The EMC will provide a summation of 
whether impact mitigation was implemented in accordance with the project policies 
established in the RP. 
(vi) 
Issues and Follow-Up Actions. The EMC will provide descriptions of any 
outstanding future issues that are required to bring the project impact mitigation into 
compliance with National Policies. Likewise, it will describe further mitigation measures 
needed to meet the needs of any PAF perceiving itself to be worse off as a result of 
resettlement or land acquisition. 
(vii) 
Lessons Learned. The EMC will outline lessons learned from the evaluation that 
might be useful in developing future resettlement policies in Lao PDR. 
 
(b) Reporting
