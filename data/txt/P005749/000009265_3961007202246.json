The objectives will be realized through\n            improving maintenance of rural roads, particularly unpaved\n            ones; decentralizing road management responsibilities to\n            local governments, without developing new entities;\n            establishing a link between budgets and road classification;\n            strengthening budgetary disciplines, transparency and\n            accountability; targeting specific road maintenance tasks\n            for execution by contract to improve efficiency and to\n            create new development opportunities for a dynamic private\n            sector; and finally minimizing life-cycle costs by making\n            optimum use of gravel road techniques. The project includes:\n            1) the preparation and initial implementation of an\n            institutional reform program; 2) the periodic rehabilitation\n            of approximately 300 km of gravel roads in a pilot program\n            to be carried out by contract in ten Governorates; and 3)\n            the upgrading of about 715 km of priority rural roads to\n            appropriate standards."}, "docdt": "1995-01-03T00:00:00Z"}
