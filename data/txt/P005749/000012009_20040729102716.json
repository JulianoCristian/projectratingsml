The lessons indicate\n            that task teams should make an effort to use, if not the\n            tool itself, the logic imposed by the project framework\n            matrix. The Project focused on priority objectives that were\n            clearly valued by the client. The project's simplicity\n            paid off. This allowed the Bank and the Implementing Agency\n            (IA) to focus on few, relevant components and reform areas\n            and ensure those could be systematically pursued. The Bank\n            would have benefited from more carefully listening to the\n            client on the issue of paving versus graveling of roads.\n            Clearly this component had no real buy from IA. The IA did\n            end up carrying out this component successfully and drew\n            useful lessons from it, but the pilot is unlikely to be\n            scaled up and mainstreamed. The risk of inadequate\n            commitment towards this technique and its mainstreaming was\n            brushed aside during the preparation or at least\n            insufficiently mitigated. On the issue of the length of the\n            project, the Bank demonstrated to be rather inflexible and\n            was proven wrong by the client which implemented the bulk of\n            the project within the four years it had anticipated. The\n            Bank insisted to follow predominant country's\n            standards, but would have benefited from a more flexible\n            approach. The objective of deconcentrating the function to\n            the Regional Councils (RCs) was doomed from the start, for\n            the reasons explained above. The lesson to be drawn from\n            this is that complex public sector management issues, such\n            as decentralization, take time and highest senior level\n            commitment to be carried out and cannot be pursued through a\n            project focused on physical construction and improvements,\n            and within a Ministry that has really no stake in this, and\n            would not draw benefits from, such reforms, possibly the\n            opposite. Decentralization and empowerment of local\n            authorities remain an important objective in Tunisia that\n            should be pursued through public reform projects, specific\n            and well targeted projects and implemented by the agencies\n            that can draw benefits and have incentives in pursuing such\n            reforms, with high level government commitment and with a\n            long time frame and implementation period. The project did\n            well to insist on the involvement of the private sector for\n            rural road works. This component made a big impact and it\n            has permanently changed the way works are undertaken in\n            rural roads in the country. The success of this component\n            should serve as example also to other transport sub-sector\n            and provide a best case scenario where the reluctance of the\n            IA to reduce public sector involvement initially was later\n            overcome by the positive effects of the private sector involvement."}, "docdt": "2003-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
