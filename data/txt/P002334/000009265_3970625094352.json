policies\n            and measures aimed at accelerating growth in production,\n            employment and strengthening public sector management.\n            Specifically, the Structural Adjustment Credit program\n            includes the following measures some of which have already\n            been taken. They include: (i) agricultural incentive reforms\n            to increase cereal production; (ii) steps to decontrol\n            agricultural input distribution, free up sector marketing\n            arrangements and increase groundnut producer prices; (iii)\n            industrial policy reforms; and (iv) implementation of a\n            two-year public investment program. The project further\n            involves: (v) acceleration of parapublic sector reforms,\n            including development of a coherent strategy for\n            restructuring and/or privatizing of most state-owned\n            enterprises; and (vi) measures to address the underlying\n            structural causes of financial disequilibrium. The ongoing\n            Technical Assistance Project for Economic and Financial\n            Management will assist in implementation of the program."}, "docdt": "1986-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
