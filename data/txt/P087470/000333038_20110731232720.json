Some lessons learned included: in terms of\n            design, it is important to assess carefully whether the\n            reform of a state pension provider is the right framework\n            for a partial tax administration reform or, perhaps, the two\n            reforms should follow one another. In the case of\n            Montenegro, the two reforms were implemented in parallel,\n            which caused slower implementation of both at times, but\n            resulted in well coordinated systems. Second, if a\n            particular subcomponent provides a technical instrument for\n            the rigorous analysis of a particular system (such as the\n            pension model in this project), it is worth devoting\n            resources to education of government agencies and officials\n            about the potential other uses of the technology applied. In\n            this case, for instance, the underlying methodology of the\n            pension model could be relatively easily extended so that\n            the model is applicable to projections concerning other\n            status-dependent social expenditures, too. Thus, if the main\n            objective supported by the instrument (structural pension\n            reform) exits the policy agenda, the investment itself would\n            face a smaller risk of becoming irrelevant. Third, a\n            stakeholder analysis of the participating institutions is\n            crucial in order to identify potential reasons for support\n            and resistance, the areas where cooperation is natural and\n            where it needs more attention from high level officials in a\n            position to resolve institutional problems. Fourth, it is\n            critical to have a clear results framework with specific,\n            monitorable indicators for which data can be gathered and\n            which can be monitored through the life of the project.\n            Discussions with the client as to what is monitorable, who\n            will collect data, when etc. should be conducted prior to\n            finalizing the documentation. Without a clear monitoring\n            framework, the successes of the project may go unrecorded,\n            or lack of progress may not be detected."}, "docdt": "2011-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
