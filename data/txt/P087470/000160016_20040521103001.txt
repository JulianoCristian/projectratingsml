A.       STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryand sector issues

         (a) Introduction

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)      -- now the union State of Serbia and Montenegro
(SAM) succeededto the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in
the World Bank inMay 2001. InitialBank Group support to SAMwas provided intwo stages:
first, a pre-membershipphase funded through a US$30 million Trust Fundfor FRY. The second
phase, outlined in a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS - Report 22090-YU, June 26, 2001),
provided a three year program of support for the Economic Reconstruction and Transition
Program (ERTP), to be financed with a US$540 million temporary and exceptional IDA
envelope. A TSS Update (Report 24476-YU, July 18,2002), described progress inthe first year
of implementation (FY02) and laid out plans for the FY03 program. A further TSS Update for
FY04, presented to the Board on March 16, 2004, describes progress during FY03, including
FRY'Sconstitutional transition to Serbia and Montenegro, and provides the strategic framework
for the final year (FY04) of the three year Bank Group assistance program. A full three year
participatory CAS covering FY05-07 will be developedjointly with the IFC and presented to the
Boardfor consideration inlate-2004.

         (b) Politicaland Socioeconomic Context

Political Outlook.       The past eighteen months have seen the introduction of the new
constitutional union State o f Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003. The new union is now
fully established and functioning.    Both Serbian and Montenegrin leaders have placed high
priority on seeking early accession to the European Union. Montenegro's ruling coalition
garnered a strong majority inthe 2002 republican elections. The economic reform program has
been somewhat hesitant, although positive progresscontinues to be made.

EconomicDevelopments. SAM's leadershipis stillgrapplingwith the legacyof a decade of
adverse externaland internalfactors. The centralization ofpoliticalpower at the federal level
during the 1990s weakened economic institutions, exacerbatedpoor public accountability, and
led to more government intervention in markets (e.g., with price and exchange controls). The
effects of poor economic management were compounded by international sanctions (1992-1996
and 1998-2000) which severely inhibitedtrade and investmentinthe country. By 2000, recorded
per capita GDP had fallen to about one half of its 1989 level. Foreign trade volumes also
declined sharply while inflation(including hyperinflationin 1993) was chronic.

SAM had accumulatedlarge domestic and externaldebt. The external debt was around 131
percent of GDP in 2000 (figures exclude Kosovo). Although cash deficits of the consolidated
government were kept low, this was achieved largely through unsustainable expenditure
compression, the accumulation of budgetary arrears, non-servicing o f public debt, and the
toleration of quasi-fiscal deficits. The real sector became largely inefficient due to the lack of
market-oriented ownership structures, the loss of markets, lack o f access to working capital,
delayed investment and maintenance, and repressive and complicated taxation and regulation.
This resulted ina decrease inreal earnings, with absolute poverty roughly doubling since 1990,


                                                 1

and a deterioration in social protection and health services, as available financing fell below
existingentitlement levels.

Progress in stabilizing the macroeconomic situation and structural reform has remained
positive. However, implementation remains the key challenge. Montenegro's consolidated
fiscal deficit was cut from about 8 percent of republican GDP in 2000 to 5.3 percent in 2003.
The renewal of transfers to cover federal union expenditures has placed new pressure on fiscal
accounts in 2003. Excluding this transfer, the underlying fiscal deficit for 2003 i s expected to
decrease further to about 3 percent o f GDP.

Montenegro enacted a new law on pension and disability insurance, a new labor law to increase
the flexibility o f the labor market, and a number of reforms focused on creating a more favorable
business environment.           In Montenegro's financial sector, priority areas of focus include:
completing the restructuring and privatization of the remaining state bank; resolving bad assets
carved-out of privatized banks; and withdrawing Government deposits from the commercial
banks.

Despite four years of growth, living standards remain low relative to historical standards
and popular expectations. In2003, recorded GDP was less than 60 percent of its 1990 level.
Absolute poverty remains a problem inboth republics.' InMontenegro, most estimates indicate
that GDP growth has been modest at less than2 percentper annumsince 2000, while the official
unemployment rate has remained highat over 20 percent (among the highest inthe region). Not
only is open unemployment a problem, households without working members make up one
quarter ofail poor, buta large share ofthe working age populationare also inactive or occupying
themselves with low productivity andlor occasional work. From an economy-wide perspective,
this represents output foregone and income lost. Moreover, the important goal of sharing the
benefits of growth more equitably among groups and regions proves increasingly elusive when
many citizens are trapped in long-term unemployment. A sustainable supply response does not
yet appear to have taken root.

Given these conditions, a viable social security system can play an important role in
smoothingthese volatilities for the vulnerable. However, both the policy and administrative
environment for developing a robust and viable social security system have beenin disarray and
carry a heavy legacy of the socialist systems.




  The Bank's recent Poverty Assessment found that by mid-2002, material poverty affected every tenth person in
both Serbia and Montenegro (defined as population with consumption below the country-specific absolute poverty
line). The report found that poorly educated individuals make up the majority o f SAM's poor and have the highest
poverty risk. Those with elementary education constitute about two-thirds o f all poor and are twice as likely to be
poor as secondary school graduates. Lower education attainment is the key background factor explaining the higher
incidence of poverty of some vulnerable groups, such as rural or jobless households. The report also found that
jobless households (i.e., families with working-age members in which no one works) have more than twice the
average poverty incidence, but households with gainfully employed members make up 75 percent of the poor.

         (c) Sector Issues

The government's strategy inthe area of pension administration is to have a more effective and
efficient pension system through changes in legislation, regulation, management practices,
operational procedures and better use of informationtechnology. This strategy is aimed at:

0     Stabilizing the pension systemthrough policy reforms andadministrative strengthening;
0     Improving the collection of social insurance contributions, taking better advantage of scale
      economies supported by effective IT solutions; and
0     Creating data linkages to monitor and evaluate operations and outcomes across social
      programs.

The current situation, which motivates this strategy is describedbelow.

Within the sector, there are serious economic and politicalconstraints to reform including
the fragile situation ofthe public finances, large competing expenditure needs, lack of developed
financial markets and regulation, and the need to provide minimumprotection to pensioners who
may not live to enjoy the eventual benefits from the transition but still expect the government to
honor their "social contract". Nonetheless, efforts to embark on systemic reform have gained
new urgency as it becomes even more obvious that fiscal sustainability of the pension system is
at best, precarious.

The pension system is under severe fiscal stress, due, in the short run, to an ineffective
administrative system, characterized by a loose and fragmented collection and compliance
system, and economic and demographic factors that affect its sustainability over the medium
term. An aging population and the erosion of the contribution base triggered by economic
stagnation and a growing shadow economy, have contributed to a decline in the system
dependency ratio to 1.3 workers per pensioner. The age dependency ratio (the ratio of the over-
65 year old population to the 15-65 year old population) grew to exceed 20 percent. Both
indicators are similar to those found inneighboring countries. However, with a replacement rate
of 69 percent, a low retirement age of 55 for women and 60 for men, wage indexation of
benefits, loose standards for disability eligibility, and overly generous benefits, the pension
system became unsustainable. By 2002, pension expenditure reached 13 percent of GDP.
Pension contributions and Budget transfers to the Pension Fund (PIO) were insufficient and the
pension deficit reached3.9 percent of GDP in2002.2

The administrative and institutional arrangements for managing the pension system
remainweak, with a host of issues that needto be urgentlydealt with, including; (i)                  fragmented
collection and reporting systems, with several agencies doing the same functions; (ii)                       weak
collection and compliance processes and procedures; (iii)           a lack of accurate data and weak data
management systems; (iv) very little coordination between the key agencies involved, including
the HealthFund, Pension Fund (PIO), Directorate for Public Revenues (DPR), and Ministryof
Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA); and (v) lack o f capacity to assess and analyze data, and


 Please see Annex 1for a more detailed discussion on the pension deficits. The pension contribution rate is 24 o f
gross salaries, split equally betweenemployees and employers.

draw policy implications. Underlyingthese issues, is the politics of the reform process - a shift
inpower betweenagencies, adownsizing/increasingofimportance ofcertainpostsandpositions,
andthe relatedunwillingnessto share informatioddataamong the different agencies.

The PIO's databases are outdated, lack proper integration and contain many errors.
Recent analysis has shown that 71 percent of employer records are missing their Tax (FIN)
number as the primary key, 13 percent of employee records are missing their JMB number (a
code to register people) and over 30 percent of self-employed records are missing their JMB
number. There are almost 30,000 cases where no returnof work and contributiondata has been
made since 2001. Almost 50 percent of these cases are 10 years old. The number of non-
compliant cases i s rising since 1999, and 5,000 (M4)3 cases remained outstanding during 2000-
2001.

It is possible to set up a pension payment record for a person who does not have a contribution
record - as the contribution record database does not interface with the payments processing
database. This is a serious control weakness and highlights the general lack of adequate controls
-bothelectronicandmanual-inthecurrentsystem.

To address these issues, a new law on pension and disability insurance was introduced in
September 2003. This law adjusts key parameters of the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) pension
system to better align entitlements to available resources, announces the introduction of the
funded pension pillars, outlines administrative reform and a time table for shifting
responsibilities among key agencies involved incollection and compliance. These reforms have
improved the near-term fiscal balance and provide the possibility for introduction of a multi-
pillar system inthe future. These changes (effective inJanuary 2004) included:
(i) increasedretirementagebyfiveyearsformenandwomen(65and60respectively)over
          a ten-year period;
(ii) widenedcalculationperiodfromtenbestyearstofullcareerovera15yearperiod;
(iii) changedindexationpatternfromwagetoacombinationofwagesandprices;
(iv)      introduction of a point formula and lowered accrual rates from more than two percent to
          one percent per year o f service;
(v)       tightened disability conditions; and
(vi)      eliminationof most social-related benefits, such as rehabilitationandrecreation, etc.

These changes should lower the pension deficit to less than one percent o f GDP in2006 and are
likely to eliminate the pension deficit by 2O0ga4The declining patho f pension to GDP ratio will
eventually create the fiscal space for the next roundofreform inwhich the financial management
procedures of the pension system will be strengthened and funded pillars possibly introduced.

  Summary data on contributors wagehalary, employment and social insurance contributions are transmitted to the
P I 0 annually. This information on the M4 form, must be submitted to the P I 0 by 30 April for the prior calendar
year, Employers send their M4 forms to the P I 0 -99 percent are paper based.
  It is to be noted that these projections assume transfers from the budget to the FundPI0 equal to 1.8 percent of
GDP. The budget is required to finance pensions for war veterans and the police. In addition, the budget is
obligated to finance the gap between the calculated pension and the minimum pension. These projections also do
not take into account more recent changes being contemplated, including a reduction of contributions from
employers from the current 12 percent to 7.2 percent which are likely to push further the path o f declining deficits,
unless offsetting measuresare proposed.

The Pension Insurance Law and other recently enacted legislation on tax and social contribution
collection also envisage a full transfer o f collection and control responsibility to the Agency for
Public Revenues (DPR) in2005 and full transfer o freportingprocedures andrequirements to the
DPR in2006.

However, these statutory changes address only the policy environment and leave unattended
the needed complementary administrative and institutional capacity which are critical to the
implementation o f the reforms.         These capacity constraints, especially in skills for stricter
compliance and collections, processing, policy analysis, and the required investments insoftware
and hardware for better data management, registration, and payment processing, both of which
are critical to improved efficiency and effectiveness o f the system are likely to jeopardize the
gains achieved through improvement o f the policy environment.

The importance of these administrative reforms is critical, in the short run, both on the
potential for increased contributions and intightening illegitimate payments. Some estimates put
the level o f evasion at 50 percent for the total prospective population o f contrib~tors.~On the
payments side, according to one survey, 52 percent o f disability pensioners were below 50 years
o f age, and in 31 percent o f disability pensions, fiaud may be possible.6 The extent o f arrears in
2002, just for the central budget, stood at 37 percent o f contributions. Arrears on receivables
from other contributors needs to be fully determined.

This makes it is impossible to accurately reconcile contributor records with taxpayer records in
the DPR. Such reconciliation is required inthe fbture, when DPR will take over responsibility
for contribution collection and compliance.            These problems can be resolved by a uniJied
PIO/DPR registration and collection system.

These weaknesses inthe pension system, coupled with an unlikely steep decline inthe deficit as
has been projected under the parametric reforms (due to any o f the assumptions underlying the
projections, not holding true) would mean that administrative tightening would provide a strong
lever in the short run, both for increasing contributions and preventing hemorrhaging on the
payments side.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

Inorder to ensure that the government has the capacity and the needed investment inplace for
proper implementation o f the legislative framework, a Pensions System Administration
Investment Project (PSAIP) had been requested by the Government, through the Minister o f
Finance, ina letter to the Bank dated November 10,2003.

Preparatory work for these reforms has been built up through the Structural Adjustment Credit
(SAC) missions andpolicy measures set out under SAC Iand the proposed SAC 11. The project

will also benefit from the extensive diagnostic work USAID has done inthis sector. However,
USAID, the largest donor inMontenegro, sees a complementary and supportive role for the Bank
as it begins to wind down its efforts and withdraw its involvement inthis sector in2005.

Given this situation, there appears to be a window o f opportunity to:
0     build on the improved policy environment and strengthen the reforms under the Bank's
      SAC I1through needed investments at the institutional level;
0     seize a window o f opportunity in the sector where government readiness appears to have
      crystallized around the need for improved administrative capacity and modernizationo f the
      pension system; and
0     ensure that the hard-won reforms at the policy level are not derailed due to lack o f support
      inimplementationofthe reforms.

3. Higherlevel objectivesto which the projectcontributes

The project supports implementation o f the new law and reform o f the pension and tax
administrative system being undertakenby the government. These reforms are intendedto:
0     Improve revenue performance o f all social contributions and personal income tax;
0     Improve service to pensioners and taxpayers;
0     Reduce the administrative burden for businesses andindividuals;
0     Reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and pensioners; and
0     Increase transparency andintegrity inadministration o f the pension andtax system.

These efforts would, in the long run, lead to the financial sustainability o f the system - a key
goal o f the pension reforms undertaken by the government.


B.      PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. LendingInstrument

The project will be a Specific Investment Loan, o f US$5 millionequivalent. A sector investment
operation has been judged the best approach to provide the necessary technical assistance and
investment needed for modernization o fthe system. While there i s extensive technical assistance
(TA), training, and capacity buildingto develop the systems and staff, the bulk o f the costs will
be for information technology - both hardware, software and subsystems.            So far, no co-
financing arrangements have been identified, but once capacity is in place for second or third
pillarreforms, donor support will be actively sought.

2. ProjectDevelopmentObjectivesand Key Indicators

The project development objectives are to improve the financial sustainability, effectiveness, and
efficiency o fthe pension system through:

a.      Developing a unified contribution collection and reporting system and establishing
        central registries that are based on modern information technology and processes.


                                                 6

b.       Modemization and restructuring, as needed, of the organization, processes, and
         technology inthe key institutions ofthe Pensionsystem: the DPR and FundPIO.

c.       Developing capacity for better policy design and analysis o f the pension system and
         improving readinessfor future pensionreforms.

The key performance indicators would include:
0     Modernization and restructuring implementationplans prepared and implemented in DPR
      andFundPIO, with milestones to measure progress.
0     Compliance improved as measuredby revenue/(average wage*employment).8
     Effectiveness of administration improved, measuredby stock of arrearshevenues,
0    Efficiency o f administration improved, comparing Montenegro costshevenues to similar
      sizedrepublics' average costs/revenuesinneighboring countries.
0     Client services improved, measured by increases in numbers o f enquiries received and
      answered.
0    Lowering of the burden for employers as measured by fewer requirements and forms for
     processing.

3. ProjectComponents

Giventhe government's strategy inthis sector as mentioned under A.1(c) above, implementation
of recently enacted legislation and policies to improve the pension system will require
investments and capacity to be built in the following three areas: (i) and contribution   tax
collection and information management; (ii)             Fund PI0 modemization; and (iii)            strengthening
capacity for policy analysis anddeveloping apublic education andoutreach program.

The proposedproject will provide financing for hardware and software, study tours, foreign and
local training, expert advisory services, public education materials, and incremental recurrent
costs. The estimatedtotal cost of the project is US$6.5 million.

The project aims to benefit from existing work done by USAID. This includes both diagnostic
assessments and in the case of the Directorate of Public Revenues (DPR), investments for the
first stage of the modemization process. As such, the project draws heavily on the analysis of
USAID and builds on the current infrastructure for reform already put in place, especially
technology investments inthe DPR.

The project will be implemented over a period of four years and will consist of the following
componentsand activities:




* Employment   to be measured by labor force survey; wages are those reported by statistical office. Any changes in
payroll tax rates to be normalized incomputation; that is changes inpayroll taxes alone do not change compliance.


                                                          7

Component 1. Increase Tax and Contribution Compliance (US$3.5 million of which
US$2.8million is IDA-financed).

This component will serveto improve compliance by strengtheningthe DPR capacity to:
(i) theroleofsocialcontributioncollectionsinadditiontoincometaxcollection;and
  assume
(ii) ontheroleofintegrateddatacollectionforincometaxandsocialcontributions, inthe
   take
agreedtime period. Key activities under this component include:

0    Consolidation of contribution collection, control andenforcement functions inDPR.
0    Creation of central registries on tax and contribution payers including central registration of
     new companies, self employed and fanners, with data dissemination to all involved
     institutions.
0    Establishment of expanded DPR organizational structure that would perform additional
     business processes to eliminate the duplicative functions of other agencies.
0    Development of a baseline for benchmarking of progress and measuring of results
     throughout the life o f the project

Component 2. Restructure and Modernize the FundPI0 (US$2.0 million of which US$1.5
million is IDA-financed)

This component is aimed at modernizing the fund PI0 to: (i)      improve services to clients, both
contributors and beneficiaries; and (ii)focus the FundPI0 on its core capabilities and processes.
Key activities underthis component include:


0    Reviewing the core functions of the FundPI0 in light o f the new law and establishing core
     processes andproceduresthat underlie these functions.
0    Eliminating duplicative functions and streamlining the processes to improve services to
     pensioners.
0    Investment in equipment, both hardware and software to modernize core functions of the
     PI0 o f statistical and policy analysis, processing of claims, awarding o f benefits, appeal
     processing, and better servicing its clients.
0    Deliveringtraining programs, technical assistance, to support the newrole o fthe PIO.

Component 3. Develop and Strengthen Capacity for Pension Policy (US$0.6 million of
whichUS$0.5 millionis IDA-financed)

This component i s designed to address capacity constraints in designing pension policy,
supervision of private pension funds, and developing a public education campaign. The sub-
components include:

0    Developing capacity for policy analysis and supervision. This sub-component would
     include provision of training, equipment, technical assistance and staffing, in: (a) creating
     capacity and analytical tools such as apension modelto analyze and forecast pensionpolicy




                                                  8

       inthe Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA),9 and (b) preparing the groundwork
       for capacity building for supervision of pension funds by the Ministry of Finance (MOF),
       and for thirdpillar reforms, over time."

0     Public education campaign. Key activities under this sub-component would include a
       phasededucation campaign aimed, with due sensitivity to the messages and their timing, to
       promote the goals of the pension reform, and explain the need for the changes. This
       campaign would be staged over the life of the project and would include, at a later stage,
       building public support for a three pillar reform and widen public awareness for the needto
       voluntarily save for retirement.

Component 4. Project Coordination (US$0.3 million of which US$0.2million is IDA-
financed)

This component would support the coordination of project activities and would involve the
hiring of a local consultant to serve as a Project Coordinator who will be supervised by the
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Financial Systems and Public Expenditures (ODPM).
As the need arises, an Administrative Assistant may also be hired to assist the Project
Coordinator. The beneficiary agencies (Le. the DPR for Component 1, the PI0 for Component
2, and the MOLSA and MOF for Component 3) would be responsible for the implementation of
the project and for providing substantive input. To facilitate the implementationand monitoring
of the project by the implementing agencies, focal points would be drawn from each of the
namedagencies, and will be appointed as membersof an expert working group. They will work
with the Project Coordinator and the central Technical Services Unit (TSU) under the Office of
the Prime Minister which is responsible for providing core procurement and financial
management services for this project and all other Bank-financed projects. The costs of the TSU
are being financed under the HealthSystem Improvement Project (HSIP).

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

The implementation of pension reform and administration projects in the Europe and Central
Asia region has shown that success depends on: (i)               support from the authorities at the highest
level inthe implementing agencies; (ii)            the willingness to accept technical assistance; (iii)      clear
linkages between policy reforms and the investment in information systems; (iv) the
development of appropriate technology; (v) the development of information architecture prior to
the purchase of hardware; (vi) the development of a committed and well-trained Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) to implement the project; (vii) adequate training o f staff to use the
new procedures; and (viii) coordinated policy objectives across Government and the agencies
involved inthe project. And as evidenced throughout the region, successful pension reform
depends on successful administrative reform.




  There is a serious shortage o f qualified staff inthe Ministry. Inaddition to investment needs o f the Department,
the project would also finance consultants.
loThe current Insurance Supervision in the Ministry of Finance consists o f a staff o f three and is ingreat need of
training, education and equipment.


                                                           9

In designing the PSAIP, to build commitment and ensure high level support, the team has
worked with the government to establish a Steering Committee with the Deputy Prime Minister
for Financial Systems and Public Expenditures as its Chair, described as follows:
0    The working group would meet at least once a month to monitor progress and resolve
     contentious issues.
0    The working group includes the Ministers of Labor, Finance, and all o f the Directors o f the
     relevant agencies, such as Health, Unemployment Bureau, and Fund-PIO.
0    The working group has nominated an expert team drawn from the relevant agencies to
     assist inthe implementation o fthe project.

The project's support for consolidated revenue collection and reporting reflects lessons learned
and good practice reforms being implemented in South Eastern Europe, and Central and Eastern
Europe. The move towards consolidated revenue collection and reporting is supported by both
the Bank and IMF as increasing efficiency, accountability and transparency in the revenue
system.    Examples of Bank-supported efforts in this direction are Bulgaria, Slovakia, and
Croatia.

However, there is mixed experience as we look specifically at collection, record-keeping and
transferring contributions to individual accounts.         This is due to a variety o f reasons.
Contribution rates, including levies on employer and employee, frequently exceed a quarter o f
gross wages in many countries. Moreover, high contribution rates, coupled with weak links
between contributions paid and benefits received, can result inpoor incentives to comply or even
for people to take jobs or firms to hire them.           With contribution rates on average with
neighboring countries and benefits more than generous, this particular aspect does not appear to
be an issue in Montenegro. On the other hand, complying with contribution requirements can
impose a large administrative burden on employers, which appears to be the case inMontenegro.

Poor rates o f collections can also result from institutional weaknesses incollection systems. For
example, employees o f collection agencies are poorly paid. This can result in recruitment and
retention problems, poor qualifications and motivation.         It also increases the potential for
corruption. This is very much a live issue inMontenegro. As such, a majorfocus oftheproject
is on institutionalstrengthening.

Other common problems identified are that often more than one agency collects levies on
earnings, with social security, personal income taxation, and health insurance administered
separately. Different agencies often fail to share information, and duplication adds to public
sector's administrative costs and to employers' compliance costs. Some countries lack a unique
system of identification numbers for workers and fail to take full advantage o f information
technology, These issues become even more acute for countries with limited capacity and a
paucity o ftrained officials. The above issues arepredominant in Montenegro.

Givensuch a situation, care is being taken to address these issues by: (i)  approachingthe process
in a cross-cutting manner, by involving all o f the key stakeholders in the reform process;
(ii)giving due attention to the political economy and incentives for change, by creating
champions, developing a coalition, and explicitly recognizing issues that would need to be dealt
with for those who will lose from the reforms; (iii)  creating a shared platform with other donors,



                                                  10

such as USAID, for pushing the reforms forward; and (iv) creating awareness of the reforms in
the public andmediathrough a public informationcampaign.

5. Alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection

(a)     Centralized versusDecentralized Collection. Under a decentralized system, collection is
the responsibility of each agency or pension fund, eliminating the intermediate `clearing house'.
However, for Montenegro, the consideration ought to be based on the relative size of its
population (roughly 650,000),            scarce institutional capacity, processes for control and
management, and efficiency, security and costs of both running the system and the indirect cost
of compliance borne by employers.

The case for a centralized scheme ina pay-as-you go system, as it exists inMontenegro, is clear.
This choice is basedon the following key factors:l1

     Control mechanisms - regular reporting and auditing of contribution records, which is
     necessary, can best be managed centrally, especially given the lack of technical skills and
     good data andinformation systems.

     Cross controls - Centralizing collection allows for cross-checks of pensions with other
     information, such as health insurance and personal income taxation. A single agency,
     responsible for collection, can develop a single reporting system. With separate agencies,
     there are many pitfalls insharing of information, as is currently the case inMontenegro.

     Cost of collecting - This i s likely to be cheaper in a centralized system because of the
     economies o f scale, given that it is possible to centralize the collection of pension
     contributions with other social security contributions and taxes. A centralized system of
     collection also simplifies the payment processes.

     Corruption-Centralized collection can reduce the risk of corruption since the central set of
     information i s shared by a number of actors inthe pension system. The risk of corruption
     can be reduced further when `centralized collection' i s simply a set of information signals
     between financial institutions and the recipient o f revenues. The role of the collecting
     agency is then merely as guarantor of the process. This also avoids the spurious use of
     funds by the state.

        One go unification versus phasing-in of agencies, beginning with the Pension Fund.
Inconsideringwhether it wouldbemoreprudentto unifycontributions first withjust the Pension
Fund and then with the Health Fund and other agencies, a key factor is the momentum for
reforms and the duplication of efforts that will continue while the other agencies maintain their
current systems and processes.

(c)    Project Not Financed. The most obvious alternative to the project would be not to
finance a project at all. Thejustification for this alternative would be the incomplete progress in


  Drawn from ``collecting and transferring pension contributions" Rafael Rofinan, and Gustavo Demarco, 1999,


                                                         11

the area o f policy reform. However, the new laws require, irrespective o f whether the current
system i s continued or a new one instituted, the collection o f earnings records within DPR
instead o fthe FundPIO. This collection would be impossiblewithout a new information system.
And given that the USAID is pullingout altogether from this sector, it makes it very difficult to
find new donors who would step inat this stage,

(d)     Letting the parametric reforms take their course to improve the system without any
administrativestrengthening. To illustrate the need inone area o f administrative improvement:
Client data are provided to the Fund PI0 at the end o f the year and not on current basis. Under
current procedures, each employer provides aggregate data on its wage bill and information on
total numbers o f employees to document contributions for pension and employment programs.
This system worked for a planned economy. But as contributions are now likely to be paid by
multipleemployers for any one individual, data losses will be multiplied. Individual records are
required. With or without pension reform, individual client records need to be reported on a
current basis for the PAYGO system, if future entitlements are to be correct. When pension
reform starts without an adequate administrative structure, it i s inevitably less effective as some
contributions are misdirected (Kazakhstan) or are never made (Poland).


C.      IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements(ifapplicable)

The project is buildingon andusing the extensive analytical work done by USAID inthis sector.
Beyond that, no partnerships are envisaged currently, though during implementation o f the
project, other partners will be actively sought.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

Beneficiary agencies (Le. the DPR for Component 1, the PI0 for Component 2, andthe MOLSA
and MOF for Component 3) will manage, implement and monitor the implementation o f their
respective components. Project coordination and support will be conducted through the ODPM,
who will hire a local consultant to serve as a Project Coordinator. If needed at a later stage, an
Administrative Assistant will also be hired.

To ensure smooth implementation o f the Project, a high-level Steering Committee has been
established by Government Resolution and made responsible for strategic decisions on project
implementation, coordination and monitoring. The Steering Committee is chaired by the Deputy
Prime Minister for Financial Systems and Public Expenditures and is composed o f the Minister
of Finance, the Minister o f Labor and Social Affairs, Heads o f the DPR and PI0 and other
agencies involved in the Project (Health Fund, Unemployment Fund, Statistics Agency, and
Secretariat for Development), plus the Head o f the TSU. The Steering Committee will meet
regularly at least on a monthly basis, or more frequently as the need arises. To facilitate the
implementation and monitoring o f the project by the implementing agencies, focal points would
be drawn from each o f the named agencies, and will be appointed as members o f an expert
working group.



                                                12

The central TSU, recently established by the G O M in the General Secretariat (Prime Minister's
Department), will be responsible for carrying out core procurement and financial management
functions for all fkture Bank-financed projects, and potentially for other donor-supported
projects. This TSU has been established with Terms of References (TORS)that define clear
boundaries o f responsibility between the line Ministries and the TSU, giving the respective line
Ministries clear overall responsibility and decision-making authority, and making the TSU
accountable to line Ministries for providing prompt, professional services.          The costs o f
operating the TSU are being financed under the Health System Improvement Project (HSIP).

The TSU has prepared an operational manual for the TSU, covering financial management and
procurement arrangements, and relationships with line Ministries. The Operations Manual for
the TSUis generic, covering core arrangements for all future Bankprojects which will be served
by the TSU.      A project-specific annex or operational manual for PSAIP (POM) has been
prepared by the Project Coordinator in collaboration with the Implementing Agencies and
submitted to IDA for review.         The PSAIP P O M will ensure that it i s consistent with the
guidelines and procedures under the TSU operational manual. The TSU has employed a full
time procurement officer and accountant. The head o f the TSU will be a part-time role for the
first year, taken by a senior staff member o fthe Department o f the Deputy PrimeMinister.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomes/results

The Implementing Agencies will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation.             Proposed
monitoring indicators are listed in Annex 3 below. The Project Coordinator will work with the
expert working group to coordinate the monitoring and evaluation process.

4. Sustainability

The Government has already launched the parametric reforms to its PAYGO system. It has also
passed a new law on pension and disability insurance in September 2003. Under this law, new
collection and control responsibilities are envisaged. These cannot be undertaken without the
requisite restructuring and investments whichthe project supports.

This cross-coordination is at the core ofthe project's success. Previous attempts by other donors
did not yield results as the dialogue and process for reform proceeded in silos, i.e. within the
different agencies, without an attempt to link their efforts or develop cross agency relationships
so crucial to sharing o f information and getting agreement for implementation.

For the first time, all o f the key agencies, i.e. the Health Fund, the Unemployment Bureau, DPR,
FundPIO, and other agencies have agreed to an implementation plan. This implementation plan
i s supported both at the senior management levels, i.e. Directors and the respective Ministers as
well as at the working level, by an expert group, again drawn from the relevant agencies.

Moreover, the project i s being shepherded by the Office o f the Deputy Prime Minister in charge
o f Financial Systems and Public Expenditure. This office is responsible for coordinating the
functioning o fthese agencies as well.



                                                     13

5. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

Fiscal developments and risks.          At the beginning o f March 2004, the Government of
Montenegro announced its intention to cut contribution and personal income tax rates, effective
from May 2004, and fwther cuts in early 2005.                  Such cuts, unless accompanied by
countermeasures would in all likelihood increase the budget deficit in 2004 and beyond.
Without fiscal countermeasures or withdrawal of the rate reductionpackage, the fiscal risk to the
PSAIP as well as for other Bank operations would be highand increasing, imposinga significant
obstacle inthe development o f a proper policy environment inwhich the administrative reforms
can make a difference.

Legislative activities and risks. Development o f the central registries with a central registration
system, new centralized collection o f tax and contribution data, single payment order, and other
elements o f the new data collection and control system have been indicated in the recently
adopted Action Plan o f the Working Group. Certain elements o f the Action Plan are scattered
over other legislations. For example, the laws on tax procedures have already assigned the sole
responsibility for control and enforcement to the DPR, while the Pension Insurance Law
envisages that DPR will assume pension contribution collection from 2005 andreport M 4 data to
the P I 0 from 2006. The DPR's future role is not synchronized over the mentioned legislations
andrequires a new and separate law that would clearly specify and regulate the DPR's roles and
responsibilities as well as those o f other institutions, and the central registries and more frequent
monthly OPD3 reporting.

With the adoption of the Action Plan by the Government, and outlining within the plan the
GovernmentS intention to develop and pass such a law, this risk appears to have been
minimized. Passageo fthis law is also part o fthe reforms beingproposedunder SAC2.

Incase the Government fails to draft and pass such a law, these issues might still be regulated in
the tax laws. However, the central registry and reporting issues would ultimately have to be
regulated by a separate law. If these remain unregulated, these could cause considerable delay
in project implementation and/or prevent the achievement of development objectives in
component 1.

The other risks that may prevent the project development objectives from being met appear to
be political and institutional. Cooperation across the agencies, especially Fund P I 0 and DPR,
continues to be an issue. Capacity within the government agencies to implement the reforms
remains weak.

To ensure that the different agencies begin to see the overall process and their respective roles,
the Bank organized a multi-donor workshop that brought all principal actors in the pension
reform process together in February 2004. Based on the outcomes o f the workshop, two sets o f
cross agency relationships for implementation have been established - one at the Ministerial level
andthe other at a moreday-to-day working level.




                                                    14

To support government capacity duringthe initialphase of the reform, preliminary diagnosis and
evaluation o f system requirements are beingjointly prepared, with the help of other donors (such
as USAID) who have a long relationship in Montenegro. A key step in managing risks in
implementationwould be to leverage the existing work andrelationships of other donors.

D.      APPRAISALSUMMARY

1. Economicandfinancialanalyses

The proposedproject would support the improvements inthe administration and sustainability of
the existing pension system, as well as activities related to the building of the framework for
possible third pillar reforms for the future. Pleasesee Annex 9 for an integratedanalysis.

The introduction of better collections and reporting processes for social insurance, based on
individual monthly reporting, should result in an increase in collections and help stabilize the
fiscal position of the pension system. Reform o f the PIO, could lead to reduced expenditures
through more efficient administration of pensionbenefits. The systemwould also allow the DPR
to maintain informationregarding contributions and liabilities o f all employers and to match this
information with similar information from related systems. This facility will allow the DPR to
detect potential non-payments or underpaymentsandtake corrective actions.




                                                  16

These interventions are also expected to reduce the timekost o f clients through more efficient
delivery o f pension services. The introduction of the new system for collection o f pension
contributions will increase the overall rate o f collection and enable the creation o f individual
accounts with records o f the contributions paid, thus resulting in increased transparency and
improved fiscal sustainability o f the system. Although it i s difficult to estimate the net fiscal
impact that can be expected as a result o f the new system on the collection rate increase, the
experience o f other countries that have implemented such systems is largely positive. Drawing
on the experience of other countries, gains may be significant: in Croatia, the introduction o f
individual monthly reporting requirements increased collections from 78 percent to over 90
percent.

However, it should be noted that causality between the project investment and economic
outcomes cannot easily be established. The most common benefit is the assumed improved
compliance as mentioned above but quantifying the net effect and estimating the period of
impact would not be useful, particularly, given the government's announced intention to cut
contribution rates, with the size o fthe cuts as yet undetermined.

Evenifcausality could be established, there is muchuncertainty about arange o f other economic
effects to include them in the economic analysis. These include a net savings improvement
(which i s disputable), policies on closure andbankruptcies o f firms, etc.

2. Technical

The policy development technical assistance reflects current practice in pension policy design
andprogram evaluation used inOECD and ECA countries. Further, bothpensionreform andthe
reform o f cash-benefit programs have a long history o f policy analytic and evaluative studies by
highly respected researchers, so that efforts inthis area have a firm intellectual foundation.

Organizational changes to be implemented in this project will reflect best practice in pension
administration agencies in OECD and E C A countries. The client-service principles followed in
this designwill leadto more flexible andefficient organizations, saving time o fboth clients and
staff. The computer system solutions (computer equipment and software necessary to upgrade
capacity for contribution collections, systems and sub-systems architecture for networking, voice
and data management capabilities, statistical analysis, actuarial modeling, evaluation o f
performance o f social programs) represents a good balance between function and cost. It will
use a combination o f object-oriented and traditional approaches to data management.            All
software will be fully tested before implementation.

3. Fiduciary

Procurement: An experienced procurement specialist has been engaged to work inthe central
TSU. A procurement capacity assessment has been completed and action plan agreed for
developing adequate procurement capacity inthe central TSU. A procurement plan for the first
18 months of implementationhas been prepared and agreed.




                                                  17

Financial management: A financial management review was undertaken in March 2004, to
determine whether the financial managementarrangements for the Project are acceptableto the
Bank.

Ithasbeen concludedthat the Project satisfiesthe Bank's financial managementrequirements.

The SAMCFAA report notes that there are anumberofrisks onthe managementofpublic funds

the past; (b) unfinished reforms - the new governments that were elected have commenced a
in SAM. The risks to the public funds include: (a) poor public sector financial managementin

process of major reform, which looks good as designed, but it i s still too early to say if the
reforms will be totally successful; (c) capacity constraints in both the Federal and Republic
governments; (d) weak banking sectors; (e) weak audit capacity; (f) poor implementation
capacity in line ministries; and (g) the lack of recent Bank implementation experiences within
SAM. Since re-joining the membership of the World Bank, SAM has been using individual
implementation units for each investment project (traditional PIU model), located within the
relevant line ministries or project beneficiaries, to mitigate some o f these risks.

During the period since the CFAA was published, the number of commercial banks in SAM
assessed as acceptable to hold Special Accounts has increasedfrom three to five andthe number
of firms assessed as acceptable to audit Bank-financed projects has increased from two to four,
indicating an improvement in the fiduciary environment. Experience in implementing Bank-
financed projects is increasing but the lending portfolio is still too young to be able to conclude
that the Borrower has a thorough understanding of Bank operations.

Disbursementsfrom the IDA credit will initially follow the transaction-based method, i.e., direct
payment, reimbursement and special commitments using SOEs and full documentation as
appropriate. It is anticipated that the project will migrate to report-based disbursement during
2005, following demonstration for at least two quarters o f satisfactory preparation ofreports.

Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing of up to US$0.28 million would be applied to
expenditures made after June 1, 2004 for (a) consultant services for extending the functionality
of tax and pension system; and (b) fees for a Project Coordinator, and as necessary, an
Administrative Assistant.

4. Social

A Montenegro Social Protection Note preparation has been financed, under this project. This
note will provide an overview of social insurance and social assistanceprograms inMontenegro.
It will look at the coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of programs to assess areas for reform.
It would also include an assessment of the functioning of the present pension benefits and
payments. Given that the MOLSA is working on a new Law on Social Welfare, this will be
timely. The Note would also be used for discussions with other donors involved in the sector
(e.g. UNICEF, Save the Children). The work will be done betweenApril 1 and May 30, 2004.
A draft report has beensubmittedonMay 7 and afinal report is expected by May 30.

  ii.Socialassistancecashbenefitsandchildallowances:reviewofprograms, eligibilitycriteria,
     data by program on expenditures andbeneficiaries.
 iii.Socialservices:inventoryofpublicservices,expenditures,beneficiaries,numberoffacilities.

 Institutional issues to be addressed include: (i)        who is responsible to whom - administration, and
 monitoring linkages betweenthe municipalities, CSWs, social protection institutions, Ministryo f
 Labor and Social Protection, management boards, etc.; (ii)                  reporting structure between these
bodies; (iii)   financing flows; and (iv) major roles and responsibilities o f key institutional actors
 (e.g. MOLSA, employment fund, PIO, NGOs, Ministryo f Justice, Ministry o f Interior).

Analysis o f the decentralized offices of the MOLSA, the Centers for Social Work, will cover: (i)
relations between CSWs and local governments; (ii)                  organizational structure of the 10 CSWs,
division services and cash, professional profile in the CSWs; (iii)                  services provided (on paper
 and inpractice; and (iv) capacity (staffing, equipment).

 7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

Not applicable.

The project is building on the work done in this sector by USAID. However, despite USAID
involvement inthis sector for some three years, progress inadministrative reform, has been very
minimal. Inter-agency relationships have been cumbersome. Many of the tasks required under
the administrative reforms are cross cutting. This puts a premium on ensuring closer cooperation
among the agencies involved and inproviding highlevel support to shepherd the process. It also

means a more careful managing of relationships and broader and fuller involvement of
counterparts inthe project preparationprocess.

As such, a workshop was held jointly by the Bank and the USAID, where all the key
stakeholders inthe reform process were brought together. A common plan for restructuring and
a modality for working resulted from this workshop. This was the first workshop of this kind
heldinMontenegro.

                           Annex 1:Countryand Sector Background
SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: MontenegroPensionsSystemAdministrationInvestmentProject

(a) Country background

The Government of Montenegro implemented a program supported by SAC I,covering
reforms in (i)public expenditure management; (ii)pensions; (iii)the energy sector; (iv)
labor markets; and (v) the business environment. One key feature of the program was the
enactment of a law on pension and disability insurance which adjusts key parameters of the
pension system to better align entitlements to available resources.         The new labor law
significantly increases labor market flexibility. The enactment of new enterprise, bankruptcy,
and securedtransaction laws create a more favorable business environment. The enactment of a
new energy law provides a basis for the development of a regulatory framework, together with
energy industry restructuring and liberalization.

InMontenegro, the consolidated budgetdeficit was cut from about 8 percent of republican GDP
in 2000 to about 5.5 percent in 2003.        The renewal of transfers to cover federal (union)
expenditures placed new pressure on fiscal accounts in 2003.         Excluding this transfer, the
underlying budget deficit for 2003 fell to about 3 percent o f republican GDP. Montenegro's
2004 budget envisages a consolidated deficit of 4.4 percent of republican GDP, or 1.6 percent of
GDP excluding the transfer to the uniongovernment.

Both republics have yet to fully overcome the daunting legacy of the past. This legacy
includes years of economy-wide decapitalization, a banking sector driven to severe insolvency,
and a corrupt and ineffective public sector. Evenafter efforts o f recent years, a critical mass of
reforms may not have been reached ineither republic. While transition reforms have progressed
in both republics, they are incomplete, were not always planned in an integrated fashion and
were introduced with inadequate attention to implementation capacity.          In Montengro, the
massive presence of the public sector inthe economy continues with 40 percent of the economy
still in State hands. The size and scope of Government intervention in the economy remains
large and the capacity o f public sector institutions to implement reforms remains weak. The
reform effort of recent years has improved governance, public sector transparency and financial
discipline, but more needs to be done in each of these areas. One of the key challenges the
Government of Montenegro now faces is building strong institutions with the capacity and
incentives to carry out the recently adoptedformal elements of reform.

(b) Sector background

Montenegro launched a reform o f the pension system in2003 with the support o f SAC I.Prior
to this reform, the pension system experienced serious fiscal difficulties due in the short run to
an ineffective administrative system, characterized by a loose and fragmented collection
and compliance system, and economic and demographic factors that affect it's
sustainabilityover the mediumterm. An aging populationandthe erosion of the contribution
base triggered by economic stagnation and a growing shadow economy, both contributed to a
decline inthe system dependency ratio to 1.3 workers per pensioner. The age dependency ratio
(the ratio of the over-65 year old populationto the 15-65 year old population) grew to exceed20

percent. Both indicators are similar to those found inneighboring countries. By 2002, pension
expenditure reached 13 percent o f GDP. Pension contributions (the rate is 24 o f gross salaries,
split equally between employees and employers), accounted for 50 percent to 60 percent of
pension revenues on average. The remaining revenues consisted o f required mandatory transfer
from the budget for state employees' contributions and citizens eligible for privileged categories'
benefits (military personnel, police officers, World War I1veterans, and public servants retired
under special rules). The system had difficulties incovering some o f these obligations and thus
the pension deficit widened to almost 3.9 percent of GDP in2002.

Duringthis first phase ofreform, the focus was onrestructuring pensionfinance andonreducing
arrears.

The initial restructuring effort culminated with the enactment of the new Pension
Insurance Law in September 2003. Reform o f the existing pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) system
sets the stage for the future introduction o f a multi-pillar system.      The law tightens key
parameters o f the existing PAYGO system in an effort to improve the near-term fiscal balance.
These changes effective inJanuary 2004: (i)    increased the retirement age by five years for men
and women (65 and 60 respectively) over a ten-year period; (ii)    widened the calculation period
from ten best years to full career over a 15 year period; (iii)
                                                              changed the indexation pattern from
wage to a combination o f wages and prices; (iv) introduced a point formula and lowered the
accrual rates from more than 2 percent to 1 percent per year o f service; (v) tightened disability
conditions; and (vi) eliminated most social-related benefits from the pension system.

Reforms supported by SAC I1will ensure the effective implementation o f some o f the reforms
introduced in 2003 aimed at improving the transparency and management o f the pension
component o f public finances. Further SAC I1support is intended to lay the ground work for the
next stage o f pensionreform envisaged inthe Law on PensionInsurance, through the drafting o f
new legislation to regulate voluntary pension funds. Some elements o f budget execution
continue to lack adequate transparency. These will be addressed in 2004 by ensuring that no
new intergovemental arrears on pension contributions are incurred. Also, by itemizing all
required transfers from the budget for all privileged and special categories o f beneficiaries,
regular reporting to the PI0 on public sector employees' wages and contributions paid will be
made possible.

(c) Proposed legal and regulatorv changes inthe pension system

The full transfer of tax and social security contribution collection to DPR in 2005 i s a
process that goes well beyond centralizing the flows o f contributions inthe Treasury, envisaged
by the tax procedures laws. Effective control o f social security contributions requires a prompt
and effective flow o f information o f social security contributions to all relevant institutions.
Such an information flow would require a frequent, i.e. monthly or quarterly, personified
reporting and a central database o f insured individuals and contributionpayers.

To enable this process, an action plan has been adopted for the unification of registration
and reporting of tax and social security contribution collection. The action planestablishes a




                                                 22

working group led by the Deputy Prime Minister of Financial Systems. This group will draft a
newlaw to ensurethe effective implementationofthese plans.

This new law on consolidated reporting and control on social security contributions, personal
income tax and surtax will be enacted by end of 2004. By 2005, DPR will have to be fully
equipped to collect, control and enforce pension and other social contributions as well as
forward contributions paid to the social security funds in a timely manner. By 2006, DPR
will prepare corresponding reports on personified contribution payment. Inthe interim period,
the proposed legislation will require that DPR establish: (i)central databases of insured
individuals and contribution payers; (ii)procedures for updating individual data; (iii)data
dissemination requirements to extra-budgetary funds; (iv) procedures for one-stop registration of
newly insured individuals and contribution payers; and (v) other procedures required for the
smooth operation of the consolidated administrative system. Also, measures to harmonize
provisions on social security contribution control in this proposed law will be undertaken.
Currently, such measures are scattered throughout several other relevant laws. The proposed
new law would supercedethe old laws and eliminate the conflicting discrepancies.

As mentioned above, the Pension Insurance Law envisages the eventual introduction of
mandatory second and voluntary third fundedpensionpillars inMontenegro. The law stipulates
that the funded pillars will be regulated by separate legislation to be adopted in the future. A
decision to have a voluntary pension pillar would be introduced and regulated well inadvance of
the mandatory second pillar in order to allow the pension fund industry (including regulatory
institutions) to develop in Montenegro. Drafting of the law on voluntary pension funds is
expectedto take place in2004. The Government will adopt the draft legislationby year-end.

(d) Information technolow architecture and environment

(9    Current system being developed by the USAID. USAID has beenworking with the DPRto
develop and implementa scalable Integrated DistributedInformationSystem. This system will
be incompliance with the new legislative framework.

The systemwill be:
0   Multilevel distributedclient server application.
0   Supporting a Central Taxpayer Registry.
0   ProvidingCustomer services andautomatedtax returnprocessing.
0   Providing managementinformationat branchesand central level.
0   Controllinganauthorized access to the data.

The systemwill be connectedto the other Government InformationSystems(IS) suchas:
CustomsIS, Commercial Court IS, Budget IS, etc.

The final product of the USAID project i s a DistributedClient - Server Application made up of
two basic software packages:
0   A software package that will be implemented in DPR branches, called Tax Information
    System (TAXIS).




                                                23

0  A central package that incorporates a Taxpayer's Registry and warehouse database and will
   be implemented inthe Central DPR office. This package is called (Central Tax Information
   System-CTIS).

The following chart depicts the deployment ofthe system's packages:

Each branch system (TAXIS) will be connected to the Central System (CTIS) through a WAN
supportedby Secretariat for Development (SfD). This connection will be used for data exchange
betweenCentral and branch systems. There will betwo way flow ofdata.

Package implemented in DPR branches (TAXIS). The entire package will have a core
component and several subcomponents.

The core of the system consists of:
0  taxpayer's registration component (TPRC), with main functionality to create a registry of the
   taxpayers, identifying them andtheir tax obligations; and
0  taxpayer's revenue accounts component (TPRA), that will track information about taxpayer's
   behavior (filling return forms, payments, reassessment o f liabilities, imposedfines, etc.).

Constraintsin the present system. The following functionalities are not inthe scope of the
existing ongoing work:
0  audit selection
0  audit tracking
0  document tracking
0  collection activities tracking
0  appealprocedures and legal activities
0  web site informationfor DPR forms andprocedures



                                                      24

(ii) New system to be developed under PSAIP.         The PSAIP would build on this architecture
and introduce several new interfaces to ensure compatibility with registration and database
systems from the Fund PIO, Health Fund, Unemployment Agency, Banks, Central Bank, and
other relevant institutions.

The following core application modules have already been developed and deployed under the
current project:
0   Registration o f natural and legal persons
0   Return Processing for all taxes
0   Payment Processing (both payment system and cash payments)
e   Taxpayer Accounting supporting tax type sub-accounts

The following core applicationmodules are still under development with deployment plannedfor
no later thanMay 2005:
0   VATRefund
0   Audit selection, assignment, and tracking
0   It is also possible, though not yet firm, that a module for the management o f appeals to be
    delivered.

The application system is based on the TAXIS and CTIS packages and methodology from
Barrents/KPMG/BearingPoint. It is expected that, under the project, the delivered modules
would be extended in many areas to support an integrated revenue collection environment and
provide for data sharing with participating agencies.      On the payment side, the system is
interconnected with the Montenegro Treasury system, which is SAP based. This i s an open
standard connectivity, which should be able to be continued with no problems under the project.

The Project would extend the scope o f the TIS in key dimensions so that it can support the
implementationinthe country o f a sophisticated multi-tier pension system. The extension would
follow the following principles:
    The project team believes that the policy environment will continue to evolve over the life o f
    the project, similarly to what i s being experimented in other countries in the region
    undergoing similar reforms. As a result, we will attempt to keep the revenue collection
    system strategy and architecture deliberately as open as possible - i.e. allowing for future
    interconnections, interfaces, and policy options. The direction is to builda system notjust to
    process transactions based on current policies, but one that can accommodate future policies
    withreasonable ease.
    In particular, the extension should be planned to accommodate more centralized or
    distributed registration and collection processes which would be defined through the
    impendinglegislation for consolidated revenue collection. We believe there is a reasonable
    chance that this specific legislation will have to be amended a few times over the life o f the
    project as Montenegro gains experience with an integrated collection system and the need to
    enforce collection




                                                 25

Finally, the extension must be flexible enoughto support the introductionof the secondand third
pillar of the pension reform, and their administration, especially the corresponding financial and
data flows, and reporting.

(e) The FundPIO: the needto modernizeandrestructure

The FundPI0 faces a number of challenges. There are almost 30,000 cases where no return of
work and contribution data has been made since 2001. Almost 50 percent o f these cases are 10
years old. The number of non-compliant cases is rising since 1999, and 5000 (M4)12 cases are
outstanding from the period2000-2001.

It is possible to set up a pension payment record for a person who does not have a contribution
record - as the contribution record database does not interface with the payments processing
database. This i s a serious control weakness and highlights the general lack of adequatecontrols
-both electronic andmanual -inthe current system.

The PI0 does not have accurate information about contributors and cannot properly identify
those who are failing to register and/or pay contributions. Aside from errors that result from
such gaps in information, controls, and management, the possibility o f fraud cannot be
discounted either. Two areas standout as requiringurgent attention.

(4     Database Accuracy.          The PIO's databases are outdated, lack proper integration and
contain many errors. Recent analysis has shown that 71 percent of employer records are missing
their Tax (FIN) number as the primary key, 13 percent of employee records are missing their
JMB number (a code to register people) and over 30 percent of self-employed records are
missing their JMB number. This means it is impossible to accurately reconcile contributor
records with tax-payer records inDPR. Such reconciliation is required inthe future, when DPR
will take over responsibility for contributioncollection and compliance. These problems can be
resolved by aunifiedPIO/DPR registration and collection system.

The PI0 databases show a significant number of persons aged over 60 with an open insurance
record but no payment of contributions recorded since 1997 and no pension in payment. This
indicates their records have not been updated with vital information and/or their pension
payment record is not linkedto their workkontribution record.

(io    IT System. The IT system is struggling to cope with the PIO's business requirements.
Much of equipment i s outdated and unsuitable for a modern public service with a critical
mission. The communications network with Regional Offices - used to access information,
record registrations and decisions - is slow and unreliable. Most offices don't have basic word
processingor printingfacilities.

Development of new applications i s minimal and many existing skills are seriously outdated.
Specialized training is almost non-existent and budgets for development are under-funded.


l2Summary data on contributors wagelsalary, employment and social insurance contributions are transmitted to the
PI0 annually. This information on the M4 form, mustbe submittedto the PI0 by 30 April for the prior calendar
year. Employers sendtheir M4 forms to the PI0-99% are paper based.


                                                    26

Despite having large teams of in-house technical specialists (software engineers etc), the PI0
contracts an external IT company to amendits application programmes, such as was necessary to
implementthe recent Pensions Law. This indicates the IT Departmentlacks skills and capacity
to properly support the PIO's business. A thorough overhaul o f the IT Departmentand the IT
systems is required.

Reform Strategy

The USAID advisors have deeply analyzed the PIO.              Taking into account their findings,
including the above issues, they have proposed a reform strategy that re-focuses the PI0 on its
core business: pensiodbenefit processing and payment. They have advised that key business
functions be transferred from PI0 Regional Offices and centralized in PI0 headquarters. This
strategy incorporates anewPI0 business model and a new PI0 organization structure.

To illustrate how modernization and restructuring might help the FundPIO, improve services to
contributors and reduce duplication with other agencies, take the area of contribution data
processing. Here Employers send their summary data on contributors' wages/salary to the Fund
PIO. These returns are 99 percent paper based. Inthe year 2000, some 162,000 suchforms were
submitted to the PIO.       In addition some 60,000 forms (on cessation of employment or
commencement) were sent as well. These forms were processed manually and scanned for
electronic archiving. The data on these forms is maintained inthree locations: the form itself, the
PIO's IT system, and the electronic archiving system. The DPR will also collect the same
information under the new integrated tax and social insurance collection system. It would be
much more efficient to be able to access this information from a central database, as is being
plannedunder the project. And the same applies to other agencies like the Health Fundand the
Unemployment Bureau, which maintaintheir separate databases as well.

The maincomponentso f modernization andrestructuring inthe FundPI0 include:
0    Centralization of pensiodbenefit claim processinginPI0 headquarters
0    Centralization of registration of Contributors and Participants in PI0 headquarters, in
     preparation for transfer to DPR
0    Transfer of collection of contributions (cash and data) to DPR

0    Modernization andrestructuring o f PI0 organization to focus on core business
0    Restructuringo f P I 0 regional offices -to focus on service to pensioners

The PI0 is responsible for the administration of the social insurance system in respect of the
following insurable contingencies: old agehetirement, disability andwidow(er) hood. The
system is based on the principles of mutuality, solidarity and past labor (accumulated rights
relating to years of active attachmentto the labor force). Iti s funded on a Pay-As-You-Go basis.

The range of benefits that are covered by the PI0 include:
0    RetirementPension
0    DisabilityPension
0    Family Pension(survivors pension)
      Cash benefit for bodily injuries (occupational injuries benefiudisablement pension)

                                   Annex 4: DetailedProject Description
 SERBIAAND MONTENEGRO: MontenegroPensionsSystemAdministrationInvestmentProject


Within the government there has emerged a consensus on the needed improvements of the data
reporting system for social contributions that would complement the system of consolidated
collection in DPR and provide a basis for stronger collection and better compliance. These
improvements include: creation of central registries of insured individuals and contribution
payers (in DPR), establishing a single-point registration system for insured individuals and
contribution payers, monthly reporting on taxes and contributions paid for each insured
individual (monthly OPD3 form) to the DPR, and central control function inthe DPR.

Inaddition to creating a framework for improvement incompliance, the central registration and
data collection institution would have to provide timely reports to other systems in accordance
with their data needs.13 Procedures and responsibilities for a more frequent unified reporting,
collection and control of tax and social contributions, reporting responsibilities, central registries
transactions and update would best be regulated through a separate Law on Consolidated
Reportingand Control on Contributions, PersonalIncome Tax and Surtax that would be drafted
bythe Government inthe first halfof2004 and enactedby the Parliament by end-2004.14

By the endof 2004, DPR would haveto be fully equippedto collect, control and enforce pension
and other social contributions, forward contributions paid to PI0 in a timely manner, and other
extra budgetary funds, and by 2006, to prepare corresponding reports on individualized
contribution payment. Inthe interim period, the DPR would, following the new law, establish
central databases o f insured individuals and contribution payers, procedures for updating
individual data, data dissemination requirementsto extra budgetary funds, procedures for one-
stop registration of new insured individuals and contribution payers and other procedures
required for smooth operations of the consolidated administrative system. In this Law, the
Government may also consider to harmonize provisions on contribution control scattered
throughout other material laws andoverride the conflicting discrepancies.l5

In order to respond fully to these Government objectives and the laws being proposed, the
project envisagesthree components:

Component 1:IncreasingTax and ContributionCompliance (US$3.6 millionofwhich
US$2.4million is IDA financed)

Underthis component there are two major areas of strengthening:


l3For example, health laws link the benefit provision to an information on contribution payment for the insured
individual inthe period o f preceding three month. Similar provisions are considered in the employment and social
assistance systems. Finally, a participant inthe pension system is not eligible for accruing a year o f service unless
the contributionhas beenpaid.
l4Inaddition to laws on tax procedures, reportingrequirements have been regulated indomicile laws separately for
each social contribution. Such a separate legislation would unify the procedures across taxes and contributions and
override the redundant procedures without amending the domicile laws.
l5For example, recent labor legislation had allowed labor inspectors to perform control o f contributions paid,
despite existing tax laws that recognize only the DPRas the institution responsible for control.


                                                        33

Establishment of Unified Contribution Collection System. This sub-component would put in
place a modern infrastructure to process the flow of data and contributions from the FundPIO,
Health Fund, and the Unemployment Bureau to the DPR. The component would simplify the
procedures for payment filing and declarations, introduce electronic filing for large taxpayers,
and institute targeted audits (audits for cause) and random audits in lieu of periodic audits. It
would improve filing procedures to include information for the client database.

Development of a Client Data Base and other Information Systems. This sub-component
would create the client database o f individualized recordsnecessaryfor a modernpension system
ina market economy andfor the fkture reformof the pension system. Itwould also finance the
development and implementation of automation systems and infrastructure for the DPR
necessary to ensure efficient and effective delivery of services. It would improve client services
in the DPR as well make inquiries easier and service faster. In addition, it would facilitate
working out potential problems in assigning individual records, supplementing current
procedures to appeal benefit determinations. It would also support database infrastructure
development for employment programs for the MOLSAF, and for social assistance, social
welfare, and workplace safety for the MOLSAF for program monitoring and analysis.

The key activities under this component would include:
0   Consolidation o f contribution collection, control and enforcement hnctions inDPR. Project
    would provide TA, equipment and training for creating additional capacity in DPR and
    establishing proceduresfor integration.
    Creating central registry on tax and contribution payers including central registration of new
    companies, selfemployed and farmers with data dissemination to all involvedinstitutions.
    Creating a central registry on insured individuals and individual taxpayers with a central
    registration feature and data dissemination to all involved institutions.
    Implementing integrated and more frequent reporting on personal income tax and social
    contributions.
0   Installation of new accounting and control procedures, and new management information
    systems.
0   Development of individual accounts, and collection and dissemination o f individual earnings
    information.

Support under the project would include Technical assistance for developing a model for
unifying registration and collections; and investments in hardware and software for information
system implementation.

Component2: Restructureand Modernizethe Fund PI0(US$2.0 millionofwhich $1.5millionis
IDA financed)

This component which envisagesthe modernization and restructuring ofthe FundPIO, will build
on the existing work done by the USAIDwhich has been involvedindiagnosis o fthe agency and
has preparedplansfor its restructuring for over two years now.

Restructuring the FundPI0 i s designedto:



                                                 34

0  Improve the service to contributors by reducing the points o f contact for transactingbusiness
   through the introduction of Unified Registration, UnifiedData and Contribution Collection,
   UnifiedControl and Enforcement, all transferredto DPR.
0  Improve the service to insured individuals and beneficiaries by accurately maintaining a
   registry of insured individuals and beneficiaries with reconciled individual earnings history
   andbenefitpayments history.
0  Reduce the cost of public administration and eliminate duplicate processes and instead focus
   the agency on its core business processes i.e. data and contribution collection (actually
   outsourcedto DPR), eligibility of insuredindividuals, andpayment of grantedbenefits.
0  Implementrecently enactedLaw ofpensionanddisability insurance.

This component would require: Reviewing the core functions o fthe FundPI0 inlight of the new
law and establishing core processes and procedures that underlie these core functions.
Eliminating duplicative functions and streamlining the processes to improve services to
pensionerswould bepart of this.
0  Developing systems to accurately maintain registries of contributors and beneficiaries and
   database of individual earnings history.
0  Developing information systemto regularly inform systemparticipants on contributions paid.
0  OrganizatiodApplication software implementation, i.e. technical assistance for improving
   basic functions o fthe Fund, PIO.
0  Investment in equipment requiredto modernize core functions of the P I 0 and develop new
    organizational structure o f PIO.
0   Training programs to support the newrole of PIO.

Key Activities under this component would include:
   Mapping core business processes needed to implement recently enacted16 Law of Pension
    andDisability Insurance.
   Designing new P I 0 organi~ation'~compliant to mapped core business processeseliminating
    duplicative functions, reducing complexity o f reporting and collection system and improving
    services to contributors, insuredindividuals andbeneficiaries.
    Identifying staff positions needed to populate the new organizational structure and writing
   job descriptions for all staff positions (EC).
   Assessing IT needs required to implement mapped core business processes and to support
   redesignedPI0 organization. Develop IT Strategy and Implementation Plan.
    Mapping UnifiedData and Contribution Collection in DPR compliant to generally accepted
    Revenue module'*.
    Mapping Data and Contribution Exchange between DPR and PI0 presented in Extended
    Revenue Model i.e. Unified Data and Contribution Collection Model (Unified Collection
    Model).

Component3: Develop and Strengthen InstitutionalCapacityfor PensionPolicy(US$0.6 millionof
whichUS$0.5 millionis IDA financed)

This component hastwo sub-components:

(Q Develop capacity to supervise private pension funds. This sub-component has two areas
where strengtheningis most needed.

(a) strengthening supervision capacity in the Ministry of Finance. The team was informed
that the issue of financial non-bank supervision has been intensively discussed in Montenegro.
While the NBM remains in charge of bank supervision, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in charge of privatization (and future investment) fund supervision, the new draft
Law on Insurance designates an independent Agency for insurance supervi~ion.'~The current
Insurance supervision Department inthe Ministryo f Finance consists of a staff on three and is in
high demandof training, education and equipment. Untilestablishment of the Agency, expected
in 2005, this Department will be responsible for legal and supervision work of insurance and
pension systems. Finally, it can be expected that the Agency would emerge from this seed
Departmentinthe Ministry. Followingthat assumption, this component should start by focusing
on strengthening supervision and legislative capacity o f the Department for Insurance
Supervision. The key activities under this subcomponentwould include:
      Proposedinvestment inequipment, TA andtraining over the project cycle.
0     Investment in equipment is proposed to provide computer hardware (server and three work
      stations) and specialized supervision software.

(b) strengtheningpensionpolicy capacity inthe Ministry of Labor and SocialAffairs.
TA proposed by the team includes foreign consultants on legal, actuarial and pension system
issues, and local consultants on legal, demographic and actuarial issues. TA i s expected to be
engaged in producing legal and supplementary acts needed to regulate and supervise private
pension funds. This component would be executed by the Pension Policy Department at the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and should result increating capacity and analytical tools
such as a pension model to analyze and forecast pension policy in the Ministry. Inaddition to
investment needs in the Department, the team identified a serious shortage of staff and thus
proposed that the project would also support staffing o f consultants in the Department via
participating inthe recurrent costs. The activities covered would include:
0       Proposedinvestmentcosts for hiringof consultants.


l9 Legal status ofthe Agency has not beenfully identifiedyet, which depends ofthe Agency's fmancing sources. If
the Agency is to be predominantlyfee-financed, it might be decidedthat it becomes fully independent. If,however,
it is financed from the Budget,the Agency could get the status of anextemal departmentofthe MinistryofFinance.


                                                        36

0    Investment in equipment, training, and TA. TA proposed by the team includes foreign
     consultants on actuarial modeling, and local consultants on modeling macroeconomic,
     demographic and actuarial processes. TA is expected to result in a pension model that will
     be used by the Department, manuals for its operation and trained staff to run it. Training
     budget is proposed to include two study tours to countries with model PAYGO and funded
     systems, and individual courses on actuarial modeling, macroeconomic/pension policy and
     programming and computer skills.

ii.  Public education campaign. Key activities under this sub-component would include:
0    BroadPR and education campaign would aim to promote the goals of the pension reform in
     Montenegro, to strengthen public support for the pension reform process, including
     expected additional pillars in the future, and to widen public awareness of a need to
     voluntarily save for the retirement. This component i s to be executedby the PensionPolicy
     Department at the Ministryo f Labor and Social Affairs.
0    This component is envisagedto be outsourcedto a specialized PR company and include PR
     and education consultancy, opinion polls, development of PR and education materials and
     publications, analyzing focus groups and campaign outreach, TV and radio time,
     workshops, lectures, and developing tools for individual assessment o f the pension reform
     outcomes.

Component 4: Project Coordination (US$0.3 millionofwhich US$0.2 million is IDA financed)

This component would support the coordination of project activities and would involve the
hiring of a local consultant to serve as a Project Coordinator who will be supervised by the
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Financial Systems and Public Expenditures (ODPM). ,
As the need arises, an Administrative Assistant may also be hired to assist the Project
Coordinator.

The beneficiary agencies (Le. the DPR for Component 1, the PI0 for Component 2 and the
MOLSA and MOF for Component 3) would beresponsible for the implementation of the project
and for providing substantive input in. To facilitate the implementation and monitoring of the
project by the implementing agencies, focal points would be drawn from each of the named
agencies, and will be appointed as members of an expert working group. They will work with
the Project Coordinator and the central Technical Services Unit (TSU) under the Office of the
Prime Minister and who will responsible for providing core procurement and financial
management services for this project and all other Bank-financed projects. The costs of the TSU
are beingfinanced under the Health SystemImprovement Project (HSIP).

The ODPM would be responsible for coordination of the project activities. To support the
coordination tasks, a full-time Project Coordinator and, as needed, an Administrative Assistant,
will be hired The beneficiary agencies (i.e. the DPR for Component 1, the P I 0 for Component
2 andthe MOLSA and MOF for Component 3) would be responsible for the implementation and
management o fthe project.

To ensure smooth implementation o f the Project, a high-level Steering Committee has been
established by Government Resolution and made responsible for strategic decisions on project
implementation, coordination and monitoring. The Steering Committee is chaired by the Deputy
Prime Minister for Financial Systems and Public Expenditures and is composed o f the Minister
o f Finance, the Minister o f Labor and Social Affairs, Heads o f the DPR and P I 0 and other
agencies involved in the Project (Health Fund, Unemployment Fund, Statistics Agency, and
Secretariat for Development), plus the Head o f the TSU. The Steering Committee will meet
regularly at least on a monthly basis, or more frequently as the need arises.

Inaddition, focal points would be drawn from each of the named Implementing Agencies, and
will be appointed as members o fan expert working group to further facilitate the implementation
andmonitoring ofthe project bythe implementing agencies. The focal points will work with the
Project Coordinator and the central Technical Services Unit (TSU) which was recently
established by the GOM under the Office o f the Prime Minister and who will responsible for
providing core procurement and financial management services for this project and all other
Bank-financed projects. This TSU has been established with Terms o f References (TORS) that
define clear boundaries o f responsibility between the line Ministries and the TSU, giving the
respective line Ministries clear overall responsibility and decision-making authority, and making
the TSUaccountable to line Ministries for providing prompt, professional services.

SERBIAAND MONTENEGRO: MontenegroPensionsSystemAdministrationInvestmentProject


CountryIssues

The SAM CFAA report notes that there are a number o frisks on the management o fpublic funds
in SAM. The risks to the public finds include: (a) poor public sector financial management in
the past, (b) unfinished reforms - the new governments that were elected have commenced a
process o f major reform, which looks good as designed, but it i s still too early to say if the
reforms will be totally successful, (c) capacity constraints in both the Federal and Republic
governments, (d) weak banking sectors, (e) weak audit capacity, (f) poor implementation
capacity in line ministries, and (g) the lack o f recent Bank implementation experiences within
SAM. Since re-joining the membership o f the World Bank, S A M has been using individual
implementation units for each investment project (traditional PIU model), located within the
relevant line ministries or project beneficiaries, to mitigate some o fthese risks.

During the period since the CFAA was published, the number o f commercial banks assessedas
acceptable to hold Special Accounts has increased from 3 to 5 and the number o f firms assessed
as acceptable to audit Bank-financed projects has increased from 2 to 4, indicating an
improvement inthe fiduciary environment. Experience in implementing Bank-financed projects
i s increasing but the lending portfolio is still too young to be able to conclude that the Borrower
has a thorough understandingo f Bankoperations.

ImplementingEntity

Beneficiary agencies (i.e. the DPR for Component 1, the P I 0 for Component 2, and the MOLSA
and MOF for Component 3) will manage, implement and monitor the implementation o f their
respective components. Project coordination and support will be conducted through the ODPM,
who will hire a local consultant to serve as a Project Coordinator. If needed at a later stage, an
Administrative Assistant will also be hired.

To ensure smooth implementation o f the Project, a high-level Steering Committee has been
established by Government Resolution and made responsible for strategic decisions on project
implementation, coordination andmonitoring. The Steering Committee is chaired by the Deputy
Prime Minister for Financial Systems and Public Expenditures and is composed o f the Minister
of Finance, the Minister o f Labor and Social Affairs, Heads o f the DPR and PI0 and other
agencies involved in the Project (Health Fund, Unemployment Fund, Statistics Agency, and
Secretariat for Development), plus the Head o f the TSU. The Steering Committee will meet
regularly at least on a monthly basis, or more frequently as the need arises. To facilitate the
implementation and monitoring o f the project by the implementing agencies, focal points would
be drawn from each o f the named agencies, and will be appointed as members of an expert
working group. They will work with the Project Coordinator and the central Technical Services
Unit(TSU).




                                                    41

The central TSU, recently established by the G O M inthe General Secretariat (Prime Minister's
Department), will be responsible for carrying out core procurement and financial management
functions for all future Bank-financed projects, and potentially for other donor-supported
projects. This TSU has been established with Terms o f References (TORS)that define clear
boundaries o f responsibility between the line Ministries and the TSU, giving the respective line
Ministries clear overall responsibility and decision-making authority, and making the TSU
accountable to line Ministries for providing prompt, professional services.         The costs o f
operatingthe TSU are being financed under the Health System Improvement Project (HSIP).

Strengths and Weaknesses

The staff o f the TSU have only limited experience o f WB procedures, however they do have
considerable experience of working with other donors and are technically competent. The recent
appointment o f a TSU Director has substantially strengthened the unit and the general control
environment.

FundsFlow

The International Development Association (IDA) would make funds available to the
Government o f Serbia and Montenegro (SAM) under a Credit Agreement, governing the terms
and conditions o fthe IDA credit and specifying the project. The Government o f SAMwould on-
lend the funds on IDA terms to the Republic o f Montenegro based on a Subsidiary Credit
Agreement with terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.

The following legal agreements will confirm the flow o f funds and the respective parties' roles
andresponsibilities:

0       TheDevelopment Credit Agreement, betweenIDAand Serbia andMontenegro (SAM);
0       The Sub-credit Agreement, between S A M and GoM;

The Sub-credit Agreement between S A M and G o M will be a condition o f effectiveness o fthe
Development Credit Agreement

A special account (SA) will be opened bythe MOF on behalf o fthe Project ina bank acceptable
to the Association. Project expenditures have not been fully budgeted by the General Secretariat
(Prime Minister's Office) for the first year o f operations and therefore funds cannot be disbursed
directly through the Treasury system. Hence, the MOF will also open a project account in the
same bank as the Special Account, into which counterpart funds will be transferred in full.
When a supplier payment falls due, the requisite amount o f funds will be transferred from the
Special Account to the project account, and a single payment will be made to the supplier. Bank
funds will be mingled with counterpart funds for not more than one business day.

Insubsequentperiods, the fullcost ofthe Project will bebudgeted bythe General Secretariat and
all payments will be made through the Treasury system. When a supplier payment falls due, the
requisite amount o f Bank funds, sittinginthe Special Account, will be deposited into an account




                                                  42

of the Treasury, and a single payment will be made to the supplier. Bank funds will be mingled
with counterpart funds for not morethanone business day.

Staffing of the AccountinglFinance Function

The TSU has an accountant/disbursement officer with several years of experience as a financial
manager in both the commercial and non-profit sectors. The TSU is currently servicing the
Health System Improvement Project. TSU capacity is adequate to manage the transactions of
both the Health and the Pensions projects. As more projects become effective, resources are
available to increasethe capacity ofthe TSU.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

As part ofthe preparation for the Healthproject, an operations manual was preparedby the TSU
and approved by the Bank. With only minor changes, this manual will describe the operations,
procedures andpolicies inrespectofthe (PSAIP).

The TSU will prepareproject financial reports onthe cashbasis.

Reporting and Monitoring

The TSU will prepare financial monitoring reports (FMRs) on a quarterly basis. The FMRswill
initially include:

0       Project Sources and Uses of Funds
e       Uses of Fundsby Project Activity
0       SpecialAccount Statement
    e   Procurement report

The first Financial Monitoring Report will be furnished to the IDA not later than 45 days after
the end of the first calendar quarter after the Effective Date, and will cover the period from the
Effective Date to the end o f the first calendar quarter. Draft FMRformats have been agreedwith
the TSUand are included inthe operations manual.

Information Systems

The TSU has installed an off-the-shelf accounting package, designed for small business users.
This package runs under MS Windows XP, contains adequateuser accesscontrols and is capable
of automatically generating FMRs2'. The same software is currently being used to manage the
Healthproject and other Bank-financed projects inSAM, and a number of other agencies will be
adopting it to manage forthcoming Bank-financedprojects.

With assistance from USAIDand EAR, the Treasury department o fthe MOF of Montenegro has
installed andis operating SAP (budget, treasury and general ledger modules). Initial discussions
indicate that it would be possible to incorporate the Bank-financed Projects into SAP and for the


2oProcurement planning reports are not integrated-these will be maintained on a spreadsheet.


                                                      43

system to generate all reports requiredby the Bank (a number of "programme budgeting" pilots
are currently running - the Bank-financed projects are analogous to identified "programmes").
The Bank and the TSU will work with Treasury and its IT group to develop the Project reporting
system, with a target implementation date o f January 1, 2005. Until such time as the Bank and
the Borrower are satisfied that the Treasury system is capable of producing reliable FMRs, the
TSU will continue to maintainrecords inits existing system i.e. there will be a period of parallel
operation. If,inthe final analysis, it is not feasible to use the Treasury systemto produce Project
reports, the TSU will continue, throughout the life of the Project, to maintain accounts on its
existing system.

The Ministryof Finance of Montenegro would be responsible for initiating the move to report-
based disbursements. This would be done via a written request to the Association when the
following criteriahave beenmet:

    The Republic of Montenegro has establishedthat report-baseddisbursementwould be amore
    efficient mode o f disbursement;

    The Republic of Montenegro has for at least two quarters provided the Association with
    accurate forecasts (plus/minus 10 percent) of quarterly disbursements, prior to moving to
    report-baseddisbursement;

    The Republic of Montenegro has providedtimely and accurate quarterly financial monitoring
    reports for project expenditures in a format similar to that agreed in the Technical Services
    Unit Operations Manual for at least two quarters, prior to moving to report-based
    disbursement.

SupervisionPlan

The project implementation progress reports will be monitored in detail during regular
supervision missions. FMRswill be reviewedon a regularbasisby the Belgrade-basedFMS and
any issues arising will be followed up promptly. The frequency o f on-site FM supervision
missions will be determined basedon the Project's FMrisk rating, which will be generatedusing
the ECA's financial management risk model. Audited financial reports of the Project will be
reviewedandidentifiedissues followed up.

ExternalAudit

The Director ofthe TSUwill be responsible for ensuringthat the project financial statements and
the financial statements of the Pension and Disability Fund (Fund PIO) are audited by an
independent auditor acceptable to the IDA, in accordance with standards on auditing that are
acceptableto the IDA. TORSfor the audit of the project financial statements, inaccordancewith
International Standards on Auditing, are included in the operations manual, as i s the list of
auditors that have beenunconditionally pre-qualified to audit IDA funded projects inSAM. The
cost ofthe audit will be financed from the proceeds of the credit.

The following chart identifies the audit reports that will be required to be submitted by the
Borrower together with the due date for submission.

The Directorate of Public Revenues, a beneficiary under the project, is audited as part of the
annual audit o f the consolidated Republican Budget. The audit i s performed by an independent
external audit firm. A copy of the audited consolidated budget report will be provided to the
Bank

DisbursementArrangements

The project is expected to be implemented over a period of four years, which includes six
months for the completion o f accounts andthe submission ofwithdrawal applications.

Disbursementsfrom the IDA credit will initially follow the transaction-based method, Le., the
traditional IDA procedures including reimbursementswith full documentation, direct payments,
SOE procedures and special commitments. It is anticipatedthat the project will migrate to report
baseddisbursementduring2005.

To facilitate timely project implementation, the MOF will establish, maintain and operate, under
conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in Euro, in a bank acceptable to hold
Special Accounts.

An initial Special Account allocation of 80,000 will be established. The authorized allocation
of the Special Account will be 170,000, once the aggregate disbursements of the Credit total
SDR 410,000 or more. Replenishment applications should be submittedby the TSUmonthly or
when one third of the funds of the SA have beenused, whichever occurs first, and must include
reconciled bank statementsas well as other appropriate supporting documents.

Should the Project migrate to report based disbursement, the maximum balance that may be
maintained on the Special Account will no longer be limited to the authorized allocation.
Transfers from the Credit Account to the Special Account will be made on a quarterly basis, in
accordance with the Borrower's (TSU's) forecast of expenditures to be made via the Special
Account during the subsequent two quarters. Requests for replenishment will be supported by
"Expanded FMRs" (regular FMRs plus a number of additional schedules) and copies of Special
Account bank statements. The project will not migrate to report based disbursementuntil such
time as the Bank is satisfied that the Borrower is able to produce Expanded FMRs and to
accurately forecast expenditures.

Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing of up to SDRl80,OOO would be applied to
expenditures made after June 1, 2004 for (a) consultant services for extending the functionality
of tax and pension system; and (b) incremental operating cost related to local fees for a Project
Coordinator.



                                                               45

Financial Covenants

The Borrower is responsible for ensuring the maintenance o f a satisfactory Project Financial
Management System, includingrecords and accounts, and for ensuringthat financial statements
are preparedin accordance with accounting standards satisfactory to the Bank. The Borrower i s
responsible for ensuring annual project accounts and audit reports are provided to the Bank
withinfive months of each fiscal year (withthe audit to be carried out by independentauditors in
accordancewith International Standards onAuditing, and TORSsatisfactory to the Bank).

The Borrower is responsible for ensuring that quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)
are prepared, which will include, at a minimum:

0   A statement of sourcesanduses of funds for the Project showing year to date and cumulative
    amounts and explains variances betweenthe actual and planneduses of such funds;

0   A statement of the Special Account, showing the opening balance, movements during the
    period andthe closingbalance; and

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: MontenegroPensionsSystemAdministrationInvestmentProject


General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description of the
Procurement Arrangement involving international competition are summarized in Table A For
each contract to be financed by the Credit, the different procurement methods or consultant
selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and
time frame are agreed betweenthe Borrower andthe Bankproject team inthe ProcurementPlan
inTable B. The Procurement Planwill be updatedat least annually or as requiredto reflect the
actual project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutionalcapacity.

Other procurement information, including capability o f the implementingagency and the IDA'S
reviewprocess etc. is presentedinTable B1andTable B2. The project will be financed from the
proceeds o f the proposed US$5.0 million IDA credit and the local expenditure contributions
from the Government o f Montenegro (US$l.599 million). The total cost of the project would be
US$6.556 million.

1.     Procurementof Goods andTechnicalServices

Goods and related technical services consisting o f information systems/technologies, computer
hard-wares would be grouped to the extent possible and considering project objectives, in
package sizes that would encourage competitive bidding.             The following methods of
procurement would be followed:

(9     International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used for contracts
       above US$100,000 equivalent for the procurement of computer equipment, system
       software andtechnical services.

(ii) Shopping. Thisprocedurewouldbeusedfor off-the-shelf goodssuchasofficeand
       computer equipment and technical services for public education campaign relating to
       pension reform, estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO per contract. Shopping, which
       requires to obtain three quotations, i s used here because more competitive methods are
       not justified on the basis o f cost or efficiency. The ECA Regional sample format for
       shopping "Invitation to Quote" available on the ECA Procurement Web Site will be
       applied.

(iii) DirectContracting(DC)wouldbeused,subjecttotheBank'spriorapproval,toprocure
       spare parts or equipment of a proprietary nature.




                                                47

2.     Selection of Consulting Services

Contracts shall be packaged for consulting services from firms and individuals required for
increasing tax and contribution compliance, restructuring of pension fund system, strengthening
capacity for pension policies and project management, etc. Short lists of consultants for services
estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of
national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines. The following methods ofprocurement would befollowed:

       Quality and Cost-based Selection (QCBS) procedures would be used for contracting
       consulting services for extending the functionality of the tax andpension systems.

       Consultant Qualification procedures would be used for contracting most qualified firms
       for public education campaign relating to pension reform and training (workshop) under
       us$loo,ooo.

       Least Cost Selection procedureswould be used for auditingservices contracts for annual
       audit throughout the life ofthe project.

       Individual Consultants would be hired in accordance with Section V o f the Guidelines.
       Individual consultants would be hired for small assignments of short-term duration for
       consulting servicesrelated to tax andpensionpolicy restructuring and capacity building.

       Single Source procedures would be used for direct contracting very specialized, low
       value contracts inthe areas o fpension reform.

       Expensesfor the study tours under the project relatedto the project will be covered under
       training category anddisbursed basedon SOE.

       Incremental Operating Costs

The operating costs, which would be financed by the project, would be procured using the
implementation agency's administrative procedures which were reviewed and found acceptable
by the IDA.

5.     Notification of Business Opportunities

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be publishedin the UN "Development Business''
on -line (UNDBonline) and inthe Development Gateway's dgMarket around the periodof Credit
Negotiation.   For ICB goods contracts and large-value consultants contracts (more than
US$200,000), Specific Procurement Notice would be advertised in the Development Business
on-line (UNDBonline) and in the Development Gateway's dgMarket and national press, and in
the case o fNCB, ina major localnewspaper (inthe national language).




                                               48

6.      Review by the IDA of ProcurementPlan

Procurement Plan. The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been
agreedbetweenthe Borrower and the Project Team on April 25,2004 and is available at the TSU
office. Itwill also be available inthe Project's database and inthe Bank's external website. The
ProcurementPlanwill be updated inagreement with the Project Team annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutionalcapacity.

Procurement o f goods and services for the project would be carried out in accordance with the

7.      Prior Review

0)      Goods and Technical Services: Prior review of biddingdocuments, including review of
        evaluation, recommendation of award and contract would be conducted for all ICB and
        DC.

(ii) ConsultingServices: Requests for Proposal(RFP), short lists, terms ofcondition of
        contracts as well as evaluation reports and recommendation for award would be prior
        reviewed by IDA for contracts for individual consultants above US$25,000 and firms
        above US$50,000. All documents and recommendations involving single source for
        firms and sole source for individual consultant contracting would be subject to IDA prior
        review. Terms o f reference for consulting assignments may be reviewed by the Project
        Team.

After award of contracts, should any materialmodifications or waiver ofterms andconditions of
a contract resulting in an increase or decrease above 15 percent of the original amount, IDA
would undertake a prior review of such modifications (including modifications to contracts for
consulting services).

8.      CustomDuties andTaxes

All custom duties and taxes for goods specifically imported for the project and for all technical
assistance would be financed by the Borrower.

9.      Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement

Overall responsibility for project coordination would rest with the Project Coordinator under the
Office of Deputy Prime Minister. The Project Coordinator would be supported by the central
Technical Services Unit(TSU) consisting o f Head, Procurement Specialist and Accountant. An
assessment of the capacity of the TSU has been carried out by Yingwei Wu in December 2003.
The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the
interaction betweenthe TSU and the line ministries. This report indicates "High" risk based on
the fact that TSU has little experience with World Bank procurement, andthe procurement staff

hired inTSU is untrainedand unfamiliarwith World Bank procurement practices. The capacity
of the TSU without outside support and immediate training would be inadequate to handle the
procurement activities workload under the project. Therefore, procurement training plan and
hiring of an international procurement advisor are recommended to assist in building
procurement capacity for the project.

Most ofthe issues/ risks concerning the procurement for implementation ofthe project have been
identified. FWPs and bidding documents for the first year of project implementation are being
prepared and ICB for procurement of computer equipment and system software as shown in
Table A1 would be ready prior to the negotiation. RFPs under two QCBS packages inTable A2
would not be feasible for the borrower to develop before Board presentation for manyreasons. It
i s assessed that the Client does not have the necessary level of technical knowledge and
experience to produce the detailed specification neededfor the terms of reference for a complex
application development. This will have to be created by the individual consultant assignment
planned under retroactive financing in the procurement plan in Table Bywhich will last for a
minimumofthree months.

Basedon assessment of the capacity for procurement administration of the project, the following
Action Plan to strengthen the procurement administration capacity of the TSU and the Project
Coordinator is recommended:

1.      An international procurement advisor hired under the funding of the PHRD for
        Montenegro Health SystemImprovement Project, shall assist the Project Coordinator and
        the TSU in undertaking tasks under this project, for logistical planning, development of
        procurement plans, training plan, and preparation of operating procedures and standard
        bidding documents for procurement activity.

2.      The Project Coordinator and the TSU Head and Procurement Specialist would be given
        the opportunity to receive on-job training on Bank procurement by the international
        procurement advisor and at Bank's regional procurement workshop.

3.      Initiating a Project Launch Workshop in September2004 before the credit effectiveness,
        as part o f the project implementatiodcapacity building initiatives, especially in
        procurement.

4.      The project would be subject to the intensified supervision by the Bank. Duringthe first
        year ofproject implementation, there would be at least two supervisionmissions.

5.      Periodic ex-post reviewbythe Bank of 1in5 contracts duringthe supervision missions.

                          Overall ProcurementRiskAssessment: High

(a) Impactof Reformon the PIO's Budget

The impact o f the newreforms (as introduced under the new laws introduced inSeptember 2003,
and effective since January 2004) on the FundPIO's budget i s presented inthe table below. The
results are presented in three separate reform "layers", to provide a sense o f the relative
importance o f each o f the three primary reform measures.

                ImpactofReformonPIO's Budget (Valuespresentedas % of GDP)22




Section A o f the table shows the gap between contributions and expenditures, and Section B
shows contributions plus the transfer for official Budget obligations, minus expenditures. Thus,
the values insection B represent the projecteddeficits o f the pension system. Inthe "no reform"
scenario, these deficits would have grown to more than 10 percent o f GDP by 2050. If the
retirement ages are increased by 5 years, the deficits will grow to 7 percent of GDP. If, in
addition to the retirement age increase, pensions are indexed at half the rate o f wage growth plus
half the ratio o f inflation, the deficit will grow to about 4.5 percent o f GDP. Finally, if the full
reform package as has been adopted, the long-run deficit will be about 2 percent o f GDP.

The forecasts o f the preceding table are based on the assumptionthat real wages will grow at a
steady rate o f 2.5 percent per year. Faster economic growth would generate stronger fiscal
results, while weaker economic growth would generate less favorable fiscal results. Below,
comparison is made of fiscal forecasts under three different sets of assumptions: real wage
growth of 1.5 percent (pessimistic), real wage growth of 2.5 percent (base case), and real wage
growth of 3.5 percent (optimistic). For the sake of simplicity, only the results for the full reform
package are shown (rather than for each separate layer of reform), and only the deficits of the
pension system (which are equal to contributions plus the 1.9 percent of GDP transfer, minus
expenditures).

                             Forecast Scenarios for the Pension System




Under the pessimistic scenario, the system runs long run deficits of nearly 3 percent of GDP.
Under the optimistic scenario, long run deficits are merely 1.3 percent of GDP. Under the
pessimistic scenario, a transition to a two-pillar system would be very challenging, because the
temporary surpluses are not large. The introduction of a second pillar could easily consume
these small surpluses, possibly driving the system into deficit. In contrast, under the optimistic
scenario, atransition to a two-pillar systemcould be well withinreach.

The following assumptions were usedfor forecastingthe impact ofreforms:
     The costs of providing care for disabled and blind persons will decline gradually, over the
     next 25 years, from 0.22 percent o f GDP to 0.0 percent of GDP. A decline to zero is
     inevitable because the reformprohibits the award of newbenefits of this type.
     The cost of benefits for bodily injurywill remain fixedat 0.15 percent of GDP.
     Annual benefits for funeral costs will equal 1.3 percent of annual pension expenditures.
     Wage subsidies for persons with shortened working hours or persons waiting for re-
     employment will decline from 0.15 percent of GDP to 0.0 percent of GDP over the next 10
     years. A decline to zero is inevitable because the reform prohibits the award of new
     benefits of this type.
     The cost of rehabilitation, cultural programs, and accommodation for pensioners will drop
     from 0.15 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 0 percent of GDP in 2004, because the law will
     eliminate these benefits.
     Pension delivery costs will decline from 0.23 percent of GDP to 0.13 percent of GDP over
     the next5 years, as efforts are madeto improve efficiency.
     PI0 labor costs will remain fixed at 0.23 percent of GDP, and supply costs will remain
     fixed at 0.21 percent o f GDP.
     The budget transfer for expenditures that are an obligation of the budget is assumed to
     remain fixed at 1.94percent o f GDP.



                                                 57

(b) Impact of the Reform on the Levelof Pensions

Pensions o f the current stock o f pensioners will rise inreal terms inthe future. Under the new
reforms, pensions rise at the rate o f nominal wage growth plus half the rate o f inflation. To
illustrate the impact o f reform, let us assume that inflation i s 3 percent per year and wage growth
i s 6 percent per year. A pensioner who currently receives a pension o f 100 Euros would receive
the following stream o f pensions inthe future:

                        Example ofPension Growth for a Current Pensioner




Note that under the new law, the pension continues to grow in real terms. Thus, purchasing
power for the stock o f current pensioners will increase over time.

Pensions for future retirees will probably remain fairly constant inreal terms for about ten years,
and then begin to rise. Duringthe next decade, the expansion o f the earnings period from 10 to
40 years will have a downward impact on pensions for new pensioners.                    However, this
downward force will be counterbalanced by the indexation o f the point, which will increase in
value at half the rate o f inflation plus half the rate o f wage growth. An example based on
inflation o f 3 percent and wage growth o f 6 percent is presented in the table below. The first
entry in the table i s 100 Euros, for 2003, which roughly corresponds to the pension that an
average worker would receive for 25 years o f service.

           Comparison of Pensionsof Stock of Pensionerswith Pensionsof Future Retirees




The reform is likely to result ina slight, short-term decline inthe real value of pensions for new
retirees, while the stock o f existing pensioners will experience a rise in the value o f their
pensions. Thus, today's pensioners are treated more favorably than future retirees. This i s a
consequence o f the switch from a 10-year earnings period to a 40-year earnings period.

(c) Impact of PensionReform on the overall FiscalBalance of the Pension System

Looking at stocks rather than flows, the overall NPV o f the system (all pension-related revenues
minuspension-related expenditures) shouldmoveinapositive directionas aresult ofreforms.

The following table shows how the overall fiscal balance of the pension system is affected by
reform. The table gives stock numbers, expressed inpresent value terms.



                                                                       NPV using          NPV using CPI
                                                                     GDP growth as          plus 5% as
                                                                   the Discount Rate     the Discount Rate
            1. Reformed Mono-Pil1arz4                                      4%                   9%


The table shows two sets ofNPVs. The first set is calculated usingGDP growth as the discount
rate. This methodology gives equal weighting to all future cash flows as a percentage of GDP.
This methodology yields NPVs that can easily be converted into average annual cash flows. For
example, ifthe NPV o f revenues minus expenditures is negative 300 percent of GDP over a 100-
year period, this impliesan average annual deficit of 3 percent of GDP (300/100=3).

The second set of NPVs was calculated using inflation plus 5 percent as the discount rate. This
methodology i s the standard approach, and gives more weight to cash flows in the immediate
futurethanto cashflows inthe distant future.

                                                                       an
balance through pension reform, (ii)              improved tax compliance, (iii)improved services to
beneficiaries, (iv) improved services to payers, and (v) reduced administrative costs. It is easier
to identify the benefits from the project, however, than to develop estimates of the quantitative
importance o f eachof them.

Ultimately, the greatestbenefit of the project will be the ability to tightenthe administration both
on the collections and on the payments side. This project will support that result through the
development of a client database of personalized accounts, which is crucial to the administration
of the reform. How this project affects the extent of the sustainability of the pension system-
the ultimate goal of these reforms, cannot be calculated, without separating the effects of the real
economy versus the gains through administrative tightening. And, o f course, it would be
difficult to estimate these benefits with and without the project, but presumably better technical

23The term "T-Bills" refers only to those T-bills that are purchasedusingcontributions to the second pillar. Such T-
bills are used specifically to finance the introduction o f the second pillar and are hence an important component o f
 ension-related revenues and expenditures.
   A hypothetical second pillar with a 6 percent contribution rate, would help reduce the Government's financing
burden even more, leadingto NPV's o f9 percent and-14 percent under the two scenarios respectively.

assistance and a quicker implementation of better administration will allow SAM to reap the
benefits of reform faster and more efficiently.

Improvedservices to payers will include reducedreporting burdens, i.e., dealing with fewer tax
collection administrations and processes for contributions. The reductions will be larger for
institutions that habitually make timely tax payments and are most conscientious in
administering sick leave payments. However, requiringmonthly information on the earnings of
individualworkers will representan increasedreporting burdenon payers even ifthe reporting is
done through fully electronic media. On balance, these changes would be expected to reduce
reporting burdens.

A quantitative analysis of the direct benefits that are expected to accrue to providers and
beneficiaries from the Credit has not been undertaken. However, benefits are expected to be
significant, arising from more efficient administration of programs and the more effective
application of benefits,  as well as from incentives for greater contributions compliance and
program participation. These include:

1.      Improvements in the social insurance administration should strengthen the aggregate
        financial position o f the P I 0 and improve client services. The development of a general
        register based on individual reporting and new and enhanced business processes should
        result in an increase in collections and improve the flow of funds. Drawing on the
        experience of other countries, gains may be significant: in Croatia, the introduction of
        individual monthly reporting requirements increasedcollections from 78 percent to over
        90 percent. Improved general and financial management should increase the internal
        efficiency of P I 0 and further underpin better balance in revenue and expenditure flows,
        as should the introduction o f actuarial capacity, which will allow for better planning of
        activities. Better and more transparent information flows, and more timely and accurate
        payment of pensions, should enhance the well being o f participating workers and
        pensioners. There may also be a broader positive revenue effect on tax bases through
        potentially reducedincentives to remain inthe informal sector.

2.      Strengthening the social assistance administration will create a better capacity to
        target social assistance benefits at poor households, increasing the impact that such
        benefits have inalleviatingpoverty.

3.      The introduction of national data bases is likely to yield cost savings through the
        detection of the participationo f ineligible beneficiaries and overlapping benefits, as well
        as by encouraging the development of standardsfor data bases within the Government in
        order to promote more interchange of information.

4.      Strengtheningcapacity for policy analysis should increase efficiency and effectiveness
        inimprovingthe quality and standardsofbenefit provisionand enhancethe effective use
        of donor support through the provision of a coherent context for the application of donor
        funds.
