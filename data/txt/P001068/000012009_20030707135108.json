Lessons primarily convey\n            that the project was an inappropriate vehicle to tackle the\n            problems identified in the appraisal report, where major\n            cross-sectoral reforms, and improvements needed in the\n            private sector investment climate, could not be delivered by\n            a project of this size, which was therefore doomed to fail.\n            Likewise, physical constraints to evacuate produce to\n            markets, and bring inputs to farms, were of such enormous\n            proportions that they could not be adequately addressed by a\n            single sectoral project, in spite of the redesigned project,\n            which unsuccessfully tried to address this by refocusing on\n            only certain key bottlenecks. Such factors convey the need\n            to establish appropriate, and regularly updates to a clear\n            project implementation plan early on, which would have\n            helped the project unit focus its activities, and made\n            supervision easier. The Government needs to clearly\n            formulate, and implement a strategy that recognizes the\n            importance of the private sector, and supports the creation\n            of a favorable investment climate. No such strategy had been\n            formulated, and as a result, few foreign investors are\n            present, despite the relative advantage of Guinea in terms\n            of availability of arable land and water, and proximity to\n            major markets. The policy letter therefore became a tool\n            that was only used by the Bank for its internal processing\n            purposes. Moreover, a project seeking structural and\n            institutional reforms, cannot be implemented by an\n            independent project unit with only weak ties to Government;\n            rather, Government has to be actively involved and lead the process."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
