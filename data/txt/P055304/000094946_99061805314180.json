There are eight main components. The land and\n            building cadastre component prepares maps, improves\n            cadastral maps, installs computer linkages to the land\n            registry, and sets up a building register. The land register\n            component removes backlogs in land registry offices, assists\n            in computerization of the register, installs computer\n            linkages to the cadastre, and improves registration\n            procedures. The apartment registration development component\n            designs and tests an apartment registration system including\n            several pilot projects, The fourth completes development of\n            a land use monitoring system for European Union's\n            Common Agricultural Programme (EU CAP) in support of\n            Slovenia's accession to EU. The fifth component\n            develops a real estate property tax and valuation system and\n            tests in two municipalities. The sixth component improves\n            the legal framework for housing finance, including mortgage\n            system reform. The seventh component improves the legal\n            framework for property ownership and registration. The\n            eighth component coordinates the project, and develops an\n            information technology/information management strategy and a\n            cost recovery strategy."}, "docdt": "1999-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
