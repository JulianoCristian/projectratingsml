The project has\n            successfully upgraded the legal and regulatory framework for\n            real estate transactions, and put in place the\n            infrastructure to ensure a more efficient and effective land\n            administration system, more optimal spatial planning and\n            management, an effective land use monitoring system, and a\n            mass appraisal system for effective property taxation all\n            meeting EU requirements. Project rating are as follows :\n            project outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank and\n            Borrower performance is satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned are : a) program of training/workshops/study tours\n            was a valuable part of the capacity building under the\n            project; b) despite project complexity success was largely\n            due to the quality of the management of the project; c) the\n            importance of having a viable business model with clearly\n            defined performance based targets; d) property registration\n            must operate as a service to participants in the land market\n            and meet their needs; e) strong leadership and coordination\n            from the Surveying and Mapping Authority (SMA), and\n            consistent staffing and participation from all of the\n            ministries involved added up to a successful project; and e)\n            a chief registrar must be focused only on the land registry\n            offices, their issues and problems, and how to solve them."}, "docdt": "2005-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
