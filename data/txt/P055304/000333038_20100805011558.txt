      IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lending operations through field
work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other
in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is
sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the
public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
 instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
 ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with
the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report of the Real Estate Registration
Modernization Project in Slovenia. The project was approved in June 1999 and closed six
years later and as scheduled in June 2005. Actual project costs amounted to EURO 25
million ($3 1.2 million) compared with the appraisal estimate of EURO 27 million ($28.7
million). The project received a Bank Loan of EURO 14.1 million ($15.0 million equivalent)
At project closure, the Loan had been drawn down by EURO 12.9 million. The EU
contributed EURO 3.0 million to the project for technical assistance and computer
equipment. Government's counterpart financing was EURO 9.1 million. There were no
changes in project objectives and no major changes in components.

The report presents IEG findings based on review of the projects implementation completion
report, appraisal report, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant material; and a
mission to Slovenia in December 2009. The mission visited project sites, and held
discussions with government officials and agencies, project directors and staff, beneficiaries,
the private sector, key donors and NGOs.

The Real Estate Registration Modernization Project was chosen for assessment because the
project exhibits several interesting design features: first, Slovenia has adopted a multi-agency
approach to land administration, whereas a number of countries have all land administration
activities under one agency. Slovenia's experience would add understanding on the relative
merits of different institutional choices. Second, the project's actions to improve the
efficiency of land administration processes can be considered including issues encountered
and how they have been addressed. And third, Slovenia chose to include components such as
mortgage finance reform which complement but go beyond typical activities in a land
administration project. How this has fared would be of interest. This PPAR is undertaken as
part of a series of PPARs of several similar land administration projects in the ECA Region.

Following IEG procedures, copies of the PPAR were sent to relevant government officials
and agencies for their review and comments. Comments from the Borrower were taken into
account and included in Appendix D.

Summary
 This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the experience and lessons of the Real
 Estate Registration and Modernization Project (RERMP) in Slovenia. The project's objective
 was to: Improve the efficiency and effectiveness o real estate administration systems in
                                                    f
 Slovenia, including improvement o the real estate registration system, upgrading the legal
                                    f
framework for real estate transactions, establishment o an agricultural land use monitoring
                                                          f
 system to meet European Union accession requirements, and designing and testing of a
 market-based property tax and valuation system. This fitted well with the growth-oriented
 development strategy for Slovenia pursued by both the Slovenian Government and the Bank.
 Growth of the economy was below potential due to the country's cumbersome legal,
 regulatory and institutional framework, which resulted in an unsupportive business
 environment. Hence, the strategy was strongly focused on boosting the economy, with the
 private sector as the main engine of growth. Development of the land market was a
 fundamental part of the strategy. As a basic factor of production, land (and all immovable
 property) needed to be securely owned and readily tradable through an efficient market
 facilitated by effective land administration services. Another need was to prepare Slovenia
 for accession to the EU for which one requirement was the development of a land-use
monitoring system.

Slovenia's land administration was very far from satisfying these needs. Constraints
included: fragmented records of land ownership between different government agencies, and
discrepancies between such records; inadequate legislation and regulation; land and property
possession which was frequently without official records of ownership; infrequent land sales
as the buyer had no guarantee that the land was legitimately owned by the seller; low land
prices for the same reason; disincentives for productivity enhancing investment on the land
due to uncertainty of land ownership and therefore of returns to investment; and, very limited
acceptance by financial institutions of land as collateral for credit.

The overall project objective to improve Slovenia's land administration services was, thus, a
relevant part of Slovenia's development strategy. The project's four sub-objectives were also
relevant: improving the efficiency and effectiveness of land administration was a basic
requirement; establishing a satisfactory legal framework was essential to underpin the reform
actions; establishment of an agricultural land use monitoring system was one of the accession
requirements of the EU; and piloting a new real estate tax system would provide the base for
better fiscal management.

RERMP's design reflected the four sub-objectives but raised a number of issues. First, the
project was ambitious in the number and diversity of its components. There were eight
components, all justifiable in themselves but, taken together presenting a formidable
challenge for implementation. Further, most of the components were to be rolled out to
national coverage, and all of them were innovatory and unfamiliar to Slovenia. Second, the
project covered a swathe of activities, not just core land administration fuctions but also
activities such as a component to develop a mortgage finance system, usually considered
beyond the purview of a land administration project. Third, five institutions were involved in
                                              n



project implementation making coordination difficult. These factors alone made the project a
complex program to implement.

But even these complications were trumped by two overarching choices which proved to be
the dominating influences on RERMP's issues and implementation throughout, and even
beyond, the project period. The first issue was the acceptance by the Bank of Government's
strongly held view that land administration should remain under two separate agencies, the
current and historically long-standing system used in Slovenia, and also found in a number of
other countries. This "dual agency" system had cadastre under a land planning agency and
registration under the Supreme Court and its district courts. Bank experience in other
countries was that a single-agency approach was more effective than a dual agency, the main
factor being that coordination between activities was much easier and operations more
effective.

Nevertheless, the decision to go ahead with the project despite the known disadvantages of a
dual agency approach was justifiable in Slovenia's particular circumstances. The preparation
team accepted that one institution combining registration with cadastre was not a politically
acceptable option and went forward with a second-best institutional structure. There were
alternatives, amongst them: to walk away from the project; to maintain a dialogue while
waiting until a better institutional arrangement was found; or to adjust and downsize the
registration component. While all these options have their respective merits, the decision to
accept Government's dual agency institutional structure and go ahead without delay met the
pressing strategic need to enhance economic growth.

The second overarching issue was that land registration was one of many responsibilities of
the Supreme Court and district courts. The courts had no particular expertise in land
administration, and in any case had little time for it. At time of appraisal, this situation was
not expected to be a major issue, but as it turned out, the management of land registration by
the courts became the project's most critical problem. Insufficient staff working full-time on
land administration, and lack of full-time field supervisors, might have been predicted to be a
major constraint, and this turned out to be the case.

Project design did, however, establish a good coordination system, which partly mitigated
these problems. A senior level Program Council, and, for hands-on management, a Project
Coordination Office (the latter met weekly in the first years of the project) were established,
and served to improve inter-agency communication.

Another strategic choice in RERMP's design was the inclusion of several components that
were not central to land administration. Whereas a straightforward project focused on land
administration alone would typically be preferred, RERMP included a housing finance and
mortgage reform component, which is in the banking rather than land domain. Yet,
development of financial instruments in the property market is a core need for developing the
land market, and could enhance the market impact of land registration. As a consequence it
contributed to the RERMP's overarching goal to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
land administration. There can be no hard and fast rule for such ancillary components, if any,
but RERMP illustrates the potential benefits that might be present if the broader environment
for the land market is considered.

Despite RERMP's complexity and institutional issues, it was largely successful in meeting its
objectives. A good legal framework was set up and provided the legislative base for land
administration (Objective II), the land use monitoring system was established and met the
requirements for EU accession (Objective 111), and a property-based tax and valuation system
was designed (Objective IV). Improving the real estate registration system (Objecttive I) had
a mixed performance. On the cadastral side, all targets were achieved: 2000 cadastral maps,
nearly covering the country, were prepared as against a target of 1700 maps. The intended 44
registration offices were set up, and digitization and information technology were introduced.
Registration achievements were partial. Before RERMP, registration of land transactions
took over 20 months and there was a backlog of about 200,000 unsolved cases (registration
requests that had not been processed). This dysfunctional situation has been substantially
improved - average processing time is now 1 % months and the backlog has reduced to
50,000. Registration time in Slovenia is now comparable to the Eastern Europe and Central
Asia average, although it must be said that Slovenia still has substantial room for
improvement -for instance, registration takes less than two weeks in several ECA countries.

RERMP's Efficiency was Substantial. RERMP's objectives and implementation targets were
largely attained while project expenditures were EURO 25 million compared with the
appraisal estimate of project costs of EURO 27 million. Benefits were considerable. The
aggregate value of house mortgages grew from a minimal value ($15 million) before the
project to $100 million by 2005; the share of mortgage-based loans in total bank lending
grew from 14 percent in 1998 to 5 1 percent in 2003; and annual interest rates for mortgages
fell from 15 to 7 percent between 1998-2000 and 2004-05. The increases in the mortgage
market will mostly have been driven by macro-variables such as GDP growth and the general
investment climate. But the improving land administration service can be expected to have
played an important facilitating role (for instance, banks are reluctant to lend against land
collateral, when it is not certain whether the prospective borrower even owns the land).

Risks to Development Outcome are Moderate. Continued financial and political support by
Government will be required; hence a risk that successor governments might give less
priority to land administration. However, demand by clients for a good service would be a
counteracting force. The ultimate solution to such problems is for the service to be
financially self-sufficient, an area where Slovenia has made only modest progress.

RERMP's Outcome was Satisfactory overall, although implementation confronted a number
of difficulties, RERMP's's objectives were relevant, the project broadly met its objectives,
and its facilitating role in an expanding land market indicates its economic viability.

The performances of the Bank and borrower were Satisfactory albeit uneven. The Bank
brought good technical skills to the project, and applied these pragmatically, both during
preparation and implementation, to the particular situation in Slovenia - establishing a strong
coordination system, for instance, helped reduce the disadvantages of a multi-agency project.
The Government mustered the political support needed for the program, passed a number of
Acts required for the project and helped resolve difficulties. And the five agencies succeeded
in implementing their parts of the project. For the Supreme Court and the district courts, this
is still a work in progress, although performance is improving over time.
                                             xii

The project presented a number of strategic choices, and on the whole these were well
handled. Faced with a second-best institutional structure, the decision was made to go ahead
and some practical measures were taken to help coordinate the different agencies. Given the
strategic importance of developing an effective land administration service and preparing for
EU accession, the Bank went ahead. This was at risk of failure, but, even if only partially
successful, was in the best interests of Slovenia, although the path to be taken with the dual-
agency structure could be expected to be difficult. This could, however, have been much
easier if there had been sufficient staff and full-time managers for registration, answerable to
a specialized line agency. Finally, RERMP illustrates through components such as mortgage
financing reform that (on a case by case basis and taking implementation capacity into
account) financing activities that are not directly related to the land service can add value to
the benefits from land administration by itself.

The design and implementation of the Slovenia RERMP yields the following main lessons:

       A multi-agency institutional structure for land administration has inherent
       disadvantages compared with a single agency; particularly in coordination and in
       prospects for attaining financial self-suficiency. The division of land administration
       activities between two institutions, one for cadastre and the other for land registration,
       resulted in coordination difficulties between the institutions. Also, the possibility of
       financial self-sufficiency by cross-subsidization from the higher revenues of
       registration to cadastre with lower earning possibilities, is made difficult by the
       institutional divide.

       Where a multi-agency institutional model is accepted as unavoidable, practical steps
       to reduce the disadvantages o these arrangements should be integrated in project
                                   f
       design. Two main steps were taken to reduce the disadvantages: (i) a strong
       coordination mechanism comprising a well staffed project coordination office and a
       more senior-level multi-agency council was created; and (ii) an information
       technology system which enabled data to be shared between the institutions was
       established.

       A land administration agency needs to exist uniquely for that task, be operationally
       independent and have full-time specialist stafl These features were not enjoyed by
       the Supreme Court and the district courts responsible for the project's land
       registration. Court judges had many demands on their time besides registration, and
       there was no institutional structure for specialist field supervision of registration
       activities.

       Actions beyond the core activities o land administration should be considered f they
                                           f                                            i
       significantly enhance project impact and are within the project's implementation
       capacity. RERMP's housing finance and mortgage reform component is in the
       banking rather than land domain, but was a significant contributor to the project's
       goal to improve the efficiency of the land market. While a focused land
       administration project would generally be preferred, addition to a project of a high
       impact ancillary component may be beneficial if manageable by the institution
       concerned.

Legislative reforms are an essential concomitant to establishing a land
administration program. Development of a legal base for land administration was
prioritized in order to provide a structured legislative framework. Laws were
proactively amended as experience was gained, and legislation in related sectors
(mortgages, taxes) was also approved.

1. Slovenia's development and land market issues
1.1     At the time when Slovenia declared Independence from the former Yugoslavia in
1991, the new nation, of all the transition countries, had some of the most favorable
conditions for restructuring to a market economy. While a small country - only some 2
million people - Slovenia was one of the wealthiest of the new nations. It had a skilled labor
force and a relatively high urban population (some 50 percent compared with about one-third
for Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan). This was reflected in the high proportion (95 percent) of
value added from the industrial and services sector. These sectors typically had higher factor
productivity than in agriculture. It also had a port to the Adriatic Sea enabling maritime trade,
and it had well-established trade links with the West. As a result, Slovenia was able to
quickly redirect Eastern European market outlets to western countries. Economic turnaround
was, thus, faster than for most of the former Eastern-block countries.

1.2     Notwithstanding this initial success, structural reform of the economy has taken
longer. Various Bank and other reports have commented on the persistence of such structural
problems. Key constraints noted during the preparation and early implementation phases of
the Real Estate Registration Modernization Project relate to rigidities in the financial sector
and in factor markets (labor, land), which translated to a low private sector presence (in 1996
the private sector's part of GDP was only 40 percent). As a result of these constraints,
Slovenia's economic growth has been lower than potential.2 In essence, Slovenia's below-
potential economic development has been held up by its unsupportive business environment.

1.3      In response to this situation, Government and the Bank articulated a growth oriented
development strategy - "The overarching development objective for Slovenia is to achieve
faster, sustainable growth" - with the private sector as "the main engine of growth" (CAS,
1997). The reform program was also intended to prepare Slovenia for accession to the
European Economic Union (EU), and the competition within this market and the world
economy that would result. Enhancing domestic savings, attracting foreign capital, increasing
investment rates, and raising the productivity of investments were amongst the changes
which would be necessary. A basic need was to increase the efficiency of the land market,
but market development was constrained by an underdeveloped and unwieldy governance.
This was articulated in the 1997 CAS - "Special attention will need to be given to developing
the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for markets that remain very weak in
Slovenia today, such as the markets for land."

1.4      Constraints for land included: fragmented records of land ownership between
different government agencies, and discrepancies between such records; inadequate
legislation and regulation; land and property possession which was frequently without
official records of ownership; the risk, especially for households with little social influence,

accession; World Bank; 1999; and Slovenia - Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (World Bank,

2. Slovenia's per capita GDP growth in 2005-2006 was 5.4 percent. Per capita GDP growth in 2006-2007 was
between 6 and 8 percent for Bulgaria, Kyrgyz and Ubekistan (Source: World Development Reports 2008 and
2009, World Bank).

of eviction from their customarily owned property by more powerful persons; infrequent land
sales as the buyer had no guarantee that the land was legitimately owned by the seller; low
land prices for the same reason; and very limited acceptance by financial institutions of land
as collateral for credit. Clearly, the land market was highly inefficient, and likely to be one of
the factors impeding Slovenia's economic development. It was in this environment that the
Real Estate Registration Modernization Project (RERMP) was conceived and designed.



2. Objectives and Implementation
Development 0bjective
2.1     RERMP's objective was: "To improve the eflciency and effectiveness of real estate
administration systems in Slovenia. This will include improvement of the real estate
registration system, upgrading the legal framework for real estate transactions,
establishment of an agricultural land use monitoring system to meet European Union
accession requirements, and desi ning and testing of a market-basedproperty tax and
valuation system." (Source: PADf)

Design
2.2     The project comprised eight components (Box 1) supporting between them the
project's principal objective, and its four sub-objectives: (i) Improvement of the real-estate
registration system - Components A (Improving Land and Building Cadastre); B (Improving
Land Registration); and C (Developing an Apartment Registration System); (ii) upgrading
the legal framework for real estate transactions - Components G (Legal Framework for
Property Registration) and F ( Housing Finance and Mortgage Reform); (iii) establish land
use monitoring for EU accession (component D); and (iv) market basedproperty tax and
valuation (component title same as objective).

effectiveness of real estate administration systems in Slovenia.") but does not have the four sub-objectives
provided in the PAD. The PAD version is taken here as it better provides the intention of the project as
discussed in the PAD text.

Implementation and Institutional arrangements
IMPLEMENTATION

2.3     Slovenia RERMP was approved by the World Bank Board in June 1999 and closed
six years later as scheduled in June 2005. Actual project costs amounted to EURO 25 million
compared with the appraisal estimate of EURO 27 million. At project closure, the Bank Loan
of EURO 14.1 million had been drawn down by EURO 12.9 million. The EU contributed
EURO 3.0 million to the project for technical assistance and computer equipment.
Government's counterpart financing was EURO 9.1 million. There were no changes in
project objectives and no major changes in components. No environmental or social
assessments were undertaken during project preparation as the project was assessed to have
no adverse social and environmental impacts. Project implementation was largely at or ahead
of schedule and appraisal targets were mostly met or exceeded (Table 2).

INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

2.4     RERMP involved five agencies: The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the
Republic of Slovenia (SMA) was responsible for land cadastre, developing a legal
framework, and project coordination (components A, G and H)), and, supported by the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ), for apartment registration (component C). The Supreme Court,
supported by SMA, was responsible for land registration (component B). The Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Food (MAFF) was responsible for agriculture land use monitoring
(component D). The Ministry of Finance was responsible for developing a real estate tax and
valuation system (component E) and for Housing Finance and Mortgage Reform (component
F). The Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) was the parent Ministry for
SMA. This multi-agency arrangement was very far from the "Single Agency System"
followed by some countries such as the Kyrgyzstan Land and Real Estate Registration
Project, where all land administration activities were under one institution.

2.5     Slovenia did, nevertheless, endeavor to coordinate the various institutions and
activities involved with the RERMP. Government established a senior-level body - the
Program Council - chaired by the Minister of Environment and Spatial Planning and with
representatives from across the agencies involved, for oversight and policy making. A Project
Coordination Office (PCO) was also established in The Ministry of Environment and Spatial
Planning's SMA. The PCO was charged with hands-on monitoring, coordination and quality
control of the project, and was also the Secretariat of the Program Council. The Program
Council met about three times per year and, for hands-on implementation, the PCO and
involved agencies met about weekly at the beginning of the project and bi-weekly in later
yearse4These arrangements were sensible and undoubtedly helped, although the cadastral
work of SMA and the registration activities under the Supreme Court were never fully
harmonized.


            ~~   ~




4. It was decided to continue the Program Council after the project. The PCO has been absorbed into SMA, but
SMA's organization and staff responsibilities are continuing the PCOs coordination functions.
                                                5


Monitoring and Evaluation
2.6     Design. Monitoring and evaluation was coordinated by the PCO. The PAD provides
minimal details on how M&E was to be done, what data would be collected, and how it
would be analyzed and for what purpose. A conceptual framework analyzing what data was
important for the project would have been desirable. Nevertheless, a good management
information system (MIS) was created with data to be collected that was relevant to project
management. The M&E program could have been broader however. Data collected was
largely restricted to measuring project progress and performance. Assessment of project
outcomes such as changes in investment levels, incomes and social impacts were not
considered. Also, benefits from land registration were seen from a land market perspective,
without also considering the possible benefits from investment on registered properties where
no transaction takes place. Taking the good MIS system but limited inclusion of outcome and
productivity measures, the Design of RERMP's M&E program is assessed Modest.

2.7    Implementation. By their nature, most project components provided at least some
relevant data: monitoring of agricultural land use is itself a monitoring exercise; the digitized
property registry is a nation-wide resource; and the Supreme Court measures registration
backlogs for all of the county courts. There was a monthly monitoring report coordinated by
the PCO, consolidating progress and performance data for each project component and this
proved useful for the project's managers. Implementation is rated Substantial.

2.8     Utilization. The monthly reporting system (MIS), informing managers, staff and
policy makers on program implementation and progress, is a relevant informational base for
the Project and Program Council meetings. The usage of these monitoring reports in the
meetings, and the continued production and use of the reports after the project period
indicates that the monitoring system is appreciated and useful. Utilization of M&E data was
Substantial.

2.9    Taking account of the design, implementation and utilization of RERMP's M&E
system, overall performance of M&E is assessed Substantial. Operational monitoring was
timely and became a key management tool, but there was limited attention to outcome and
the broader impacts of a land administration program.

3.2     RERMP?s obiectives were: ?To improve the eflciency and effectiveness of real estate
administration systems in Slovenia. This will include improvement of the real estate
registration system, upgrading the legal framework for real estate transactions,
establishment of an agricultural land use monitoring system to meet European Union
accession requirements, and designing and testing of a market-basedproperty tax and
valuation system.?

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

3.3     Slovenia?s goal to accelerate economic growth required structural reforms on many
fronts, not least of which was land (Section 1). International experience has shown that an
efficiently functioning land market is one of the reforms that can contribute to such an
enhanced growth path. Thus, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of land
administration was very relevant to the country?s aspirations,

3.4     All four of the RERMP?s sub-objectives were also relevant. Extension and
improvement of land cadastre and registration (sub-objective 1) was a basic requirement for a
national land administration system. Establishing a satisfactory legal framework (sub-
objective 2) was essential to underpin the reform actions. The establishment of an
agricultural land use monitoring system (sub-objective 3) was one of the accession
                                                7


requirements of the EU. And piloting a new real estate tax system (sub-objective 4) provided
the base for better fiscal management. Relevance of Objectives is thus rated Substantial.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

3.5     The project's design was in most respects well suited to achieve the project's
objectives. As indicated above, there was a component or more than one component
supporting each of the four objectives, and most components were adequately designed to
provide the support needed. In particular, the technical aspects of design were well prepared
and remained valid throughout project implementation. The main issues were more strategic
in nature: the choice between a single agency or multiple agencies to implement the project;
insufficient full-time staff and management for one of the institutions; and the inclusion of
some components which went beyond the specific needs of a land administration service.
These issues are discussed below.

3.6     The project was ambitious in several ways: (i) the eight components provided an
extensive array of actions that needed to be undertaken; (ii) although piloting was used in
instances where an activity was completely new, the scale of activities was large and mostly
to national coverage -the cadastral work was rolled out country-wide, the network of offices
for both cadastre and registration, the information technology, the legal framework and
agricultural monitoring were also at national scale. And, even if an activity had been
implemented before, RERMP introduced challenging changes in implementation processes,
technology and service standards; (iii) digitization and information technology was to be
introduced in a major program; (iv) the project's significant changes in legislation and
policies would need review and steerage through the political processes; and (v) as indicated
below, the institutional structure was highly complex.

3.7      The most significant decision during project design, which was ultimately vindicated,
was to accept the division of land administration responsibilities between two main
institutions. This "dual-agency" institutional structure had cadastre under SMA, and
registration through the Supreme Court and its network of county courts. Moreover, the
RERMP had other institutions - the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food and the
Ministry of Finance - implementing parts of the project, making RERMP's institutional
structure what might be termed a "multi-agency" approach. The involvement of multiple
institutions made project implementation inherently complex, and far from the much simpler
"single agency" model typically espoused by land administration specialists. RERMP's
senior level "Program Council" and weekly project meetings involving all agencies helped in
this regard, although coordination was always a challenge.

3.8     The key gap in design was to presume that the county court system would be able to
effectively implement registration activities within its existing structure. Property registration
was only one of the responsibilities of court judges and there was no field-level entity to
supervise registration activities. This situation was the main source of the registration
difficulties that the RERMP encountered, A specialist agency with focused, full-time
management and staff would have been a better choice.
                                             8

3.9     As indicated above, with eight components and five institutions, RERMP's design is
far more complex than typical land administration projects in the ECA Region. Moreover,
the scope of the project goes beyond what is specifically needed for land administration. Two
of RERMP's components stand out: the Real Estate Tax and Valuation System component,
and the Housing Finance and Mortgage Reform component. Neither of these is necessary for
a land administration service, and their inclusion, thus contributing to the project's
complexity, departs from usually considered "good practice." Nevertheless, both components
were successful. Thus, RERMP illustrates that though simple land administration projects
may be easier to implement than projects such as RERMP, a more complex project can be
made to work. In part this was because of the generally high administrative capacity in
Slovenia, but it was also facilitated by the design of RERMP's institutional structure.
RERMPS Program Council and PCO provided an effective bridge between institutions, and
the Ministry of Finance took on the Real Estate Tax and Valuation component and the
Housing Finance and Mortgage Reform component in full, in effect relieving the PCO from
management of these two components. In turn, the Ministry of Finance provided the
necessary staffing to implement the components. Hence, the strategic decision to include
these additional activities paid off.

3.10 Summary of Relevance of Design. In an ideal world, the project would have
addressed each of the above issues; in particular different agencies dealing with cadastre and
land registration, and the overcharged court judges for registration activities. But the
Government was insistent on using its dual-agency approach, entrenched over many years.
The Bank had to make a basic decision whether to accept this institutional arrangement or
cancel, delay or reduce the project. It made a strategic choice to work within the existing
institutional set-up. Furthermore, in an effort to address a number of critical constraints to
land markets, the project took on a number of ancillary components. These components were
successful. But they introduced a further level of complexity, covering a number of issues
and areas not usually found in land projects. As a result of these design choices, the project
carried definite risks. But a pragmatic approach to institutional design enabled a complicated
and not ideal situation to ultimately succeed. Relevance of design is rated Substantial. In
combination with the Substantial relevance of the project's objectives, RERMP's overall
relevance is also rated Substantial.

Efficacy for improving the real estate registration system
3.12 The first sub-objective aimed at: "improvement of the real estate registration
system. "

3.13 Three project components supported this objective: (a) The Land and Building
Cadastre component was to complete a nation-wide, digitized cadastral map; (b) the Land
Register component aimed to improve the efficiency of registration, remove backlogs of
unfinished registrations at registry offices, and create computer linkages between the SMA
                                                      10

and the Supreme Court; and (c) the apartment registration component was to pilot a
registration system for apartments5

GENERAL CADASTRAL IMPROVEMENTS
      AND

3.14 In most respects, improvement in the real estate registration system has been
substantial. Four of RERMP's six monitorable indicators that were related to land
registration have been met or exceeded: (i) the country's 44 registry offices have been
computerized; (ii) preparation of cadastral maps exceeded plans, reaching full national
coverage; (iii) the major discrepancies in owner names between cadastral and registry data
was reduced from an unworkable 20 percent before the project to three percent by project
end, below the project target of five percent; and (iv) an apartment registration law was
passed.

DIGITIZATION

3.15 A big step forward has been the digitization of data, and computerization of
procedures that were introduced under the project. An increasing number of registration
offices are using computerized systems and some 86 percent of data are now digitized. The
information system allows transparent access to data by professionals and the public, and is
updated daily. The system has become fully functional only in the last two years, but is
beginning to have impact. The Supreme Court and SMA advised the IEG mission that the
system would provide a natural bridge between them, and that registration processes could be
speeded up. A businessman welcomed the transparency of information and transactions and
the much easier access to land administration information compared with 12 months earlier.

IMPROVEMENTS IN REGISTRATION OF TRANSACTIONS

 3.16 Achievements with registration of transactions have been less than intended, although
progress was made. The intentions were: (i) to increase efficiency, in particular to reduce the
time for registering property transactions; and (ii) to clear a backlog of unprocessed
registration applications.

3.17 Registration efficiency has improved considerably from the dysfunctional situation
before the project. At that time (late 199Os), registration typically took over 20 months. There
was also a large backlog ("unsolved cases") of unprocessed applications in the registration
offices (about 200,000 in 2002) which took time to reduce. A significant contributor to the
backlog was a wave of additional demands for registration after the Apartment Registration
Law was updated. This allowed apartment owners to register their apartments individually
whereas before only the entire building could be registered. The law's update was not
anticipated and the resultant increase in registrations overwhelmed the Land Registry
Offices, causing the backlog to increase by some 2000 cases per month. Nevertheless, as

5 . Together, these three components were the main project expenditure, costing $18.3 million at completion or
73 percent of total project costs (Box 1). SMA's cadastral work was RERMP's largest component, representing
77 percent of the total costs of cadastre and registration combined (appraisal estimate) and 63 percent of costs at
project completion.

shown in Figure 1, the backlog progressively reduced during the project period, to 100,000
unsolved cases by 2005, and has reduced further after project closure, to about 50,000 in

3.18 Table 3 shows a major improvement, both during the project and since the project, in
the time taken by the courts to register a transaction. The extraordinary delays of the past
have been substantially reduced, and 40 out of 44 courts now have transaction times of less
than three months. However, as a number of sources commented to the IEG mission, the
capacity of the courts in land administration still has substantial scope for further
improvement. This is confirmed if comparison is made with land registration times in more
efficient countries where registration time (all processes including the time taken by other
institutions) can be less than two weeks (Appendix A, Table 2). Slovenia is well behind
Kyrgyz (5 days) and Bulgaria (7-14 days) in the time taken for registration (IEG mission
estimates)6. That said, the typical range of days taken for registration in Slovenia of 32 to 56
days (IEG estimate) is, at the high end of the range, about comparable to the ECA average of
60 days and, at the low end, is not far from the average for OECD countries of 25 daysa7
(ECA and OECD data from Doing Business, 20 10).




6 . The estimated registration times for Slovenia, Kyrgyz and Bulgaria are all IEG mission estimates (December
2009), based on data and interviews with agency staff, supplemented by feedback from clients and other
professionals and agencies involved with land registration.
7. Comparison with the targeted registration time set at appraisal of six days is not made here as, given
Slovenia's pre-project situation, the target was completely unrealistic in the first place. The revision to 20 days
made at project mid-term was also unrealistic in the short (project period) term.

3.19 Slovenia's registration efficiency can also be gauged by three comparators commonly
used in land administration: (i) the number of procedures involved in registering a property
transaction; (ii) the time taken (as above); and (iii) the registration costs. As estimated in
Appendix A Table 1, based on the IEG mission's interviews with clients and court staff, land
registration in Slovenia in 2009 involved six procedures; costs were about 2.0 percent of the
property value; and, inclusive of all actions taken by other institutions, the process typically
took between 32 - 56 days. (Registration time, costs and number of procedures refer to all
actions and institutions involved in registration - i.e. the whole registration process as
relevant to the client.)* The main change since the beginning of RERMP is in the time taken
to register a transaction. Reducing the typical time for registering a transaction from 20
months to 1 ?4months is a significant improvement. As concerns, the number of procedures
involved in registering a land transaction, Slovenia is in the range typical in a number of
other countries. Slovenia's six procedures are about the same as the averages for ECA (6
procedures) and OECD countries (5 procedures). Slovenia's registration costs as a percentage
of property costs of 2.0 percent are lower than in nearly all of the comparator countries
shown in Appendix A, Table 2: registration costs average 2.2 percent for ECA countries, and
the average for OECD countries is 4.6 percent.

3.20 In summary, for the three criteria commonly used to compare the overall efficiency of
land registration across countries: (i) Slovenia has lower costs than most other countries; (ii)
is in the typical range for the number of procedures involved, and, (iii) Slovenia is about
comparable to the average time for ECA and for OECD countries. Considering the distance
that Slovenia has travelled since the pre-project situation of 20 months for registering a
transaction, the situation today is a noteworthy achievement. Nevertheless, Slovenia's
registration time is still well below potential (as exemplified, for instance, by Kyrgyz and
Bulgaria). The clear ongoing and future challenge for Slovenia is to reduce registration time
to levels comparable with the most efficient ECA countries.

Cadastre agencies handling registration, refers to the total processes, time and costs required for registration

lawyer and notary might also be involved etc.

COVERAGE
3.2 1 Geographic coverag;e. RERMP was a national project with offices and services
distributed throughout the country. Equipped land registration offices were established at
each of the country's 44 county courts, and 9 cadastre offices were established regionally. By
the end of the project, cadastral maps were created for virtually the entire country.
Digitization of data was also nearly complete. A registration office was generally within 25
kilometers of a householder. Monthly registrations data show that all 44 registration offices
are functional, indicating that there is no particular difference in access to land administration
services between urban and rural areas.

3.22 Social inclusion Under Slovenian law there is no difference between the rights of men
and women, or any discrimination against the poor. All persons consulted in Slovenia
considered that social inequality was not an issue for RERMP, and project design and M&E
reflect this view. Data is not disaggregated by the gender of property owners, or by incomes.
And there are no specific features of the project that would help protect the welfare of
women and the poor. Where issues arise, the law courts are the mechanism for redressing
problems.

3.23 This assessment is likely to be substantially correct. Slovenia is a sophisticated
country with a literacy rate of almost 100 percent, a per capita income of $27,000 (about
$10,000 at the time of RERMP's appraisal), and with an egalitarian outlook and an
established legal system. Moreover, the quite dense network of registration offices provides
ready access to offices even in more remote lower-income areas. Nevertheless, it would be
desirable to examine social inclusion issues more probingly. For instance, would the access
to law courts, and the affordability of associated costs, be as attainable for a modest income
farmer as for a business man? Experience in a number of other countries suggests that there
                                                    14


may be social equity issues in land administration programs that are not easy to detectg, and
that there may be simple actions that might make a difference."

SUMMARY ACHIEVEMENTS FOR LAND REGISTRATION

3.24 Performance was strong as concerns establishing the 44 registration offices, land
cadastre, digitization and information technology, which were all rolled out nationally and
were of good quality. Several activities such as cadastral mapping and registration of
apartments progressed well beyond initial intentions. Registration of transactions was the
weak link. The backlog of registrations of property transactions reduced substantially, as did
the processing times in the courts. But the time taken to register a transaction, while
improving, would still need major reductions if processing time is to reach efficiency levels
such as in Kyrgyz. Given this situation, the overall achievement for land registration is
assessed modest.

Upgrading the legal framework
3.25     Sub-objective 2 was to: "upgrade the legal framework for real estate transactions. "

3.26 Two laws prepared and enacted during the RERMP period formed the legal base for
much of the legislative reforms promoted by the project: (i) a "Real Property Code" approved
by Parliament in 2002, and covering titling, tenure security, interactions between neighbors
and land-based credit; and (ii) a Land Register Law (2003) providing the legislative
underpinning for property registration processes. These were followed over the project period
and to the present by a number of other laws on specialist topics. The main laws are listed in
Table 5.

3.27 Clearly, Slovenia has been prolific in its development of land related legislation. .
Further, the legislation has covered not just the legal framework for cadastre and registration,
but also important features needed for development of the broader land market: mortgages;
taxation; and finance. Development of the legislation was a participatory process led by the
Ministry of Justice, and with land related institutions and civil society involved, including
from Ljubljana University and international experts. Study tours helped inform the
preparation teams. By project completion, Slovenia's land legislation was at a point
acceptable for EU accession. This was a considerable achievement given the situation
prevailing in the 1990s (one legal specialist at Ljubljana University summarized the
legislation then as having been a "Black Hole.").




9. As expressed in a recent Bank study, "Legislation and procedures that appear gender neutral because they do
not make a distinction between the rights of men and women, may, nevertheless, affect men and women in very
different ways, given how traditional gender relationships and stereotypes affect access to information,
resources and power." (in Land Reform and Farm Restructuring in Transition Countries. The Experience of
Bulgaria, Moldova, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan; N. Dudwick, K. Fock and D. Sedik; World Bank, 2007)
10. For instance, in Bulgaria, registration offices offer free legal services to clients needing assistance.

3.28 Housing finance and mortgages reform. RERMP's legislative reforms included a
specific focus on improving the efficiency of mortgage-based financing and facilitating
development of mortgage banking. These activities commenced with an analysis and
workshops with bankers to identify the legal and systemic issues related to expanding and
increasing the efficiency of the mortgage market. A technical report and policy paper were
prepared, followed by drafting of a Mortgage and Municipal Bond Act in 2004, which was
passed in 2006. Legislation to further develop the law was prepared in 2009. The legislation
provides the rules and rights for mortgage financing, and, according to one banker consulted
by the IEG mission, has been well received by both bankers and citizens - the legislation, has
been an enabling factor for the explosive growth of the mortgage market (Table 6), and
financers and property owners alike were beneficiaries. In summary, the objective to
"upgrade the legal framework for real estate transactions " has been more than achieved: (i)
the legislative framework required "creating" more than "updating"; (ii) it provided a
comprehensive base for the RERMP, going beyond transactions to backstop all project
activities; and (iv) it delivered extra mileage in land market activities such as mortgage
reform. Efficacy was High.

Agricultural land use monitoring
3.29 Sub-objective 3 was to: "establish an agricultural land use monitoring system to meet
European Union accession requirements"

3.30 The Efficacy of this objective was Substantial. The underlying goal was to establish
an agricultural land use monitoring system acceptable under the EU Common Agricultural

 1 1. Reform of housing finance and mortgages is not specifically mentioned in RERMP's objectives, but is a
clearly specified project component in the PAD, and is primarily concerned with reforming legislation. It
therefore fits naturally under the upgrading of the legal framework objective, and is treated as such here.
                                            16

Policy to enable receipt of EU agricultural subsidies. A start had been made to this process,
but, when the project was starting up, only one-third of agricultural land area had been
covered. The MAFF, the implementer of the monitoring system, developed and put into
operation an improved digitized data system, which covered agricultural and forest land
parcels nation-wide. The EU's Joint Research Center has approved this system, fully
satisfying the purpose under this objective

Developing property tax and valuation systems
3.3 1 Sub-objective 4 was: "designing and testing a market-basedproperty tax and
valuation system. "

3.32 The intention was to develop a new, unified system for valuing property, including
mass valuations of similar properties, and to develop a tax system to handle such valuations.
Main achievements were: (i) passing of a Law on Real Estate Mass Appraisal in 2006; (ii)
successful piloting of the valuation and tax systems in three municipalities (two
municipalities had been planned); and (iii) institutional strengthening in the Ministry of
Finance and selected municipalities. The national real estate register (under the registration
component) is expected to be complete in 2010, providing scope for applying the new
valuation and land tax systems country-wide. A draft Real Estate Tax Law was finalized in
2009 and is expected to be passed in 2010.

3.33 The utility of the new valuation and tax systems is quite broad, going beyond the
evident usage for land taxation purposes. Other points mentioned to the IEG mission by the
manager of the program were that the system could be used for determining sales taxes,
valuations for compulsory purchase; gift taxes; inheritance taxes; social subsidies;
foreclosures; better organization of land administration data; and for EU monitoring
purposes. The efficacy of this sub-objective was substantial.

RERMP's overall efficacy
3.34 In most respects RERMP achieved or exceeded its objectives. The sub-objectives to
develop land use monitoring and a property based tax system were fully achieved
(Substantial efficacies), a legislative base for land administration was successfully
established, and additional legislation supported the land finance market - a High Efficacy.

3.35 For RERMP's first sub-objective - improvement of the real estate registration and
cadastre system - performance was mixed. On the cadastral side, SMA exceeded property
registration targets, developed an information technology system, prepared digitized
cadastral maps covering the country, and substantially reduced discrepancies in owner names
between cadastre and registry. For these activities efficacy was High. Transaction
registrations fell short of targets, although progress was made - the backlog of unprocessed
registrations was nearly halved (but not eliminated as planned, in part because of the major
expansion in demand when individual apartments were allowed to register independently of
other units). Typical registration time was reduced from a dysfunctional 3 to 12 months to
about 1 % months. Undoubtedly this was progress and it took Slovenia to below the average
for ECA countries, although property registration in Slovenia still took longer than Kyrgyz
                                                        17


and Bulgaria. Registration time in Slovenia is also longer than the (unrealistic) target of 6
days set at appraisal. l 2 In summary, progress was made improving efficiency for registering
transactions, but achievement against targets was Modest. Registration was RERMP's second
largest component (after cadastre), and its modest performance must be considered a
significant shortfall. Thus, while cadastre went well, RERMP's overall performance against
the registration and cadastre objective is also rated Modest.

3.36 For RERMP's overall efficacy, account is taken of the efficacies for three of the
project's four sub-objectives of substantial or higher, and the substantial efficacy of the
cadastral half of the fourth sub-objective. For the other half of this sub-objective,
achievements were less than intended. But, even here, progress was made and a foundation
laid for the further development of land registration that occurred after project closure.
Beyond the evaluation of these four sub-objectives, however, the most important
consideration is whether RERMP's over-arching objective has been achieved. The overall
"efficiency and effectiveness of real estate administration systems in Slovenia" has
undoubtedly "improved." RERMP's overall efficacy is assessed Substantial.

Efficiency
3.37 A first consideration is the efficiency with which project resources have been used to
achieve the project's objectives. From this criterion the project's efficiency was substantial.
All project components were implemented and, as indicated in the discussion of efficacy,
RERMP's objectives were largely achieved. Meanwhile, costs were contained - actual
project expenditures were EURO 25 million compared with the appraisal estimate of project
costs of EURO 27 million. The smaller project components (apartment registration, land use
monitoring, tax and valuation systems, housing finance and mortgage reform, and building
the legal framework) appear to have been particularly cost efficient. Their combined cost was
EURO 7 million, slightly less than the EURO 8 million planned at appraisal. While it is
difficult to quantify the benefits from these components, they are likely to have leveraged
economic benefits well in excess of their costs. The agricultural land use monitoring
component (EURO 3 million actual costs) for instance was the base for assessing agricultural
subsidies from the EU, and the legislative and procedural changes introduced under the
mortgage finance reform component (EURO 0.1 million) provided a more secure
environment for investment. Of the two big components, the actual costs of cadastre at
EURO 10 million were lower than the appraisal estimate of EURO 12.4 million. Land
registration (EURO 5-7 million) was the only component that exceeded appraisal
expectations (EURO 3.7 million), apparently due to higher than expected investment costs
(field offices, computers), and use of consultants. However, the project investments have
significantly improved operating efficiency. Discrepancies in owner names between registry
and cadastre were reduced from a dysfunctional 20 percent to three percent, registration time
was reduced from 20 months to 1 % months and the cost of registration at 2 percent of
property value is comparatively low by international standards.



 12. Few countries have reached a registration efficiency (all processes) of six days. At project mid-term the
target was raised to 20 days.

    3.38 An economic rate of return was not calculated for the RERMP; hence assessment of
    the project's efficiency must rely primarily on proxies such as observed trends in market
    variables. The house mortgage market has developed rapidly, both in aggregate value which
    has grown at an annual average of 43 percent, and in the share of mortgage-based loans in
    total bank lending: in the five year period 1998 to 2003, mortgage -secured loans grew from
    14 to 51 percent (Table 6). Another proxy is how the land market's efficiency has developed
    (Table 7). From 1998 to 2005, real estate mortgage rates fell substantially - from 16 to 6
    percent in five years. Market confidence in the real estate market has also grown - the
    "spread" (the difference between the market rate and the Treasury Bill rate), falling from a
    baseline (pre-project) average of 550 basis points (average from 1998 to 2000) to an average
    spread of about 300 basis points in 2004-2005, for a considerable reduction of 250 basis
    points or 2.5 percentage points.

3.39 Major trends such as Slovenia?s economic growth and the stimulus from EU
accession will have been the main drivers for development of the land market. Nevertheless,
a developing land administration service can be expected to have played at least a facilitating
role. Based on international experience, this could be along the following lines. With
accurate and formal registration, backed by the law, land and property become securely
owned. With tenure security, property owners can invest with confidence, and a secure
environment for buying and selling is established. In parallel, lending agencies are more
willing to lend against collateral secured by reliable ownership; and interest rates on
mortgages may fall, providing a reinforcing cycle of positive influences. l 3

3.40 Finally, the bottom line is that the business community and property owners want the
land administration program to continue and further develop, and, at least for transaction
registrations, are willing to pay for these services at rates covering service costs - an
unequivocal demonstration that the program has generated value added. RERMP?s
Efficiency is assessed Substantial.

Reaching beyond land administration
3.41 A feature of the RERMP is that it has components additional to those conventionally
found in a ?good practice? ECA land administration project, where activities are limited in
number and usually focused on land administration alone. This ?good practice? approach has
evident advantages in making implementation as straightforward as possible. The RERMP,
however, goes beyond this model, adding complexity. The agricultural land use monitoring,
and the real estate tax and valuation components are beyond typical land administration
activities. And the housing finance and mortgage reform component is in the banking rather
than land domain. Yet, development of financial instruments in the property market is a core
need for developing the land market, and could enhance the market impact of land
registration. As a consequence it contributed to the RERMP?s overarching goal to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of land administration. There can be no hard and fast rule for
such ancillary components, if any, but RERMP illustrates the potential benefits that might be
present if the broader environment for the land market is considered. (Of interest is that
implementation of the housing finance and mortgage reform component did not add unduly
to the PCO?s work pressures, as the component was exclusively managed by the Ministry of
                  ?~
F i n a n ~ e . ) Two other factors were important to success: first, Slovenia?s generally good
governance and educated workforce; and second, RERMP?s effective interagency
coordination arrangements.

 13. It is noteworthy that in the discussion of benefits in the PAD and ICR, the bulk of the data available to
assess the impacts of RERMP are market-related. Yet efficiency of land market transactions would have been
only one factor for enhancing land?s economic benefits - investments by property owners can also improve land
productivity without exchange of ownership. Thus, conceivably, RERMP might have had greater economic
impact if benefits had been seen in a broader perspective. For instance, might there be practical and low-cost
opportunities (legal, financial, regulatory, etc.) to enhance the business environment for investing on the land?
As example, getting a construction permit, commonly associated with buying land, involves 15 procedures and
the typical time required is 208 days, making the purchase of land for investing on the property a daunting
decision (from Doing Business, 2009). The evident caveats apply, however, in particular, to avoid undue project
complexity.
14. Similarly, the Real Estate Tax and Valuation System component was also managed by the Ministry of
Finance, and the Agricultural Land Use Monitoring component was managed by the MAFF.
                                            20



Risk to development outcome
3.42 There are two principal risks: inadequate future funding; and the possibility of
wavering political support as government administrations change. Most officials met by the
IEG mission considered that dependence on the Government budget was much less desirable
than full financial independence. However, as part of cadastral activities are public services
and are not charged for, this might require some cross-subsidization from the registration
service. This would be more easily done if registration and cadastre were under a single-
agency. A self-sufficient agency would also be more able to operate in case of varying future
political support.

3.43 In effect, there are structural reasons why the land administration program in Slovenia
is continually beholden to the good will and continuous effort of a number of parties.
Funding requires continuous recognition that the institutions concerned should be regularly
provided with government funds; the efficiency of registration relies on a court system with
many other duties besides land administration; and cooperation between registration and
cadastre assumes continued individual and institutional efforts at both ministerial and agency
levels.

3.44 There are, nevertheless, a number of indications that Government and the
implementing agencies are committed to supporting good quality continuation of the land
administration program. The term of the Program Council was extended by decree at the end
of the project. The Council and managers of the program still meet regularly. Passing of new
land legislation is prolific and more is under preparation, Most land administration activities
have improved since RERMP's closure (e.g., reductions promoted by the Supreme Court in
the registration backlog). Another factor is the demand, likely to become more assertive over
time, of the clients. In IEG meetings with persons from the banking, real estate and business
sectors, and with house-owners, interest was consistently expressed in the continuation and
further improvement of land administration services. Given these factors, Risk to
Development Outcome is rated Moderate.

Slovenia's Multi-agency experience
 3.45 Dual/Multi-agency issues. Slovenia has by now gained substantial experience in
administering land through two separate agencies - SMA for cadastre and the Supreme Court
for registration. The MOF and MAFF have also been involved. A complete inventory of the
relative advantages and disadvantages of a multi versus single agency institutional structure
is not attempted in this review. However, from IEG mission discussions and site visits,
Slovenia demonstrates that when cadastre and registration are located in separate entities, and
in particular when the registration function is within an organization that also has many non-
land related functions, problems of coordination and performance are likely to emerge. The
difficulties of the land registration program are one such issue although the program's
problems may have been as much a product of the lack of a full-time agency dedicated only
to land administration than because registration was under a separate entity. Thus, the
Bulgaria Registration Cadastre Project also had a separate registration institution, which,
after a delay creating the agency, achieved its registration targets. The difference was that
                                                       21


Bulgaria's institution was an agency dedicated only to land registration and had its own full-
time staff, both in headquarters and field offices. Another of RERMP's problems was
inadequate communication between SMA and the Supreme Court during the first years of the
project. Then there are the more difficult prospects for cadastre to become financially self-
sufficient under a separate agency than if the two agencies were merged (para. 3.40) 15. And
finally, there is some duplication of work and facilities between cadastre and registration.
Nevertheless, a shared data system has been established, which has significantly enhanced
communication between the two agencies. The advantage of a single agency is generally
recognized in Slovenia. In fact, in December 2005, the ICR commented that Government
intended to establish a joint agency in 2008, l6 but a legislative proposal to this effect was
subsequently-removed. However, in its comments on the draft PPAR (June 2010, Appendix
D), the Supreme Court has advised that a single national land registration court with a chief
registrar is planned to be created in 20 10.      ''
3.46 Addressing the issues. The RERMP brought in a number of features to address some
of these problems. The Project Coordination Office served to connect the work of the
different institutions, and a senior level "Program Council" was created (and still exists) to
monitor progress and address problems. Also, all cadastral and registration records were
progressively digitized in a harmonized system common to both agencies. And finally, an
information technology system was established, updated on a daily basis, with individual
records for all landowners, transparently available to both SMA and the Supreme Court (and
also the general public and other government agencies). These initiatives have helped
Slovenia to reduce the coordination inefficiencies inherent in a dual-agency land
administration system.

3.47 Multi-aaencv impacts. RERMP's "multi-agency'' approach is really a dual-agency
model with additional agencies added for specific components. Four of the project's eight
components were implemented by institutions other than the SMA and Supreme Court. Yet
these additions were not particularly burdensome for RERMP's management. This was
because the components were made the direct responsibility of the agency/ministry
concerned, with the PCO and Program Council only playing a monitoring and coordination
role. With such delegation and monitoring, multiple agencies do not appear to have been
significantly more difficult than a dual-agency institutional structure. Rather, the significant
change in complexity is when cadastre and registration are in separate agencies.


15. Both cadastre and registration can be self-reliant from fees (e.g. Bulgaria), although, because part of
cadastral work has a public goods element (systematic land surveying and mapping) it is easier when
registration activities can part-subsidize cadastre (e.g. Kyrgyz). With two agencies, financial inter-linkages
become more difficult than with a single agency, and pragmatic solutions would clearly be needed.
16. As stated in the ICR (page 13): "In November 2005 the Government initiated the activity ofjoining all real
estate data (land cadastre, building cadastre and land registry) with the final aim of establishing a new joint
agency for real estate management to be established by 2008 and filly operational by 2010.
17. Specifically, the Supreme Court in its comments on the draft PPAR (June 14, 2010, refer Appendix D),
advised that a new legislation was currently being prepared which stipulates that land registration is to remain
within the courts system, but that the new legislation is "also introducing a single Land Register Court for the
entire country, which is supposed to start operating November 15,2010. Such a solution will also put into
practice the proposal of the World Bank to introduce a "Chief Registrar" which will function as a single
national registration court."
                                                    22

3.48 Would land administration have been better with one agency? RERMP's one
significant problem - the delays in registration of transactions - was primarily due to factors
independent of the number of agencies. With many other calls on their time, registration
often took a back seat for court judges. The registration program also had no full-time central
management with authority to insist on actions by the county courts. And, quite simply, there
were not enough staff in the court^.'^ Such constraints were seen by a number of persons
interviewed as more relevant in practice than the number of agencies involved. Nevertheless,
a single agency was generally considered to have inherent efficiency advantages over a dual-
agency approach. The IEG mission's observations are consistent with these views.


4. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank performance
QUALITY ENTRY
      AT

4.1      The Slovenia RERMP's design was different from many, and perhaps the bulk, of
land administration projects in ECA. While there is no prototype, sharply focused projects
limited as far as possible to cadastre and registration alone are typically preferred. A single
rather than a double agency has also been favored, and, indeed, was also strongly advocated
by the Bank to the Slovenia Government during project preparation. The RERMP bucked all
of these "good practices." First, the project was highly complex involving eight components
with very different activities. Second, activities going beyond cadastre and registration alone
were included in the project. And third, the institutional arrangements, involving five
institutions, including separate institutions for registration and cadastre, were a polarity apart
from a single implementing agency. It was a risky decision to go ahead with such a complex
and multi-institution project - but the project in most respects worked, and the ancillary
components filled important needs. The Bank had successfully gauged Slovenia's generally
good institutional capacity when assessing what the project could achieve in a not ideal
situation.

4.2     Project design was practical for all project components except registration. The
decision to have a high-level Program Council across all institutions and a hands-on Project
Coordination Office helped integrate the work program, and, as consistently mentioned to the
IEG mission by staff in the implementing agencies and Government, the Bank's technical
expertise was strong.

4.3      The decision to go ahead with the project despite its institutional weaknesses was
justifiable in Slovenia's particular circumstances. The preparation team accepted that one




18. In its comments on the draft PPAR (Appendix D), the Supreme Court has stated that court staff were
adequately trained and working full-time on the project. (The staffing comment would have applied for the staff
working with the court judges.). The comment on staffing in paragraph 3.48 has been adjusted to clarify this.

institution combining registration with cadastre was not an option" and went forward with a
second-best institutional structure. There were alternatives, amongst them: to walk away
from the project; to maintain a dialogue while waiting until a better institutional arrangement
was found; or to adjust and downsize the registration component. While all these options
have their respective merits, the decision to accept Government's dual agency institutional
structure and go ahead without delay met an important strategic need. An improved land
administration system and land market was a requirement for Slovenia's accession to the
European Union. And an efficient land market was a key part of Slovenia's market-based
economic growth strategy. This judgment has been broadly vindicated by the project's
achievements. The project had significant benefits in terms of land market development, was
economically viable and enabled Slovenia to meet its EU requirements. Quality at Entry is
rated Satisfactory.

QUALITY SUPERVISION
      OF

4.4     The Bank continued to provide good technical support to the implementing agencies.
The Bank team worked closely with Government and the PCO to resolve difficulties and help
with new initiatives. Supervision budgets, averaging $78,000 per annum, were adequate, and
missions were regular, providing the means to monitor and guide RERMP's implementation
throughout the project period. The Bank could have done more to resolve implementation
difficulties with land registration - for instance, procurement of a consulting firm to provide
extra staff to help clear the backlog was unsuccessful, and alternatives could have been tried.
But overall, the Bank helped steer a complex project to a largely satisfactory outcome.
Quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory. Considering both quality at entry and
supervision, the overall performance of the Bank was Satisfactory.

Borrower performance
GOVERNMENT

4.5     The Program Council at senior government level was effective in helping coordinate
the different ministries and agencies involved in the project. Government very wisely
minimized staff turn-over in the PCO and implementing agencies. This was particularly so in
the PCO where the same key staff continued throughout project implementation. The
Government was highly effective in mustering the political support to pass the acts
supporting the project. The backlog problem could have been more proficiently addressed if
extra full-time staff had been recruited for the courts - registration time, while now
comparable to the ECA average, is still more than in a number of comparator countries.
However, the Supreme Court's initiatives since project closure have helped further reduce
the gap, and improvements have been particularly marked in the past 12 months.

4.6     While Government could have performed better with the land registration aspects of
the project, the bottom line is that a complex project, across multiple institutions, with major


19. "Given the 250-year history of the court based title registration system, the unified system was not
considered a feasible option at the time, and the Bank and Government agreed to design the project based on the
existing system." (ICR page 12).
                                              24

legislation, and requiring concerted decisions, was promoted by Government and made to
succeed. Government performance is rated Satisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES

4.7     The five agencies involved managed their respective components well, although this
was not so until the later years of the project as concerns the regional courts. The PCO did an
excellent job coordinating project activities. Practically all activities were new to Slovenia so
the agencies had to learn as they proceeded. They took these activities from scratch to
proficiency. Of note - all of the programs are continuing and expanding. Overall, the
performance of the implementing agencies was Satisfactory. Taking account of the
performance of Government and of the implementing agencies, overall borrower
performance was Satisfactory.


5. Lessons
5.1    The design and implementation of the Slovenia RERMP yields the following main
lessons:

 (i)      A multi-agency institutional structure for land administration has inherent
 disadvantages compared with a single agency; particularly in coordination and in prospects
for attainingjnancial self-sufficiency. The division of land administration activities between
 SMA for cadastre and the Supreme Court for registration (other agencies involved in
 RERMP were for ancillary activities rather than central land administration activities),
 resulted in coordination difficulties between the two agencies in the first several years of the
project. Also, with cadastre separate from registration, cross-subsidization from the higher
 revenues of registration to cadastre with lower earning possibilities is made difficult by the
 institutional divide (paras. 3.45 to 3.48).

(ii)    Where a multi-agency institutional model is accepted as unavoidable, practical steps
to reduce the disadvantages of these arrangements should be integrated in project design. An
existing dual structure was strongly favored by Government. In this second-best situation,
two main steps were taken under RERMP which proved useful in reducing the
disadvantages: (i) a strong coordination mechanism comprising a well-staffed PCO with
minimal staff turnover, and a more senior level multi-agency Program Council was created -
both bodies met regularly and were actively supported by Government (para. 2.5); and (ii)
The digitization information technology system, established in the later years of the project,
enables data to be shared between SMA and.the Supreme Court (paras. 3.15 and 3.45).

(iii) A land administration agency needs to exist uniquely for that task, be operationally
independent and have full-time specialist stafi (This applies whether the institution is a
single agency combining cadastre and registration, or whether the agency handles cadastre or
registration alone.) These features were not enjoyed by the Supreme Court and the county
courts responsible for RERMP?s land registration. Court judges had many demands on their
time. There was no field supervision, nor any accountability of court staff to land registration
(paras. 3.8, 3.45 and 3.48).
                                             25


 (iv) Actions beyond the core activities of land administration should be considered f they
                                                                                       i
significantly enhance project impact and are within the project's implementation capacity.
RERMP's housing finance and mortgage reform component is in the banking rather than
land domain, but was a significant contributor to RERMP's goal to improve the efficiency of
the land market. Inclusion of this component was within Slovenia's implementation capacity.
While a focused land administration project would generally be preferred, addition to a
project of a high impact ancillary component may be beneficial if manageable by the
institution concerned (paras. 3.9 and 3.41).

 (v)   Legislative reforms are an essential concomitant to establishing a land
administration program. Development of a legal base for land administration, which was
minimal before RERMP, was, appropriately, prioritized by Government and the Bank, and
laws were passed to provide a structured legislative framework. Laws were proactively
amended as experience was gained, and legislation in related sectors (mortgages, taxes) was
also approved (paras. 3.26 and 3.27 and Table 5).

Re: Slovenia - Real Estate Registration Modernization Project (Loan No. 4498); Draft
Project Assessment Report

Dear Sirs,

Thank you for the Draft Project Performance Assessment Report of the Real Estate
Registration Modernization Project in Slovenia, which we have received on June 2, 2010. As
requested, we would like to provide some comments, as we are certain that they will be
beneficial to the preparation of the final report.

Firstly, we would like to comment on the assessment of court staff being ,,the most critical
design shortfall" (3.8.), which we find completely incorrect. From the very start of the
project, and even prior to that, as the project of Land Registration Reform started well before
the World Bank project itself, the judiciary has ensured a sufficiently strong and professional
personnel structure, which was dedicated to the project full-time. The findings mentioned in
3.48 seem to be similarly incorrect or based on incorrect information. We therefore cannot
agree with the finding that the courts were not prepared or could not ensure specialist cadre
of full-time registration staff. The staff working at the Land Register has excellent and
continuous professional training for both the existing as well as new staff members, thus
ensuring adequate levels of professionalism and dedication. At the beginning of the project
some personnel structures had to be adjusted to the existing numbers of new cases and of the
staff. This was temporarily solved by the courts by assigning either the personnel or cases to
other courts in order to ensure their timely processing.

The project of Land Registration Reform has started well before the start of the World Bank
RERMP and is still in progress. It is a permanently on-going project and its position within
                                          35                                    Appendix D

the judicial branch ensures its sustainability and independence. The same view has also been
upheld by the Constitutional Court of Slovenia (decision U-II-464/06). Land Register is a
part of the judiciary, and as such does not ,,rely on a continuing proactive Supreme Court and
county court judges despite their many other activities," as had been suggested in the draft
report. Also, the issues of funding and functioning of the Land Register are not and cannot be
subject of the decisions of the government or the executive branch. We therefore find the
findings in 3.43 slightly unusual.

A meeting with the representative of the World Bank was held at the Supreme Court on
December 2,2009. The idea of a single agency system had not been mentioned or presented
at this meeting, otherwise we would have been happy to provide information and comments
on this issue at the time. We would therefore like to point out that a legislative proposal of a
similar nature had been removed from the procedure, and that the amendments to the Law on
Land Register to this effect have already been dismissed in the past.

A new legislation is currently being prepared, which does not include such a solution, but
does specifically stipulate that land registration is subject to the judicial decision making
process, and therefore remains within the courts system. The new legislation is also
introducing a single Land Register court for the entire country, which is supposed start
operating November 15,2010. Such a solution will also put into practice the proposal of the
World Bank to introduce a ,,chief registrar,"which will function as a single national land
registration court.

We would also like to express our surprise, that despite the meeting with the representative of
the World bank, the final report still seems to be primarily based on his initial assumptions
(which we believe were based on informal sources and do not represent the official position
of the state, but may rather follow their own individual interests), and that the information
provided by the Supreme Court and its report had been used selectively.

We have also identified certain discrepancies of the referenced sources. For example, the
Draft report references Doing Business 20 10. However, the data in this report is not
consistent with the data presented in the WB Draft Report. We therefore conclude, that the
comparisons of registration procedures between Slovenia and the countries, which are used
in the report as comparative or potential benchmarks,.could also be incorrect or
incomparable.

                                                                    Supreme Court of Slovenia
