The\n            report contains an analysis of existing data on radiological\n            safety in harvesting and processsing of wood, public safety\n            in product use, and forestry development in the\n            Chernobyl-affected areas of Belarus using information gained\n            from local foresters and scientists.  Their information is\n            used to determine the time course of contamination buildup\n            in various tree species under different growth conditions.\n            Thus, the effect of harvest time on radionuclide content of\n            wood and dose to workers is discussed for different tree\n            species in different locations.  Other aspects of the\n            environmental assessment, such as resource management,\n            product development and waste management, are discussed in\n            less detail.  The report includes discussions of: 1) worker\n            radiological safety in both harvesting and processing; 2)\n            product monitoring and public safety standards in\n            harvesting, processing and transportation; 3) contamination\n            containment from harvesting equipment and during\n            transportation; 4) quality standards and export policy; 5)\n            disposal of radioactive waste including industrial off-cuts,\n            ash, liquors from pulping, etc..; 6) use of contaminated\n            wood as fuel; 7) post-harvest soil management; 8) the\n            Ministry of Forestry's oversight and regulatory\n            functions by contamination zone; 9) resource management of\n            zones that are too  contaminated to harvest in the short\n            term future; and 10) management strategies for the medium\n            and long term."}, "docdt": "1994-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
