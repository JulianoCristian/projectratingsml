In hrtvest forest hioniss production every yeat. Forest radioactive contamination
Iherpeere i;ns botih the ftiture production potential of a land and the potential accumulated
in .1 lf.ll centiny th. t pTeceded the Accid-nt. The management of millions of cubic metres
flr enviamiinited wood is .such a vast task that while there is no economic interest in this
tyvpe or activity. nothing will be undertaken for the restoration of contaminated forest
na enc.   e r   afIoralini or a rorest may be promoted if technologies for the valorisation of
-tInncI c n be applied.
lnvestiention or fniterral sampled in the Chernobyl Zone2 shows that the most of the
kitutmuiwatrin is still in the organic layer of the forest soil. Even the lowest contamination
lonids to increasing the radioactivity of wood inasmch as the part of deposited radio
rinclides has been already available for root uptake, If nothing is undertaken to reclaim the
frlnest nnw, the qmuntity of contaminated wood will draniatically increase in the future.

envi,,mrneeital cost? To answver this question the followvng subjects are under the
crnsidleration in this study-

L I Tn eive a scientific substantiation for conception of forestry, and to prepare the
commercial proposals on the application of the technologies developed.
1I shouldlite stressed that after removing the bark and phloem that represent 75% of the
irtivilv in a tree tirnmk and 7r  of a tree mass, the contamination of wood requires yet
mnt11her decontamination step to satisfy the consumer regulations3 in some fields of the use.
The technnlogies and pilot technique for this most important step, as well as for
cir-ming tip the mnust contamiiinated spots in the productive forest area, are currently being

ilteuories: 4i) non radinactive waste; (ii) conventionally radioactive waste; (iii) low level
ra:ionctive waste. Low level radioactive waste (LRW) according the Waste Manageme
Sanitarv Ruiles (COKPO85) corresponds to the solid radioactive waste with. the lowest

enwtniiined area (see Fig. 2.1). These samples of total quantity of about 1.3 ton
iindlcwent the meamirement of their specific activity and were used later for experimentl
stuly or lhe processes or wood deontamination and valorization.
S Samples from November 1992 were taken inside 10-km zone at Kopachi, Buakovka,
-nnd in the Red Forest. The samples from the springsunmmer of 1993 involve areas firter
away. noie in Ukraine in Rivne province, the other in the Gomel province inside 304c

Samples of birch and Scots pine were taken respectively in Burakovka and Kopachi.
Righut Iv the place of wood sampling the litter and soil sections were gathered. Soil Ws
sampled usinus an aluminium core drill of 10 cm in diameter and 50 cm long. The core,
remcoved easily from the sandy soil of Chernobyl, was pushed out from drill and
sinuIiraneorsIy was cut into slices of I to 2 cm thick, to detemiine the radioactity
inier.eion prolile. 1.ilter was sampled using a trowel on a 10 cm- area to a depth of about
IO) em. Wood saimples were taken fom tres bt  30 yes old with two slices of 5 to 10
cm thick made at 1-metre intervals; one analysed in rrance in IPSN/DPE1/SERE and the
.tillet amalysed at the sane time in Belarus in IPEP. Tihe litter and soil samples taken in the
Red Forest have served to identifiy several radio nuclides. Wood of about 50 kg from the
Redl Forest represents Scots pine, and it was uise  later in laboratory study- of
*lwhemochemical treatment processes both in France and Be'arus.

IrrEr in Minsk and IPSN in Cadarache show the similar results (Figures 2.6). Each annual
eircle laver wvas punctually stripped using special technique designed in. IPEP, that provided
stlippinh! thfe aze-ring in an axis direction. Trne samples of age-rings reeived were futhe

contamination or this wood can only be explained by the percolating difEusion of
T radio mt.clides from ctntaminated wood outside towards wood inside.
Similar restilts (Fig. 2.7) are observed in the wood of a birch trees sampled in
ilitrakln,ka. alirnuah they are not easy to distinguish as those of pine sampled in extremely
rniII-IIi:Iailed ReA FOrest. Ih;S explains why the distribution of Cs-137 and Sr-90 i-

Vertical distribution
The resIlts in Rlures 2.. 2.Q represent the radioactivity due to Cs-137 and Sr-90
measured in a log slice Still bearing its bark. In spite of the fluGtuation because of random
samPling, it appears that the distribution of the radio nuclides in a vertical profile is fairly
iiiiirorm, lint may be explained by convection transfer brought about by sap rising through
the vascular system.
Conclusion
TIhe main goal of our measurements at the sampling plots was to rtizdy the
characteristics of wood followed its f&rther treatment and valorisation. On the otier hand
[he new data received in 1993 gave the possibility to specifi notions regarding the prest
radioactive scenario in the contaminated forest and, that would be the most important, the
next step concerning the decontamination strategy and countermeasures applicable to
rorcst ecosystems. Our previous results (Fig. 1.4) and a new one given in this chapter show
that forestry will in the nearest future face at the dramatically increase of the volume of
contaminated wood. Yesterday this wood suited the permissible levels but will not after 5-
10 years further when both root uptake and radio miclides difflusion inside the wood stein
will lead to about 55 to 600/o of valuable wood which will not meet the TPL-91'
rcquirements (see Fig. 1.7).
It should be stressed that Sr-90 contamination in the wood is about 10 times more than
that due to Cs-137. although deposits of these radio nuclidesWare equivalent in term of
q.uantity. This result acknowledge that strontium transfers to the wood are greater than
those of caesium, as though contaniination were entering by the roots.
In the most cases, removing the humus layers of about 6 to 8 cn thick results in
removal of the most of deposit (80 to 90%/e). This conclusion follows the radio nudlides
distribution in forest litter and forest soil (Figures 2.2-2.5). Moreover the level of
contanmintation in. the liter is by a factor of I00-500 ligher than in the wood, even in the
bark. The wood debrisgenerated as a result of felling the forest can therefore be remained
jkst at the area of felling- This doesn't bring radio ecological situation into the worse and
promotes frurther accruing the new litter so increases the buffering capacity, that can also
reduce the irradiation from humus layers.
Tnus, the litter layer removal still remains as the only method to improve the radio
ecological situation in the contaminated forest But this method also remains as the most
expensive one and requires in every case the analysis of efficiency, taking into account the
amount of waste, thickness of humus, possibility of erosion of soil, presence of appropriate
technique. The last concerns the wood feiring as well.

3. 1Testing the torest decontamination techniques
(IPSN/DPEI/SERE, IPEP)
PrellmInary test of collectng the llitr
Chernobyl forests. and namely those of Belanis, consist mostly of Scots pine (see Fig
1.2). These forests ae artificial, plaed with lines of trees spaced about 3 m apw  The
tnder rowth contains a light layer of shrubs, which must be removed, however, to allow a
machine to cWlIect the fitter.
In view of possible tesang in the Chernobyl Zone, a inmted test on litter layer reval
was conducted on a few square metres in the Cadarache forest which is planted with Scots
pine. This forest, aside fiom the height of the taees that has no influence on the litter
colketed, is rathe similar to the Chernobyl forests
The horizntal grnding mower (Wiedenmami machine) made in Germany was used.
The tTial has shown that the mower can cut and grind the light shrub vegetation. Adjusting
the cufting height allows the gindmg bldes to penetrate the fitter layer, feeding it to a
rotaiy brush  cated above which transfers the fitter to a wagon located behind the machne
(see scheme below and Fig. 3.1).

A visual assessment of litter collection shows that when the ground is flat, the process
works efriciently (Fig. 3.3). The cutting tool of this mnachine is too wide (1.2 m), however,
to rollow the ground surface closely when it is uneven, so that bumps are scraped, but the
litter close to ground is not caught by the mower. In addition, there is a large amount of
dust raised, to an extent that appears unacceptable in the present situation.

Tre fleling machine
The dion of a machine for cleing trees (Valmet made in Sweden) was
camed out in collaboration with the French vendor in a finest of Scots pime in the Alpes de
Haut  Pirovence regn, selected for its resemblanc with the Chanobyl foest as regads
the age of he tr  and dte deity of plntion. Clearing conditions are more difficult in
the Alps, bowva, due to the slope of the lnd, about 30%, whereas the land aoud
Chernobyl is practicaly flaL
The tree img mchine used is one of the most widely sold models mi the world, with
abou 250 machines presently in use. It ony ct coifers, the brnches of these  es
having lmited lateral develo      can cut down tees from 30 to 50 cm in diameter.
This macine is a motor Nehe comparabkl to a pow  shovel wih a telescopic arm
aeipped with a cutting head that suudshe ees before cutting -them using a circbur
chain saw (see Figures 3.3 and 3.4). When the tree has been ott at the base, the arm can
move within a radius of 10 m aound the machine, to position the cuting head, still aound
the te, i a tring a   were paut of the bark an the brches arn cut off. Trimnmng
is perfomied by twio wheels that feed the trunk across the cutting head which has blades
that cut ofr the .inc branches. While this machine appeas quite simple in design, its
implementation calls for the use of state-of-the-art technology as regards both. the strength
of parts such as the hydrauric motors and the connecting parts to them, and the electrical  -
control devices linked to the control station. which use such sophisticated remote contml
techniques as those provided for nudear industby.
AnY iniher description of t[is machine has been described quite completely in
specimrised journra12. It should be noted, however, that the cotrol station, located about
L15 m above the ground, is in a sealed and air conditioned cabin, faurable for ensuig
radiation protection. In compaison to manual. fi     this machine allows an itinsic
reduulion of the colletive dose, since it accomplishes the work of 12 woodcutters.
Model to estimate an external dose rate for forestry psmonnel
Lar  scale application of the rmeion technologies mendoned abov in this chapter
has to be proved with assessment ofrisk for forestry personeI that is connected with dose
of  iaton. Individual and collective dos:, and namely the cost of risk caused by
irradiation impact to people in contaninated forest; must be taken into account whie
conducting the cost-benefit anais.
As it follows frm prvious chapters the most part of external ilmadation dose is
connected with  -enitters mainly with radio caesiwn The objective tberefore leads to the
equation of transfer of radiation from voluminous sources of different configuration in the
heterogeneous medium.

allows to control tbe specific activity of wood without cutting the tree. The measurements
inciude the determnination of 7- and P-emitters dose rte at difrerent altitudes and position
of detector.
Conclusion
To improve the radio ecologial situation in the contaminated fomst existing technique
medionled above can bc used. Field trial coid out shows that machines testcd need some
modification to provide the flecessry requiremnt Due to this the dust resuspension that
frolows the grinding mower operation must be avoided, and couresponding protection
aginst irradiation from contaninated soil has to be provided for the tree felling machine
operator.
Scraping the surface humus layer certainly results in very high effectiveness of
deconitamination which can be more than 90°X.. On the other hand it may brings to the
sever ecological daamagc, eg soil rosion whie low buffering capacity, and to large
volume of waste generated. Therefore this countemeasure should be applied to clean the
most dangerous spots before industrial feling to reduce extea dose rate, taking into the
account cost-benerit analysis. I also could be recommended for limited area inside
recreation zones (parks, gardens).                                                 .
The external dose mte may be of 10-20%o reduced if the thickness of planting
constitutes s(r50 of existing now. T o mnake a corresponding cleaning in the zone of 1540
Ci/km2, thus to save/produce about 20 million cubic metres of pine wood, 20-30 Felling
nachines mnitioned 'is necessary ror long-tenn peiod of about i0 years.
In CIS countries there are several models of appropriate technique among existing
machines. c g ITU04 for felling and IM1C-06 for liter renoval could be listed.

Mechanical stripping
In the zone of contamination level of 5-15 Ci/km2 raw wood after feling require bark
stripping that may removes 7r of biomass and 60-70"/. of rtioactivity. Valuable wood
trunk reeived in this zone may be ued without any limitaion.
In the zone of 15-40 Cik  the contmr  of quality of wood must be provided and, cam
stripping bark, valuable wood trunk is, along wih this, recommended not to be directly
used but only if it is sawn into the beams. Phloem layers of 2-3 cm  idck have to be
stripped too, so the average size of square beam would not exceed 70%. of stem dimer.
Nevertheless wood processed as it is mentioned above still contains not less than 30-
40%/n of activity. This wood should be underwent yet another econtamaon step
especialy if it is delivered to the process with a higb enrchnent fictor (Table 4.1).

Dissolving tlhe radlo nucildes from the wood using a thermnochendcal
process
The fiSrt results were obtained in the Cadarache laboratory on about ten tests inlving
samples of ;pproximately 30 g of dry Scots pine wood from the Red Forest These test
gave quite promising results. since on an average, efficiency of wood pulp decontaminaion
is 95%ez for 90Sr and 137Cs (Table 4.2).
These radio nuclides were dissolved in the liquid medium used in the current industrial
protection decontamination process. Dissolving these radio nuclides makes it possible to
perhaps concentrate them using known processes such as ion exchanging resins Wood
pulp decontaminated in this way could then be used in conventional wood procesg
without requiring implementation of protection techniques against radio nuclide dispersion.

Thermal process under the pressure (pyrogenic process)
In the laboratory condition the research of radio nuclides distnrbution and forms of their
physical-chemical state in the processes of thermal treatment of contaninated wood is
being carried out. Expaiment is conducted. at the temperature range of 200-1000°C.
aiming to study different processes (dry'ig, pyroLisis, gasification) using the pressure-
sealed of 2 1 supplied with electrical heating and applicable to a pressure of 20 MPa. Air
consumption in the vessel is regulated. Pine/birch wood is ground previously and loaded

Preliminary results give a reduction factor of about 200 in the products of thrvmal
treatment using pyrogenic process in temperature less than 600°C under the certain
pressure and condition..
Conclusion
- -               Valuabie wood harvested in contaminated zone can be used in corresponding industrial
fields but in the very technological processes, which don't result in concentration of radio
nuclides in final product or in by-products more than it is established according
intervention levels. On the other hand, our raw assessment of enrichment factor (see Table
4.1) and results published"3 show that TPL-91 (see Table 1.5) doesn't correspond the
rrames of Regulations for the CRW and CIIOPO'85 for the LRW. For example, in order to
avoid the LRW generation in technological chain of pulp/paper production (eg. in black

i Valorlsation of wood. Trial of pilot installations
(IPEP, F?RAMAXOME)
Iicineraion of wood waste
In tihe past FRAMATOME has developed sveral methods in the produce useful energy
rI,ii. hioniass and lhas built an industrial prototype plant generating rud gas from biomass.
mlis gasifier is based on Ihe pressurized fluidized bed princ;ple and is sized to produce six
ions per hour of gas from wood waste (wood chips, bark, leaves. etc.).
The method consists in using oxygen to gasiiy previously dried wood waste under
pressure in a two-stage gasifier. The secondary waste is vitrified and steai is injected into
the process c make fiael gas. This gas can be burnt to produce enegy either in gas turbines
or in steam generating systems. It can also be reformed to produce usable methanol.
Adaptation Or these methods can be used for treating chips and bark or organic waste
contaminated byChemnobyl falloul.
Tnie cnnagninatcd pans or trces, crown and bark could be processed in a circulating.
flluiilded bed incineralor designed in FRAMATOME, either to generate gas and produce
msiofrli suich as netliaiicol or lo generate steam in an atmospheric fluidized bed incinerator
in order to produce electricity. Secondary organic waste resulting fionm litter removal
processes such as described in previous chapter could also be collected an incinerated in a
fluidized bed incinerator in order to produce steam for electricity generation.
A Iluidized bed is formed by placing a powdery material in a rising air current. When
lthe speed or ihc air is increased the corresponding rising forces acting on the material
1aliticles will rollow suiL Beyond a ccrtain speed the material appears to grow in volume, a
hori7ontal surface romis and lhe material swarts to behave like a liquid.
This type or fluidi7ed bed is known. M)re recently the advantages of the circulating
fluidi7ed bed technique have given rise to rew developments in its use in the area of waste
treatment".
For thc incineration orcontaininated wood and organic waste, it is assumed that a large
scale fluidi2md bed incinerator (6 tons per hour of contaminated waste) is necessary. This
incinerator is catpled to a waste heat recovery boiler for superheated stern production
wviich celd be used in a steam turbine for electricity generation.
Irolection against the dispersal of radionuclides is provided by a bag house filter
kcatled on the nfT gas stream at the outlct c,tthe waste heat recovery boiler. The bag house
filtcr is cquipped with high reLention eiriciency bags made of GX7RE-TEX material having
an eniciency of 99.91/o ror partides of 0.2 to 0.3 .. The GORE-TEX felt is able to operate
at 240^C and Ihe bags are periodically cleaned by pulsed air.
The incinerator operates at a slightly negative pressure which is an additional safety
reature. The main data related io the opration of the fluidized bed incinerator are given
helowl.

Source and character1stlc of wastes
Ash
Radioactive ash presents a significant part of waste in Chemobyl Zonc Now the
domestic stoves anid municipal heating fiumaces are producing the muual amount of about
20 thousand tons of radioactive ashL The use of contamiaed wood and peat as a local fild
with specific activity even less than Tentative Perwismble Limit (TPL-91), i.e. 0.7 kBqkg,
gives the activiq of ash or about 50-100 kBqcg. Besides, the   otaminafion ad the
valuable wood production in contamited forest am gie more than 1.5 milion tons of
wood waste (e.g. felling by-products. natunl tree fallout, wase after wood  o g,
etc.) per year some fiaction of which is expected to be ili   or pre-reted wit a
special equipment (e.g. gas geneaor. fluidized bed furnace, trench incinerator). The
estimated value of ash obtained after this processing is about 10 thousand tons per year.
The masured and averaged data on specific activity of wood in Belarus forests ar given
in Table 6.2.

The composition of mineral residues afler buning the wood waste depends mainly
upon trec speies, its age, soil and landscape condition, bark percentage, season, etc. The
average wood ash composition following our data for Belanus fiorest is given in Table 63.

. Annual consumption of clinoptilolyte is expected not more than 1000 tons and its
specific activity after the treatment of riquid waste and contaminated water solutions does
not exceed 10 kBq/kg.
Soent liquid decontaminating solution
The most widespread decontaminating solutions are made of nitic acid, oxalic acid and
citic acid. As for alkaline solution, a sodium hydroxide mixed with potassum
permanganate is usually used.
Before immobilization the spent solutions undergo the muthal neutralizing then pH
correcting. The integrated liquid consists of nitrates and oxalates. Sodium nitrate presents
a significant part in the liquid waste and its concentration nonnally does not exceed 50 g1l
that meets the requirement of further conditioning in order to reduce the waste vohmne.
Thie salt concentration has not to be higher than 250-300 gn taldng into account the
amount of water necessary for cementing, and this can -be prorided with evaporation or
electro-osmotic dewatefing.
The expenence of decontamination carried out at nuwnrous industrial enterpris  in
Gomel Province, Belarus, allows to make an assessnent of annual consumption of the
liquid waste mentioned. It amounts to 200 tons approximately and the salt solutions after
conditioning contain radio caesium of not more than 10 kBq/kg.
Wet solid waste
Wet solid wastes are mainly presented of nm-off bottom sediments. The specific
activity of pulp afler drying and incandescing varies fTom 0.1 to 1.5 kBq/lc Thi waste as
well as residuals after treatmnt of the most contaminated spots of soi can be directed to
the disposal site.

Immobilzatlon process
It results from the previous chapter that total weighL of low level radioactive wate
generated every year by decontamination activity cam achieve 50 thousand tons. To
immobilize that volume the traditional and quite simple method of enmbedding the waste
into cement matrix could be used taking into account the activity level of wastc But i is
well known that even the advanced cement technologies have an embedding raio of not
more than 2-30 % in a case of aih and 15-20 % in a case of corcentrated salt solions.
Therefore 150-200 thousand tons of aInn   consumption of a cement is required to
immobilize Chernobyl wastes in Bdarus; i.e. of about 10 % of national potenti of
cement should be spent for ths purpose.
In this study we consider several technologies that give the possibility to reduce the
cement consumption, above all by means of incuding some industi waste into a binding
materid.
Phosphor-gyvsum as a bindin2 material 7
In Gomed Province, Beawns there is a larg source of phosphor-gypsumn that represents
a by-product of fertilizer manufacture plants. The phosphor-gypsum processing technology
for binding material production is developed at Gomde Chemical Fertilizer Factory and
includes cooking, then calcinating at 650-300 IC and fine-miling. For the purposes of our
., research the phosphor-gypsum binding material (GBM) was presented by GCFF. The.mark
of GBM, used at present stage, cormsponds initial compressive strength of the pure GBM-
paste of about R,=12 MPa.
To determine the propenies of GBM as a matrix fbr radioactive waste emnbedding, the
laboratory test programme allowing sveral GBM4Waste compositions to be cmpared
was developed:
13 Fabrication of samples by means of laboratory equipment with the ainm to evaluate
the feasibility of waste that is loaded into the solidified fonm
1i Measurement of the resistance to the compression of the hardened samples after
28 days.
(1 Measurement of the radio nucLide leach rate, usirg real radioactive ash as a
constituent of samnple and stable Cs solution as welL
(1  Determination of swelling abilitwater eisnce, radiolysis resistance and
freezing-defrosting firmness.
There were fabficated more than 300 sampics by mean of mixng the GBM with ash
and fine-milled clinoptilolyte or/and ion exchge resins and then nitrate-oxalate liquid -
solutions conditioned up to 250-300 gl were added. More water was poured if necessay.
The liquid introduced into the composition had an acid concentration being enough for ash
alkali to be neutralized. The cylindrical samples obtained had a diameter of 2 can md a
height of 2.2 cm. The composition of wastes loaded was yaied in a wide range and total
waste consumption reached 69 wt %. The anablsis of data of comprv  stength
measurements after 28 days (see Fig. 6.1) shows that the best results were obtained with
the proportions for each constituent such as that is given in Table 6.5.

The compressive strength constituted about. 60-70 °K of R.. The leach rate tests for
caesium and sirontium gave the results very similar to that obtained fbr ordinary Portland
cement mairix containing 12 wt % of ash. Other items of the test prognraune have not
been finished yet, but the results obtained are rather promising.
Further improvement
The determinaion of pozzolanic activity of ash did not give the evident positive rslt
but composition obtained by means of mixing the dinoptilolyte and ashi, calcinating it. at
500-600 eC and then simultaieous fine-milling showed the tass activity and aveage
auuminate and silicate module. The incorporation of this pre-trament with immobTihation
technology mentioned above enables to increase the degree of loading the waste into
solidified block by 10- 1 5 % and to improve its strength and sulphate resistance (Fig. 6.2).
Impregnating the hardened samples by a special monomer compositon gave a hydro-
resisting and reinforcing polymer-concrete layer of 2-3 cm thick. An imprepatng
Lnnmposition comprises a number of oligomer-based compounds, which are polynefized by
radiation or thermo-chemical methods applied after impregnation thus foming a tough
noinsoluble polymer of a latticed structure. Sonme results showing the properties of
polymer-concrete layer afler impregnation of concrete samples with a three-ethylenglycol
dimcthyl ether and polymerization of layer by irradiation of 40 kGy are given in Table 6.6
and Table 6.7.
The compressive strength R of the layer impregnated increases by a factor of 2-3 in
comparison with a strength JR of starting concrete sample. The layer obtained ihows the
resistance to salt, acid and alkli, and its low-tempeau  resistace reaches 800 freeing-
defrosting cycles. The rate of radio nuclide leaching drops off by a ftor of 3 to S. As for
forming the reinforcing polymer-gypsum layer in the samples with GBM, the test has not
completed yet but the first data also show that the characteristics are improved.
Coating the immobilized waste
Fonning a durable and hydro-resisting capsule mide of latex-cement-clinoptilolyte
composition around the filled block was also studied. The optimal composition obtained is
gfiven in Table 6.8. After heating up to 80-90 IC and cesing at 10 kPa, the cale,
being solidified and impregnated with oligo-ether, gains a strength of up to 50 MPa, i.e.
thrice more than pure concrete sample made of a same cementing material. The above
nientioned properties or polymer-concrete layer obtained permit to recommed to using it
as a capsule for preserving the immobilized radioactive wastes from outer environment
cfllcts duiringa long-lcrm and permanent storage.

LilY .   :CONCLUSION
*liw inomlinu.tjn availa1ble in this docutment provides a fairly complete view of the data

.       IkIlanis. tiC repiblic die most airected by the Chernobyl acciden, but the results are for
Ili mnst parl applicable to the olher CIS republics.
Trhe litter is the most contaninated part of the forest ecosysten. The cae5ium
ronrtntratinn can be estimated as 100-500 times greater than that of the wood. The litt
.        .is a radionuclide resevoir for the tree roots which route contamination to the trunk,

r*sevwvir mi,stlm inics. the fibccasa sci.rorth in this doctirnent, i.c., the increase of transfer
-,ficlrs. the consequence of which will be an etremely large increase in the amount of
w0wl contaminated within thc next S to 10 yeas. Although heavy investments may be
!  reilliret. solutions can yet be proposed to face the present state of afiirs. The study of the
d,  .,mic soil-to-plant transfer of radio miclides predicts for the future. much impostant
i   Jifit7'i it-; fiuI t: tm;agicrncnt or thc produciion orcontanuinated wood
A I;airiv simple remlmbilitalini model wotild consist in first collecting litter using the .
ii,' lipilpnwnl trevdl 211 (Cadainchic anrl tlicn storing it in-sitiu on tihc ground, scalcd nfT by a
i  .  votecInical nienihrane. In the next phase the contaminated -trees would be cut down
111edhnnic-ally andf transported tn their usage site. Wood cutting debris such as branches,
.Ihere cinlarminmaion is much lower than in the litter, would be left in place to reconstitute
I . Ilie ornic laver recluired to protect the soil. Certain spots or strips of fores. would not be
-   uot down t allow natural reueieration of the pine forest through seed dispersion. The
i -       cu,mlulaminnild wosnnd wotild be either incinerated, or decontaminated to provide a certain
flhliount irf economic compelisation for investments.
An alternative to this model would consist in not taki.,g any action whatsoever, other
lum' io impose restrictions on the use of forests and then wait for radioactivity tO decay.
Tlhis possibilitv is being studied as part of a sub-project entitled -"sef-restorationw,
ctndnucted witlin ihe sarme EEC programme as the present work. Once the rcsults of this
iesearclh eroip are available. they wvll perhaps give way to ideas more. attractive to
:sulljpoltcrs rirf atural methods than the solution proposed in this document.
Nonct heIsM. a rew ideas to reflect upon regarding management of contaminated forests
are alreadlv available. The first concerns the forest fires that ravaged 2000 ha in l992,
emisnllen ItI tceIivil lif radionuiclile suspenstion in the flying cinders and smoke to such an
extent that contamination in the air at Chernobyl reached the levels recorded in 1987. One
-  Or i:e ca:ics nr :i:c rim was the lack of upkeep in the forests which caused an
ar t ukii;ltio,i or(iead wood. favourable lo starting fires.
!.-Antwioer slviciii to takc inito considcra lion is the opinion of Lhe forest owner. While
-t -is quesion may be easily solved at. Chemobyl, this will surely not be the  e  in the
-   - :   f~s ires of Solo.ne- fror cxample. Although rehabilitation of the contaminated forests of
(lhernohvl may seem utopic, the iesults of a full-scale experience cWod demonstrate tieir
