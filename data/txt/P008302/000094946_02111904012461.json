However, the Bank\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory, given that project\n            design assumed far more rapid implementation of\n            macroeconomic reforms than actually achieved, in contrast to\n            a satisfactory Borrower performance, which exhibited\n            responsibility at project preparation ,and resourcefulness\n            under difficult management issues. Lessons highlight the\n            knowledge the Bank holds in forestry development, a position\n            which should have benefited the identification of policy\n            constraints to the forestry sector. Regrettably, project\n            design encompassed too many components, which made\n            monitoring and evaluation insurmountable, and, this lack of\n            simplicity was also reflected in various aspects of project\n            management, hampering disbursement. Moreover, the weak\n            procurement capacity - including accounting and auditing\n            practices - should have been assessed prior to\n            implementation. Likewise, the economic analysis should have\n            been critically assessed during the internal review process,\n            prior to Bank approval, for it is suggested that the\n            commercial viability of the seed center facility is in\n            question, because of higher than expected costs.\n            Nonetheless, holding at least one Bank operation under\n            implementation, at times of an overall deteriorating\n            situation in a country, may sustain a Bank and Borrower dialogue."}, "docdt": "2002-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
