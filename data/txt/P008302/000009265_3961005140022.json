parts; and introduction to efficient\n            harvesting practices; (c) forest fire protection: provision\n            of adequate protection against forest fires and prevention\n            of the spread of radionuclide contamination through forest\n            fires; and (d) forest ecology: policy for the preservation\n            of biodiversity and species mix; monitoring of forestry air\n            pollution and radionuclide contamination; monitoring of\n            fuelwood utilization; assessment of the ecological impact of\n            the harvest and maintenance systems;
