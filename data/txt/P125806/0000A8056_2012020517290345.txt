                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The Third Development Policy Loan on Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors (PASS) in the Dominican Republic is the third of a series of three sequential
                         programmatic operations. Its overall objective is to improve results in social sectors in order to preserve the human capital of the poorest citizens in the short term and
                         enhance it the medium term. Consistent with this vision, the PASS has four objectives: (i) enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital for the
                         poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government‘s Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in
                         health and education; (ii) improve budget management to support the performance of social sectors, protect critical social spending and support the required
                         improvements in the supply of health, nutrition and education services; (iii) support the gradual introduction of performance agreements in key social sector agencies;
                         and (iv) enhance transparency and oversight in social sectors.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The loan agreement was signed on November 18, 2011 after confirming that all prior actions had been achieved across all four pillars supported by the Performance and
                         Accountability of Social Sectors (PASS) series. Congress has ratified the project on January 17th, 2012. The team is now preparing the documentation necessary to ensure
                         Effectiveness of the loan before the February 27, 2012 deadline. Disbursement would take place shortly after effectiveness declaration.
