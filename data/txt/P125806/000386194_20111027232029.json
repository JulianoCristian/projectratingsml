          capital (health, nutrition, education) for the poorest\n            citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the\n            Government's Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program,\n

within the\n            CCT program; (iii) to support the gradual introduction of\n            performance agreements in social sectors; and (iv) to\n            enhance transparency and accountability to users by\n            strengthening the enabling environment for a better informed\n            demand for improved public sector performance in the social\n            domain.
