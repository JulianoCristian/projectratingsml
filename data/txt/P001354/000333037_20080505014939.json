(KENYA,", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Second National\n            Agricultural Research Project for Kenya were as follows:\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            when the outcome of an operation is contingent upon a\n            parallel program on which the project has minimal influence,\n            the risk mitigating measures should be identified at\n            appraisal. Establishing partnerships with research\n            organizations and allowing independent external evaluation\n            of research institutions operations, management, and\n            performance enhance institutional maturity. This is the\n            hallmark of Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI).\n            Other research organizations value KARI's scientific\n            knowledge and reciprocally, KARI seeks partnership to fill\n            in-house knowledge gaps. KARI has benefited immensely from\n            independent external evaluations. This reflects an openness\n            to new ideas that is important for institutional\n            development. Adopting a pluralistic approach for the\n            delivery of agricultural services requires the parallel\n            placement of complementary input and service delivery\n            institutions. Care should be taken in assuming the readiness\n            of new service providers. Lessons from the reforms of the\n            1980s teach us that due to incomplete policy reforms and\n            market failures, the expected service and input providers\n            may equally fail to step-in or delay their full integration\n            in the pluralistic market and create delivery gaps. A case\n            in point is the failure of the national parallel Training\n            and Visit (T&V) system which was critical for the\n            dissemination of KARI's new agricultural technologies.\n            A good lesson is KARI's gradual withdrawal from a\n            number of commercial commodity research areas which are\n            handled by growers associations whose members were strongly\n            supporting the transfer of responsibility."}, "docdt": "2008-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
