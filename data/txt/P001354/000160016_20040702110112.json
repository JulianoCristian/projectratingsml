Lessons learned from this project\n            are outlined as follows: 1) Objectives should be stated\n            clearly and concisely, and limited to what the project can\n            realistically accomplish. 2) When circumstances change and\n            necessitate revision of objectives and/or activities,\n            project teams should state clearly what has happened, even\n            in cases when political sensitivities may be aroused. 3)\n            Monitoring and evaluation of relevant indicators are crucial\n            to ex post evaluation and to project supervision. 4)\n            Research should focus on the system of production within\n            which commodities are produced, as well as characteristics\n            specific to the key commodities. 5) Institutional changes\n            key to the success of the project but potentially sensitive\n            for political or other reasons should be agreed prior to\n            project approval.  6) Commercial viability may not be\n            achievable within the constraints of a public or parastatal\n            institution. 7) Outreach can complement and enrich research,\n            but will not substitute for other mechanisms of extension or\n            provision of advisory services. 8) Agricultural research\n            without complementary and effective mechanisms for\n            dissemination and adoption of technology will have low returns."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
