In\n            addition, it would assist in : a) rationalizing investments\n            for rural electrification, b) establishing a long term\n            framework for extending the rural network at least cost, c)\n            capturing the benefits of investments already made, while\n            improving the reliability of service and reducing network\n            losses, and d) minimizing the generating capacity shortfalls\n            through the better management of load. The project consists\n            of two components. The first is infrastructure development\n            which includes extending electricity supply to new villages,\n            connecting to grid settlements of already electrified\n            villages, expanding consumer connections, reinforcing the\n            network, and extending the supply to tubewells. The second\n            is technical assitance which would provide for mapping of\n            villages, installing load management schemes and consultancy services."}, "docdt": "1989-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
