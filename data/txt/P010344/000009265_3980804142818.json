The project only\n            partially achieved its key objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was marginally satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, there is no substitute for\n            thorough project preparation. Second, it is not realistic to\n            expect a utility to carry out activities for which it is not\n            adequately compensated. Finally, RE programs require a\n            substantially higher commitment of resources than other investments."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
