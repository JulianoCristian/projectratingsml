This study expands on the scale and scope of the\n            initial economic analysis that was completed for 41 KDP\n            projects in November 2001 under KDP 1. That study was\n            limited to calculating Economic Internal Rates of Return\n            only. In contrast, this study focuses on three main\n            activities: (1) Assessing tangible benefits by calculating\n            the Economic Internal Rates of Return for the four types of\n            KDP rural infrastructure; (2) Analysing the overall\n            macro-economic impact of new income generated by KDP\n            infrastructure activities within the local village economies\n            by using (i) a General Income Multiplier Analysis and (ii)\n            Project-Specific Quality of Life Indicators to capture\n            certain intangible benefits that have accrued since the\n            project\u0092s completion; and (3) Undertake a Least-Cost\n            Analysis by re-costing KDP infrastructure projects using\n            local contractor rates to determine what the same project\n            would cost if tendered out by local government to local contractors."}, "docdt": "2005-01-01T13:03:03Z"}
