With poverty rising to 23 percent and\n            institutions of government weakening with Suharto's\n            exit, conventional top-down approaches to development did\n            not offer the most effective way to address the needs of the\n            rural poor. Further, challenges posed by widespread\n            corruption and cronyism were hampering delivery of\n            development projects and created the need for an innovative\n            method that was transparent in providing project funds\n            directly to villagers. Later in 2001, when Indonesia\n            decentralized its governance structure, the KDP provided\n            support in building local level capacity for governance\n            through its large network of facilitators."}, "docdt": "2007-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
