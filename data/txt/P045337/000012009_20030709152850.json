likely, and institutional\n            development impacts are high. Many useful lessons for\n            community-driven development projects are drawn from this\n            project. Human resource development, and capacity building\n            are good investments, and critical to program success.\n            Training was especially important since the project was\n            introducing principles, and procedures (i.e., participation,\n            transparency, accountability, etc.) that represented a\n            radical departure from the practices built up under years of\n            authoritarian rule, in a centralized top-down planning.\n            Nevertheless, the project fell short in addressing\n            effectively a number of training competences, and in\n            addressing such training through a sustained strategy for\n            developing capacities continuously, and transferring skills\n            gradually. Similarly, technical assistance (TA), and\n            supervision for village infrastructure projects in\n            particular need to be strengthened. Furthermore, communities\n            also require more quality training in the areas of planning,\n            financial management, and construction skills. Another\n            important lesson is that community participation can improve\n            through better facilitation, communications, and outreach,\n            while poverty targeting within villages was weak, which led\n            to the exclusion of some of the more marginal and poorer\n            segments of the population. Other lessons address the need\n            to increase women's participation; to continue support\n            for an independent civil society monitoring, as well as\n            invest in strong monitoring, evaluations, and studies; to\n            facilitate the redesign of the economic loan portfolio,\n            given the difficulties experienced in managing the\n            micro-credit component; and, to establish mechanisms to\n            reduce corruption."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
