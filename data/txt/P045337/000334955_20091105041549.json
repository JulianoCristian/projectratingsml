The distinctive feature of the project is\n            its highly decentralized nature, which devolves\n            decision-making down to the villagers themselves. A\n            kecamatan, or council, is an administrative unit made up of\n            multiple villages. Villagers are empowered to exercise full\n            control over their developmental decisions from\n            identification of their needs to implementation of the\n            project. The project also focuses on gender equality and\n            encourages women to participate in planning and\n            decision-making activities. The first phase of the project\n            was completed by the Government of Indonesia in September\n            2002. Infrastructure projects for roads, bridges, water\n            supply systems, and school repairs were executed in more\n            than 21,000 villages in about 1,000 kecamatans throughout\n            the country. The Indonesian Department of Home Affairs is\n            currently in charge of the implementation of the next phase,\n            KDP-II. However, high levels of corruption have been\n            reported in relation to the release of funds and the\n            procurement of materials. With loan repayment rates as low\n            as 50-60 percent, the financial sustainability of the\n            project also remains an issue to be addressed. In addition,\n            the project requires a more responsive technical support\n            structure if the objectives set forth in terms of\n            procurement, financial management, and project quality are\n            to be achieved."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
