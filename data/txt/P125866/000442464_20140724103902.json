and Bank and Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the preparation and supervision of the RRSC benefitted from\n            lessons learned from previous operations for improved design\n            and supervision. Notwithstanding improvements in the quality\n            of design and supervision, the outcome is still mixed.\n            Borrowers and implementing agencies have a tendency to focus\n            on the realization of prior actions, dedicating less\n            attention to the results framework. There is a potential for\n            the World Bank to build on leadership on donors'\n            coordination to support a more consolidated reform program\n            while leveraging stronger financial support."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
