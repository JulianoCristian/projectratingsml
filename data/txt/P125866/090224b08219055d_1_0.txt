                         The proposed stand-alone Development Policy Operation supports the authoritiesâ€™ efforts to (i) deepen executive accountability, (ii) protect poverty reduction progress
                         made in recent years, and (iii) prepare for a rapid economic recovery as the political transition ends and the security situation improves.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following a review of the Results Framework in November 2013, progress against development objectives was assessed as moderately satisfactory. Three intermediate outputs
                         expected to deepening accountability were met (budget reports using computerized system, audit reports conducted using risk-based approach, publication of audit reports by civil

                         society organizations); public investment projects retained in the 3-year public investment plan 2014-16 were all selected by the unique selection committee. On the other hand,
                         operational subsidies to the electricity company largely exceeded budgeted amounts, and delays in the certification of budget execution reports by the audit section of the Supreme
                         Court still persist. Lastly, it is still uncertain that actual pro-poor expenditure will reach amounts foreseen in the budget law 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Authorities re-affirmed their commitment to provide as soon as possible to the World Bank the documents required for effectiveness declaration and disbursement (which were
                         delayed with presidential and legislative elections), with a view to ensure that the creditwould finance the budget 2013. In the absence of Parliament, Government was authorized to
                         legislate by decree; the decree ratifying the credit should be signed shortly and legal opinion on it shared with the bank.
