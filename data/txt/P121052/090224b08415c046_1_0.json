Part of the Project (Part I) was\n            implemented by Agency A. At the time of INT\u2019s investigation,\n            there were over 400 contracts under Part I. Those contracts\n            were awarded to approximately 400 contractors. Evidence\n            indicates that government employees solicited and received\n            kickback payments from contractors under Part I of the\n            Project. Specifically, evidence indicates that government\n            employees instructed contractors to pay 10 percent of the\n            contract value in \u2018commitment.\u2019 Evidence indicates that\n            contractors made these payments as instructed. Evidence also\n            indicates that contractors, with the knowledge and\n            assistance of government employees, submitted documents with\n            inflated expenditures to recover the kickback payments they\n            had made.
