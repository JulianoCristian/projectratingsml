                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         27.     The specific objective of the program is to increase short term employment opportunities and to improve employability and incomes of targeted youth. The
                         program seeks to address constraints on the demand and supply side of the labor market namely: (i) to improve technical capacity and promote creation and/or
                         expansion of small youth owned enterprises in economically viable activities; (ii) to improve skills base of young people to make them more employable; and (iii) to
                         provide a safety net and income supplement for the most vulnerable youth through public works. The program will be scaling up ongoing interventions to increase
                         number of beneficiaries and expand geographic coverage. The project will pay particular attention to learning from its experiences through impact evaluations designed
                         around different interventions. Finally, the program is expected to reduce social pressures and the risk of conflict by providing employment support to about
                         30,000-35,000 vulnerable youth over a period of three years.

                         Overall progress of Component 1. The component, Cash for Work (CfW) was designed to support a labor-intensive public works program, which in turn would provide short-term
                         employment to young people through construction and rehabilitation of key economic infrastructure and other priority public works. The fourth round of CfW totaling 86 sub-projects in

                         all 14 districts commenced in August 2013 and is nearly complete, with most (84) sub-projects having completed 95% or more of the work. The first 22 agriculture sub-projects were
                         implemented from August to November 2013 and an additional 64 sub-projects were launched in November 2013. The next round of 70 sub-projects, financed with project foreign
                         exchange gains, is expected to be launched in June 2014 and will all focus on agriculture in order to increase women participation and learn lessons for future replication. It is
                         expected that all cash for work sub-projects will be completed by December 31, 2014.


                         Component 2: Skills Development and Employment Support

                         The mission met with the NAYCOM and each of the three service providers (SPs) contracted to implement the three interventions under Component 2: Partners in Relief and
                         Development (PaRD), HELP-SL, and ChildFund. The NAYCOM presented an overview of the monitoring activities of round 1 and 2. Even though all SPs have completed training of
                         beneficiaries in round 1, some activities are still not completed, mainly formation of business groups, and distribution of startup kits and other post-training support. Training of second
                         round of beneficiaries has started for all SPs, and some beneficiaries have already completed the training stage and are now in on-the-job training. Overall, the component seems on
                         track to achieve the target of 85% completion rate and complete activities by December 31, 2014.

                         Urban youth with some secondary level of education. HELP-SL reported that 1,193 round 1 trainees have graduated against the target of 1,200 and 200 business groups were
                         formed, of which 180 have been provided with start-up capital. The SP is currently training 2,400 beneficiaries in the second round, divided into 3 groups according to the impact
                         evaluation (IE) design. Sixty beneficiaries left the program in Bo Town and Freetown centers. The IE team provided a list of randomly selected replacements and HELP-SL will
                         conclude the replacement process by May 30. As part of the impact evaluation activities, HELP-SL and SSL completed registration using smartphone of the round 2 beneficiaries and
                         created an electronic database (including pictures), which HELP-SL is currently validating and will submit the verified database by June 15, 2014.

                         Urban youth with lower levels of education. ChildFund reported that 1,069 trainees have graduated out of the 1,200 round 1 target. Sixty-three start-up kits out of 191 have not yet
                         been delivered, mainly because beneficiaries fail to comply with the guarantor requirement. This issue was flagged during the September 2013, supervision mission and ChildFund
                         has indicated that this issue was due to inadequate communication on the role of the guarantor. The team will continue to monitor this issue. Regarding the 1,800 beneficiaries
                         originally enrolled in the second round, 1,759 have completed technical training and are now on-the-job training.

                         Rural Youth with or without education. PaRD reported that 1,390 beneficiaries graduated in round 1, against a target of 1,200, and 67 cooperatives were formed. In April 2014, the
                         Bank team provided training to PaRD staff on the use of smartphones and conducted electronic registration of the second round of beneficiaries. A total of 1,130 round 2 beneficiaries
                         were registered and an electronic database (including pictures) was created. PaRD reported that 480 round 2 trainees have completed training and 21 cooperatives have been
                         formed. PaRD is currently undertaking the procurement process for machines and packaging materials for round 2.

                         The Ministry of Youth finalized the preparation of a Cabinet Paper on the draft youth policy following reviews and comments from various stakeholders during the nationwide
                         consultations. The draft has been submitted to cabinet.

                         The National Youth Commission (NAYCOM) reported that elections for the two remaining District Youth Councils of Kono and Kailahun had been successfully held. All 14 District
                         Youth Councils are therefore established and functioning. Members of 5 DYC (Freetown, Bombali, Bo, Kenema, Kono) participated to a two-day training session facilitated by the
                         World Bank team in April 2014. The program included both theoretical and practical sessions, in which the participants learnt how to collect complaints and monitor training institution
                         through the use of smartphones. They also provided some useful feedback on the challenges youth face in the different districts, including lack of coordination and support from
                         NAYCOM. The initiative, still ongoing, included visits to training and artisan centers, with collection information on the project as well as feedback from the beneficiaries.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Implementation of project activities is likely to be completed as scheduled by December 31, 2014. However, the Impact Evaluation (IE) of the skills component will not be completed
                         until June 2015. The client has requested the Bank for an extension of six months to allow for completion of the IE.
