Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 27. The specific objective of the program is to increase short term employment opportunities and to improve employability and incomes of targeted
 youth. The program seeks to address constraints on the demand and supply side of the labor market namely: (i) to improve technical capacity and
 promote creation and/or expansion of small youth owned enterprises in economically viable activities; (ii) to improve skills base of young people to
 make them more employable; and (iii) to provide a safety net and income supplement for the most vulnerable youth through public works. The
 program will be scaling up ongoing interventions to increase number of beneficiaries and expand geographic coverage. The project will pay
 particular attention to learning from its experiences through impact evaluations designed around different interventions. Finally, the program is
 expected to reduce social pressures and the risk of conflict by providing employment support to about 30,000-35,000 vulnerable youth over a period
 of three years.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Component 1: Cash-for-Work

 Overall progress of Component 1. The component, Cash for Work (CfW) was designed to support a labor-intensive public works program, which in turn
 would provide short-term employment to young people through construction and rehabilitation of key economic infrastructure and other priority public
 works. The fifth and last round of CFW totaling 70 sub-projects were implemented during the period January –April, 2015. The Agriculture sector being
 key to the economy in Sierra Leone including employment generation, the last batch of sub-projects focused on agriculture. The completion of the
 implementation of the 70 last batch of sub-projects brings the total of 540 sub-projects for the entire project period. It is expected that implementation
 lessons from implementation these agricultural sub-projects will inform future scale up of such programs.



 Component 2: Skills Development and Employment Support.

 The three service providers (SPs) contracted to implement the three interventions under Component 2: Partners in Relief and Development (PaRD),
 HELP-SL, and ChildFund have completed skills training of beneficiaries in round the first and second rounds of training. Business groups have been
 formed, distribution of startup kits will be completed by May 30, 2015.

 Urban youth with some secondary level of education. HELP-SL trained and graduated 1,193 in round 1 trainees against the target of 1,200. Skills
 training of the targeted 2400 youth has been completed an impact evaluation of this sub-component is under way. The baseline survey was completed
 by November 2014 and an end line survey is expected to be completed by June 30, 2015.

 Urban youth with lower levels of education. Child Fund trained and graduated 1,069 trainees out of the 1,200 round 1 target. A second batch of 1,759
 trainees completed the skills training by April 30, 2015 against the target of 1,800.

 Rural Youth with or without education. PaRD trained and graduated 1,390 beneficiaries in round 1, against a target of 1,200. A total of 1,130 of the
 second batch of trainees also completed training by April 2015 against the target of 1200.



 Component 3: Institutional Support, Policy Development and Impact Evaluation.

 The Ministry of Youth finalized the preparation of a Cabinet Paper on the draft youth policy following reviews and comments from various stakeholders
 by December 2014. The draft was submitted to cabinet for approval.

 The National Youth Commission (NAYCOM) completed the establishment of the district youth councils and they are all functioning. Members of 5 DYC
 (Freetown, Bombali, Bo, Kenema, Kono) participated to a two-day training session facilitated by the World Bank team in April 2014 on how to use smart
 phones in monitoring project activities. The training initiative included visits to training and artisan centers, with information collection on the project as
 well as feedback from the beneficiaries.

 The project provided funds to support the Ebola community mobilization response. Over 11,600 households in 145 communities benefited from
 sensitization and sanitary materials during the August-November, 2014 Ebola peak period.
