                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         27.     The specific objective of the program is to increase short term employment opportunities and to improve employability and incomes of targeted youth. The
                         program seeks to address constraints on the demand and supply side of the labor market namely: (i) to improve technical capacity and promote creation and/or
                         expansion of small youth owned enterprises in economically viable activities; (ii) to improve skills base of young people to make them more employable; and (iii) to
                         provide a safety net and income supplement for the most vulnerable youth through public works. The program will be scaling up ongoing interventions to increase
                         number of beneficiaries and expand geographic coverage. The project will pay particular attention to learning from its experiences through impact evaluations designed
                         around different interventions. Finally, the program is expected to reduce social pressures and the risk of conflict by providing employment support to about
                         30,000-35,000 vulnerable youth over a period of three years.

                         Progress on Component 1 (Cash for Work - CfW), which is being implemented by the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA), is satisfactory. The first two rounds comprising
                         250 sub-projects have been implemented and completed, providing temporary employment to about 18, 000 (of which 36.4% are women) youth against the end of project target of
                         23500 beneficiaries (about 77% achievement). Three quarters of sub-projects are in roads, and one quarter in the agriculture sector. Of the 470 planned sub-projects, 133 have been
                         launched for the third round of CfW. To strengthen the life skills of the project beneficiaries, NaCSA, the implementing agency, has also provided mentorship and money

                         management support and entrepreneurship skills to 6,835 (75%) beneficiaries in the first phase of implementation and 4,680 (72%) in the treatment group of the second phase. A
                         total of 11,515 beneficiaries against the target of 17,625 have benefited from this training. The training will be undertaken in all of the CfW sub-projects yet to be implemented.

                         For Component 2, three NGOs were contracted to implement this component. The contracts of the three NGOs were signed in March 2012 and skills training, though initially delayed
                         is now on course. Child Fund which is training urban youth with lower levels of education had placed 1200 youth (656 women and 544 men) in 16 training institutions by October
                         2012. Child Fund reported daily attendance of 92%. Help, which is providing training to youth with some secondary level of education, had enrolled 1200 in 13 TVET training centers.
                         In both cases, the youth are receiving training in catering, auto mechanics, electrical installation, masonry, carpentry, plumbing, hairdressing, metal work, electronics, wheel chair
                         manufacturing and repairs, shoe making, and caterpillar operation. The third NGO, ParD was by October 2012 providing skills training to 565 rural youth in agro-processing. ParD
                         was expected to enroll additional 635 youth by October 2012 to meet the target of 1200. To enable appropriate completion of the targeted skills training and meet the PDO, additional
                         implementation time might be needed. The Government will submit a formal request to the World Bank detailing the arguments for a possible extension of up to 18 months.

                         With respect to Component 3, a total of seven District Youth Councils (DYCs) are now active and efforts are under way to facilitate their creation in the remaining districts. In some of
                         the districts where they exist, the DYCs have successfully used smart phones for project monitoring in seven districts. Preliminary results from the smartphone monitoring exercise
                         was demonstrated to the National Youth Commission (NAYCOM) and the Integrated Project Administration Unit in October 2012 and there is agreement to that the smartphone
                         activity is promising and should be scaled up as new DYCs are created partly as an implementation modality for the grievance redress mechanisms which is already performing well
                         in many districts.
