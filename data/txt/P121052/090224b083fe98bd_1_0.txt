1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal
1.      The project was designed in response to an emergency situation. Youth was at the
core of the prolonged conflict in Sierra Leone ending in 2002, which was fought
primarily by marginalized, uneducated rural young people with no access to social and
economic avenues. Many of these young men felt in a ‘youth trap’ in which they were
unable to complete their transition into marriage and adulthood. The collapse of the
economic system in the 1980s resulted in social, political and economic marginalization
of young people. Although the post conflict period brought some change in the
intergenerational relationships in Sierra Leone, young people lacked economic
opportunities and alternatives for social mobility. Migration of youth from rural to urban
areas where opportunities are also limited has led to youth becoming disconnected from
their families and communities. This, together with a hard-hit economy due to the global
economic crisis at the time, increased the risk of instability and social unrest in the
country, making the issue of youth employment a critical one in reducing fragility.

2.      At the time of this project’s approval on June 30, 2010, Sierra Leone was close to
the bottom of the United Nations Human Development Index, ranking 180th out of 182
countries. However, significant economic gains had been made since the end of civil war
in 2002. More than 60 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2007, representing a
significant fall of between 6 and 8 percent since the end of the conflict in 2002. The
availability of services had shown some improvement, in line with the decentralization
and devolution of authority to local authorities. The proportion of population with access
to a health clinic within 30 minutes had risen from 29 percent to 49 percent. And, through
support from a variety of health initiatives, there were some signs of a fall in mortality,
particularly among children under five. In education, enrollment rates were on the rise.
Given the global food, fuel and financial crisis at project design, there were risks that
poverty rates could start rising again.. The country’s economic performance was
adversely affected by the global economic downturn. As in many African countries the
principal transmission channel had been through the real sector affecting imports and
exports, remittances and Gross Domestic Product growth—which has in turn lowered
Government revenues. Real growth in 2009 was reduced by as much as 1.5 percentage
points as a result of lower exports and remittances.

3.      At project design, youth (people aged 15-35) accounted for 34 percent of Sierra
Leoneans. They were one of the groups hardest hit by the economic slowdown, given the
need for high levels of growth to absorb the large youth population into productive jobs.
Despite the country’s robust growth performance after the end of the civil war,
unemployment and underemployment in Sierra Leone had remained high, particularly
among young people. Using data from the 2004 Census and the 2003 Sierra Leone
Integrated Household Survey, Peeters et al. (2009) found that despite a very low official
unemployment rate of 4 percent, up to 800,000 people between ages 15 and 25 were
unemployed, were employed without remuneration, or were underemployed (see Annex
14 of the Project Paper for details). The lack of productive employment for youth was
considered not only an economic problem, but also a major political and security risk.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
4.     The original PDO was “to increase access to short term employment
opportunities and to improve employability of targeted youth.”

5.      The key outcome indicators at the design stage were:

      Direct Project Beneficiaries (number), of which female (%);
           - Beneficiaries of cash for work program (number of individuals temporarily
               employed);
           - Beneficiaries of training programs (number);
      Beneficiaries who are employed or self-employed in the field of training six
       months after receiving skills development;
      Statistically significant difference in terms of employment of beneficiaries
       compared to control group (yes/no);
      Beneficiary completion rate for skills development and employment support
 interventions (%);

6.      The definitions of those indicators remained unchanged through the life of the
project. However, some of the targets were modified during the life of the project. Details
of these changes are discussed in sections 1.3 and 1.7, and in Annex 5.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
7.      The PDO remained unchanged for the life of the project. Although the main
Outcome indicators remained unchanged, some changes to targets, as well as to
Intermediate Indicators were applied during the life of the project, reflecting additional
analysis by the Bank and Government teams on the relevance of indicators, ongoing
learning, as well as data collection limitations. The changes were administered on two
occasions – during the Midterm Review (MTR) in March 2012, and during a March 2013
implementation support mission. The changes were considered minor and introduced
without a formal restructuring. A detailed presentation of the changes made to targets and
intermediate indicators is provided in Annex 5. While the Implementation Completion
and Results Report (ICR) team broadly agrees with this assessment, the ICR attempts to
offer below some needed clarifications. Below is a summary of the changes made to the
outcome-level indicators:

     individuals temporarily employed) of which female”: This indicator has an original
     baseline in the Project Paper equal to 32,085, and an original target equal to 55,585.
     However, starting almost immediately after the beginning of active implementation,
     the team uses a baseline of 0, and a target of 23,500 to track progress. The
     explanation of this discrepancy is that initially the results from previously ongoing
     public works were considered as a baseline, while later on the opinion prevailed that
     the Youth Employment Support Project (YESP) should count its own beneficiaries


                                             2
   separately. Therefore, the baseline was brought down to 0, and the target became the
   incremental difference between the target of 55,585 and the original baseline of
   32,085, namely – 23,500.

   - Outcome indicator “1b. Beneficiaries of skills development and employment
   support programs (number) of which female”: This indicator has an original target
   of 15,900 and a baseline of 0. However, the target used by the team to account for
   progress was 6,000. The explanation here is that the original baseline and target
   incorrectly referred to the beneficiaries of capacity building under Component 1,
   which was already covered by the original indicator 11, “Beneficiaries receiving
   mentorship support (disaggregated by categories man/woman and district) (number)”.
   This led to an inadvertent duplication of the original indicator 11, and left the
   capacity building under Component 2 without an outcome indicator. Thus, under
   indicator 1b the team started monitoring the outcome of trainings under Component 2,
   which were defined in the Project Paper as two cycles of 3000 persons each.

8.      As the PDO and the formulation of the outcome indicators were not changed
(neither formally, nor informally), a split evaluation of the outcome is not applied to this
ICR.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.      The beneficiaries of Component 1 (Cash for Works) are defined in the Project
Paper as “all individuals within the ages of 15-35 residing in the “works” locality and
who are willing to work for the program wage will be eligible to participate”. Only one
person from each household was allowed to participate. The program targeted at least 30
percent participation by female workers. The program was implemented across the
country. The “works” localities were defined in the project paper as follows: after
dividing the available resources for cash for work among all 14 districts on the basis of
population size, the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) identified public
works locations through an intra-district targeting methodology. In order to benefit poorer
populations within each district, a composite index which consisted of population and
relative poverty ranking of chiefdoms or wards was used to target the poorest
communities where the works were to be carried out.

10.     Under Component 2 (Skills Development and Employment Support) the
project targeted three segments of the youth population as follows: 1) Urban youth with
low levels of education (none or some primary); 2) Urban youth with higher levels of
education (completed primary to some secondary); and 3) Rural youth (all levels of
education). Interventions in urban areas are located in the cities of Freetown, Bo,
Kenema, and Kono. The component targeted young men and women ages 15-35, who
were not in school.




                                             3
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
11.    The Project was planned to finance a package of short term to medium term
interventions and build on existing youth employment support programs. It was also
envisaged to provide institutional support to national structures, and finance policy
studies and analysis to support effective national coordination of youth employment
support initiatives. The original approved components were:

12.     Component 1—Cash for Works (US$10.0 million). This component was
designed to support a nationwide labor intensive public works program which would
provide short term employment to young people. It would build on the existing cash for
works program with expanded coverage and improved design features including
geographic targeting, project and beneficiary selection and monitoring. The public works
projects would be implemented in poorer communities to be selected using a poverty
index. The component involved rehabilitation and/or improvement of priority
infrastructure sub-projects that were to be chosen from amongst a menu with different
works typologies. About 60 percent of the works were expected to be on feeder road
rehabilitation and 40 percent on other works to particularly encourage women’s
participation. Public works projects were to be proposed and sponsored by communities
in targeted areas. The component also planned to train and support a portion of the youth
groups participating in the project as contractors to acquire improved technical skills and
be able to operate independently following the project continuing to employ unskilled
youth.

13.    Component 2—Skills Development and Employment Support (US$7.5
million). This component was designed to scale up and test approaches to support young
individuals and youth groups who either had established businesses or were interested in
pursuing business/employment opportunities through a package of technical assistance
which would consist of technical training through apprenticeship schemes in the formal
and informal sectors, business development support and coaching, and other life skills.
This component supported three innovative approaches targeting specific segments of the
population (urban youth with low levels of education; urban youth with higher levels of
education; and rural youth) to provide skills development opportunities to unemployed
and under-employed youth to improve their livelihoods and employability in agriculture
and other economic sectors.

14.      Component 3—Institutional Support, Policy Development, and Impact
Evaluation (US$2.5 million). This component consisted of two sub-components. The
first, subcomponent on Institutional Support and Policy Development provided financial
and technical support to help the National Youth Commission to fulfill its mandated role,
and assisted the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) to develop policy responses in
various areas through further analytical work on labor markets, skills certification,
monitoring and evaluation of existing programs and setting up of systems to assist in the
identification and follow-up of beneficiaries. The sub-component would also finance
knowledge management and learning events to promote the interests of youth. The
second sub-component on Impact Evaluation was planned to support impact evaluations
of activities under the first two components.


                                            4
1.6 Revised Components
15.    There were no major revisions to the components and they largely functioned and
were implemented as described in section 1.5. Some communication activities were
revised and strengthened in 2014 to assist the country and in particular project
beneficiaries, in the fight against Ebola.

1.7 Other significant changes
16.    There were no significant changes to the design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements, or funding allocations. Two extensions (the second one also including
some reallocation) were approved during the life of the project to reflect the delays
caused by the initial procurement capacity constraints and the Ebola outbreak.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17.     The project became effective on October 18, 2010. Considering that the project
was prepared as an emergency response, it had a solid logic, good analytical and prior
learning base, and its level of preparation at approval was quite advanced, as compared to
emergency operations in general. The technical design for the project relied on the
analysis and recommendations in the report Youth Employment in Sierra Leone (World
Bank, 2009). The book identified approaches for enhancing labor market opportunities
for young people in the short-term—and these approaches were all utilized by the project
design. Under Component 1-Cash for Works, lessons learned from the implementation
experience of a preceding phase 1 of the program and preliminary findings of a
qualitative assessment were incorporated into the design. Under Component 2-Skills
Development and Employment Support, the design adopted promising approaches
implemented on small scale by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) over the years
preceding the project.

18.    The project was part of a coordinated Joint Response on the part of the
Government and the key development partners active in youth employment in Sierra
Leone: the United Nations (UN) family (United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
and the International Labor Organization), The German Technical Cooperation
(Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit, GTZ), the World Bank, and the European
Union. The Joint Response had a three year horizon and consisted of parallel programs
and funding from the respective partners. Interventions under the Joint Response were
categorized into six broad areas: Labor Intensive Public Works; Private Sector and Agro-
Business Jobs; Skills Development and Employment Support; Youth Empowerment;
Research on the Situation of Youth; and Sector Planning and Coordination.

19.    Quality at entry was also affected by the low capacity in the country, and the
quick pace at which the project had to be prepared.




                                            5
2.2 Implementation

20.     The project was administered by the Integrated Project Administration Unit
(IPAU) of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED). The NaCSA
was responsible for the implementation of the Labor Intensive Cash for Works
component, in close collaboration with relevant line ministries. The Skills Development
and Employment Support component was implemented by specialized Non-
Governmental Organizations serving as Implementing Partners (IPs) – Partners in Relief
and Development – Sierra Leone (PARD-SL); Hands Empowering the Less Privileged in
Sierra Leone (HELP-SL); and ChildFund Sierra Leone. They were contracted for the
project by IPAU to implement this component. The National Youth Commission
(NAYCOM), with administrative support from IPAU, was responsible for the
implementation of the Institutional Support and Policy Development component of the
Project. In addition, IPAU was responsible for the overall administration and fiduciary
oversight of the project.

Restructuring

21.    A first restructuring was approved on May 16, 2013, to extend the project by 18
months. This extension was to compensate for the initial delays that arose from client
procurement capacity constraints resulting in delayed start of implementation of
Component 2 (Skills Development and Employment Support). A second restructuring
was approved in December 2014 – it extended the project by another 6 months (till June
30, 2015), and set up some needed minor reallocation. Over the life of the project, some
changes to outcome indicator targets and to intermediate indicator language were
introduced without formal restructuring (see 1.3 above, and Annex 5 for details).

Ebola

22.    The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak resulted in a six months delay in the
implementation of the project activities. The project closing date was therefore extended
from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015 (the second restructuring mentioned above) to
allow for completion of project activities. As of the end of 2014 the implementation had
picked up and the project to a large extent caught up with the delays. The overall
successful implementation of the project under this complex situation should be noted.

Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) Case

23.     INT undertook and completed an investigation related to the Youth Employment
Support Project (YESP). The investigation focused on Component 1 (Cash for Work) that
was implemented by the NaCSA. The investigation involved allegations of corruption on
the part of certain NaCSA staff. The team and the Government reacted to the case by
implementing mitigation measures to address the integrity risks that may result in using
NaCSA to implement the Project. The measures included: (a) using communities to
implement activities, instead of using individual contractors (consultants); (b) developing
an electronic beneficiary database including digital photos; (c) introducing an e-payment



                                            6
system linked to electronic timesheets to record beneficiary attendance; (d) using
community Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based monitoring and
accountability mechanisms; and (e) the Recipient’s undertaking (at the request of the
Bank) to administratively reassign NaCSA staff whom INT considered to pose an
integrity concern, so they were no longer involved in implementation of IDA-financed
Projects. The Project also incorporates enhanced governance and accountability
mechanisms. The INT investigation resulted in firing of some implicated staff and
reassigning others. Combined, these actions were deemed adequate by the Bank
management in addressing the existing integrity risks.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24.     The design of the two substantive components included an impact evaluation to
allow thorough analysis of the results. The Impact Evaluation (IE) for Component 1
(Cash for Work) was completed at the end of 2013 and has been taken into consideration
in writing this ICR. However, for Component 2 at project closing, a report on the baseline
survey analysis was available. Collecting of data for the final survey had been completed
and preliminary analysis was ongoing.

25.    The Impact evaluations were contracted out by the IPAU to specialised service
providers. The main purpose of the evaluation of the cash for works programme was to
analyse whether or not the public works programme made a difference in terms of the
employability and livelihood of beneficiaries. The evaluation of the skills development
sub component of the project was done to have a better understanding of the effects of
entrepreneurship/business development programmes on the well-being of beneficiaries
measured by income, consumption and other welfare indicators.

26.     As reported by the implementing agencies, the execution of the impact assessment
especially for the skills and employment support sub-component met some challenges.
The beneficiary selection process included in the impact evaluation methodology was
rigid, and some unexpected costs arose during implementation. Experience suggested that
the impact evaluation methodology should be developed at an early stage of the project
implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
27.    Overall safeguards rating remained Satisfactory through the life of the project.
The project operated under an approved Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF), and a Resettlement Process Framework (RPF). NaCSA had the
responsibility of ensuring that environmental issues, where applicable, were identified
and made known to the beneficiaries and communities trained in monitoring
environmental safeguards.

28.     Post-completion safeguards implementation evaluation was recommended by the
World Bank safeguards team as part of strengthening the implementation for subsequent
projects. It was proposed that the evaluation should assess the availability and
documentation of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for all lands voluntarily


                                            7
donated, and the current status of all lands (whether temporarily lands acquired have been
returned to owners or are still in use by the youth). The post-completion evaluation had
not yet been undertaken at the time of this ICR, due to the Ebola outbreak.

29.     Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) consistently rated the project
Moderately Satisfactory for Financial Management. Issues, however, seem to have been
technical in nature – computerizing the FM system was a challenge. While there was an
INT case related to the project (paragraph 21 above), it was not so much about FM or
procurement, but more about straightforward cases of corruption. The procurement
delays that occurred in the course of implementation were also related to technical issues
and lack of capacity, for example for preparing strong Terms of Reference/technical
specifications, procurement filing and contract supervision. However, the World Bank
provided adequate support and a qualified procurement specialist was hired as part of the
client’s implementation team. This solved the initial procurement challenges.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
30.     The World Bank is preparing a new Youth Employment Support Project 2 (YESP
2), which was in identification stage at the time of the preparation of this ICR. The
Project Development Objective of the new project is looking to expand access to income
generation opportunities for vulnerable youth in Sierra Leone. YESP 2 takes up lessons
from YESP and plans to have three substantive components: (a) Productive Public
Works; (b) Skills and Enterprise Development, and (c) Systems Development. The
Ministry of Youth Affairs would provide overall policy oversight while the National
Youth Commission will lead the implementation of the project. IPAU is expected to
provide the fiduciary oversight to the project. The National Youth Council (through the
District and Chiefdom Youth Councils) and other youth organizations and networks will
provide community level channels for beneficiary identification and monitoring of
project activities. This project is expected to be delivered to the World Bank Board of
Executive Director by Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
a)     Relevance of Objectives

31.   The relevance of the PDO is high both at the time of appraisal, and at the time of
implementation completion.

32.     At appraisal, the PDO responded to both government goals and to the Bank
strategy in a prominent and prompt manner.

33.    The Government’s poverty reduction strategy, called the Agenda for Change
(2008-2012), outlined a strategy to promote youth employment and empowerment
through five programs, including Support to Youths in Agriculture; Support for Viable



                                            8
Youth Enterprise; Labor Intensive Public Works Schemes; Waste Management and
Disposal Project; and the Handy Corps Scheme.
34.     On the Bank side, the project was guided by the Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS)
for Sierra Leone, approved by the Executive Board of the World Bank on April 6, 2010,
which mirrored the Agenda for Change, and set out planned lending and non-lending
support for FY2010 to 2013 for the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), the
World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Reflecting the structure of
the GoSL’s Agenda for Change, the JAS was organized around two pillars: growth and
human development. The JAS also featured two cross-cutting themes: governance and
private sector development. The Youth Employment Support Project was one of the
main interventions in the JAS to contribute to the achievement of JAS Outcome 4 –
“Improved capacity to manage social risks.”

35.      The PDO also remains relevant at the time of completion, especially in the
context of the Ebola outbreak. Following the Ebola, youth – defined as those aged
between 15 and 35 – are facing larger employment shocks than the broader population.
Since the outbreak began, the employment rate among youth in some urban areas
declined more steeply than among workers overall. 60 percent of the country’s youth are
unemployed, and over 80 percent of the country’s young people live below the poverty
line of US$2 per day. This marks a major socio-economic problem, with implications for
peace and stability. The majority of Sierra Leone’s work force do not possess the right
skills for work. Many young people have had little connection with the formal economy
and often lack a positive work attitude. There are few opportunities to gain experience
and skills. If constraints to improved livelihood and employment are not tackled quickly,
especially among the youth population, Sierra Leone’s peace, stability and development
may be put in jeopardy. Building on the successes and lessons learned from YESP, a
follow up operation will focus on deepen and increase the scope of activities that had a
positive impact on income generation for youth, as well as introduce new initiatives to
broaden its scope.

b) Relevance of Design

36.     Relevance of design to the PDO is rated substantial. Project design supported the
PDO clearly and logically. The PDO has two discernable directions: one was the direct
“to increase access to short term employment opportunities”, which was clearly met by
Component 1, providing immediate cash-for-work opportunities. The second one was the
more medium-term “to improve employability of targeted youth”, which was covered by
Components 2 and 3, building capacity and creating conditions for graduation from
unemployment and poverty.

37.     The rationale for the choice of an emergency intervention focusing on youth
employment was based on (a) the vulnerability of youth to a slowdown in job creation
due to their marginal position in the Sierra Leone labor market; (b) the government’s
urgent request for support in the area and the priority given in the Agenda for Change, its
poverty reduction strategy, to addressing the political and social risks associated with
youth underemployment and unemployment; and (c) the extensive analysis of the sector



                                            9
already undertaken by the Bank (Youth Employment in Sierra Leone, 2009) and partners.
The strategy identified youth unemployment as one of the three key risks facing the
country—due to its potential, if not appropriately addressed, to result in social unrest and
threaten the country’s peace and security— especially because of the large number of
youth who are ex-combatants.

38.     Overall, the design was appropriate to the needs and capacity of Sierra Leone. At
the same time, there were some deficits in the performance of the poverty targeting
mechanism. The Key Performance Indicators also needed additional refinement and
polishing, which had to take place immediately after project approval. However, having
in mind the emergency nature of the project and the short time for its preparation, on
balance this ICR maintains the relevance of design as substantial.

c) Implementation

39.     The project started up quickly after a very short preparation period (six months
from initiation to Board approval) under the emergency procedure. Implementation
performed solidly under very difficult circumstances – the challenging post-financial
crisis period at the beginning, followed by the Ebola situation at the project midterm. The
Government and the implementing agencies continued basic operation at all times, and
delays that were accrued were compensated later on, with needed extension. The
Government and the Bank also reacted quickly and efficiently to the implementation
issues at NACSA, bringing in INT and introducing effective mitigation measures.
Separately, while there was a solid logic for the introduced changes to outcome indicator
targets and definitions/changes to intermediate indicators (see section 1.3 above, and
Annex 5 for more details), these could have been better explained in the supervision
documentation and ideally should have been instituted much earlier and through a simple
restructuring.

40.    Overall, relevance of implementation is substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
41.     Some Key Performance Indicator targets and intermediate indicator definitions
were refined in the course of implementation, without a formal restructuring. The ICR
found the changes to be largely technical and correcting factual and/or presentational
errors, and with no significant material influence on the assessment of the outcome. The
changes are listed in Table 1 below, and are presented in detail a comparative table in
Annex 5.

42.     The ICR evaluated the achievement of the PDO against the original indicators and
targets from the Project Paper, as well as against those showing in the last ISR and the
implementing agency’s quarterly reports (e.g., the “revised” indicators). As explained
earlier in 1.3 and 1.7 above, during implementation the Bank and Government teams
agreed on some changes to targets of outcome indicators and to changes to intermediate
indicators without implementing a formal restructuring. Some of these changes were
simple arithmetical and presentational improvements. Others corrected factual errors.


                                            10
These changes are explained in detail in Annex 5. By evaluating the original results
framework, the project has a total of 5 original outcome indicators (1 split into 1a, 1b, 2,
3 and 4): it has surpassed 2 of those (1a and 4), fully achieved one (indicator 3), achieved
one at 75 percent (indicator 2), and may be considered as surpassing another one (1b)
accounting for the corrected error in the initial values for that indicator. Looking at the
informally revised indicators/targets table provided by the team and the implementing
agency at closing, the project has clearly surpassed three of the outcome indicators, fully
achieved a fourth one, and partially achieved the last one at 75 percent. From the 15
original intermediate indicators, five were surpassed, three were fully achieved, two were
partially achieved, and five were dropped so no data was collected. Looking at the 12
revised intermediate indicators, four were surpassed, six were fully achieved, one was
partially achieved and for one there was no information available.

43.    More than 36,000 people benefitted from the Cash for Work (CfW) component,
16,000 of which were women. As a result of program participation the likelihood of
household participation in remunerated work increased. Household members in treatment


                                                      12
households were found to be 34 percent more likely to have worked for cash in the last
12 months. As a consequence, household income increased. On the whole, the CfW
program appears to have been a highly productive safety net for beneficiary households.
Further, program participation is quoted to also having boosted participation in informal
savings groups. The CfW program was also found to have positive impacts on the
beneficiary households’ asset accumulation in terms of small livestock assets. Program
participation also impacted household welfare in other more direct ways, like utilization
of health services, particularly for young male children1.

44.     Under the Skills Development and Employment Support component, 9600
individuals received training and employment support, with almost 5000 of those being
female. The completion rate for the program was close to 100 percent. In total, 84 percent
of Phase I participants and about 62 percent of Phase II Participants were found by the
Tracer Study to be employed. 49 percent of Phase I participants and about 40 percent of
those in Phase II were found to be employed in their skills training areas. Over 85 percent
of all beneficiaries of Component 2 reported significantly improved lives and incomes
and benefits to their families and relatives either entirely or partially as a result of their
participation in the program. A study of the effects of the program on participants’
employment prospects was under development at the time of the ICR drafting. Its
preliminary results showed that individuals receiving the full package of services under
the project are more likely to work more months during a 12 month-period. This is true
for both men and women, even though the effect for women is smaller than for men. On
average, participation in the program increased the number of working months by more
than half a month during the last year for men. This result represents an increase of 35
percent in the number of working months during the last year. For women, participation
also increased the number of working months by 1 percent and the effect is statistically
significant.

45.     Based on the combined assessment of the original and the revised indicators,
project effectiveness is rated substantial.

3.3 Efficiency
46.     Overall efficiency of the Project is rated as Substantial. While according to the
Project Paper cost-benefit analysis at appraisal was not possible due to limited available
data, the project took into account the available information and ventured to combine
public works with skills development for achieving higher efficiency.

47.    In terms of program management, NaCSA and NaYCOM delivered good value-
for-money as an implementing agency. The project administrative ratio at closing was
13.5 percent. This operating cost was achieved despite one and a half years of additional
operating costs resulting from the Project’s extension.

 Public Works as a Productive Safety Net in a Post-Conflict Setting:Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation of Sierra Leone’s Cash-
for-Work Program, The World Bank, August 2013




                                                               13
48.     YESP appears to be more efficient as compared to other similar programs. YESP
spends approximately U$5.7 per person day of work created, while a similar UN program
planned a target of U$9 per person day created, while the actual number of person days it
produced cost close to U$32 per person day. According to another study of youth
employment programs in Sierra Leone2, the average investment per beneficiary [of the
reviewed programs] was U$394. YESP, which had an average investment of U$275 per
public works beneficiary, seems quite more efficient than the average project. 60 percent
of the cost of sub-projects went directly to beneficiary wages.

49.     In addition, YESP developed and showed high levels of consciousness for
improving efficiency over the course of its implementation, employing some major
modifications improving delivery of the transfers, including: (a) shifting responsibility
for sub-project implementation from contractors to communities; (b) improvement of the
data collection system through digitalization and electronic transmission of timesheets;
and (c) use of a mobile payment solution.

50.     In response to the issues of poor targeting uncovered by the targeting assessment,
the CfW program changed its targeting methodology for the final round of CfW, putting
in more rigorous approaches including stronger and more structured community
participation. The last round of targeting (covering approximately 5,000 CfW
beneficiaries) was conducted jointly with the Social Safety Nets Project targeting using
these new targeting approaches and a targeting assessment currently underway suggests
the new targeting approach is more effective at identifying the poor.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

51.     The rating for relevance of objectives is high, recognizing that the objectives
reflected and continue to reflect - Government and Bank strategic priorities. The
relevance of design is rated substantial, reflecting the logical relationship between the
project's planned activities and its expected outcomes. Relevance of implementation is
also substantial, given the good performance of the project under very challenging
circumstances (one crisis after another). Overall relevance is therefore substantial.
Efficacy is rated substantial for both parts of the objectives, with robust outcomes
achieved for both under the original and the informally-revised set of indicators. This
assessment is based on the analysis, including all caveats, described in Section 3.2 and
Annex 5. Efficiency is rated substantial as YESP compares well to similar projects and
demonstrates ability to further improve.

  Impact Assessment: Youth employment Programmes in Sierra Leone (2007–2009), 2011, Brian McQuinn, St. Cross College,

Peacebuilding Fund (PBF), Irish Aid, and the Government of Norway.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

52.     According to the World Bank policy paper based on the impact evaluation of the
cash-for-work component3, the CfW program appears to have had positive impacts on
inter-personal dynamics and female autonomy at household level. In line with the
program’s objectives, approximately a third of the beneficiaries were female. Positive
impacts were found on family trust and cohesion and women’s power to make decisions
on the use of own earnings and contraceptives. Reported incidence of domestic violence
among female respondents in the treatment group was significantly lower relative to the
control group. Compared to the treatment group, female respondents in the treatment
group were also more likely to report that they themselves were the most influential
decision-maker on the use of contraceptives and on how to use their own earnings.
Similarly, the study found that the CfW program successfully reached youth (ages 15-35
years) with low levels of education working in the agricultural sector. However,
performance in terms of poverty targeting was found to lack strength. Part of the reason
the targeting didn’t work well is that it relied heavily on self-targeting at the community,
since the literature on self-targeting at the time suggested this was a strong targeting
mechanism for this type of program. However, this approach might not have worked in
Sierra Leone because it is ineffective in contexts where subsistence work is prevalent and
the reservation wage is very low.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.     The project strengthened the Government’s institutional capacity to develop,
coordinate, supervise, monitor, and evaluate youth programs. This support aimed to (a)
ensure effective supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the youth interventions
supported under the YESP; and (b) to provide more generalized support to help
NAYCOM to fulfil its institutional mandate. The Project enabled key ministries and
agencies (including finance, labor and employment, agriculture, trade and commerce and
education, youth and sports) to provide technical inputs into project implementation and
overall implementation of the GoSL youth agenda. It ensured that the youth councils
and/or youth representatives in the local councils were enabled to actively participate in
the implementation and monitoring of Project initiatives. In addition, it ensured that
through learning events and discussion forums, District Youth Councils (which include
local youth groups and advocacy organisations) were informed about the programme and
are invited periodically to provide feedback in programme implementation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.    The project also provided funds to support the Ebola community mobilization
response. Over 11,600 households in 145 communities in the project area and in

particular the youth, benefited from sensitization and sanitary materials during the
August-November, 2014 Ebola peak period.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

55.     The risk to the development outcome is the risk at the time of evaluation that
development outcomes (or expected outcomes) will not be maintained. The risk is rated
as significant basically because continuing the project activities will require considerable
funding, which the country may not be able to afford. A deterioration of the country’s
economy or a relapse into conflict would pose a risk to the continued employment of
project beneficiaries, which also adds to the risk.

56.     Otherwise, the government remains firmly committed to continuing and scaling
up the achievements of YESP under the new operation. Institutional capacity developed
under the project will help support sustainability of the impacts. At the same time,
sustaining the outcomes requires enlarging the financial commitments. The country also
remains susceptible to financial and other crises (EVD) which may recur and quickly
undermine the effects of the program.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

57.     The Bank team worked closely with the government to prepare the project in a
timely fashion, under an emergency procedure. The Bank preparation team had a good
skill mix, adequately supporting the technical needs of the project. The project, although
prepared in record time (less than 6 months from identification to Board approval), was
of very good quality. Although the emergency processing allowed for some leeway on
postponing certain operational aspects (e.g. manuals, safeguards documents, etc.), the
project preparation team made sure those were at an advanced stage of preparation before
Board.

58.    There were, some minor shortcomings in ensuring quality at entry. The key
performance indicators were not entirely polished, with some targets needing refinement,
and some definitions in need of clarification. Although this was an emergency project,
the M&E framework could also have been planned further ahead.




                                            16
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.    The Bank provided good and timely implementation support to the client. The
Bank reacted quickly when the Ebola hit Sierra Leone, working to restructure the project
and to look for additional resources to finance new interventions. The Bank team was
expanded and new capacity was deployed to tackle the new and complicated situation.
The Bank was proactive in the INT case involving the CfW component. The Bank also
addressed appropriately the need for clarification of the results framework dating back to
the times of the project appraisal. However, the changes to the results framework should
have been done earlier and via a formal restructuring, which would have made a clear
statement on proactivity and would have allowed for a straightforward completion
evaluation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.     The Bank acted fast and with good quality both in preparation and
implementation of an emergency project, under very complex circumstances, that got
further complicated by the Ebola outbreak. At the same time, while the changes to
outcome targets and indicators do not seem to have materially affected the project
assessment, those should have been done earlier and through a formal restructuring
process.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

61.    The central Government showed continuous commitment to financing the project
and to controlling the quality of implementation. The project development objective
remained a strong part of the Government agenda, even during the Ebola crisis. Policy
discussion on major policy issues was also welcome and led by the Government.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.    The implementing agencies management arrangement worked relatively well. The
main government entities – IPAU, NAYCOM and NaCSA operated in a dedicated and
professional manner. The agencies involved, including implementing partner NGOs,
were in regular communication among each other, and also with the Bank and other
Government ministries. However, some persistent financial management issues as well as
implementation issues on the ground were observed (including the ones related to the
INT case).




                                           17
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.    Overall, the Government commitment and the implementing partners active work
ensured good adaptability and a good pace and quality of implementation under difficult
circumstances. However, moderate issues were observed with recurring financial
management inaccuracies and allowing the potential for leakages under the CfW program.

6. Lessons Learned

64.     Project lessons can be grouped in two broad categories: general, and component-
specific.

65.     The general lessons are related to the difficult context and the implementation in a
fragile and crisis-ridden period. For example, the project proved valuable in the Ebola
outbreak context – it was flexible, provided resources to improve communication to
beneficiaries, taught ways to avoid Ebola, etc. The project is a proof that design can be
forward looking, with readiness to respond to shocks. Another overarching lesson
stemmed from the INT case related to the project. This case, and the Bank and
Government teams’ response to it, demonstrated that when designing a project in Sierra
Leone, both the private and public sector need to receive strong, ongoing and consistent
oversight through capable client structures (Project Implementation Unit) and high-
quality implementation support by the World Bank.

66.   Further, some specific lessons can be derived within the lines of the two main
components.

67.       Under the Cash-for-Work:

         There is clear evidence that labor-intensive public works programs, even when
          short-term in nature, can act as productive safety nets by improving households’
          overall welfare and enabling them to accumulate assets and enter into new
          economic activities that can protect them against future shocks. These programs
          can have important positive spillover effects for women in beneficiary households.

         While the program is well targeted toward youth, it may need further work to
          improve poverty targeting. The program’s effectiveness could have been
          increased by improving targeting to reach poorer beneficiaries who have fewer
          alternative work options and therefore lower substitution effects

         The impact of this type of programs is higher when the program repeats over the
          same groups of beneficiaries, thus increasing the effect of the small transfers and
          creating better chances for the beneficiaries to graduate from poverty.

68.    Some of the lessons learned were incorporated into project implementation and
the design of the subject Cash for Work Project financed under Ebola Emergency Trust


                                              18
Fund. Due in part to the findings from data collection during the component’s IE, the
final wave of the CfW program also tested potential improvements in most of these areas.

69.    Related to skills development, the following lessons could be highlighted:

          Selection of youth by randomization is a good process to ensure transparency
           but it was not too effective in ensuring equal distribution across skills areas. It
           also failed to address the issue of the most vulnerable youth, especially the
           disabled, as there was no way of identifying them.

          Career guidance/counselling before skills identification and training leads to
           better-informed decisions on skills options.

          Cohesion in youth groups is enhanced when youth take the lead in the group
           formation process as they know their colleagues with whom they are
           compatible or have high attachment.

          Youth from rural areas were more open to accepting the project than youth in
           the urban/district towns. Since most of the rural beneficiaries were farmers,
           they saw the training as an opportunity to increase their income levels by
           adding value to their agricultural activities.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1—Cash for Works (US$10.0 million):

1.      The public works program successfully reached youth (ages 15-35 years) with
low levels of education and those working in the agricultural sector. In line with the
program’s objectives, approximately a third of the beneficiaries were female. The Cash
for Work Impact Evaluation report of 2014 shows that as a result of program
participation the likelihood of household participation in remunerated work increased.
Household members in treatment households were found to be 34 percent more likely to
have worked for cash in the last 12 months. As a consequence, household income
increased. On average, the total value of reported cash and in-kind payments received by
households for work in the previous month increased by 26 percent. The increased
income changed beneficiary households’ expenditure profile - spending on food, hygiene
products, and home improvements increased.

2.      The Beneficiaries of the Cash for Works program (number of individuals
temporarily employed) stood at 36393 against the target of 23500 (64.5 percent). Of
those temporarily employed, 16054 were women against the target of 7050 (44 percent).
The Beneficiaries of the skills development and employment support programs stood at
9600 against the target of 6000 (62.5 percent) youth. Of those trained, 4864 were women
against the target of 2400 (49.3 percent).

3.      Persons days provided in Labor Intensive Public Works stood at 1,762,329
against the [revised] target of 2,800,000. 540 community-based subprojects were
implemented in total, including 613 km of rehabilitated rural roads. 19,220 beneficiaries
receiving mentorship support under the Cash for Work component. Detailed tables below
summarize the number and type of subprojects by district.

Component 2—Skills Development and Employment Support (US$7.5 million):

4.      The Skills Development and Employment Support Component was implemented
by three contracted service providers (SPs) namely: Partners in Relief and Development
(PaRD) trained Rural Youth; HELP-SL trained Youth with at least Secondary Education,
and Child Fund trained Youth with less than Secondary Education. The implementation
of this component had initial delays due to low procurement capacity. With the support of
the World Bank procurement team that was based at the country office, this was later
overcome but resulted in one and a half years of project extension. As the
implementation was about to be completed in December 2014, there was an Ebola
outbreak in May 2014 causing further delay in implementation of this Component and
resulting in another six months extension of the implementation period. Besides these
delays and the impact of the Ebola outbreak, 9600 youth were benefitted from this
component against the target of 6000.

Component 3—Institutional Support, Policy Development, and Impact Evaluation
(US$2.5 million):

6.     On the policy and institutional front, the Ministry of Youth Affairs prepared a
Youth Policy which has been disclosed and approved by cabinet in 2014. Further
investment in this sector will be guided by this policy.

7.      Two impact evaluations were carried out to support the cash for works and skills
development and employment support components. The Impact evaluations were
contracted out by the IPAU to specialised service providers. The main purpose of the
evaluation of the cash for works programme was to analyse whether or not the short term
training added to the public works programme made a difference in terms of the
employability and livelihood of beneficiaries. The evaluation of the skills development
sub component of the project was done to have a better understanding of the effects of
entrepreneurship/business development programmes on the well-being of beneficiaries
measured by income, consumption and other welfare indicators.

8.      The component assisted the GoSL in developing policy responses in various issue
areas through further analytical work on labour markets, skills certification and other,
monitoring and evaluation of existing programs and setting up of systems to assist in the
identification and follow-up of beneficiaries. The component also financed knowledge
management and learning events to promote the interests of youth.




                                              29
9.      The project enabled the conduction of labor market analysis through financing of
the Labor Force Survey (with contribution from GIZ, ILO and GoSL) that looked at both
the demand and supply side of the labour market. This was undertaken by the service
providers under Component 2. The service providers also organised skills certification for
all the beneficiaries who went through the programme. The Labour Force Survey Report
was delivered in June 2015.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.      The cost effectiveness of the safety net transfers are a function of the accuracy of
targeting, the labor intensity of the public works, wage rate, and the general overhead
costs of the program. Together these determine the overall share of program resources
that actually reach the poor through transfers. While according to the Project Paper cost-
benefit analysis at appraisal was not possible due to limited available data, the project
took into account the available information and ventured to combine public works with
skills development for achieving higher efficiency.

2.     Youth Employment Support Project (YESP) appears to be more efficient as
compared to other similar programs. YESP spends approximately US$5.7 per person day
of work created, while a similar United Nations planned a target of US$9 per person day
created, while the actual number of person days it produced cost close to US$32 per
person day.

3.       According to another study of youth employment programs in Sierra Leone4, “the
average investment per beneficiary [of the reviewed programs] was US$394. As
expected, there is a correlation between the amount invested in each youth and the
resulting impact on income. Yet the correlation was weak because there were a few
projects that saw a disproportional impact.” With that statement in mind, YESP, which
had an average investment of US$275 per public works beneficiary, seems quite more
efficient than the average project. 60 percent of the cost of sub-projects went directly to
beneficiary wages. This assessment assumes no leakage and no substitution effects.
However, even net of leakages and substitution effects according to recent impact
evaluation 2/3 of the transfer amount actually went to beneficiaries (i.e., 40 percent of the
U$275). While some of YESP’s higher efficiency could be attributed to the larger scale
and to the build-up of capacity within the government of Sierra Leone (GoSL), YESP
still seems to have captured a more efficient modality of implementation, and to have
developed it further than its predecessors. This result is likely due to the combination of
public works short-term employment and the longer-term, higher yield skills
development.

Improving Efficiency in YESP

4.      YESP demonstrates high levels of consciousness towards improving efficiency
over the life of the project. Delivering transfers efficiently – in a timely, safe, and
transparent manner – is not always easy, especially in post-conflict countries where the
financial sector is not fully developed. In Sierra Leone, the implementation of a labor-
intensive public works program was significantly improved by increasing the engagement
of local communities, digitalizing information at district level, and introducing a mobile

payment system. YESP employed a 3-pronged approach to improving the Cash for Work
program5 The Cash for Work program, the largest component of the YESP, has provided
employment opportunity to more than 36,000 youth across the country since 2010. The
program, which is implemented by the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA),
gave able-bodied workers coming from poor and vulnerable households the opportunity
to participate in labor-intensive public works for approximately three months. In return
for this work, each beneficiary received a daily wage of approximately US$2, with
payments made every two weeks based on attendance at the work site. In the first phases
of the program, contractors were responsible for recording participation and
administering the payments, but this model proved to have a high risk of leakage and
mismanagement. The grievance redress mechanism captured a high volume of
complaints from beneficiaries relating to reduced and delayed wages (of up to 2 months)
and contractor mismanagement.

5.      To overcome these challenges, three major modifications were introduced: (a)
shifting responsibility for sub-project implementation from contractors to communities;
(b) improvement of the data collection system through digitalization and electronic
transmission of timesheets; and (c) use of a mobile payment solution. Under this new
model the implementing agency was able to minimize leakage risks and reduce the
average payment time to one week. A related initiative that was key in improving the
system was the use of smartphones in the registration process. This allowed capturing
multiple beneficiary data, including the ID pictures later used to create a beneficiary
database and picture books (“look-books”), and to produce pre-filled paper and electronic
timesheets immediately following registration.

6.       As documented in December 2013 (Martin and Rosas), less than 5 months since
its introduction, the new payment system had been successfully used to transfer more
than US$450,000 to more than 6,000 beneficiaries across the 14 districts of Sierra Leone.
The combined use of community participation and technology had improved the
efficiency of data collection and the timeliness of payments, minimizing leakages and
mismanagement. Under this new system the average payment delivery time dropped from
more than one month to approximately 2 weeks, and it improve even further as all agents
became more familiar with the process. These improvements in turn have played a
pivotal role in restoring the program’s credibility, which was confirmed by this ICR at
project closing.

                     PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

1.     Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes

1.1    Component I – Labor Intensive Public Works ($10m)

1.      Four factors affected implementation of outcomes - (a) Factors outside the control
of Government or the implementing Agency – NaCSA such as inflation/global increases
in prices increased the cost of project implementation beyond the project costs at
appraisal, resulting in reduction of number of sub-projects implemented and delay in the
time of project completion, weather/seasonality which was also beyond the control of
NaCSA affected the completion of some projects and higher expectations of communities
across the country for post-war development. (b) Factors generally subject to
Government control including policies and regulations that ensure transparency and
accountability in the project implementation, the structure and role of the government
local councils in governance and service to communities, and maintenance of the projects
after handing over to the communities (c) Factors generally subject to implementing
agency control including responsibility in project appraisal and environmental impact
assessment, ensuring that communities claimed ownership to the sub-projects
implemented in their communities. Other factors included (d) Costs, financing and
procurement and the extent to which NACSA, contractors and COCs performed their
overall implementation and monitoring functions.

1.2 Component 2- Skills Development and Employment Support ($7.5m)

1.2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality of Entry

2.     Project implementation was affected by institutional and macroeconomic forces.
The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) disrupted economic activity making it impossible to
support the expansion of already established enterprises and cooperatives. This reduced
job openings for young people.

3.       The design was affected by absence of policy on technical and vocational
education and this made the issue of accreditation remained crucial through the span of
the project implementation. The design did not consider youth business sites or shelter
facilities and so youth business groups found it difficult to acquire business sites/shelter
facilities to establish their business enterprises due to the high cost requested by shop
owners. The results of the labor market analysis limited the choice of some youth whose
choice trade areas where not captured in the results of the analysis. The raining period
was also not enough for some trade areas.

1.2.2 Implementation

4.      Project implementation was affected by the prolonged duration which extended
from 24 months to 30 months and beyond. This was a big challenge for the service
providers. The practical training carried out by artisans had some challenges relating to
the practical training arrangements as these were not clearly articulated in the contract
signed by the service providers and the artisan centers. There were issues of managing
the expectations of the artisan centers as they felt cheated. The s of the start-up kit
packages increased remarkably far exceeding what was in the approved budgets and this
contributed to delays and additional financial constraints on service providers.
Cooperation from key stakeholders in project implementation, especially in Freetown
posed a serious challenge as heads of Government institutions and companies whose
contributions were crucial to the project were difficult to get. For rural youth, a huge
disparity in the level of education among beneficiaries was also a very big challenge.

1.2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

5.      The National Youth Commission and IPAU monitored implementation progress
of activities carried out by the service providers who provided quarterly progress reports
to the IPAU and NAYCOM. NAYCOM conducted desk appraisal on reports submitted
by service providers to ensure that they reported on all their quarterly reporting
deliverables. This was followed by a joint field appraisal by NAYCOM and IPAU to
ascertain the progress reported by the service providers.

6.     The Beneficiary selection process included in the impact evaluation methodology
of component 2 was rigid, time consuming and costly. The design necessitated an
increase in beneficiary size from 3000 to 3600 with associated costs required.




                                            41
1.2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

7.     The project triggered four World Bank safeguards policies (i.e. those on
Involuntary Resettlement, OP/BP 4.12, OP/BP 4.09 Pest Management, OP/BP 4.01,
Environmental Assessment and OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats). There was an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF), and a Pest Management Plan (PMP).The project did not trigger any
involuntary settlements and there were no issues of land acquisition as land is
communally owned in Sierra Leone. Implementation of the rural programs however
necessitated the construction of structures to house the machines supplied to the
cooperatives. This activity was however not in the original design and the service
provider had to contend with funding the extra costs incurred as a result. Although
component 2 of the project also invested in agricultural support, the support did not
occasion the use of any pesticides.

2.0 ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

2.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

8.     The development objective of the project remain highly relevant from appraisal
through implementation and closure. Youth unemployment continued to be a challenge
and government’s planned response was articulated in the country’s development agenda
– the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P) as well as the country’s immediate strategy in
responding to the impact of the EVD – the National Ebola Response Strategy
(NERS).Also, the YESP was one of the main interventions in the World Bank's Joint
Assistance Strategy (JAS) to contribute to the achievement of JAS Outcome 4 –
“Improved capacity to manage social risks.

9.       The rationale for the choice of an emergency intervention focusing on youth
employment was based on (i) the vulnerability of youth to a slowdown in job creation,
(ii) the government’s urgent request for support in the area and the priority given in the
Agenda for Change, its poverty reduction strategy, and (iii) the extensive analysis of the
sector already undertaken by the Bank (Youth Employment in Sierra Leone, 2009) and
partners. The strategy identifies youth unemployment as one of the three key risks facing
the country. This rationale is consistent with one of the objectives of the pilot crisis
response window to assist eligible countries in developing, implementing and monitoring
programs to manage the poverty, social, and economic impact of the crisis.

2.1.1 Component 1

10.    The YESP Phase1&II was rated highly. The detailed results chains in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and the project development outcomes to intermediate result;
project activities were carefully chosen for their expected contribution to these .The
strong focus was designed to ease the burden on the price increases on the most
vulnerable populations and provide households with incremental resources to cope,
helping them to avoid reverting to adverse mechanisms that would diminish their asset



                                           42
and human capital. The implementation arrangements remained substantially relevant and
specially to support the socioeconomic interventions and strengthening NaCSA. There is
a very strong nexus between the Government's policies and YESP activities. In fact the
latter supported government policies.

11.     Both the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers II & III (PRSPII & PRSP-III) have
the same fundamental priorities; governance, social protection, re-launching the
economy, supporting education, health, agriculture, health and promoting gender equity,
these priorities was reflected in the sectoral criteria established for funding projects under
the YESP. Substantial amounts of monies were disbursed under the YESP Project and
this had an effect on the macro-economy and the private sector.

12.    The investments in rural areas created jobs and provided income as part of the
economic recovery. The Public Works Component created temporary work for
approximately 35,000 unemployed youths.

2.1.2 Component 2

13.     The relevance of the YESP project development objective is reflected in
government’s priority in improving the skills base of its youthful population. Pillar V of
The Agenda for Prosperity (A4P) clearly indicates the government's desire to design and
implement programs that will improve the skills set of Sierra Leoneans including youth.
This includes public private partnerships with companies on appropriate training and
support for technical and vocational training. The A4P also articulates the inherent
challenges involved in improving the employability status of its youth. These include
among others, getting the universities to join the race for producing graduates with
appropriate skills, ensuring that the technical vocational centers step up their skills
training programs with citizens opting for skills and training that make them employable.

2.1.3 Component 3

14.    The objective of the sub-component on institutional development remained valid
right through the project implementation period. The objective was relevant as it
supported higher based government objectives of strengthening government's capacity in
coordinating, supervising, monitoring and evaluating all youth-based programs through
capacitating the National Youth Commission. Through the project, NAYCOM
monitoring role was enhanced by the provision of three two-wheel drive cars and
provision of state-of the art equipment and furniture for the established regional offices.

15.    The objective of the sub-component on Policy Development was to assist the
GoSL to develop policy responses in various issue areas through further analytical work
on labor markets, skills certification and other, monitoring and evaluation of existing
programs and setting up of systems to assist in the identification and follow-up of
beneficiaries. The project enabled the conduction of labor market analysis that looked at
both the demand and supply side of the labor market. This was undertaken by the service




                                             43
providers. The service providers also organized skills certification for all the beneficiaries
who went through the program.
16.      The sub-component also funded the conduction of an impact evaluation. The
YESP project was designed with the intent of learning from experiences through impact
evaluation of different interventions. In line with this objective, the impact evaluation
(IE) of this sub-component assessed the effectiveness of different approaches supported
under YESP’s Skills Development and Employment Support component in (i)
facilitating entry into micro and small enterprises and (ii) raising earnings and
productivity of existing micro and small enterprises (MSEs) for young individuals.

17.    Relevance of design was substantial. The impact evaluation design was based on
randomization of treatment. In order to allow for the randomization of beneficiaries, the
service provider ensured that the number of eligible participants was at least 75 percent
over the number of served beneficiaries included in the proposal. Also in the design, the
evaluation collected baseline data and a follow up towards the end of the program. In
order to make sure that people in the control group were willing to participate in the
follow up, the Service provider (HELP-SL) provided monetary incentives

2.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

2.2.1 Component 1

18.        The program achieved the following:
      i)      Scaled up ongoing interventions to increase number of beneficiaries and
              expand geographic coverage.
      ii)     The project created provisions for model for show casing innovative ways of
              youth service delivery (COC implementation rather than contractors, E-
              payment, Grievance redress etc.)
      iii)    Finally, the program reduced social pressures and the risk of conflict by
              providing employment support to about 30,000-35,000 vulnerable youth over
              a period of three years.

2.2.2 Component 2

19.      The program achieved the following:

Direct Project beneficiaries of which female (%)

20.      The training and employment support package was provided in two rounds. The
total number of trainees to be trained was 3,000 for each service provider. According to
the agreement, each service provider was expected to train 1,200 (40 percent) of trainees
in the first round and 1,800 (60 percent) of trainees in the second round.

21.    For HELP-SL, a total of 1193 (males-601 and females-592) of the first phase of
the 1,200 youth completed technical skill training of their choice, entrepreneurship and
business development trainings. A total of 165 business plans were produced and



                                             44
supported with 798 beneficiaries involved. Out of the 1193, youth who completed the
training, 592 of them are female representing a percentage of 50 percent. For Round 2
2,181 youth completed the training of which 1082 are female. Thus the percentage
female completion is 50 percent. Thus for HELP-SL, the total number of intended
beneficiaries is 1,200 + 2,261 = 3,461. The beneficiaries who completed training are
1,193 + 2,181 = 3,374. The total number of female beneficiaries who completed the
training is 592 + 1082 = 1674 out of a total of 1193 +2181 = 3374. Thus the percentage
of female beneficiaries who completed training = 1674/3374 = 52.3 percent

22.     For Child Fund, A total of 1,096 beneficiaries completed Round 1 training out of
a total of 1200. 656 female youth completed the training in Round 1 giving a percentage
of 656/1096 = 55 percent. In Round 2, 1744 beneficiaries completed the training out of a
total of 1800. Thus for the two Rounds, the total number of beneficiaries who completed
the training are: (1096 + 1744) = 2,840 out of a total of 3,000 for the two rounds. The
total number of female beneficiaries who completed the training is 656 + 900 = 1556.
Thus the % completion rate for female beneficiaries = 1556/2840 =54.8 percent.

23.    For PaRD-SL, 1,390 beneficiaries completed the training in Round 1 of which
699 is females representing a percentage of 51 percent female completion. In Round 2,
1610 beneficiaries completed the training of which 920 are females representing 57
percent female completion. Thus the total number of females who completed the training
is 699 +920 =1619. The total number of beneficiaries who completed the entire training
is 3000. Thus the percentage completion for female beneficiaries is 53.9 percent.

Beneficiaries who are employed or self-employed in the field of training six months
after receiving skills development and employment support (%)

24.     According to the Tracer Study, in phase 1, 67.5 percent of Child Fund
beneficiaries trained are currently employed in jobs matching the skills in which they
were trained. In the case of HELP-SL, 52.6 percent of beneficiaries trained are currently
employed in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained. For PARD-SL 40.7
percent of beneficiaries trained are currently employed in jobs matching the skills in
which they were trained. The total percentage of beneficiaries trained in Phase 1 who are
currently employed in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained is 49.0 percent.

25.      In phase 2, 66.3 percent of Child Fund beneficiaries trained are currently
employed in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained. In the case of HELP-SL,
41.152.6 percent of beneficiaries trained are currently employed in jobs matching the
skills in which they were trained. For PARD-SL 48.1 percent of beneficiaries trained are
currently employed in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained. The total
percentage of beneficiaries trained in Phase 2 who are currently employed in jobs
matching the skills in which they were trained is 40.0 percent.

26.     In phase 1, 87.8 percent of Child Fund beneficiaries currently employed whether
in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained or not. In the case of HELP-SL,
83.2 percent of beneficiaries are currently employed whether in jobs matching the skills



                                           45
in which they were trained or not. For PARD-SL 88.7 percent of beneficiaries are
currently employed whether in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained or not.
The total percentage of Phase 1 beneficiaries are currently employed whether in jobs
matching the skills in which they were trained or not is 83.0 percent.

27.     In phase 2, 82.9 percent of Child Fund beneficiaries are currently employed
whether in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained or not. In the case of
HELP-SL, 44.0 percent of beneficiaries are currently employed whether in jobs matching
the skills in which they were trained or not. For PARD-SL 78.9 percent of beneficiaries
are currently employed whether in jobs matching the skills in which they were trained or
not. The total percentage of Phase 2 beneficiaries are currently employed whether in jobs
matching the skills in which they were trained or not is 62.7 percent.

2.2.3 Component 3

28.      Through the project, NAYCOM’s monitoring role was enhanced by the provision
of three two-wheel drive cars for the regional offices and provision of state-of the art
equipment and furniture for the established regional offices. Furthermore, the project
enhanced the establishment of District youth Councils (DYCs) in 12 out of the 14
districts in the country. As the other 2 were established through UNDP support. District
Youth Councils were also capacitated to enable them to actively monitor youth project
activities in their districts. The sub-component also funded the conduction of an impact
evaluation. The YESP project was designed with the intent of learning from experiences
through impact evaluation of different interventions. In line with this objective, the
impact evaluation (IE) of this sub-component assessed the effectiveness of different
approaches supported under YESP’s Skills Development and Employment Support
component in (i) facilitating entry into micro and small enterprises and (ii) raising
earnings and productivity of existing micro and small enterprises (MSEs) for young
individuals.

2.3 Efficiency

29.     The cash for work program was very much labor intensive and the program
designed that 60 percent of all program funds were paid as wages. Also implementation
of the program was accompanied with low administrative costs. The cooperative schemes
established in component 2 provided support to a large number of people through
recycling of profits. The benefits of this scheme have a rippling effect as other members
of the society will benefit when the economic situation of community members increases.

2.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

30.    The YESP was relevant to the country context and in line with the government's
development program - the Agenda for Prosperity. The YESP with its various
interventions indeed proved very successful. There is enough evidence to prove that this



                                           46
is so. On the whole, the CfW program appeared to have been a highly productive safety
net for beneficiary households. Participation in the CfW program significantly increased
the likelihood of enterprise creation for households. Treatment households are nearly
four times more likely to set up a new enterprise than control households. Less than 10
percent of control group households reported that someone in the household had set up a
new enterprise in the last 3 months, compared to 33.6 percent in the treatment group.
31.     The main objectives of the Tracer study was to primarily determine the level and
quality of delivery on the key performance indicators (KPIs) under the project, including
its Project Development Objective (PDO). The main objectives of the Tracer study was to
primarily determine the level and quality of delivery on the key performance indicators
(KPIs) under the project, including its Project Development Objective (PDO). Evidence
adduced from the study have again substantiated the fact the strategy was efficient.
Relevance and economic efficiency were substantial and consistent throughout the full
implementation period. Therefore, the overall outcome rating for the YESP is rated as
Satisfactory.

2.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

32.     YESP/CfW was primarily meant to provide access to income through temporary
employment opportunities for youths and to also create social assets (e.g. feeder
roads).Therefore, proxy indicators such as number of access to feeder roads etc. are used
to show the impact of the project on poverty reduction.Women especially had the
opportunity of being employed and earning monies on their own. The construction and
rehabilitation of feeder roads increased agricultural trade as vehicles had access to farm
gates.

33.     The tracer study on component 2 showed that over 85 percent of beneficiaries
reported significantly improved lives and incomes and benefits to their families and
relatives either entirely or partially as a result of their participation in the program. The
study revealed that in total, 84 percent of Phase I participants and about 62 percent of
Phase II Participants are estimated to be employed Also forty-nine percent (49 percent)
of Phase I participants and about 40 percent of those in Phase II are estimated to be
employed in their skills training areas.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

34.    NaCSA continues to be relevant in the development paradigm of the country.
Therefore, the government has extended the life-span of NaCSA from 2008 – 2018 and
expanded its mandate to cover other areas of intervention such as ‘Social Protection’ and
‘Reparations’ that are an integral part of government’s social development policy.

35.     Specifically component 3 supported NAYCOM to fulfill its institutional mandate.
Funds from the YESP were used to develop the monitoring and evaluation capacity of the
National Youth Commission. The project procured 3 four wheel drive cars one in each
region (east, north and south) or effective supervision and monitoring of the program and
also 2 motor bikes for administrative purposes. The Commissioner was also provided



                                             47
with a vehicle. The board of the Commission was also enabled to interact with youth
leaders at district level. All the 14 district youth councils DYCs in the country were
established and trained in life skills. District Youth Advisory Committees were
established in the country. The YESP also supported the establishment of 4 resource
centers in Bo, Makeni, Freetown head office and Kenema and each resource center was
equipped with the latest desk-top computers, furniture and Sierratel modems for
connectivity. The Ministry of Youth Affairs was able to hold consultative meeting in all
regions to revise the 2003 Youth Policy, facilitate its approval by cabinet and also print
over 2,500 copies of the approved Youth Policy.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

36.   The YESP provided funds to support Government's Ebola sensitization efforts for
over 11,600 households in 145 communities in Sierra Leone between August and
November, 2014.

2.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

2.6.1 Component 1-Cash for work

37.     The main objective of the program was to help mitigate the negative impacts of
the global financial crisis on vulnerable youth by supporting short-term employment
activities. In order to rigorously measure the impacts of the CfW program – and to help
inform the future scale-up of such programs in Sierra Leone and other similar contexts -
an impact evaluation was built into program design. The evaluation relied on a
randomized phase-in methodology to establish the causal impacts of CfW participation
on household outcomes. Communities (CfW sub-projects) were randomly divided into
control and treatment groups. Treatment communities received the program in Phase 1,
while control communities did not (they received the program in subsequent phases). The
random assignment allowed the measurement of the (very short term) impacts of the CfW
program by comparing mean outcomes across the treatment and control groups.
The CfW program successfully reached youth (ages 15-35 years) with low levels of
education working in the agricultural sector. In line with the program’s objectives,
approximately a third of the beneficiaries were female. However, performance in terms of
poverty targeting was weak.

38.     As a result of program participation, the likelihood of household participation in
remunerated work increased. Household members in treatment households were found to
be 34 percent more likely to have worked for cash in the last 12 months. As a
consequence, household income increased. On average, the total value of reported cash
and in-kind payments received by households for work in the previous month increased
by 26 percent. The increased income changed beneficiary households’ expenditure
profile - spending on food, hygiene products, and home improvements increased.

39.     On the whole, the CfW program appeared to have been a highly productive safety
net for beneficiary households. Participation in the CfW program significantly increased

the likelihood of enterprise creation for households. Treatment households were nearly
four times more likely to set up a new enterprise than control households. Less than 10
percent of control group households reported that someone in the household had set up a
new enterprise in the last 3 months, compared to 33.6 percent in the treatment group.
Further, program participation also boosted participation in informal savings groups
(osusus) by 16 percent. However, there was no corresponding increase in the amount of
household savings reported. Also, the CfW program had positive impacts on the
beneficiary households’ asset accumulation in terms of small livestock assets.

40.      Program participation also impacted household welfare in other more direct ways.
There were positive impacts on beneficiary households’ utilization of health services,
particularly for young male children. However, the program did not lead to any increase
in utilization of education services for children in beneficiary households. However, there
appeared to be no impacts on beneficiary households’ utilization of education services.

41.     The program appeared to have had positive impacts on inter-personal dynamics
and female autonomy at household level. There were positive impacts on family trust and
cohesion and women’s power to make decision on the use of own earnings and
contraceptives. Remarkably, reported incidence of domestic violence among female
respondents in the treatment group was significantly lower relative to the control group.
Compared to the treatment group, female respondents in the treatment group were also
more likely to report that they themselves were the most influential decision-maker on
the use of contraceptives and on how to use their own earnings.

42.      These results demonstrated that CfW programs can be effective social protection
instruments with positive impacts on household welfare and productive potential – at
least in the very short run.

2.6.2 Component 2 - Skills Development and Employment Support

43.     Specifically, Component 2 of YESP focused on skills and development
interventions that sought to: (1) improve technical capacity and promote the creation
and/or expansion of small youth owned MSEs in economically viable activities, and (2)
improve skills base of young people to make them more employable. A randomized
impact evaluation (IE) was designed, as part of the project, to measure the impact of a set
of interventions being implemented by a local NGO, Hands Empowering the Less
Privileged-Sierra Leone (HELP-SL).

44.     HELP-SL’s programme targeted urban youths, who are defined as those of age 15
to 35, with at least some secondary education, and who have an established business or
are interested in pursuing business/employment opportunities. The IE covered 3,344
individuals who were classified as eligible to participate in the program, 49.5 percent of
whom are women – 2,314 randomly selected to participate in the program and assigned
to three treatment groups and the remaining 1,030 participants randomly assigned to the
control group.




                                            49
45.    The program covered five major urban centers: Freetown, Bo, Kenema, Kono,
and Makeni. The IE examined variables of interest ranging from labor market
performance (e.g., employment, business creation, hours of work, income, and profits,
and business performance) to supply side changes such as improved cognitive and non-
cognitive skills, business knowledge and practice, attitudes, aspirations, and financial
behaviour such as borrowing and saving.

46.     The baseline analysis established the status of the IE participants prior to the start
of implementation of the interventions. First, it conducted balance tests to evaluate the
hypothesis that the randomly allocated groups have no pre-program differences. Second,
it described the participant profile compared to the urban youth population and provided
a broad assessment of targeting performance. Thirdly, it provided a descriptive analysis
of the characteristics of the IE participants and the main outcome indicators. With a
gender dimension, this analysis examined how male and female participant profiles
differed. Finally, it presented results of econometric analysis on a set of outcome
indicators, namely labor market performance, occupational choice, and trade study
choice, by regressing these on a number of individual and household characteristics
controls, and variables related to the main interventions (e.g., access to finance and
training).

47.     The baseline analysis showed that random assignment yielded balance across
study groups and suggested the programme was correctly targeting urban youth with
some secondary education. While similar in some respects, the IE participants were
younger, better educated, and more active in seeking work than their urban peers. Nearly
a quarter (23.7 percent) had prior TVET training, concentrated in a few gender-specific
subjects. Most youth were not working prior to the survey, but those who were, are
concentrated in lower value-added sectors, such as service and sales, particularly women.
Nearly a quarter (23.5 percent) of IE participants have been or are currently self-
employed, mostly in micro scale household enterprises with moderate earnings (that are
lower for women), and limited access to business credit. Only 1 in 4 of the IE participants
has access to money deposits and women tend to rely more on informal saving
instruments. Agency and time use indicators suggest that women have less decision
power both within their families and communities and face a higher domestic burden,
despite spending similar time working outside the home.

48.     The econometric analysis re-confirms the descriptive findings from the baseline
data with additional insights. Gender plays a very important role in labor market
outcomes and gender divide predicts occupational choices and decisions on trade
subjects. Prior vocational training is strongly associated with wage and self-employment;
however, it has no correlation with income. Also, suggestive evidence shows that access
to business credit and savings are associated with better labor market outcomes.

49.    In sum, the baseline data suggest that the low level of skills and lack of access to
finance largely explain the gender disparity in employment, especially self-employment
outcomes. Lower levels of education limit women’s opportunities to pursue occupations
(such as IT-related occupations) that demand high cognitive skills. Choice of trade study



                                             50
are largely gender specific – among those who had prior TVET training, women tend to
choose more service oriented trade subjects with limited exposure to other topics. Access
to business credit is a challenge for both genders as only few in the IE cohort could
borrow from formal financial channels. However, women tend to rely more on family to
finance their business than men. In terms of access to savings, a larger share of women
use informal saving methods, such as osusus, and a smaller proportion of them use formal
bank accounts, suggesting a serious financial constraint.
