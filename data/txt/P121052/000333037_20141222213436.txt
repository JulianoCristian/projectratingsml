.
A. Summary of Proposed Changes
Extension of the Project closing date from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015.

Amendment of the authorized category of eligible expenditures to include operating costs under
the disbursement category 2 of the Financing Agreement.
.
B. Project Status
The project was approved on June 30, 2010. The Project will be 5 years old at the time of the new
closing.

The project became effective on October 18, 2010, and overall project implementation has been
satisfactory. Total number of direct beneficiaries with the 448 Cash-for-Work (CfW) sub-projects
implemented so far, and skills training stands at 28,000 against the end of project target of 29,500
beneficiaries (95 percent). Similarly, the first intake of 3,560 youths (against the target of 3,600)
has completed skills and apprenticeship training representing 85 percent completion rate. The
second intake of 5,330 youth (against the target of 3,600) was supposed to complete training
(including apprenticeships) by December 31, 2014 but was interrupted by the Ebola outbreak.

The implementation arrangements of the project are satisfactory and will remain unchanged. The
Integrated Project Administration Unit (IPAU) will continue to manage the project and work
under the policy direction of the Ministry of Youth and assisted by the National Youth
Commission. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development remains the responsible
agency on behalf of the recipient, the Government of Sierra Leone.

Financing
Change in Loan Closing Date(s):
Explanation
The extension was officially requested by the Government, in a letter dated June 9, 2014,
explaining that the current closing date was too short for completion of project activities. The
Ebola outbreak further disrupted project implementation, necessitating extension of the closing
date. Furthermore, the extension would also allow for completion of the Impact Evaluation of the
Skills Training Component (Component 2) of the project.

Reallocations
Explanation
The proposed reallocation of the proceeds of the credit include the:

(i)     Increase of Category 1 allocation of the credit from SDR 700,000 to SDR 960,000. This
reflects the continued support to Cash for work activities;

(ii)    Reduction of Category 2 allocation of the credit, from SDR 5,000,000 to SDR 4,360,000
to reflect prioritization of the cash for work activities and completion of project studies; and

(iii)    Increase of Category 3 allocation of the credit, from SDR 1,800,000 to SDR 2,180,000 to
reflect the need to further improve results measurement and payment of staff costs.
