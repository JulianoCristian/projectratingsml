      satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            there is clear evidence that labor-intensive public works\n            programs, even when short-term in nature, can act as\n            productive safety nets by improving households\u2019 overall\n            welfare and enabling them to accumulate assets and enter\n            into new economic activities that can protect them against\n            future shocks. These programs can have important positive\n            spillover effects for women in beneficiary households. While\n            the program is well targeted toward youth, it may need\n            further work to improve poverty targeting. The program\u2019s\n            effectiveness could have been increased by improving\n            targeting to reach poorer beneficiaries who have fewer\n            alternative work options and therefore lower substitution\n            effects. The impact of this type of programs is higher when\n            the program repeats over the same groups of beneficiaries,\n            thus increasing the effect of the small transfers and\n            creating better chances for the beneficiaries to graduate\n            from poverty."}, "docdt": "2015-12-21T23:37:03Z"}
