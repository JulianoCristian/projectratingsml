Extension of the project closing date is\n            from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015. Amendment of the\n            authorized category of eligible expenditures to include\n            operating costs under the disbursement category two of the\n            Financing Agreement. The extension was officially requested\n            by the Government, in a letter dated June 9, 2014,\n            explaining that the current closing date was too short for\n            completion of project activities. The Ebola outbreak further\n            disrupted project implementation, necessitating extension of\n            the closing date.
