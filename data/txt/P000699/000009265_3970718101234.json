In particular, it will:  (i) improve and expand\n            the road network by constructing about 3,670 km of feeder\n            and rural roads, by paving about 360 km gravel secondary\n            roads, and by rehabilitating about 430 km of paved roads;\n            (ii) strengthen road maintenance operations by providing\n            equipment and technical assistance; (iii) strengthen sector\n            institutions by providing technical assistance and training;\n            (iv) help to establish autonomous commercially-based public\n            construction enterprises; (v) improve road traffic safety;\n            and (vi) improve transport sector planning.  The project\n            will support the Government's efforts to promote\n            agricultural and industrial production by improving and\n            expanding access to productive areas, and also efforts to\n            improve social services to the widely-dispersed rural\n            population and access to the drought-prone areas."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
