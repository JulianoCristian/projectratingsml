Some lessons learned included: The project\n            approach and the implementation procedures of the local\n            investment fund (LIF) were very critical to give more\n            responsibility to the different actors, those of government\n            institutions, but particularly at the community level. This\n            allowed a better ownership of local investments and will\n            therefore increase awareness for appropriate maintenance and\n            sustainability. The approach has proven that if local\n            communities have been given the opportunity, they are\n            capable to manage their own development and be at the center\n            of the decision-making process. In addition, the active\n            involvement of the government institutions in the project\n            implementation contributed widely to their capacity\n            development and will ensure the sustainability of the\n            results achieved. The execution of community based programs\n            necessitates a good knowledge of local conditions and the\n            adoption of simple management procedures. Without a minimum\n            of flexibility regarding for example the direct transfer of\n            funds to communities and the confidence on self control\n            mechanisms on funds disbursement, it will not be possible to\n            execute a large number of micro-projects in a short term period."}, "docdt": "2008-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
