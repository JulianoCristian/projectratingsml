Burkina Faso is\n            essentially a semi-arid, but also an agricultural country,\n            thus its fragile natural resource base, and extensive\n            farming practices are accelerating its degradation. It is\n            imperative that the assessment be implemented at the\n            earliest stages of subproject implementation, and that\n            beneficiaries be trained, introducing at the same time\n            improved sanitation practices at the village level. An\n            awareness campaign should limit shallow pollution, and\n            inappropriate waste disposal. It is expected that\n            construction of rural, and feeder roads through forest, and\n            pastoral zones, in addition to small-scale dams, and piped\n            water systems for large villages, will adversely impact the\n            environment. Mitigating measures follow. Project\n            construction call for the elimination of lateral ditches\n            along the road, instead, new water channels would enhance\n            water accessibility to local populations. Construction\n            material will be humidified to prevent dust pollution, and\n            re-vegetation will prevent soil erosion. Improved drainage\n            infrastructure should restore water transfers, regulating\n            the wetlands, and, the downstream portion of road drainage\n            should prevent accelerated formation of gullies, and erosion\n            alongside. Although the engineering design will limit\n            deforestation, and vegetative losses, ecosystems and wetland\n            management will ensure tree planting and re-vegetation as needed."}, "docdt": "2000-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
