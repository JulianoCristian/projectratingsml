the Association shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to
an amount equivalent to CFAF
750,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals 
from the Credit Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments
entered into by the Association pursuant to Section

shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR

Page  304

After the Association has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special 
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
Page  305
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Association a request or requests for deposit into the  Special Account of an
amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized
Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Association shall, on behalf 
of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into the Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
Page  306
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Association requests for deposits into the Special
Account at such intervals as the Association shall specify.
Page  307
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Association the documents and other evidence
required pursuant to paragraph
4
of this Schedule for the payment
or payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the 
basis of each such request, the Association shall, on behalf of
the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into
the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and other
evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for eligible
expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the 
Association from the Credit Account under the respective eligible
Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall
have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
Page  308

For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account and the 90-Day 
Advance Accounts, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Association shall reasonably
request, furnish to the Association such documents and other evidence showing that
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
Page  309

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Association 
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
(a)
if, at any time, the Association shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Credit Account in
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
(b)
if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Association, within 
the period of time specified in Section
4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the 
audit reports required to be furnished to the Association pursuant to said Section in
respect of the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account or any of the
90-Day Advance Accounts;
(c)
if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals
from the Credit Account pursuant to the provisions of Section
6.02 of the General 
Conditions; or
(d)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to the eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into
by the Association pursuant to Section
5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to
the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of
the Credit allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the
Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be 
made only after and to the extent that the Association shall have been satisfied that
all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account and any of the
90-Day
Advance Accounts as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any payment out 
of the Special Account and any of the
90-Day Advance Accounts
(i) was made for an 
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2
of this Schedule; or
(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Association, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Association,
(A)
provide such additional evidence
as the Association may request; or
(B) deposit into the  Special Account (or, if the 
Association shall so request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the 
Association shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Special Account and any of the
90-Day Advance Accounts will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association such outstanding
amount.
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund to the 
Association all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account and any
of the
90-Day Advance Accounts.
(d)
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b), and 
(c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Credit Account for subsequent withdrawal 
or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
