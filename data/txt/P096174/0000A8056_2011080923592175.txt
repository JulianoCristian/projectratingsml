                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The program's overall development objective is to assist the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its
                         service delivery. More specifically, the project would aim to strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR's limited budget resources through better prioritization
                         and partnership arrangements, facilitating scaling-up and better linking of plans and budgets.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although the pace of project implementation and disbursements increased during the past six months, as of June 2011, accumulative loan and grant disbursements are still far
                         behind appraisal projections at this stage of implementation. As there are only 18 months before the project closes, it was agreed that the Department of Environment and Natural
                         Resources (DENR) would provide a detailed work and financial plan showing how the remaining project funds will be utilized by the closing date

                         At the same time, many of the project's physical targets are being met in part because of the use of the regular budget for some activities instead of loan funds. The targets for
                         environmental monitoring continue to be met, the program for rehabilitation of abandoned mines is progressing and forest boundary delineation is on target. Specific outcomes have
                         already been achieved, such as standardization and streamlining of procedures and responsibilities for the issue of tenure instruments, and forward planning and budget strategies
                         have been integrated. There are also promising newer initiatives such as the Manila Bay and National Greening Programs. The success of the IEM approach in the watersheds
                         targeted for GEF support is seen in the demand for its implementation in non-participating provinces. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to put these programs into action. This
                         suggests it will be quite some time before a significant fund drawdown of the Program Agreement and loan funds for these activities will occur. In light of this, it was agreed that the
                         DENR would prepare detailed work and financial plans showing how it intends to utilize the remaining project funds by the closing date of December 30, 2012.
