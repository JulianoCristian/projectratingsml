Program Support for Environment and Natural\n            Resources Management Project for Philippines is to assist\n            the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENRs)\n            to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its service\n            delivery. More specifically, the project will aim to\n            strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR's limited\n            budget resources through better prioritization and\n            partnership arrangements, facilitating scaling up and better\n            linking of plans and budgets. The closing date for the\n            project will be extended from December 31, 2012 until\n            December 31, 2013. The project has made very encouraging\n            progress during the past year and was rated moderately\n            satisfactory during the last implementation review mission\n            in June 2012. Most of the 25 performance indicators have\n            been fully or partially achieved. For the US$50 million\n            loan, disbursements increased significantly from US$21.9\n            million in December 2011 to US$41.25 million currently. For\n            the US$7 million Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant,\n            disbursements are currently at US$5.0 million compared with\n            US$2.9 million in December 2011. Major achievements include:\n            progress on the DENR's reform agenda with\n            rationalization plans prepared for several of its Bureaus\n            and only awaiting DBM approval; completion of forest\n            boundary delineation including production of maps;\n            significant progress on the cadastral surveys; achievement\n            of investment targets for the rehabilitation of ecosystems;\n            advances in the Manila Bay clean-up activity;\n            institutionalization of the management effectiveness\n            tracking tool at all protected areas being supported by the\n            project; standardized procedures for the issuance of tenure\n            instruments; and increase in the number of companies\n            complying with environmental standards. The project has also\n            improved its performance on procurement and sustained that\n            on financial management, including significantly increasing\n            the rate of fund liquidation. The extension is necessary in\n            order to complete a few activities which began late in the\n            project or were delayed which would fully utilize the\n            project funds. These are reflected in the action plan agreed\n            with the Bank and discussed during the December 2012\n            implementation support mission. These activities are: ( i)\n            the National Greening Program; (ii) comprehensive cadastral\n            surveying; ( iii) the Manila Bay and inland waterway\n            'clean-up' program; (iv) installation and\n            operationalization of the Management Information System\n            (MIS); and (v) integrated ecosystems management focusing on\n            livelihood activities."}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
