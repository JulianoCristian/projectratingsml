                          The global environment objective of the program would be to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. Specific global objectives would be addressed
                         through GEF financing in strategic areas to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. The global environment objective would be achieved by applying
                         an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach in priority watershed areas and selected sites of global significance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The program's overall development objective (PDO) is to assist the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its service
                         delivery. As stated, the PDO is to some extent "open-ended" although in terms of the key performance indicators the project has partially achieved its objective.

                         The first indicator has been substantially achieved: implementation of DENR's reform agenda, which includes timely actions on the dated covenants, achievement of the key
                         milestones and continued progress in implementing the Rationalization Plan. DENR is now implementing the Rationalization Plans for its Bureaus, which were approved by the
                         Department of Budget and Management (DBM) earlier this year. This includes restructuring of staff into function-based divisions, other staff changes according to business needs
                         while making greater use of contract staff. DENR prepared a 3-yr Forward Plan and National Expenditure Program which has provided the basis for approval of annual budgets.
                         Procurement capacity was significantly strengthened, thereby improving its pace and quality. Preparation of a Community Participation Procurement Operations Manual together with
                         geo-tagging of investments including reforestation has provided significant innovations for the DENR in monitoring investments. An Internal Audit Unit was established and is
                         functioning effectively.

                         The second PDO indicator, 15% reduction of total suspended particulate (TSP) matter in Metro Manila over the 20007 baseline levels has been fully achieved with TSP levels
                         reduced by 25%. The decrease is attributed to strategies such as color coding to reduce traffic congestion and measures to improve compliance with emission testing.

                         The project also aimed to strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR's limited budget resources through better prioritization and targeting of investments as measured by the third
                         indicator: 80% of the project's investment targets in rehabilitation, ecosystem development and assessment being met. This was fully achieved. To the extent that DENR's
                         investments were aimed at the priority area of enhanced protection of watersheds, and partnership arrangements were strengthened with LGUs as part of ecosystem management
                         and there was better linking of plans and budgets, allocative efficiency has improved, though feedback suggests that regulatory activities are still under resourced.

                         There is at present no measure of the fourth project indicator: 30% improvement in overall client satisfaction with DENR service delivery by type of client as the expected follow up
                         survey to the Baseline Survey has not been completed. The Baseline survey was delayed and by the time it was completed project activities were underway. It showed client
                         satisfaction in the 60% to 70% range which was higher than the expected baseline and there were some reservations concerning its methodology. DENR has made a commitment to
                         the Department of Budget Management (DBM) to completed the survey.

                         In regard to the Global Environmental Objective which was to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits, two of the three indicators have been fully achieved while the
                         third is considered unmeasurable. The target of 106,000 hectares of protected areas, protection forests and wetlands effectively managed in the four targeted watershed areas has
                         been exceeded with 131, 886 hectares under effective management. These areas have in place (a) effective management frameworks based on strong stakeholder participation; (b)
                         local government implementation of livelihood subprojects aimed at conservation; and (c) LGU ordinances/resolutions in place and law enforcement being implemented. The project
                         also met the target of 35% of ecologically sensitive forests (outside protected areas) under effective protection with 125,377 ha out of a total of 358,22 ha of such classified forests
                         being protected through: (a) mana gement frameworks with corresponding budgets adopted by Watershed Management Councils; (b) environment and natural resources (ENR)-
                         related subprojects being implemented by LGUs; and (c) LGU ordinances/resolutions and law enforcement for ENR protection under implementation. The third indicator, decline in
                         slash and burn agriculture (kaingin), is considered to be unmeasurable but other evidence suggests that the project has contributed to a reduction in such practices.

                         The project has further contributed to enhancing DENR's implementation of its mandate and fulfilling its role as a service providing agency in ENR through results in other areas, such
                         as: (a) completion of forest boundary delineation including production of maps, a major activity under the project, which was required by law as a prerequisite for the legal definition
                         of forest boundaries; (b) cadastral survey maps have been prepared for 50% of the municipalities in the country thus providing the cadastral information needed to resolve competing

                         Tool at all protected areas being supported by the project has been extended to other protected areas thus allowing for better monitoring and management; and (d) approaches for
