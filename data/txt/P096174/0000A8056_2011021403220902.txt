                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The program's overall development objective is to assist the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its
                         service delivery. More specifically, the project would aim to strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR's limited budget resources through better prioritization
                         and partnership arrangements, facilitating scaling-up and better linking of plans and budgets.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The project is making progress towards achievement of its development objectives, though with significant delay. Over the past six months there has been an increase in the pace of
                         implementation though it continues to be significantly behind the schedule agreed at project appraisal. However, many of the physical targets are being met in part because of the

                         use of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR's) regular budget for some activities instead of loan funds. Some important changes in the way the DENR does
                         business have been brought about by the project, including: the DENR now operates a forward planning and budgeting strategy, procedures and responsibilities for issuance of
                         tenure instruments are standardized and streamlined and the targets for environmental monitoring are being met such as measuring compliance with environmental standards. While
                         there are delays in activities such as establishing the management information system, and the interim rehabilitation of abandoned mines, work on the latter has increased
                         appreciatively since the last mission as has implementation of integrated ecosystem management in targeted watersheds.
