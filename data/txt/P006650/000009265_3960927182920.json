Second\n            Industrial Finance Project is to help sustain Chile's\n            drive to modernize and expand its industrial sector. It will\n            finance export-oriented investments at a time of attractive\n            international prices for Chile's resource-based\n            exports. The project will finance investments in new plants,\n            plant expansion, and permanent working capital. Economically\n            viable projects in all industries will be eligible. Industry\n            has been widely defined to include forestry, fishing,\n            mining, and related industrial services. This broad\n            definition has been chosen to avoid segmentation and to\n            allow maximum flexibility in loan allocation. The Central\n            Bank of Chile will be the executing agency. The Central Bank\n            will onlend the proceeds to the participating fiancial intermediaries."}, "docdt": "1989-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
