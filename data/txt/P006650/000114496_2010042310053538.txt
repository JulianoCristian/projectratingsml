Re: Loan No. 3053-CH - Second Industrial Finance Project
Amendment to the Project Agreement
Dear Mr. Bianchi:
We refer to the Project Agreement for Loan No. 3053 (Second Industrial Finance 
Project), dated May 12, 1989 (the Project Agreement), between the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Banco Central de Chile (Banco 
Central).
We are pleased to inform you that in accordance with your letter of June 14, 
1991, the Bank agrees to your request to amend the Project Agreement in order to 
eliminate the requirement that Banco Central shall utilize the proceeds accrued to 
Banco Central from the repayment of principal, interest and other charges on the 
subsidiary loans which are not required for purposes of the repayment of the Loan, 
exclusively for making loans for the same purposes.
Therefore, the Bank hereby agrees to delete paragraph (c) of Section 2.02 of the 
Project Agreement.  Please confirm your agreement to this amendment by signing and 
dating the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to the Bank.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
