MEMORANDUM AND RECOMWENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL SANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND ,DEMELOPMENT
OKN A PROPOSED LOAN TO 'THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A SECOND ZNDUSTRIAL FINANCE PROJECT
1,     .,The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of US$75.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval to the Board. The p;oposed loan would have a term
of 17 years including 5 years of grace, with interest-at the-Bank's
standard variable rate.
2.       Background.  Since 1984, macroeconomicjconditions,have been
conducive to industrial recovery.  Industrial output has been expandig'at
an average rate of nearly 7Z'p.a. over the last three years, surpassing -
pre-1981/82 crisis peak-levels in 1986.  This dynamic performance is the
result of strong domestic demand and, more importantly, the impressive
expansion of industrial etports, which increased by more than 60 percent in"
value,between 1986 and 1988.  Initially, industries were able to expand
production by utilizing idle capacity, but3 a growing number of them have
added capacity to respond to attractive international prices of resource-
based products for which Chile has a comparative advantage (e.g. fishmeal,:
wood products, cellulose, and fruit preserves).  Increased competitiveness
also has enabled medium-sized producers of garments, sioes, earthware,
metal products and others to enter the export markets.l Evidence of Chile's
export orientation can be seen in the significant increase in export
enterprises, exported products and recipient countries. Prospects for
sustaining this strong industrial performance are good, provided the policy
framework remains basically unchanged. The investment requirements of the
industrial sector for 1989-90 are estimated at about US$1.5 billion. Lack
of long term financing is the most immediate constraint to maintaining
current levels of industrial growth.
3.        Following the acute banking sector crisis of the early eighties,
financial markets have stabilized, in parallel with the expansion of the
real economy. Commercial banks have recovered, but further strengthening
is needed. Since 902 of the banks' deposit base is short-term, most of
,their credits are short-term roll-overs.  -Roll,over loans are not suitable
for investment financing, because of the'inherent uncertainty about terms
and conditions. As of late, the bond markets have been stimulated by
historically low and stable interest rates. Still, only a few industrial
companies (less than 10 during 1987 and 1988) are active in this market
because the pension funds, the main institutional investors, are governed
by restrictive investment regulations. Even when investment restrictions
are -relaxed, most large and medium-sized industrial companies will continue
to depend on their own internal funds and on short-term credit from the
banking system.
4.       The proposed project succeeds the Industrial Finance Restructuring
Project (Loan 2606-CM of US$100 million approved in 1985). After the 1987



Amendment. allowing the financing of standard In addition to restructuring
projects, loan funds were committed quickly with disbursements now almost
completed. Interest rates have been granted at market levels; the loan
portfolios of the financial intermediarieos have been without delinquency.
A total of 28 enterprises be:efitted via 12 financial intermediaries.  The
Loan contributed to the financing of investment projects amounting to about
US$400 million, or nearly one third of the sector's investment during 1987
and 1988. About 80? of the investments financed by the Loan were in export
oriented projects.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has supported the
Government's improvements in trade, fiscal, and financial policies so as to
create a conducive environment for greater industrial productivity, export
expansion, increases in productive employment and diversification. The
challenge now is to enable industry to make full use of this favorabWe
environment and to sustain the strong industrial recovery of the last four
years. Continued Bank involvement through this Project would help address
the main constraint to sustained industrial growth: lack of term finanee.
The Bank, In cooperation with 17C. is also planning to support further
development of the financial sector through a subsequent Pinancial Markets
project designed to strengthen the securities market as well to further the
recovery of the banking system. The proposed Second Industrial Finance
Project would be the last Bank lending operation of this kind, unless
capital market development proceeds at a slower pace than expected.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The objective of the proposed Project is to
help maintain the investment momentum by addressing the credit needs of
medium-sized firms which are constrained In undertaking productive
investments for lack of appropriate financing.  Funding would be provided
at market terms.
7.       Proiect Descrititon.  The Project consists of providing credit to
medium-sized industries for investments In new plant, plant expansion and
permanent working capital for implementation during 1989 and 1990   A broad
spectrum of projects, including related services, would be eligible.
Estimates are based on concrete investment proposals which industrial firns
have already submitted to commercial banks. Total project costs are
assessed at about US$280 million, with a foreign exchange component of
US$168 million or 602 (Schedule A). Several financing sources are expected
to contribute to the financing plan.  Bank funds would contribute 272, and
Central Bank matching funds 182. In addition, it is expectad that 13S
would be drawn from credit lines of the Inter American Development Bank.
The rest would be financed by the fims' internal resources (242), and
miscellaneous sources (182). Procurement would follow noSmal commercial
practices and disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31,
1994 (Schedule B). A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Chile are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff 4ppraisal Report No. 7636 dated April 13, 1989, is
also attached.
8.       The Central Ban  of Chile would act as a second-tier institution
and commercial banks as first-tier lenders. Borrowers would have the



-3-
option of denominating loans in either US dollars or Chilean pesos.
Interest rates for US dollar loan8 would be based on the Bank's interest
rate plus a margin for the Central Bank and a spread for the commercial
banks. The interest rates on peso-denominated loans would be based on a
widely published average deposit rate, plus a spread for the comercial
banks, which would be market-determined. The Government would assume the
cross currency risk. Interest rates on peso-denominated loans. in a
framework of open capital markets and free interest rates, reflect a
country risk premium.
9.       Atreed Actions.  Agreements were reached on the following actions:
(a) provision by the Central Bank for US$50 million in matching funds; (b)
setting of end user interest rates reflecting markL't conditions. To
enhance the promotion efforts by commercial banks, banks would be free to
set the spread and other financi&l charges: (c) limiting the maximum Bank
financing per investment at US$5 million; and (d) setting retroactive
financing at 10  of the loan amount (US$7.5 million) to support the
investment momentum during the first semester of 1989. Loan funds would
not be used to cover expenditures incurred more than 180 days before
subloans are presented for approval.
10.      Benefits.  The Project would help maintain the momentum of
industrial modernization and expansion by financing export-oriented
investments at a time of attractive international prices for Chile's
resource-based exports. This export orientation is consistent with Chile's
intention to maintain its debt service performance. The Project also would
help maintain a favorable investment climate during a period of some macro-
policy uncertainties in view of political changes.
II.      Risks.  The project does not face significant risks.  The
institutional channels are well tested. The estimate of loan demand is
based on concrete investment proposals which are expected to be carried out
despite the uncertainties associated with the forthcoming change in
Government. Indications are that the prudent fiscal and monetary policies
of the present Government have support and that they will be substantially
continued, even under a Government of the opposition. Therefore, interest
rates are expected to remain stable. Should this not be the case, the Loan
would disburse more slowly than estimated.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Ezecutive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
