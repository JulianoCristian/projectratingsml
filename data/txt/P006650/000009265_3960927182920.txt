CHILE
SECOND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE PROJECT
LOAN ANM  PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  The Republic of Chile
Amounts                    US$ 75.0 million equivalent
Terms:                     Repayment in 17 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at the Bank's standard
variable rate.
Proiect Obiectives:        The Project would help sustain Chile's drive to
modernize and expand its industrial sector
against the background of (i) virtual absence of
commercial bank term credit; (ii) limits on
supplier credits; and (iii) limitations on stock
and bond issues.
Project DescriDtiont       The Project consists of providing credit to
medium-sized industries for investment in new
plant, plant expansion and permanent working
capital. Loan funds would be committed during
1989 and 1990. The project would be the last of
this kind, unless financial markets develop at a
significantly slower pace than currently
expected.
Financial
Intermediaries:            The Central Bank of Chile would act as a second-
tier institution and commercial banks as
first-tier lenders.
Beneficiaries:             Medium-sized enterprises active in a broad
spectrum of industries and related industrial
services.
On-Lendina Terms:          Borrowers will have the option of denominating
loans in either US dollars or Chilean pesos. The
interest rate charged on dollar denominated loans
would be based on the Bank's interest rate, plus
a margin of 0.62 p.a. for the Central Bank and a
discretionary spread for the commercial banks.
The interest rate on peso denominated loans would
be based on a widely published average deposit
rate plus a discretionary spread for the
commercial banks.  The resulting end-user
interest rates would reflect market conditions.



- iv -
Benefits:                  The Project would help remove financial
constraints to the timely execution of industrial
investments. Bank support is strategically
opportune as it would assist in maintaining the
current momentum of industrial modernization in
the context of Chile's liberal economy and
attractive international prices of Chile's
resource-based exports. The Project would also
contribute to maintain a favorable investment
climate during a period of some macro-policy
uncertainties in view of political changes.
Risks:                     There are no significant risks. The institutional
channels are well tested. Loan demand estimates
are based on investment proposals that have
already been submitted to commercial banks. The
onlending conditions are in line with those of
tne predecessor operation, Loan 2606-CH, which
were well received by the market. Interest rates
are expected to remain fairly stable on the
assumption of continued prudent macro policies.
Should this not be the case, loan demand may be
affected negatively.

SECOND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE PROJECT
I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Sector BackRround and Performance
1.01     Since 1984, macroeconomic conditions have been conducive to
industrial recovery, with 1986 industrial production surpassing the pre-
1981/82 crisis peak level and expanding at an average rate of nearly 72 per
annum over the last three years. This growth has been faster than the
economy as a whole, fueled by strong domestic demand and increasing export
opportunities. Industrial exports increased by more than 60X in value
between 1986 and 1988. The industrial sector is stronger and more
competitive now than at any time in the last two decades, having adjusted
to the structural reforms of the mid-1970s, which substantially reduced the
Government's intervention in the economy, allowing the market to allocate
economic resources. In the near future, the industrial sector is expected
to attain annual average growth rates iD the range of 4 to 5Z, which is the
estimated GDP growth rate.
1.02     The program of structural reforms adopted in 1974 included:
reduction in tariffs from an average nominal rate of 1052 to a uniform rate
of 10X in 1979; elimination of import quota restrictions; removal of prices
and interest rates controls; phasing out restrictions on international
capital movements; and return of confiscated firms to former owners. The
effects of these policies were overwhelmed in the short run by macro
disturbances that lasted until 1976; however, they set the stage for a
drastic industrial sector transformation during the recovery period. The
reduction in protection caused a shift in resource allocation, away from
import-substitution manufacturing and toward the exploitation and
processing of natural resources for export. As a result, a substantial
proportion of the inefficient import-substituting industrial sector
disappeared and resource-based exports (pulp and paper, fish products,
lumber, wines and fruits, and vegetable preserves) grew rapidly.
Industrial exports more than doubled in four years, increasing from US$520
million in 1976 to US$1,751 million in 1980, even though the peso was
increasingly overvalued.
The 1982/83 Crisis
1.03     Industrial production contracted for a second time in ten years
during the 1982-83 recession. This was caused by both inconsistent
economic policies (in particular, a 25Z appreciation of the peso between
1978 and mid-1982), and a sharp deterioration in the international economic
environment, including extremely low copper prices, high real interest
rates, and a global recession. Industrial exports were particularly hard
hit, declining in value by 262 in 1981. The sharp curtailment of capital
flows in early 1982 led the economy to a depression; per capita income fell



- 2 -
precipitously (20? in two years) and local demand for industrial products
collapsed. As a result, production of import competing industries
contracted drastically. The Government finally devalued the peso in June
1982. Although industrial export volumes increased, aided by the
devaluation, their value fell further, due mostly to lower external prices.
Consequently, industrial value added fell by about 212 in 1982 (Annex I,
Column 2) compared to a 14? drop in GDP, with induet:ial employment
declining by one-third. The devaluation precipitated a financial crisis
for major banks and the bankruptcy of many enterprises. Many industrial
producers who had borrowed heavily abroad during the overvaluation period,
became insolvent as the cost of debt service in local currency increased
sharply. Aided by the adoption of an IMF-supported stabilization program at
the end of 1982, the depression eventually bottomed out in late 1983. The
1983 debt rescheduling and new money from external creditors began to
revive domestic demand.
Basis for the 1984-1988 Recovery
1.04     Industrial output strongly recovered in 1984; however, the
recovery was based on short-term expansionary policies and faltered in
1985. The economic team that took office in early 1985 adopted a policy
program to increase private investment in export oriented and efficient
import substitution activities. This program was supported by the Bank
through three consecutive SALs between 1985 and 1988. The initial
Government measures included: (i) further currency devaluations (8.2Z in
February and 7.8? in July 1985, which represents an accumulated 25Z real
devaluation since July 1984); (ii) reduction in the uniform tariff rate
(increased to 35? in September 1984) to 20? in June 1985; (iii) legislative
changes to promote exports by smaller-scale producers; and (iv) a 10?
drawback for new exports below US$5 million. The Government also took
measures to recapitalize the corporate sector. Furthermore, the cut in the
corporate tax rate from 382 to 10? provided industry with more self-
financing. Industrial producers quickly responded to the more stable
macroeconomic framework, growing local demand, and favorable iiternationai
prices for Chile's resource-,ased exports. Stimulated in this way,
industrial output grew at an annual average rate of 6.9? between 1986 and
1988, faster than GDP, while industrial exports increased by more than 601.
The reform of the tax system that took effect in January 1988 has improved
the climate for investments and exports by further reducing the uniform
tariff fron 20 to 15?; eliminating the 40? tax on foreign export credit
insurance; and lowering the additional tax on profit remittances. The
Government is currently in the process of extending the drawback to
indirect exporters to stimulate the development of feeder industries to the
export sector.
1.05     All of the industrial subsectors rebounded in the post-1984
recovery,1 favored by the more stable macroeconomic framework and a
virtually distortion-free policy environment. Import-competing and non

traded-goods industries expanded in response to the increase in domestic
demand, and were thus able, once again, to reach production levels attained
at the beginning of the decade. The export sector continued to expand and
now has surpassed previous peak production levels.
B. Irdustrial Exports
1.06     The extraordinary increase in the value of Chile's industrial.
exports since 1986 has resulted from both a reversal in the downward trend
in international prices of Chile's main resource-based exports and a nearly
50? cumulative increase during 1987-1988 in volumes exported (see Table).

Five products--preserved fish and seafood, fish oil, fish flour, sawn wood,
and cellulose--comprise the bulk (63?) of industrial exports.
Internation&l prices of these products increased in 1987 and 1988 (see
Annex IV). T.aditional resource-based industries were not the only ones to
respond to the improved policy environment. A number of medium-scale
manufacturers are now beginning to enter the export markets. Although in
te-rms of values these are still marginal exporters, their growth in 1988
was very fast and signals the beginning of an export diversification
process. The most successful new exports in 1988 were: apparel (237?
increase in value over 1987 levels), textiles and yarns (1002), ceramic and
glass products (100?), shoes (732) and furniture (42Z). Among the
resource-based export industries there is a clear trend toward products
with a greater level of manufacturing: exports of manufactured wood
products increased by 124? in 1988, processed foods (other than fish,
fruits, and vegetables) by 462, and non-petroleum chemicals by 163? (Annex
V, Item I).
1.07     Further evidence of the tendency towards export diversification is
that between 1985 and 1987 the number of exported products increased from
about 1,000 to 1,500; the number of recipient countries grew from about 100



- 4 -
to 120, and the number of exporting enterprises rose from about 2,300 to
3,200.
1.08     The emerging non-traditional exports point to a growing number of
medium-size exporters, since producers tend to be smaller than the
traditional resource-based industries. These medium-sized firms also may
be making a comeback in production for the local market, judging by the
disproportionately high share of these industries in total industrial
growth since 1986.2 The importance of medium-sized exporters seems
confirmed by the fact that out of 3,000 exporting enterprises surveyed by
PROCHILE, only 1,600 firms (54Z) had yearly shipments of over US$100,000.
1.09     Medium-scale finms are usually unable to enter the export market
because single export orders tend to be too large tor them. The Governrient
assists medium-scale enterprises to enter the export market through
PROCHILE. This organization currently sponsors about 70 consortia of
exporters, comprising about 600 enterprises, who divide large export orders
among the members or buy materials in bulk (the metal-industries group has
120 enterprises). Through this system, medium-scale producers are
exporting refrigerators to Morocco, shoes to the USA, toys to the UK, and
tools to West Germany. Some of these groups are in the process of becoming
established trading companies. PROCHILE also acts as an information center
rendering marketing and technical assistance, arranging participation in
trade fairs, and providing representation abroad through 26 regional
offices.
1.10     The OECD countries are Chile's main trading partners for
industrial exports ar-I imports. Not only is OECD a more important export
market than LAFTA, but since 1982 exports to countries other than OECD have
overtaken exports to LAFTA. This reflects both continuing economic
problems in '.atin America and Chile's rapid development of capacity to
export goods to industrialized nations.
C. Industrial Investment
1.11     Annual investments in industry ranged from about US$350 million to
US$700 million during the 1985 to 1988 period (Annex VI). Initially, few
industries geared to the local market were operating at anywhere near full
capacity, so little if any new investment was needed. Subsectors that
benefitted from the increase in competitiveness following the real
devaluation also had idle capacity, and their output increased for a time
even without significant investments. Moreover, since a number of
enterprises went bankrupt, it was possible to distribute their machinery
among the viable firms, and hence to maintain the sector's capacity.
4/ Evidence for this comes from comparing SOFOFA's (the Trade Association
for Industrialists) production index, which tracks 400 of the largest
corporations and the INE (the National Statistical Office) production
index, which tracks enterprises with more than nine employees.



-5 -
However, by 1986 many industries had reached maximum output capacity3 and
indeed annual investments increased thereafter by 392 in 1987 and 19Z in
1988. By late 1988, bottlenecks were aDpearing in some sectors and
inventories stood at relatively low le'4ls.
1.12     With the real exchange devaluation and the recovery of domestic
demand, investment during the recovery period shifted toward tradable
sectors. This strong shift continued in 1986 and 1988 as evidenced by the
market orientation of the projects financed under the Bank's Industrial
Finance Restructuring Loan (see para. 2.05): out of a total investment of
abouit US$400 million, more thin 80? went to export oriented projects, 7?
went for import substitution projects, and the rest for production to
satisfy local demand unrelated to imports.
D. Industrial Finance
Financial Condition of Industry
1.13     Internal cash generation of the corporate sector has been
improving. At first, on account of the 1982/1983 crisis and the curre-
devaluation, the industrial sector's indebtedness rose substantially.
Since then, such indebtedness fell due to: (i) reprogramming of loans;
(ii) cuts in corporate income taxes (para. 1.04); and (iii) revenue growth
in a stabilizing macroeconomic environment. It is estimated that in 1987
the indebtedness of the corporate sector stood at 452 of total assets or 5
percentage points lower than in 1983. Profitability and liquidity
indicators improved in 1986 and remained strnng in 1987. Net profits to
sales had increased from a negative 21? in 1983 to a positive 21;g in 1987.
Regarding liquidity, the ratio of internally generated cash rebomnded in
1986 and 1987. In 1987 this ratio stood at 1.92 as compared to 0.68 in
1984. There are indications that the financial improvement of the
corporate sector continued during 1988.
Condition of the Financial Sector
1.14     In parallel with the positive developments in the real economy,
financial markets also have stabilized following the acute banking sector
crisis of the early eighties. Commercial banks have recuperated, but
further strengthening is needed.
1.15     By the standard of most other developing countries, the financial
sector in Chile is well developed and further deepening is in progress. At
its heart is the well managed Central Bank, which is the bank of issue and
lender of last resort. The banking system, as a major pillar of the
financial sector, is open and competitive with about half of the banks
3/ The group of industries operating at near full capacity in 1986
included those export-oriented industries that had exhibited rapid
growth since iY84, as well as some that substituted for imports
(especially textiles and ceramics).



- 6 -
having some degree of foreign ownership. Financial institutions number
about 40 and assets total around US$30 billion. With the exception of the
four financial companies ("financieras") which promote consumer credit,
banks a:e multipurpose institutions and do not specialize in any particular
business line. The largest comwarcial bank is the go-enunent-owned Banco
del Estado de Chile. The only development bank now operating is the
Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO) which, apart from providing
loans and grants for industry, performs a range of related functions such
as feasibility studies. The other major part of the financial sector is a
group of institutional investors that includes the 12 private pension funds
(representing the major source of finance) and about 40 life and general
insurance companies and a number of mutual funds. Finally, the
increasingly active Santiago Stock Exchange provides an important forum for
financial intermediation.
Sources of Domestic Long-Term Finance
1.16     Internal Funds.  Industry relies heavily on internal funds for
investment purposes. Estimates are that 552 of total assets of the
corporate sector has been financed from internal sources. Further, it is
estimated that between 1985 and 1988 about 30 to 352 of industrial
investments were financed from internal sources (see Annex VI). The future
level of internal funding is enhanced by the recent higher profitability of
firms plus the suspension of taxes on retained earnings--thus providing
incentives for reinvestment. On the other hand, pressures to increase real
wages is expected to exert a downward pressure on internal sources.
1.17     Equity financing raised through share issues is still relatively
unattractive, given the low Price/Earnings ratios of 5 to 6 times on the
Santiago Stock Exchange (compared to 1 to 14 times in West Germany and the
United States). The recent surge in new stock issues is largely related to
the Government's privatization efforts. New share issues are hampered
berause many companies have a long tradition of family ownership and fear
loss of management autonomy by opening ownership to additional investors.
1.18     Commercial Bank Credit.  The bankir.g system is the second most
important financier oc the corporate sector, having funded 56Z of
liabilities as of the end of 1987. During the 1985 to 1988 period banks
financed 35 to 502 of annual industrial investments (see Annex VI).
1.19     The banking system's financial condition shows signs of recovery,
but the recovery remains fragile. After the 1982/1983 crisis, 19 banking
institutions were liquidated and 5 major banks intervened including some of
the larg^st private banks. The rehabilitation of t'Le banking system then
became the main focus of financial policy from 1982 to 1986.
Rehabilitation measures included (i) the sale to the Central Bank of
nonperforming loans with the pledge to repurchase such loans over the long
term with the banks' profits; (ii) the recapitalization of the intervened
banks; and (iii) strengthening of bank supervision. Banks' profits are
improving and the repurchase of the nonperforming loans is proceeding
better than anticipated. However, the magnitude of the obligation towards



- 7 -
the Central Bank is expected to contribute to a continuing fragility of
banks, especially of those with weak earn4ng power. The recapitalization
is now essentially complete with the assistance of local and foreign
investors and through participation of small investors - about 50,000
shareholders were induced to invest in the two largest private banks. Bank
supervision has been strengthened by giving the Superintendency of Banks
enhanced powers to oversee bank solvency, operations, and loan policies.
1.20     Given that about 902 of the banks' deposit base is short term,
most of the banks' credit is short term and bank credit with fixed interest
rates and long maturities is very scarce. Usually, banks offer short-term
rollover credits that are unsound for long-term investments, since
borrowers carry the risk that: (i) the credit may not be rolled-over or
(ii) the interest rate may be increased at the discretion of the lender,
i.e., without reference to a previously agreed margin and reference rate.
To allow banks to offer long-term credits, new financial instruments to
extend the deposit maturities will be required. The gradual development of
such new financial instruments will be rne of the objectives of the new
Financial Markets Loan (see para. 2.03).
1.21     Corporate Bond Placements.  Bonds so far have played a minimal
role in industrial financing. Estimates indicate that about 1Z of
corporate liabilities as of the end of 1987 were financed through the
placement of bonds. During the 1985 to 1988 period, bonds financed less
than about 5Z of annual industrial investments (see Annex VI). As
discussed below, there are indications that the importance of bond
financing will gradually increase.
1.22     The pension funds are emerging as a major source of institut4onal
investment funds. There are now 12 private pension funds with total assets
of about US$3.3 billion as of September 1988. It is estimated that during
the next few years the pension fund resources will grow by about US$500
million per year as a result of the participants' contributions.
Development of new long-term financial assets and a liberalization of the
pension funds' investment restrictions will be required to avoid imbalances
between demand and supply of suitable financial instruments. Currently,
about 86? of pension fund investments are in mortgage bonds and public
bonds, with about 14Z in stocks and bonds of enterprises. The pension
funds hold investments in only about 20 enterprises, representing a small
fraction of the 200 companies listed on the Santiago Stock Exchange or the
600 companies with annual sales of at least US$1.5 million. Proposals
under considera.ion would allow the pension funds to invest in: (i) real
estate companies; (ii) equity investments in listed and actively traded
companies; (iii) certificates in closed-end funds; and (.v) commercial
paper. The gradual lifting of investment restrictions will expand the
supply of securities. However, it is anticipated that in the near future
few additional firms will benefit, since pension funds will continue to
focus on investing only in firms that meet the required standard of the
highest rating or of exceptional financial soundness.



- 8 -
1.23     Fueled by historically low and stable interest rates, the number
of bond issues and amounts offered increased su.bstantially during 1987 and
1988. However, the number of firms active in the bond market remains low:
about 15, with about half belonging to the public utility sector (see
Annex VII).  While this limited presence is the result of the investment
restrictions of the pension funds (see para. 1.22), other industry related
factors play an important role as well. While some industrial firms are
attracted to bonds because of their historically low cost and long
maturities, they often are either not familiar with the process of
registration, consider such process slow and bureaucratic, or, because of
competition, do not wish to conform to the disclosure requirements. Other
requirements for bond issues include: (i) a substantial volume (probably
above US$5 million); (ii) a type of business not subject to substantial
earnings fluctuations (this favors the public utility sector and tends to
exclude the construction sector, for instance); and (iii) a type of
business which does not need to alter its internal financial info,Amation
system to conform to the requirements for financial disclosures. Provided
interest rates remain low, industrial firAs ,;an be expected gradually to
make greater use of bonds as a source of funds.
1.24     Cost of Long-Term Credit.  Chile had during the 1970s to the mid
1980s a history of very high and highly volatile real interest rates.
Interest rates for maturities above 90 days are quoted in Chile in real
terms, that is after adjustment for inflation as measured by the Unidad de
Fomento (UF) - a constant unit of account the value of which changes daily
according to the consumer price index. Following the liberalization of the
financial system in the mid-1970s, real interest rates shot up to well over
1002 p.a. to stabilize several years later in the 20 to 302 p.a. range.
The crisis of the early eighties continued to promote high and unstable
real interest rates. Only since mid-1985--in line with the improvements in
the real economy--did real interest rates begin to decline gradually, iince
then remaining stable at historically low levels. For a detailed evolution
of long-term interest rates, see Annex VIII. At present, the range of real
interest rates to final borrowers for maturities between 5 and 10 years is:
Commercial Bank Credit (short-term/roll-over type): 7 to 92 p.a. -
variable.
Commercial Bank Mortgage Credit          : 9.5 to 10.52 p.a. - fixed
Direct Placement of Corporate Bonds    s 6 to 72 p.a. - fixed
Sources of Foreign Long-Term Finance
1.25     Equity financing has been bolstered by foreign investment,
particularly through debr-equity swaps. Between 1985 and the first half of
1988, the industrial sector received approximately US$800 million in
foreign investment, one-third of a total foreign investment of US$2.44
billion. Such risk capital financing typically benefits companies with
long-standing business relationships with foreign partners; most foreign
projects often spend a year or two in gestation before becoming



-9-
operational. Given the impending presidential transition, foreign
investors can be expected to await the results of the December 1989
elections.
1.26     The rising industrial investments in recent years were made
possible to a significant extent by long-term financing of the Inter-
American Development Bank, the Bank, and the International Finance
Corporation. The IDB supported the industrial sector with an Industrial
Reactivation Loan and a Multisectoral Loan (for the Bank's past operations
see para. 2.05). The contribution of both development banks to annual
industrial investment rose from 42 in 1985 to 222 in 1988 (see Annex VI).
IFC has been supporting investments in chemicals, mining, pulp and paper
with loan commitments of US$211 million since 1986.  To foster capital
markets development, IFC provided equity financing of US$4.7 million.
1.27     Supplier credits also have made an important contribution to the
financing plan of industrial investments. During the 1985 to 1988 period
such credits financed about 9 to 10? of industrial investments. Yearly
resources available ranged from - *ut US$30-60 million (see Annex VI).
1.28     Future Investment Needs and Financing: The investment requirements
of the industrial sector for 1989 and 1990 can be conservatively estimated
at about US$700-800 million per year. This estimate is based on both the
1988 investment levels and also on known investment plans up to 1991 of a
group of about 70 enterprises. The long-term financing of an investment
level of about US$1.5 billion during 1989 and 1990 is expected to put
substantial pressure on internal funds, especially for the large majority
of medium-sized firms, which can access neither long-term sources, such as
the bond and szock markets, nor foreign equity capital. Without credit
provided from external sources, such as the Bank, investments will proceed
more haltingly and be less soundly financed: haltingly because internal
funds will only be reinvested as these become available; less soundly
financed because the banking system can be expected to continue to
emphasize short-term roll-over credits.
E. Industrial Sector Prospects and Constraints
1.29     Growing competition in the local market has stimulated Chilean
entrepreneurs to make full use of Chile's comparative advantages, which
rest on natural resources and rich human capital. Entrepreneurs have
gained experience in accessing foreign markets. Furthermore, the favorable
business climate is attracting growing numbers of foreign investors, who
complement their investments with marketing channels and technical
expertise, thus contributing to the integration of Chile into the
international economy. The prospect for sustaining the strong performance
of the last two years is good, provided the policy framework remains
basically unchanged and the Government is able to maintain macroeconomic
stability. Chile is in a favorable position to continue its exportled
growth: first, it has carved out some specialized niches in the
international market and it is unlikely that the tendency towards greater



- 10 -
protectionism in txe OECD countries will have much effect on Chile's
exports; and second, Chile's industries have a considerable competitive
margin, and moderate real wage increases are unlikely to undermine Chile's
international competitiveness in the near future.  The only const_aint to
maintaining current levels of industrial growth is the lack of long-term
sources of funds.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Bank Strateav in the Industrial and Financial Sectors
2.01     During 1985-87. the Bank made three structural adjustment loans to
Chile focusing on: (i) maintenance of external trade pclicies intended to
accelerate export growth, and efficient import substitution based on a more
diversified economy; (ii) public sector management and fiscal policies to
maintain economic recovery and strengthen public savings; (iii) financial
policies to stimulate domestic savings and to allocate funds more
efficiently; and (iv) policy incentives to expand productive employment.
As complementary support, two Bank loans, approved in 1985, assisted small,
medium and large industrial firms to finance production expansion (see
para. 2.05).
2.02     The Bank's support has contributed to the success of the
Government's adjustment efforts and helped to stimulate industrial growth.
Better public sector management and fiscal policies succeeded in
trtnsforming a fiscal deficit of 2.6Z of GDP in 1985 into a surplus in
1988, with public savings doubling as a percentage of GDP in the same
period. Lower fiscal deficits helped to halve inflation to 12.7Z p.a. in
1988 as compared to 1985. The resulting stable and virtually distortion
free macroeconomic environment stimulated investment in new industrial
exports and efficient import substitution. The extraordinary growth of
industrial exports has allowed the Government to make progress toward
reducing Chile's external obligations.
2.03     The challenge for Chile remains to sustain the strong industrial
expansi'n of the last two years while continuing to develop its financial
markets. The Bank's strategy is to support the Government's efforts
through sector oriented operations that would help remove the main
constraint to industrial growth: namely lack of term-financing. The
proposed Loan would be an instrument to help mainatain the momentum of
industrial investment. In coordination with IFC, a Financial Markets
Project is being prepared as a subsequent operation to help remove
constraints to further development of term lending - Chile. It would
focus on strengthening the securities market, as well as advance the
recovery of the banking system. The proposed project would be the last of
its kind, unless there are delays in establishing an effective capital
market as part of the financial market operation.
2.04     Timing of Bank support is strategically opportune since it would
assist in maintaining the current momentum of investments by the industrial



- 11 -
sector, taking advantage of attractive international prices of Chile's
resource-based exports. The Project would also help maintain the
perception of a favorable investment climate during a period in which
uncertainties are emerging about the continuity of the current policy
framework.
2.05     Previous Bank Involvement:  The Project would build on the solid
performance of the previous US$100 million Industrial Finance Restructuring
Loan (2606-CH). During 1987 and 1988 this Loan contributed to the
financing of investment projects amounting to about US$400 million,
equivalent to nearly one-third of that period's total industrial
investment. After the 1987 Amendment--allowing regular investments in
addition to restructuring projects--Loan 2606-CH was committed in about 12
months and is now 94Z disbursed. Real variable interest rates were market-
determined. A total of 28 enterprises, active mainly in mining,
paper/forestry, agro-industry and fishing, benefitted through 12 financtal
intermediaries. Borrowers are meeting all their debt service obligations.
Another Bank project relates to the support of small and medium industry
(Loan 2613-CH for US$40 million approved in 1985). The institutional
channels have been less successful and loan disbursements, now about
US$11 million, have been slow. Efforts are underway to remove
institutional rigidities to reach the smaller firms more effectively.
B. Proiect Objectives
2.06     The project would help sustain industrial modernization and
expansion. It would finance export-oriented investments at a time of
attractive international prices for Chile's resource-based exports. This
export orientation is consistent with Chile's intention to maintain its
debt service performance. The project also would help maintain a favorable
investment climate during a period of some macro-policy uncertainties in
view of political changes.
C. Project Description
2.07     The Project would finance investments in new plants, plant
expansion, and permanent working capital. Eligible would be economically
viable projects in all industries, widely defined to include forestry,
fishing, mining, and related industrial services. A broad definition of
industrial investments has been chosen to avoid segmentation and to allow
maximum flexibility in loan allocation. This was confirmed during
negotiations. The Project would address the credit needs of firms for
which stock and bond placements are not suitable (see paras. 1.22 and
1.23). The universe of such firms is estimated at about 400.
2.08     The Government of the Republic of Chile would be the Borrower and
the Central Bank the executing agency. The Central Bank would onlend the
proceeds to the participating financial intermediaries in accordance with
Subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the Bank.

D. Proiect Cost and Financing
2.09     Investment costs are based on about 60 concrete proposals for
which specific financing requests have been submitted to commercial banks
(for a complete list see Annex IX). The Bank has reviewed 15 during
appraisal. Total project costs are estimated at about US$280 million
assuming, conservatively, that about 25Z of the investments will ultimately
not mature. About 702 of investment expenditures would be directed to
export oriented projects. The Project represents about 202 of the expected
industrial investments during the 1989/1990 period. The foreign exchange
component of industrial investments is estimated at 602.
2.10     The financing plan for each investment project will be tailor-made
(see Annex IX). In the aggregate, it is assumed that the financing plan
for the Project would have the following profile:
USS millions     2
Owners' Contribution                     66.0         24
Commercial Bank Credit           s       15.0          5
Miscellaneous Sources            s       37.0         13
IDB                              s       37.0         13
World Bank                       s        75.0        27
Central Bank Matching Funds      s       50.0         18
Total           280.0        100
2.11     The Bank and the Central Bank jointly are expected to contribute
45Z or a total of US$125 million of Project Costs. During negotiations, it
was confirmed that the Central Bank would provide US$50 million in matching
funds to be made available over the entire project period. Moreover, it
was agreed that any firm which either (a) has placed debt securities in the
market during the last three years, or (b) had its shares quoted on any
stock exchange during the prior twelve months, or (c) has obtained a rating
for risk classification purposes on its debt securities, will not be able
to access the resources made available by the Bank and the Central Bank.
However, the Central Bank Technical Unit (para. 2.22) may allow, following
a consultation with the Bank, an exception, if evidence is provided that
market conditions make it unviable to tap the bond and stock markets for
all or part of the financing requested. The rest of the financing is
expected to be packaged by the commercial banks. Commercial banks' own
funds are expected to make a minor contribution of 5Z, recognizing their
limited access to long term maturities. Use of IDB funds from existing



- 13 -
industrial credit lines or lines to be provided (not under a cofinancing
arrangement) is expected to contribute about 132. During negotiations, it
was confirmed that the Government will not make available subsidized
industrial credit lines with terms and conditions that effectively undercut
the proposed Loan. Miscellaneous sources include (i) bond placements by
firms able to tap the bond markets to meet partial financing needs; and
(ii) suppliers' credits.
2.12     The proposed Bank loan would have a 17-year maturity, including 5-
years' grace. The Government would assume the cross currency risk. The
loan would be repaid according to the standard amortization schedule. The
Central Bank would utilize the proceeds received from the repayment of
principal and interest of subloans, which are not required to repay the
Bank loan, for making additional loans under s1milar terms ar; conditions.
2.23     Firms controlled by the Government or by commercial banks would
nct be eligible. No enterprise, including its subsidiaries, or group of
companies, would be eligible to obtain financing in excess of US$5 million.
The limit of a maximum of US$5 million is (ij to encourage a broad
dispersion of Bank loan funds; and (ii) not to compete with the bond market
which is suitable for financing amounts above US$5 million. This was
confirmed during negotiations.
2.14     Subloans would contribute to financing the foreign exchange cost
of: (i) fixed assets; (ii) permanent working capital; and (iii) technical
assistance, engineering, and feasibility studies required by the
industries. Permanent working capital financing would be restricted to no
more than 50Z of the Loan. This was confirmed during negotiations.
E. Onlending Terms and Conditions
2.15     Enterprises would have the option of borrowing either in US
dollars or in Chilean pesos.
2.16     (a) Interest Rates Charged by the Central Bank to Financial
Intermediaries: Interest rates charged on dollar-denominated subloans would
equal the Bank's interest rate plus 0.62 p.a., which would compensate the
Central Bank for the commitment fee of the Bank and for the cost of
operating the Technical Unit. This was confirmed during negotiations.
2.17     Interest rates charged on peso-denominated loans--which would
include loans made with the matching funds of the Central Bank--would be
set and adjusted on the basis of the widely published "Tasa de Interes
Promedio (TIP)" reference rate. TIP is the real weighted average rate
(i.e., after adjustment for inflation) the banking system pays for 90-365
day deposits. To achieve a reasonable stability of interest rates two
measures are proposed. First, to smooth out sharp month-to-month
fluctuations, the specific numerical value of TIP would be based on the



- 14 -
average rate during the three months preceding the interest setting/change
date (February 1 or August 1). Second, to avoid the risk that a mechanical
application of the resultant TIP is out of line with current market-
clearing rates, the Central Bank would be al'lowed to set rates within a
band of TIP plus 1Z and minus 0.52. This was confirmed during
negotiations.
2.18     (b) Interest Rates Charged by the Financial Intermediaries.
Interest rates charged to final borrowers would be based on the interest
rate charged by the Central Bank plus a spread. Commercial banks would be
free to determine their spread and any financing arrangement (including
fixed interest rates) in line with the creditworthiness of the borrower and
the soundness of the investment. This was confirmed during negotiations.
The flexibility of letting the commercial banks set the spread (instead of
the 32 maximum under Loan 2606) is considered an important incentive to the
commercial banks to lend increasingly to the more risk prone non-prime
companies. Competition is expected to keep a lid on the size of spreads
(firms typically negotiate with several banks before closing on loans of
such magnitude). Given the Bank's current interest rate, the rate for
dollar-denominated loans to the ultimate borrower would range from 10.25 to
12.25% p.a., assuming margins ranging from 2Z to 42. For peso-denominated
loans--and assuming a TIP of 5.5Z--minimum real interest rates to ultimate
borrowers would range from 7 to 9Z p.a.
2.19     The interest rate for peso-denominated loans would be reviewed
during the last quarter of each year to determine whether the Central Bank
is earning a spread to cover administrative costs, financial charges and
the dollar risk. Given that Chile currently pursues policies of open
capital markets and market-determined interest rates, current levels of
interest rates include an allowance for anticipated foreign exchange change
mainly vis a vis the US dollar. Should the yearly review show that the
Central Bank needs to raise its rates to the commercial banks, appropriate
revisions would be introduced. This was confirmed during negotiations.
2.20     The minimum loan size would be US$500,000 to avoid a conflict with
the Bank's Small and Medium Scale Industries Project (Loan 2613-CH, see
para. 2.05). Bank funds may be used to finance 1002 of the loan amount of
the subloan, provided such financing does not exceed 602 of the investment
costs. This was confirmed during negotiations.
2.21     Subloans for fixed investment and associated working capital would
have maximum maturities of 10 years, including 3 years of grace. Subloans
granted exclusively for working capital would have maturitieo of up to 36
months, including a grace period of up to 12 months. This was confirmed
during negotiations.



- 15 -
F. Project Implementation
Institutional Setting
2.22     The Central Bank's Technical Unit (TU), established under Loan
2606, would continue to manage the funds of the proposed Loan and would be
responsible for all associated administrative tasks. The TU has been ably
managed and well staffed. To encourage a more expeditious drawdown of
funds for smaller subloans, and in recognition that commercial banks in any
case bear the full credit risk, loans of up to US$l million will be granted
without prior authorization of the TU; however, an ex-post evaluation of
compliance would be performed by the TU. Bank review would be limited to
ex-post evaluations of a representative sample of projects during
supervision. This was confirmed during negotiations.
Subproject Appraisal and Supervision
2.23     The TU's Statement of Operating Policies and Procedures will
continue to govern appraisal and supervision practices. Each commercial
bank would be expected to supervise subprojects regularly and to report on
performance progress. The TU would retain the right to visit both the
commercial banks and the enterprises regularly to obtain first-hand views
of project progress. This was confirmed during negotiations.
Procurement and Disbursement
2.24     Procurement procedures would conform to standard practice for
loans to financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries will require
quotations from at least three suppliers for procurement packages worth at
least US$400,000. Subloans for consulting services would be open to
international recruitment. Subloans would finance up to 3.0X of the total
cost of the subproject, or the estimated foreign exchange component of the
investment, and all loan proceeds would be disbursed against 1002 of the
amount of the subloan. Withdrawals are expected to be made on the basis of
statements of expenditures. This was confirmed during negotiations.
Annex X provides an estimated disbursement schedule. During negotiations
it was confirmed that all funds would be committed by December 31, 1991 and
that the Closing Date would be December 31, 1994.
2.25     To ensure timely payments of reimbursement claims, a Special
Account would be established to cover estimated expenditures for four
months. The initial deposit, to meet peak demand, would be US$10 million.
This was confirmed during negotiations.
2.26     To meet the strong investment demand during the first semester of
1989, retroactive financing of up to US$7.5 million or 102 of the loan
amount is recommended. Any expenditure incurred 180 days prior to receipt
of the request for subloan approval would not be eligible. This was
confirmed during negotiations.



- 16 -
Accounts and Audit
2.27     As under Loan'2606-CH, beneficiar!i' and commercial banks'
records related to the subprojects would continue to be audited by auditors
satisfactory to the TU of the Central Bank. Project accounts would be
subject to external audit. As a now requirement, the TU would prepare
semi-annual financial statements to reflect the net cashflow of the
combined resources provided by the Bank and the Central Bank, taking into
account the interest rates charged by the Central Bank, the cost of
operating the TU, and the cost of funds including the foreign exchange
debt-service payments to the Bank. This was confirmed during negotiations.
Participating Intermediaries
2.28     There would be no restriction on participation of any bank in good
standing with the Superintendency of Banks, provided they sign a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bank. This was confirmed during
negotiations.
G. Risks
2.29     The project does not face significant risks.  The institutional
channels are well tested. The estimate of loan demand is based on concrete
investment proposals, the large majority of which are expected to be
carried out irrespective of the uncertainties associated with the
forthcoming change in Government. Indications are that the prudent fiscal
and monetary policies of the present Government have support even among the
opposition. While onlending conditions have been tightened somewhat
compared to the predecessor loan, they are still sufficiently attractive to
ensure expeditious disbursement. Interest rates are expected to remain
stable in anticipation of continued prudent macro policies. However,
should interest rates rise substantially, loan demand may not remain as
strong.
