The Project aims to\n            develop and launch a sector-wide policy, institutional and\n            operational reforms through various technical studies,\n            pilot-tests and start-up operation of some reform measures\n            (Sectoral Reform Preparation) and improve the quality and\n            efficiency of public hospital services. Bank performance\n            over the whole project cycle was in general outstanding,\n            except for occasionally slack supervision. Borrower's\n            performance during preparation was highly satisfactory. Some\n            of the key lessons learned includes: a) It is prudent and\n            flexible for the Bank to finance a sectoral reform\n            preparatory project before launching a sector-wide reform\n            program. b) It is essential to carry out a strong public\n            dissemination and education campaign for the sectoral reform\n            program to alleviate any possible resistance to it. c) It is\n            practical to start most reform measures with Executive\n            decrees or regulations rather than legislative actions. d)\n            Decentralization should be accompanied by measures to ensure\n            accountability and equity among decentralized entities. e)\n            Successful cost-recovery requires incentives for agencies to\n            retain revenues collected. f) Monitoring and evaluation\n            should receive greater attention from the beginning of the\n            reform. g) The Bank should reinforce its advantage to\n            provide policy advice and technical assistance. h) The Bank\n            should accelerate its loan agreement amendment processes."}, "docdt": "1998-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
