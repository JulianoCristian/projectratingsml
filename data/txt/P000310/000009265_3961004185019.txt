MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED ENGINEERING CREDIT TO BUREINA PASO
FOR THE OUAGADOUGOU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following me num and recoendaton on a
propoed engineering credit to Burkina Faso for SDR 3 million, the equivalent of US$4.25 million, on
standard IDA tems, with a maturity of 40 years to help finance the preparation of a water supply project.
Ihe proceeds of the credit would be passed on to ONEA (Office Nationa de lTW et de l'Assaissemen)
on tle same tm  as the IDA credit. 'he CFD (Caisse Fransaise do Ddveloppement) will provide the
equivalent of US$2.3 million to cofinmne two major studies.
2.           Co yc r Ba               Burkina Faso, a landlocked country in wester Central
Africa of about 274,000 km2 with nealy nine million inhabitants is only sparsely endowed with hydraulic
resrces. The country extends over three climatic zones; the Saiel in the north, the dry savana in the
middle and the humid saanna in the southwest. Rainfall iS irregular and unpredictable and attains an
annual average of 400 mm in the north to 1200 mm in the south. In order to promote efficient water
resource management and provide its population with an adequate quantity of safe water the Government
created a Miistry for Water (Mmistbre de l'Eau) in 1982, solely for this purpse. A Letter of Sector
Policy Development has been sent to the Bank which, inter alia, establishes the principle of ONEA's
fiacial aitonomy and establishes priorities for water resource management: drinking water, irrigation,
hydroelectric. In the rural areas the Govermnent policy is to provide the villages with the necessary
wat in     ucture, minly thgh grant financing and encuraging village participation (planning,
fnancial and labor). Ihe villages are fully responsible for operation and maintenance.
3.           The main sector problems, however, are in the urban areas, where the water supply
authority (ONEA), a financially autonomous government enterprise, cannot expand its operations fast
enough to satify the rapidly increasng demand, caused by the rapid urbanization. With the fiancial aid
of the CFD and the KfW existing ialltions have been upgraded, but are stretched to their mawimum
capacity. As all nearby water resources are filly and even over-exploited, new resources have to be
brougt in from further and further away. 1Tis results in costly and bulky investments.
4.           The Goverme  has embarked on a program to strer -hen the management of the sector.
A pewfrma    cotact has been prepared and discussed with the BankL Up to now ONEA has always
incured losses, and has survived due to Government subsidies, inadequate maintenance and a low
stdard of service. To remedy this siuation the Governmen has acceted the r mions of a
tariff study which reommends gradual substatial tariff adjustments, increasing cost recovery from 69%
to 76% for 1993, 90% for 1994 and 100% for 1995. The frst thre tranches of this tariff increase
program were properly implemente in 1991, 1992 and 1993. In addition, a plan has been devised to
reduce the likelihood of Government arrears to ONEA, based on the automatic payment of estimated
quarterly bills. An action plan to settle current Government arrears is to be included in the Performance
Contract.
5.           PrJe  Obectives. Ihe objectives of the Engineering Credit are: (i) to finance the studies
and technical assistance needed for the preparation of the fiuture project; (ii) to lay the groundwork to
improve the uality of entry of the future project and for its successful implementation; and (-i) to test
the commitment of the Gover^ment to sector reforms and the capacity of ONEA to improve its
maagement befre making further massive investments. These objectves are in line with Government's
objecdve to strengthen ONEA so as to enable it to administer the sector more effecdvely, to adhieve
financial disciline, and to accomplish financia self-sufficiency of the urban water supply ser. All
of this will lead to sustained sector development.

6.QiM Projet  scti  ITe proposed engineering credit would help to finance the
preparation of the Ouagadougou Water Supply Project. Specifically it would finance (a) consultant
services fbr the preparation of final designs and bidding document and (b) consultant services for the
dam and transmission main components, the environmental assessment and resetlement plan. In addition
It would strengthen ONEA's institutional capacity to manage a project of this scale by financing (a) a full
tim ternational expert on the management of large scale water supply projects, (b) training for ONEA
staff in project design and management, (c) the marginal costs of adding additional office space to an
ongoing constuction project to accommodate the staff working on the project, (d) office equipment and
vehicles and (e) the incremenal costs associated with project management. The net of tax cost for the
preparation of the fir phase of the investment program would be about US$6.55 million. CFD will
make US$2.3 million availabie to fince the final designs and the preparation of bidding docment for
th- treatrent plant and distution network components. The proposed engineering credit would finance
the difference. Detailed costs and financing tables are in ScbW1e A. Amounts and methods of
procurem.ent are shown in Schedle B.   timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Burkia Faso are given in ScheWes C ad D respectively.
7.           Pro  lemention. The proposed project would be executed by ONEA, whose
project management capabilities would be strengthened through the provision of technical assistance and
basic equipment. ONEA would be resonsible for the preparaton of the future investment project and,
later on, for its impulemeion USing the principles and the successful experienc with specialized
contract management in urban projects in the Sahel. ONEBA's operations will be monitored using the
vehicle of a permrmance contract, acceptable to the Association, signature of which would be a condition
Of ef fectivene3s.
S.           Poiect Sustaina4ffi . Without this engineering credit, the Govemment would be unable
to proceed fiuther with the preparation of the future Ouagdougou Water Supply Project. Strengthenimg
Of ONEA's project management capacity wiUl allow for better preparation of its investment as well as its
imnplion. The improvement of ONEA's financial capacity called for under the performan
contract would lay the groundwork for fiamcial sustanability of the sector. In addition the project will
enable the donor community to determine Government's commitment to and ownership of proposed
reforms.
9.           Lesns Larm d from Pe      s pA ilvyment. This is IDA's first involvement in
Burkina Faso's water sector. The projec draws heavily on the lessons learned from other water supply
projects undertaken in the Sahelian region. The major problems idenified in these projects have been
government interference, non-payment by government of its utility bills, and poor management of the
utility. The performance contrat includes clauses which, if respected, would resolve these obstacles.
lhe Government Is clearly aware that lIA's involvement in the future project is dependent on the results
of this upfront conditionality. As for the other ongoing operations   infstructure, the Plc Works
and Employment Project is performing commendably, the Transport Sector Project is performing
reasonably well, and there has been a recent tuound in the Urban m project. The main iesson
learned from these operations is tha management is the key factor. The proposed project reflects this
lesson in that the Government has been very involved in project conception and preparation.
10.            a1efolr IDAlmo       n. The ratonale for granting the proposed engineering
credt would be to get involved in the sector on a small scale, to test the willingness of the Government
and the capacity of ONEA to ntroduce important reforms and to ensure that these are implemented before
committi  t msajor investments. The country assistance strategy for Burkina Faso was discussed by the
Board in Februay 1992. This project fully supports the public sector management and poverty
allation on objectves of the strategy.

11.          Agrd Actions.  he major sector ssues are related to wate resource and financW
management. Agreements have been rached on: (a) a letter of sector policy issued In October 1992; (b)
several water taiff increases from 1993 to 1995 (new tariffs were implemented in 1991, 1992 and 1993);
(c) a new organization chart for ONEA; and (d) a performance conta  betwee the Government and
ONEA to be sigmd by the end of June 1993 (condition of effectiveness of the proposed engineering
credit). The respect of the performance contract by the Government and ONEA, as well as meeting the
targets specified above would be criteria for the financing of future investments.
12.          Envrmena AV=. As this project is financing oily the studies and detaed
engineering for te future project it Is a category C. However, the future project will Include a dam on
the NakanbE River and up to 5,000 people will have to be relocated. 'he TOR for the environmental
assessment which Is financed by this credit, bave been reviewed by IDA. Both the OD on the
environment as well on resettlement have been complied with. The expansion of the distribution system
will resut in an increase in the volume of water sold and an increase in the disposal of wastewater,
creaing a pote  negative envnental impacts These aspects have been also been included in the
TOR for the environmental assessmet Finally, the DCA will contain a clause spefying that the draft
report should be discussed with and made available to all interested paties and will be forwaded to IDA
for its review and comments. This will ensure that the major issues relating to the environment and
resettlement are properly addressed in the report.
13.          Propram gbietives C9&grdes. Safe drinking water is one of the most important basic
human needs and is indispensable for ssining and enhancing the quality of life, especially in the
SAHEL. Social and economic benefits are also gained from access to a clean and reliable supply of
water. The project will also contribute considerably to improving the management of a public utlity and
to better environmental management. The primary objective of the technical assstance (TA) is project
preparation and implemention support (substitution TA) through engeing designs and an
environmental assessment. The secondary TA objective is insitonal development (capacity buflding)
leading to buildig capacity beyond what is required for the project to improve institutional capacity
through a performance contract and regular audits.
14.          EMiect Benefits. The Government would be unable to pceee further with the
preparation of the Ouagadougou water supply project without this engineering credit. The project woul.
contribute significantly towards the continued reorgaization of the water sector , Improving sector
management, financial accountability and resource allocation. It would also contribute towards relieving
the naton's debt problem by rendering the sector less dependent on budgetary allocations and by making
ONEA responsible for servicing the existing and new debt related to the urban water supply subsector.
Finally the program, once implemented, would help to relieve poverty by Improving basic services and
making an adequate quantity of safe water available to urban dwellers and improving the general health
situation.
15.          Riks. The risks Involve primarily the Government's willingness and capacity to impose
financial discipline, to settle arreas in a timely fashion, to set reguations for prompt payment of water
bills and to continue to allow ONEA to increase its water tariffs periodically in order to meet its financial
obligations. The Government is very aware that a financially sound sector, including ONEA, is a sine-
qua-non condition for the further development of the sector. The use of an Engineering Credit will allow
the Bank to verify: (a) Government Commitment; and (b) ONEA's capacity to respond before committing
IDA funds to a massive investment program.

16.          RqM,odaim. I am satisfied that the proposed Engineering Credit would comply with
the Articla of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directs approve it.
