      strengthening was not met. Nevertheless, engineering designs\n            and dam construction related studies, such as the\n            environmental assessment and resettlement action plan, were\n            successfully accomplished and completed. Initially, the Bank\n            responded properly to identification, appraisal, and\n            negotiations prior to board presentation, but failed to\n            provide adequate attention to broad institutional building\n            issues, as well as corrective actions regarding the\n            Government's default on the Credit Agreement clauses\n            with respect to the Performance Contract. The Government\n            took actions in contradiction to the project's\n            objectives, thus disrupting implementation; furthermore, the\n            default on the performance contract delayed the required\n            tariff increases, failing to provide adequate financial\n            statements. Considering both the Bank and the\n            borrower's performances as unsatisfactory, it is\n            suggested that: 1) an engineering credit could be\n            appropriate for financing studies in future complex\n            operations; 2) integrated environmental assessments could be\n            completed well ahead of project implementation, financed\n            through an engineering credit, to effectively address large\n            infrastructure requirements; 3) based on past experience,\n            the Bank should have engaged the Borrower in sector\n            restructuring, leading to private sector participation."}, "docdt": "1999-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
