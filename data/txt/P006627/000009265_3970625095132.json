Project\n            will support the Government's Structural Adjustment\n            Program, a program designed to acelerate exports and\n            domestic savings so as to permit a recovery of economic\n            growth and employment while the country services its\n            external debt. The main areas covered by the\n            Government's medium-term program include: (i) measures\n            to strengthen incentives for noncopper exports; (ii) steps\n            to increase public savings and the efficiency of the public\n            investment program; and (iii) measures to improve the\n            condition of banking and corporate finances. The loan will\n            finance all imports, with the exception of luxury items and\n            military goods. Complementary studies designed to improve\n            public sector management, state enterprise divestment,\n            employment generation, export assistance programs, and\n            forestry development program will be particularly financed\n            by a prior Public Sector MAnagement Technical Assistance\n            Loan (Ln. 2504-CH) approved in March 1985."}, "docdt": "1985-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
