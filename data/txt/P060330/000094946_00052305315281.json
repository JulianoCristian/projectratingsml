and to thereby contribute to socially and\n            environmentally sustainable private mineral investment. The\n            project has six main components: 1) The policy and\n            regulatory institutional strengthening component reviews and\n            develops mineral policy , strategy, and regulation in order\n            to promote exploration, and finances small-scale mining,\n            offshore mining, mine safety and health, and mine closure.\n            The second component develops departmental capacity to\n            monitor and execute technical audits and mining activities\n            by preparing monitoring and auditing strategies;\n            implementing new institutional arrangements including\n            organizing, staffing, and work methodology; and providing\n            training. The third component strengthens the DoM's\n            mineral tenements management by conducting field\n            assessments, and developing a database. The fourth component\n            develops project coordination and environmental assessment\n            capacity for sustainable development in mining project\n            areas. The fifth and sixth components fund institutional\n            strengthening for the geological survey and develop\n            geological information system capabilities; and implement\n            new institutional arrangements for the IRC as well as\n            upgrade equipment."}, "docdt": "2000-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
