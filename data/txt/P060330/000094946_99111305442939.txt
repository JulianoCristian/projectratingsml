1. Country And Sector Background
BACKGROUND: Papua New Guinea Has Favorable Geology Which Is Located At
The Eastern Extension Of Mineral Belt Of The Indonesian Archipelago. The
Country Has Tremendous Potential For Copper, Gold, And Nickel. Following
The Discovery And Development Of The Bougenville Copper Project In The
Mid-1960s, The Country Benefited From An Active Mineral Exploration And
Mining Industry. This Led To The Discovery Of The Ok Tedi Copper And Gold
Deposit And The Frieda Copper Deposit Soon After Bougenville In The Late
1960s. In The 1970s, The Target Of Mineral Exploration Shifted To Gold.
This Led To Active Exploration Program Resulting In Discoveries In Many
Areas Including Porgera, Misima, And Hidden Valley. The Exploration
Success Continued Up Until The Late 1980s With The Discovery Of Lihir,
Wafi, Simberi, Tolukuma, Mt Sinivit, And Mt Kare. Four World Class Mines
- The Large Ok Tedi Copper And Gold Mine And The Porgera, Misima And Lihir
Gold Mines; Plus A Small Gold Mine At Tolukuma Were Subsequently Developed
In 1980s And Are In Production. Mining Development Contracts Have Been
Signed By The Investors For Each Project. These Include Social And
Environmental Protection Plans Which Are Generally Well Designed And
Implemented.  There Are Also Several Mechanized Alluvial Gold Mines And
Around 20,000 Artisan Level Alluvial Gold Operations. All Of These
Achievements, However, Had Occurred At A Time When The Government
Institutional Capacity For Mining Was Reasonably Good. However, As The
Institutional Capacity Of The Government, Both Dom And IRC Today, Has
Eroded Over The Past Ten Years, Dom And IRC Lack A Strong Presence At The
Mining Sites. The Government, Therefore, Is Presently Facing Difficulty
In Attracting New Mining Investment Into The Country And Ensuring The
Maximum Contribution To National Economy. There Were Three Main



Constraints In The Government Related To: A Lack Of Strategy On New Topics
(E.G., Sustainability, Small Scale Mining, Offshore Mining, And Mine
Closure); Insufficient Capacity In Public Mining Institutions (DMR And
IRC) To Negotiate New Agreements And Audit, Regulate, And Administer The
Mining Industry; And Inability To Update And Provide Geological Data
Needed To Attract New Exploration.Investments For Mineral Exploration In
The Country Have Steadily Declined Over The Past Decade From US$ 83.2
Million To US$ 12.0 Million Since 1988

New Guineagold And Copper Productions From 1970s Are Presented At Table
3. The Production Of These Metals Had Constantly Increased In 1970s To
80s Because Of The Development Of Ok Tedi, Porgera, And Misima.    After
The Closure Of The Bougainville Copper Mine, However, The Copper
Production In The Country Began To Decrease. There Were Major Increases
In Gold Production In The Early 1990s And In The Late 1990s With The
Opening Of The Porgera Mine And The Lihir Mine Respectively. However,
Gold Production Will Be Impacted In The Early 2000s With The Planned
Closure Of The Misima Mine. The Large Ok Tedi Mine Has Not Been Able To
Achieve The Compliance Criteria Set By Government And Recent Work On Mine
And Tailings Waste Disposal Arrangements (Including A Two Year Dredging
Project) Has Not Achieved The Desired Results. As A Result The Future Of
The Large Ok Tedi Mine Is Presently In Question Due To Harmful
Environmental Impacts And The Shareholders And The Government Are
Presently Examining Possible Options Including Early Mine Closure.Table 3,

STRATEGY: The Strategy Of The Government Of Papua New Guinea Is To
Develop The Private Mining Industry By Encouraging Socially,
Environmentally, Technically, And Financially Responsible Private Sector
Exploration And Development Of PNG's Mineral Resources. More Recently The
Strategy Has Eveolved To Encourage Environmentally And Socially
Sustainable Developmenthowever, The Major Constraint To Further Sector
Growth Is The Lack Of The Institutional Capacity Of Dom And IRC To
Administer And Oversee The Sector.    In Particular, Dom And IRC Need To
Establish A Stronger Presence At The Mining Sites, And Dom Needs To
Produce Position Papers On Certain Key Topics Such As Small Scale Mining
And Mine Closure And To Negotiate New Project Development Agreements For
New Private Sector Mining Investment That Encourages Sustainable
Development. The Government Is Therefore Seeking To Maintain And Increase
Mining Sector Investment By Creating Favorable Conditions Through The
Removal Of Constraints For The Private Sector Development; To Improve The
Contribution Of Mining To Sustainable Development In PNG; And To Provide
Timely And Reliable Administrative Services To The Mining Sector.In
Response To This Situation, The Government Has Strategies To:Develop
Mining Sector By Actively Encouraging Socially, Environmentally,
Technically, And Financially Sustainable Manner;Develop Rural Areas By
- 2 -



Overseeing And Facilitating Small-Scale Mining To Take Place In An Orderly
Way; Andpromote Private Sector Mineral Exploration And Facilitate
Infrastructure Development By Updating And Publishing New Geological And
Geochemical Maps, Reports, And Database Products.Therefore, The Government
Is Seeking To Create Favorable Conditions For Mineral Investments Through
(A) Filling In Key Gaps In Mining Policy; (B) Improving Its Ability To
Provide Timely And Reliable Regulatory Oversight For The Mining Sector;
And (C) Updating And Providing Geological Data To Attract Potential
Investors.
2. Objectives
The Main Objective Of The Proposed Project Is To Strengthen Institutional
Capacity Within The Department Of Mining (Dom) And The Internal Revenue
Commission (IRC) To Administer And Regulate Exploration And Mining
Projects And To Achieve Socially And Environmentally Sustainable Private
Mineral Investment In The PNG's Mining Sector. The Project Will Provide
Technical Assistance, Including, In Particular, To:Review And Develop
Mineral Policy, Regulations, And Mining Development Contract Including
Interface Between Public And Private Mining Sectors, Ngos, And Local
Communities;Conduct Field Audits Of Exploration And Mining
Projects;Improve Environmental Compliance And Sustainable Development
Benefits From Mining;Address The Issue Of Mine Closure And Its Impact On
Local Communities And The Broader Macro Economy;Improve Mine Safety And
Investigate Accidents;Improve The Availability Of Geological Data For
Potential Mineral Investors;Conduct Tax Audits Of Mining And Petroleum
Companies; Andestablish Effective Inter-Relationships Between Different
Government Agencies Regarding Tax Collection, Environment Management, And
So Forth.If Successfully Implemented, The Project Will Assist The
Government Of PNG To:Attract More High Risk Exploration And Mining
Development Capital Expenditures From International And Domestic Private
Investors; Improve The Benefits To The Nation Especially Through Increased
Employment And Skills Transfers Especially To Rural Areas;Improve
Environmental Performance;Achieve Safer Exploration And Mining Operations;
Andincrease Tax Collections At A Time When Revenue Collection Is A
Critical Country Priority.Mining Sector Experience Could Be Especially
Helpful For The Country In Learning How To Investigate, Audit, Regulate,
Manage, And Promote Other Natural Resources Related Sectors. Therefore,
Valuable Lessons For Other Sectors, Especially, Logging, And Fisheries,
Are Also Expected.
3. Rationale For Bank's Involvement
The Bank Has A Strong Track Record For Mining Sector Reform TA Projects.
As Of December 31, 1999 The Portfolio Consisted Of Nine Mining Sector
Reform TA Projects, All Of Which Were Rated Satisfactory. The Bank Can
Thus Provide Extensive And Positive Experience Regarding Mining Sector
Reform In Other Countries. In Addition, The Bank Is In A Unique Position
To Integrate Mining Sector Reform With Broader Macro Economic And Fiscal
Management Issues And Ensure Results Are Shared With Other Sectors. The
Bank Has Followed The Development Of The PNG Mining Sector Over The Past
Decade And Knows Both Dom And IRC Very Well And Is Positioned To Ensure
That Institutional Strengthening Takes Place In A Fully Consistent Manner
And Is Integrated With Larger Institutional Reforms In PNG. The Bank's
Presence Will Also Help Protect Dom And IRC From Possible Political
Interference.

Project Component 3
Strengthening Of Departmental Mineral Tenements Management -
The Mining Act 1992 Requires That Old Leases, Which Had Been Issued Under
The Previous Repealed Act, Be Converted To New Leases. There Exists,
However, A Large Backlog In Tenement Conversions Due To The Limited
Capacity Of The Department To Survey The Old Leases For The Transfer.
This Has Significantly Affected New Exploration And Mine Development
Investments In Some Areas, Because New Leases Cannot Be Issued Until The
Location Of Existing Leases Can Be Defined By Survey. This Component
Entails: 1) Development Of A Strategic Action Plan For Lease Conversions;
2) Execution Of Field Assessments To Determine Whether Existing Leases Are
Active And Effectively Utilizing The States Mineral Resources; 3)
Cadastral Boundary Survey Definition Will Be Carried Out To Meet The
Requirements Of Lease Transfer For Those Leases Which Are To Remain In
Force; 4) Lease Boundary Definitions Will Be Input Into The Departmental
Database For Plotting And Verification.
The Department Of Mining Presently Maintains These Lease Documentation In
Paper Registers.    Some Information Including Lease Boundary Descriptions
Are Entered Into An Antiquated Computer Database For Plotting. Updating
Into An Integrated Lease Management System Linked To The Departments
Central GIS Is Required In Order To Facilitate Lease Management Into The
Future. This Component Also Involves: 1) Development Of A Mineral
Tenements Management Database With Sufficient Security Features To Ensure
Data Integrity Which Incorporates All Aspects Of Tenement Administration
Required Under The Mining Act 1992; And 2) Integration Of The Tenements
Database Into The Departmental GIS System.
Mining Wardens Are Responsible For The Collection Of Public Input Into The
Licensing Procedure And For The Determination Of The Quantum Of Payments
To Be Made In Compensation Claims Against Exploration And Mining
Companies. The Wardens Are Required To Have A Working Knowledge Of Mining
And Land Law As Well As A Knowledge Of Appropriate Values For Damages In
Addition To Skills Such As Investigation Of Claims And Judicial
Inquiries. The Wardens Require Training And Exposure To Established
Systems To Assist In Strengthening Their Ability To Deliver The Required
Services In Papua New Guinea.
Provisions Of This Component Will Include The Financing Of A Land
Surveying Company To Carry Out Lease Boundary Surveys; Incremental
Operating Costs Related To Travel And Training; Purchase Of Specialized

Survey Software And Computer And Plotting Equipment.
Project Component 4
Development Of Project Coordination And Environmental Assessment Capacity
For Sustainable Development In Mining Project Areas -
Mining Projects Cause Significant Social, Economic, And Environmental
Change In Often Remote Rural Areas Where Land Ownership Is Under Customary
Title. Managing This Change And Ensuring That Project Benefits Are
Channeled Into Ultimately Sustainable Development Activities Which Can
Sustain Local Communities Beyond Mine Life Is The Function Of The Project
Coordination Branch Of The Department Of Mining. The Provision Of Advice
On The Environmental Effects Of Mining And Their Impacts On These Same
Social Issues Is The Function Of The Environmental Resource Scientists In
The Project Assessment Branch Of The Department. Managing The Process Of
Social Change And Maintaining An Harmonious Operating Environment For The
Mine Developer Are Critical To The Long Term Success And Continuity Of All
Mining Projects. This Requires That Coordinators Have A Wide Range Of
Skills Including Basic Social And Economic Knowledge Of Exploration And
Mining Projects, Environmental Impacts, Negotiation And Mediation, Land
Management, Communication, Business Management, Accounting And Financial
Skills, And A Knowledge Of Development Economics. Training Is Required In
All Of These Areas For Project Coordinators And Liaison Officers.
Environmental Resource Scientific Staff Also Require Assistance And
Training Opportunities In Order For The Environmental Effects Of Mining On
Communities To Be Adequately Appreciated And Accommodated In The
Development Process. The Technical Assistance Project Will Assist With A
Training Needs Analysis Followed By Training And Skills Development Of
Coordinators And Resource Scientists In All Of The Above Fields As
Appropriate To The Needs Of Each Staff Member. Provisions Of This
Component Will Include The Financing Of International And Local
Consultants And Trainers, Environmental Workshops With An International
Component, And Incremental Operating Costs Related To Travel And
Training. The Component Will Also Support Workshops And Conferences
(Including A Follow-Up To The 1999 Madang Conference On Mining And The
Community). Department Of Mining Will Take The Lead In Organizing Such
Events To Involve All Interested Stakeholders, Provincial Governments And
Other Government Departments. In Particular, This Will Support Dom In
Addressing How Mining Development Can Better Contribute To Poverty
Alleviation And Rural Development In PNG. Studies Will Also Be Undertaken
To See The Extent To Which Compensation Benefits Reach The Most Needy
Members Of The Community And All Segments Of The Community Are Adequately
Represented In Consultation And Negotiations With Project Developers And
Operators. Regional Plans For One Or Two Mining Areas Will Be Developed
In A Fully Participatory Manner Involving Local Communities And Provincial
Government Officials. These Activities Should Lead To The Strengthening
Of Government Institutional Capacity In This Regard So That Mining
Development Is Better Integrated Into Overall Rural And Regional
Development.
Project Component 5

Rationalization Of The Geological Units Present In Papua New Guinea And
The Completion Of A Programme To Digitise The Existing 1:250,000 And
1:100,000 Series Geological Maps Of Papua New Guinea Are Essential. To
Date The Australian Geological Survey Organization (AGSO) Has Digitised
The PNG Lithological Polygons From The 1:250,000 Map Series. Structural
And Point Data Remain To Be Digitised. This Process Has Highlighted A
Considerable Number Of Map Boundary Mismatches Showing Different
Geological Units Which Need To Be Rationalised Prior To The Completion Of
A Nationwide Digital Geology Of PNG. This Project Sub-Component Will
Necessarily Involve: 1) The Development Of A National Lithostratigraphic
Lexicon And Database; 2) The Completion Of Digitisation Of The 1:250,000
Geological Map Series; And 3) The Production Of A National Standard For
Geological Map Legends; 4) Resolution Of The Existing Edge-Matching

5.2   Development Of A Geological Information System
An Essential Tool For Public Institutions In Mining As Well As In Other
Land Use, Environmental Management Activities And, More Generally, In
Society Development Is Open And Efficient Access To Accurate And Reliable
Geological Information. Today, This Can Be Best Achieved Through Modern
Information Technology, Including Electronic Communication And Development
Of An Integrated Set Of GIS-Related Geo-Data Banks. Department Of Mining
Holds A Large Number Of Maps, Technical Reports And Geological,
Geochemical And Geophysical Data Generated By The Institution Or By Mining
Companies. However, Most Of The Information Is In A Hard Copy Format And
Is Not Easily Available To Potential Users. This Has Negatively Affected
The Information Services The Department Should Provide To Its Clients,
Including Mining Investors. In Order To Achieve This Development Goal,
This Component Will Make Use Of State Of The Art Technology To Gather,
Store And Provide Information To A Wide Range Of Clients In A Timely
Fashion. It Will Help Department Of Mining To (I) Develop An Information

Project Component 6
Institutional Strengthening And Capacity Building For IRC -
The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC), Through The Resources Monitoring
Division, Carries Out Audits Of Mining And Petroleum Companies To Collect
Revenues. The Current Capacity Within IRC, However, Restricts It To
Undertaking Assessments Of Financial Records Of The Companies As
Provided. No Field Audits Are Carried Out. Significant Legislative Work
Has Been Done To Cope With The Conditions Which Apply To The Companies In
The Country. In Order To Provide IRC With Long Term Auditing Capacity To
Enhance The Country's Revenue Base, This Project Component Supports IRC
To: 1) Determine Areas To Be Scrutinized And Its Effect To The Revenue;
2) Carry Out Several Pilot Audits To Assess The Results; And 3) Draft
Guidelines For Future Audits. This Project Component Will Be Implemented

Accounting Financial Reporting And Audits: The Financial Reporting And
Accounting System Of The The Implementing Agency Has Been Reviewed In
Accordance With The Bank's Requirements. A Consultant Has Conducted The
Assessment. Based On The Assessment An Appropriate Financial Management
System Will Be Developed. An Accounting Firm Or Consultant Acceptable To
The Bank Will Be Engaged, In Accordance With The Terms Of Reference
Acceptable To The Bank, To Develop The Project Financial Management System
To Ensure Compliance With The Bank's Financial Management Requirements
Including Accounting Procedures, Internal Controls And Audit. The System
Will Be In Place By Decemebr 31, 2000. An Accountant Will Be Recruited By
The PCIU To Be Responsible For The Project Accounting. Additionally, A
Local Accounting Firm Will Be Engaged To Help Prepare Monthly And
Quarterly Financial Statements. Annual Audit Of Project Financial
Statements, Statements Of Expenditure And Special Account Will Be
Conducted By Independent Auditors Acceptable To The Bank And Audit Reports
Will Be Furnished To The Bank Not Later Than Six Months After The End Of
Each Fiscal Year. It Is Proposed To Use The Traditional Method Of
-9-



Disbursement, However, Within A Year After Loan Effectiveness A Review
Will Be Conducted And A Determination Made As To Whether To Adopt PMR
Based Disbursement. Monitoring And Evaluation: Not Later Than 45 Days
After Each Quarter, The PCU Will Submit To The Bank Quarterly Progress
Reports Covering All Project Activities, Including Procurement, And A
Financial Summary Report A Mid-Term Review, 24 Months After
Effectiveness, Would Provide Detailed Analysis Of Implementation Progress
Towards Development Objectives, Including Performance To Date On Selected
Indicators Of Project Benefits (See 3-I And 3-Ii). Baseline Data On These
Indicators Will Be Gathered Prior To The Mid-Term Review And Used In The
Assessment. The Mid-Term Review Will Address The Sustainability Of Dom
Activities Under The Project Including Government Deliberations In Regard
To Dom Becoming A Statutory Agency.
7. Sustainability
The Successful Establishment Of The Strategy And Development Of The
Institutional Capacity Should Result In Increased Mineral Investments For
Exploration And Better Tax Collection. Increased Fiscal Revenues To The
Government Will Benefit All Public Sector Institutions Including Dom And
IRC. While International Metals Prices And Exploration And Investment Are
Presently Low, This Is A Highly Cyclical Industry And Recovery Can Be
Expected In The Next 3-4 Years. The Project Thus Will Help Position The
Country To Take Full Advantage When That Upturn Occurs. The Project Will
Help Strengthen The Capabilities Of Dom And IRC And Better Enable Them To
Resist Political Interference. Bank Support For Dom Becoming A Statutory
Authority Will Help The Recurrent Budget And Skills Retention For Dom To
Its Activities Since Dom Will Be Able To Retain Part Of The Fees They
Collect.
8. Lessons Learned From Past Operations In The Country/Sector
Lessons Have Been Learned From The Ongoing Activities Being Carried Out
Under The PNG Petroleum Technical Assistance Project Where The Importance
Of An Adequate Recurrent Budget Has Been Highlighted. Lessons From
Projects From Other Countries Where The Bank Has Financed Mining Technical
Assistance Projects (E.G., Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ghana, Tanzania,
Madagascar, Mauritania, Ecuador, And Argentina) And From A Recent Bank
Paper On Mining Sector Reform In Latin America (A Mining Strategy For
Latin America And The Caribbean, World Bank Technical Paper No. 345,
1996). The Main Lessons Learned From Similar Projects And Reflected In
The Project Design Include: (A) Sector-Specific Focus And Improvements
With Clear Delineation Of Authority And Responsibility Of Different
Ministries And Agencies Involved In The Sector; (B) Strong Beneficiary
Participation In Project Preparation, And Organization And Coordination At
The Field Level; (C) Supervision By Technical Specialists; And (D)
Ownership And Political Commitment To Project Objectives And To Ensure
Strong Local Leadership And Availability Of Counterpart Funds.Experience
In Other Countries Indicates That Improving The Enabling Environment Can
Increase The Ability Of A Country To Attract And Retain Appropriate
Private Investment. For Instance, Ghana In Late 1980s Undertook
Significant Reforms, Supported By The Bank And Other Donors, To Improve
The Enabling Environment For Private Sector Investment In Mining. The
Result Has Been A Four Fold Increase In Gold Production, A Mining
Investment Climate That Is Consistently Ranked Among The Best In The World
By Investors, And Privatization Of State Owned Mining Enterprises.
Argentina In The 1990s Undertook Similar Reform And Now Attracts More

9. Program Of Targeted Intervention (PTI)     N
10. Environment Aspects (Including Any Public Consultation)
Issues        All Of The Large Mining Projects In PNG Are Subject
To Specific Contractual And Regulatory Environmental Performance
Requirements. The Contractual Requirements Are Included In Agreements
Between The Project Sponsor And The Government Which Are Typically
Negotiated During The Mining License Approval Process (When There Is A
"Forum" Between All Of The Interested Government Departments And The
Investor). There Is A High Degree Of Information Disclosure And
Consultation With Affected Peoples ("Land Owners") In PNG Mining Projects.
The Projects Are Operated By International Mining Companies Who Operate In
Line With Good International Practice And Face Serious Reputational Risk
If Compliance Is Not Achieved With Agreed Requirements. (By Contrast
There Is Little Such Regulatory Requirements, Consultation Or Disclosure
In The PNG Forestry Sector). The Major Environmental Impacts For Mining
Projects In PNG Relate Mostly To River And/Or Ocean Based Mining Waste And
Tailings Disposal. There Are Some Gold Processing And Refining Plants
Which Do Not Have Any Serious Environmental Impacts. The Government Does
Not Consider There Are Any Serious Problems Of Non-Compliance At Any Of
The Mining Operations With The Exception Of Ok Tedi Where The
Environmental Mitigation Measures Have Failed To Prevent The River-Based
Waste And Tailings Systems Causing Serious Environmental Harm. With
Regard To Social Mitigation, There Has Been No Involuntary Relocation.
There Are Project-Related Social And Environmental Agreements Bilaterally
Between The Company And The Landowners And The Government And The
Landowners (As Well As Agreements Between The Government And The
Company). These Agreements Address Matters Such As Employment,
Contracting From Local Sources, Project Impacts, Compensation, Provision
Of Infrastructure And Social Services. Considerable Progress Has Been
Made Regarding Social Issues And Today The Landowners Are Very Well
Organized And Well Able To Deal With Project Developers And Operators. A
Conference On Mining And The Community Was Organized In Madang, PNG In
1998 Co-Sponsored By The World Bank, Metal Mining Agency Of Japan,
Government Of PNG And The PNG Chamber Of Mines. The Case Studies
Presented At This Conference Demonstrated That Papua New Guinea Has Become
A World Leader In Dealing With Social And Community-Related Issues In
Mining Projects And With Designing Compensation Schemes.     Social And
Environmental Assessments Of The The Mining Sector Were Conducted During
Project Preparation. The Social Assessment Found That While There
Remains Considerable Room For Further Progress, Overall A Good Amount Of
Progress Has Been Made Regarding Social Issues And Today The Landowners
Are Very Well Organized And Well Able To Deal With Project Developers And
Operators. In Particular, The Arrangements For The Ramu Project (Which
Was Submitted To The Government For Approval In Late 1999) Which Include
Establishment Of A Ramu Regional Planning Committee Seem Very Promising.
The Environmental Assessment Found That With The Exception Of The Special
Case Of Ok Tedi, There Is Generally Satisfactory Environmental Performance
At The Various Projects. However, Improvements In The Regulatory And
Institutional Arrangements And Oversight Of The Sector Have Been Limited.
A New Environmental Law Has Been Drafted With Assistance From Aus Aid.
The Project Should Help Provide Some Institutional Strengthening Which Is
Expected To Have A Positive Impact On The Environment. This Includes

Environmental-Related Workshops And Conferences With Major Stakeholders
And Training Activities For Both Dom And OEC Staff. These Activities Will
Improve The Skills And Capabilities Of Dom And OEC Staff To Conduct
Technical Field Audits Of Mining Projects And To Investigate Mine Safety
And Environmental Compliance. The TA Project Will Contribute To Improve
Both Environmental And Social Aspects Of Mining Projects In PNG, By
Providing Workshops With All The Major Stakeholders And By Providing
Training For Both Dom And OEC Staff On Social And Environmental Issues.
In Addition, The Work On A Standardized Mining Development Contract Should
Also Help Improve The Treatment Of Environmental And Social Issues. The
Project Is An Institutional Strengthening Operation That Is Expected To
Have A Positive Impact On The Environment By Strengthening Dom And IRC To
Conduct Field Audits Of Mining Projects And To Investigate Mine Safety And
Environmental Compliance. It Will Not Involve Any Direct Investment In
Mining Activities And, Therefore, Could Be Considered To Be Classified As
Category "C" Operation. However, Although The Project Will Have No Direct
Impacts, The Sector Itself Does Have Significant Impacts On The
Environment And In The Case Of OK Tedi These Remain Highly Controversial.
Taking This Into Account, The Project Is Given A Category "B"
Classification.

Annex
Because this is a Category B project, it may be required that the borrower
prepare a separate EA report. If a separate EA report is required, once it
is prepared and submitted to the Bank, in accordance with OP 4.01,
Environmental Assessment, it will be filed as an annex to the Public
Information Document (PID) .
If no separate EA report is required, the PID will not contain an EA annex;
the findings and recommendations of the EA will be reflected in the body of
the PID.
