satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            1) Engaging with Women's groups can help achieve\n            improved development outcomes in a sector such as mining; 2)\n            Technical Assistance and Capacity Building are a multi-year\n            activity that may not be completed and all the available\n            development outcomes achieved within the life of a single\n            project; 3) Technical Assistance projects can have\n            significant outputs and outcomes if well designed; 4)\n            Technical assistance projects also need to be realistic and\n            not too ambitious in scope; 5) The project provides a good\n            example of the importance to approach sector reform in an\n            integrated, instead of a piecemeal, way; 6) Commitment and\n            buy-in from an early stage by sectoral counterparts is\n            essential for regulatory/legal/institutional reform and\n            subsequent sustainability; 7) Good projects can also be\n            highly susceptible to changes in oversight authority; 8)\n            Sustainability of Project Components requires a Champion;\n            and 9) There needs to be more concerted effort on the part\n            of all Government Agencies responsible for project\n            implementation to ensure that staffing is adequate to meet\n            the objectives of the project."}, "docdt": "2007-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
