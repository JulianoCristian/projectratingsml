Approximately 50,000 new customers\n            are to be served. It represents the least cost solution to\n            meet the needs of projected load growth in this period,\n            provides much needed rehabilitation for existing systems and\n            includes an energy loss study and technical assistance to\n            increase the efficiency of IRHE's distribution\n            operations. The project works consist of: installation of\n            sub-transmission lines and feeders; distribution systems,\n            including primary and secondary circuits, distribution\n            transformers, street lamps, and meters; metering equipment;\n            and consulting services."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
