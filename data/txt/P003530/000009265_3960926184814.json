Specific policy,\n            institutional and technological objectives will also be\n            addressed. Specifically, the Shaanxi Provincial Highway\n            Project will provide for the construction of a new 67km\n            highway connecting Sanyuan with the city of Tongchuan and\n            consulting services to help train Shaanxi Provincial\n            Transport Department (SPTD) staff in the supervision and\n            quality control of the highway construction. Also, the\n            project will fund the expansion and improvement of the rural\n            road network in southern Shaanxi.  The existing road\n            pavements will be evaluated, to assist in preparation of a\n            program for road strengthening, betterment and maintenance.\n            Technical assistance will be provided to SPTD in improved\n            road planning, including the establishment of a computerized\n            road data bank and staff training."}, "docdt": "1988-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
