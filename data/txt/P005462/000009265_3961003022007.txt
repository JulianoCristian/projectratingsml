MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
OF A rkOPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND LARGE-SCALE IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Kingdom of Morocco for the equivalent
of US$215 million to help finance a project for the nationwide rehabilitation of
the large-scale irrigation systems and associated management and policy reforms
with a view to increasing efficiency, providing better resource allocation and
ensuring long-term sustainability of the subsector. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including
five years of grace.
2.          Background.  Large-scale irrigation (LSI) covers 485,000 ha, which
is 6 percent of the total cultivated area in Morocco, and contributes about 20
percent of the value of the total agricultural output by producing a variety of
cash and food crops. Most of the LSI schemes were created during the last forty
years as the centerpiece of the Government's strategy to modernize traditional
agriculture, overcome erratic rainfall distribution and reduce food imports.
They rely on modern irrigation technologies for year-round irrigation. Farms are
predominantly of a small size (3.9 ha on average) and half of the 125,000 farmers
engaged in LSI hold less than 2 ha.   The schemes are operated by nine
parastatals, the Regional Authorities for Agricultural Development (ORMVAs),
placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform
(MARA) and the Ministry of Finance for technical and financial aspects,
respectively. The ORMVAs have a wide range of responsibilities covering systems
operation and maintenance (O&M) and support services to farmers (agricultural
extension, in particular).
3.          As a whole, LSI development has been successful in promoting modern
irrigated agriculture, reducing rural out-migration, raising incomes and
increasing food production and yields.   The ORMVAs have demonstrated their
capacity to construct and operate sophisticated facilities and provide farmers
with technical and logistical assistance.   However,  this relatively good
performance was achieved at the cost of heavy public investments to create modern
facilities, substantial recurrent subsidies to compensate for insufficient cost
recovery and excessive ORNVA involvement iA budget-draining commercial
activities.
4.          With a legal framework enacted in 1969 for recovering 100 percent of
O&M costs and up to 40 percent of the initial investment cost, Morocco is a
*        leader in this field among developing countries.  However, Government focus on
rapidly developing new irrigated areas during the seventies combined with the
soaring energy costs of pumping water following the oil crisis were reflected in
*        inadequate implementation of this legal framework, resulting in insufficient
water charges and a low attention to their full billing and recovery. In 1985,
about one third of the water delivered to users was not billed and less than two
thirds of the amount billed was recovered by the ORMVAs.   Increasing cost
recovery, therefore, became a central objective for subsequent Bank-supported
irrigation projects and sectoral adjustment loans.
5.          Government priority  in LSI  shifted  in the mid-eighties  from
irrigation expansion through construction of new systems to rehabilitation of
existing investments.   Although this shift primarily resulted from a sharp
contraction of the funds available for public investments due to a budget crisis,
it also reflected the need to address the issue of deteriorating irrigation



-2 -
facilities. Government realized that, beyond the emergency repair in the most
deteriorated infrastructure, time had come to replace the distribution systems
of more than 30 years of age and pumping equipment older than 15 years.
Furthermore, to meet the growing demand for water, it became clear that most of
the main canals had to be upgraded by taking advantage of the modern technology
for automatic flow control.
6.          The First LSI Improvement Project.  The first Large-Scale Irrigation
Improvement Project (LSII-1), approved by the Bank in 1986 and supported by a
loan of US$46 million (Loan 2656-MOR), was designed to implement priority
rehabilitation works while initiating a comprehensive reform program to increase
LSI overall efficiency and cost recovery. In addition to repairing, replacing,
upgrading or completing the most deteriorated components of the existing LSI
schemes, a set of policy reforms was launched, including OKMVA divestiture from
commercial activities, increase of water charges and streamlining relations
between the ORMVAs and the Government. Another objective was to enhance ORMVA
management capabiM 4 ty through reorganization and introduction of improved
techniques for cost accounting, O&M and agricultural extension.  Five months
before the loan closing date (June 30, 1993), the physical component, have been
completed, the policy reforms satisfactorily implemented and the loan almost
entirely disbursed. Partial but promising results have been achieved for ORMVA
management improvement with the installation of new management information
systems (MIS) approaching completion in four ORMVAs, and the introduction of
computer-assisted electrical and mechanical maintenance methods which is ongoing
in five ORMVAs.
7.          Improved cost recovery was also an important result of the reform
package implemented under LSII-1. Following the indexation of water charges for
inflation, the billing of the entire volume delivered and the sharp increase in
the average collection rate up to 74 percent in 1991 and 79 percent in 1992, the
total amounts recovered by the ORMVAs soared from DH liO million in 1985 to 410
million in 1992, a remarkable performance. However, at the level set by the
Government, the water charges cover on average only 85 percent of the actual
direct O&M costs, although in some ORKVAs water charges have significantly
exceeded O&M costs. Raising the level of water charges to conform with the
current legislation through new regulations and taking a first step to address
the issue of the growing intersectoral competition for water would be a primary
focus of LSII-2.
8.          Lessons Learned from Prevlous Bank Involvement in LSI.  The ORMVAs
have a long standing, high capacity record for implementing infrastructure, as
is evidenced by the Bank-financed Doukkala I and II projects (Loans 1201- and
1416 MOR) approved in 1976 and 1977, respectively, and underscored in a 1989 OED
impact study (Report No. 7876). The LSII-1 Project has been equally successful
in this respect.   Through its long association with the Bank's portfolio in
Morocco, the Directorate for Rural Equipment (DER) has also developed the
capacity for handling institutional and policy issues associated with
Bank-financed projects. Audits of LSII-1 accounts were satisfactorily carried
out by external auditors.    The Government also demonstrated its commitment
through policy reforms aimed at ensuring overall LSI sustainability. However,
experience has shown the difficulty of implementing in a relatively short period
in-depth and comprehensive restructuring of nine separate public authorities
- the ORNVAs - operating under a variety of physical and social factors. Another
lesson from LSII-1 implementation is the difficulty that the Bank faces to ensure
the efficient supervision of such complex restructuring operations involving nine
entities at different stages of development and scattered over the entire
rnitntrv  The nronnsed LSTT-2 wotuld take advantaae of the main lessons drawn from



the first project, namely the need to focus on a limited number of objectives,
reduce the number of central directorates involved in the operations, establish
& strong interdisciplinary project secretariat, mobilize adequate technical
assistance, and set up appropriate performance monitoring systems. The proposed
project would also allocate a realistic time span for all nine ORMVAs to
implement the reforms. On the Bank side, resources devoted to supervision of
LSII-2 are expected to be above Bank averages.
9.          Relationship to Bank Country Assistance Strategy.   The proposed
project fits well within the country assistance strategy for Morocco discussed
in t.e Board on February 2, 1993. Through its substantial institution-building
component, the proposed project would contribute directly to the improvement of
public sector resource management,  a key element of the Bank's assistance
strategy. Two other elements of the strategy, developing the private sector and
alleviating poverty, would also be significantly, if less directly, served by the
project. In particular, additional ir.nome-generating potential afforded by the
development of irrigated agriculture attracts, and subsequently benefits, the
rural poor.   This effect is expected to operate most strongly in the areas
covered by the Ouarzazate and Tafilalet ORMVAs where rural poverty is most acute.
In addition, the project addresses several sector-wide policy issues, such as
tariff adjustments to promote more efficient water resource use and the
implementation of environmental management and monitoring plans. The needs of
poor rainfed farmers are being addressed in several existing projects and an
upcoming project specifically focusses on rural poverty.
10.         Proiect Objectives.   The proposed Second Large-Scale Irrigation
Improvement Project (LSII-2) would continue to implement the same strategy as
LSII-1 with the long-term objective of making large-scale irrigation more
efficient, cost-effective and sustainable. LSII-2 J specific objectives would
be to:   (a) raise efficiency of water distribution in LSI systems through
rehabilitation of irrigation facilities and improved operation; (b) preserve
public investments in LSI through appropriate replacement and maintenance;
(c) reduce the fiscal burden of O&M activities in LSI by increasing cost recovery
from beneficiaries and strengthening ORMVA management capability; (d) enhance
efficiency of water use by irrigators through improved irrigation techniques and
appropriate on-farm investments; and (e) ensure environmental protection in the
LSI subsector by implementing environmental monitoring plans. The agricultural
development aspects in LSI areas, such as agricultural research and extension,
would be supported by a separate Bank-financed project (the Irrigated Areas
Agricultural Services Project - IAASP -), which has just recently been appraised
and which is intended for implementation in tandem with LSII-2.
11.         Project Description.    The proposed project would include  the
following fou- components:  (a) infrastructure rehabilitation throughout the LSI
schemes, including the reconstruction of distribution systems on 52,000 ha,
upgrading of main canals serving 89,000 ha, improving subsurface drainage on
19,000 ha, rehabilitating feeder roads on 1060 km and replacing pumping equipment
serving 130,000 ha ; (b) institutional strengthening of the nine ORMVAs and DER,
including the provision of equipment, buildings, technical assistance and
training to: (i) improve management techniques associated with O&M, accounting
and environmental protection; (ii) establish a performance monitoring system, and
(iii) prepare studies on policy reforms; (c) water use efficiency improvement,
including pilot demonstrations of improved irrigation techniques, rehabilitation
of the water metering systems, and relevant on-farm investments; and (d) policy
reforms aimed at: (i) increasing cost recovery, (ii) streamlining the respective
roles of the Government, ORMVAs and farmers through management improvement plans
(MIPs), water delivery contracts and creation of iwater user associations, (iii)



.4.
increasing private sector participation in O&M activities, and (iv) updating LSI
institutional framework.
12.         Pro1ect Costs. Total project costs are estimated at US$367.3 million
equivalent including contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of
US$174.3 million. About 82 percent of total costs would be allocated to the
physical investments comprising civil works and equipment, 5 percent to technical
assistance and training, 8 percent to private on-farm investments and 5 percent
to other incremental costs.
13.         Proiect Financing.  The public investments supported by the project
would be financed by the Government (US$98 million) and the Bank (US$215 million)
with a contribution provided by  two ORNVAs  (US$35.3 million).    On-farm
investments required to improve irrigation techniques would be financed by
farmers (US$19 million) with credit provided by the banking system.   The
Government is seeking cofinancing from France (Caisse francaise de developpement
- CFD -) and Germany (Ireditanstalt ftir Wiederaufbau - KfW -) to finance
investments tentatively estimated at about US$23 million equivalent, permitting
an equivalent reduction in the Government's contribution.
14.         Proiect Implementagion.  The project would be implemented A_ver a
six-year period.  Overall responsibility for project implementation would be
vested with MARA and del gated to the nine ORNVAs for physical rehabilitation and
institution building as spelled out in a project agreement with each of the
0ORKVAs; DER would ensure project coordination and preparation of policy reforms.
Steps would be taken by the project to introduce innovative mechanisms for
monitoring ORMVA financial and environmental management by two interministerial
committees, while overall coordination would be reviewed by a National Committee
for Project Coordination (CNCP).
15.         Project Sustainability.   Enhancing the sustainability of the LSI
subsector is the key objective of the project.   The policy reforms and
institutional restructuring already implemented under LSII-l and those proposed
under LSII-2 should make a significant step towards effective system maintenance,
water resources conservation, environmental protection and fiscal transfer
reduction. Increasing water charges would make a decisive contribution to LSI
sustainability. In this respect, appropriate regulations would be made effective
by the Government before June 1995 to cover 100 percent of direct O&M costs and
a reasonable portion of the depreciation by all ORMVAs. In the mean time, the
average collection rate would be increased above 90 percent by the ORMVAs.
Increasing agricultural productivity and farmer capacity to pay for future
increases in water charges would become of a crucial importance and would be the
central objective of the parallel IAASP.
16.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Between 1965 and 1977, the Bank
supported the LSI subsector with six operations aimed at expanding the irrigated
area. The LSII-l Project supported the shift in Government priorities towards
rehabilitating and restructuring of existing LSI systems. BanLt involvement in
a Second LSI Improvement Project would carry on the effort to make irrigation
cost-effective and sustainable. The proposed project would continue to support
the policy reforms undertaken by LSII-l such as increasing the role of the
private sector, increasing ORMVA accountability and involving farmer associations
in O&M activities, and build upon the policy initiatives for the irrigation
subsector supported by the Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL-II)
such as increasing cost recovery.   By focusing on the ORMVAs'  strategic
management and public utility function, the proposed project would give the Bank
better leverage to overcome the most sensitive subsectoral issues associated with



the reduction of budget transfer, promotion of the private sector and
environmental protection. The water use efficiency component would be part of
the initiative that the Bank intends to support in Morocco for the
rationalizaXion of water resource management countrywide.
17.         Princinal Actions A8reed Upon.   Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that DER would: (a) hold a high level joint mid-term review; (b)
present by June 1994 and implement by June 1995 an action plan aimed at raising
water charges; (c) sign in a timely way MIPs with seven ORMVAs; and (d) adopt a
water management plan for the Souss aquifer.
18.         An agreement was reached that the Government would prepare and adopt,
after consultatioii with the Bank, a reform program to improve LSI long-term
sustainability, including the restructuring of the water tariff, improvement of
conditions for water delivery to farmers, adoption of a long-tevm rehabilitation
plan and revision of the LSI institutional framework.
19.         Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the ORMVAs would:
(a) prepare revolving three-year action plans; (b) employ consultants to assist
in the final design and supervision for rehabilitation works; (c) improve the
collection rate of water charges and allocate a reasonable portion of the
proceeds for financing rehabilitation under the project; (d) timely pay energy
bills to the electricity authority; (e) rehabilitate the metering systems for
on-farm water delivery; (f) complete in a timely way the introduction of improved
accounting and O&M procedures; and (g) implement environmental monitoring plans.
20.         Government concurrence was obtained on the signing of a project
agreement by the Bank and the nine ORNVAs as part of the legal documents. For
the first time, the Bank would establish a direct relationship with the ORMVAs,
reflecting the Government's and the Bank's desire to make the ORKVAs more
independent and accountable. This would enable them to start dealing directly
with financial institutions. An agreement was also reached in principle that the
Bank would consider, at the mid-term review and upon agreed criteria,
possibilities to provide for direct lending to ORNVAs that have achieved a
satisfactory level of financial viability and mapagement efficiency.
21.         Assignment of key staff for the project management unit and creation
of two interministerial committees to coordinate project implementation and
monitor ORMVAsI financial performance would be conditions of loan effectiveness.
22.         Environmental Aspects. The project was classified as falling within
Category "B" since it builds on existing irrigation facilities and improves
efficiency of water management.   In addition, it specifically addresses the
problems of waterlogging, soil salinity and water-borne diseases identified in
some areas during project preparation.   Provision has been made for the
implementation of environmental management and monitoring plans at both the ORMVA
and central levels.   Detailed guidelines are provided by the environmental
assessment prepared by consultants under Bank supervision and financed from the
Japanese Grant Fund.
23.         Project  Benefits.       Economic  benefits  would  accrue  from:
(a) incremental production resulting from increased water availability and
reliability due to infrastructure rehabilitation and improved system operation;
(b) savings on O&M costs (energy in particular) resulting from rehabilitation and
improved O&M procedures; (c) savings on transport costs due to roads
rehabilitation; and (d) other benefits resulting from more efficient on-farm
water use, delayed replacement due to improved maintenance, reduced budgetary



transfers and improved environment.l protection. Economic evaluation carried out
on the major subprojects for infrastructure rehabilitation, and representing
65 percent of the total cost of rehabilitation, indicates an economic rate of
return of 23 percent. Financial analysis confirms that farmers could finance the
required investment for improved water use and, with more efficient irrigation
techniques, pay higher water charges. In public finance terms, the ORMVAs would
finance the entire direct O&M costs at the end of the project and make a
significant contribution to infrastructure reh.iilitation.
24.         Risks.   The major risks in project implementation are delays in
system rehabilitation and institution building, but these risks are limited since
the proposed project carefully builds upon the experience of the previous LSII-l,
and because prepararion of the physical and institutional components is well
advanced. The risks of slower institutional srrengthening would be reduced by
the significant technical assistance component, new monitoring mechanisms being
established by DER, direct Bank dialogue with the ORMVAs through the project
agreement, close supervision by Bank missions and in-depth performance assessment
during a mid-term review. Government's commitment, demonstrated under LSII-1,
to increasing efficiency in the LSI subsector would have a determinant impact on
the project's satisfactory implementation.
25.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
