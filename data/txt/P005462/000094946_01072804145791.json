In addition, the objectives of technical\n            assistance, and studies should be specifically defined in\n            the terms of reference, water tariff restructuring, and\n            water fees collection should be firmly enforced by the\n            Government, and, water user associations should be part of\n            the overall institutional framework of large-scale\n            irrigation, with particular attention to the implementation\n            of an environmental monitoring plan, to launch potential\n            timely corrective actions."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
