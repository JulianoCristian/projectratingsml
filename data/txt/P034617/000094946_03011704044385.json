   of the project, i.e., highly satisfactory project outcome,\n            highly likely sustainability, and high institutional\n            development impacts, including a highly satisfactory Bank\n            performance, and satisfactory borrower performance.\n            Regardless of success, valuable lessons suggest the\n            following. Concerns during appraisal focused on the\n            financing of new acquisitions, liable to mismanagement\n            because of the weak parastatal organization, and,\n            alternatives presented included draining the lake, thus\n            abandoning the infrastructure, an alternative which would\n            have resulted in much higher economic and social costs in\n            the long run, while electricity production from thermal, and\n            other sources, were considerably more expensive. This led\n            the Bank to approve the project, but required the inclusion\n            of an institutional upgrading requisite, in the form of\n            sector restructuring, and management development, in\n            addition to strict adherence to a financial restructuring\n            plan, and compliance with covenant financial ratios,\n            measures which proved essential for the final success. The\n            intended project focus was primarily on the critical need to\n            repair, and rehabilitate the dam, however, the intense, and\n            decisive dialogues on sector reform, and its enforcement -\n            if needed - by means of disbursements suspension, resulted\n            in not only a timely completion of the physical\n            infrastructure, but in meeting as well the project's\n            institutional objective, that of resolving the operational\n            and financial management of the sector's principal\n            operator. And, the successful transfer of electricity, and\n            water supply services to private management came through a\n            sequence of institutional reforms."}, "docdt": "2002-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
