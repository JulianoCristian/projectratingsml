    Rehabilitation Project is to repair and rehabilitate the\n            Selingue facility to ensure that the major source of\n            electricity supply is not destroyed. Other objectives of the\n            project are to: 1) maintain the electricity demand-supply\n            balance by increasing the thermal capacity of the system and\n            implementing an energy efficiency program; 2) improve the\n            capacity of Energie du Mali (EDM) to properly operate,\n            maintain and supervise its power generation facilities; and\n            3) prepare a long-term institutional framework and\n            regulatory system for the power sector and implement it as\n            of 1999. The project consists of the following components:\n            1) rehabilitation of Selingue hydropower facility including\n            dam, power plant and transmission system; 2) maintenance of\n            the demand/supply balance which comprises the reinforcement\n            of the thermal capacity and an energy efficiency program; 3)\n            strengthening of EDM's management capacity; and 4)\n            long-term institutional framework."}, "docdt": "1996-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
