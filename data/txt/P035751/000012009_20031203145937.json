This would\n            be achieved by making private-sector and technical\n            assistance available to communities that own economically,\n            valuable forest lands, to help them manage their forest\n            resources in an ecologically, and financially sustainable\n            fashion. To this end, this initial environmental management\n            plan stipulates that any forest management initiative\n            supported by the project, should demonstrate compliance with\n            the environmental laws and regulations in Mexico, and\n            further specifies recognition of, and respect owed for any\n            legally documented, or customary land tenure and user\n            rights, as well as the rights of indigenous peoples, ethnic\n            groups, and workers. Mitigation measures are addressed as\n            follows. Areas larger than twenty hectares shall require a\n            simplified forest management plan, underlining that species\n            listed as endangered, should only be utilized under the\n            supervision of an established Environmental Management Unit.\n            Consequently, following a consultation process,\n            participatory forest management plans will be established in\n            accordance with stakeholders, communities, and local\n            governments. Subprojects will be subject to a screening\n            process, to evaluate potential adverse environmental\n            impacts, benefits or risks, prior to project appraisal.\n            Specific mitigation measures shall apply to areas of steep\n            slopes, of potential soil erosion, to riverine areas, and to\n            harvesting methods, as well as construction of forest roads.\n            Commercial harvesting operations will only be financed when\n            affected areas are not critical forests, or critical natural\n            habitats, and, certified by an independent forest authority.\n            Certification, though not legally required, will be\n            supported through the National Forest Fund."}, "docdt": "2003-11-15T17:07:04Z"}
