1. Projectdevelopment objective: (see Annex 1)

The general objective of PROCYMAF IIi s to assist indigenous communities1 and ejidos2 that
own forests in priority regions of Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoaciin, Oaxaca and Quintana
Roo to improve the management and conservation of their forest resources and to generate
alternative sources of income insustainable manner.

The project's specific objectives are (i) strengthen community institutions by means of the
                                                       to
consolidation of social capital and managementcapacity to improve the benefits flowing from use
of forest resources; (ii)to strengthen technical and administrative capacity of ejidos and
communities for the development of local and regional productive processes; (iii)                         to identify and
develop investment alternatives and productive diversification for communities and ejidos, and to
promote local and regional arrangementsto facilitate access by these communities to schemes for
payment for environmental services.

  Indigenous lands are recognized in Mexican law as belonging to indigenous communities and are legally titled to these
communities. There are an estimated 12 million indigenous people of many different ethnicities, based on the criterion of
speakingan indigenouslanguageinMexico innearly every State. Inindigenouscommunities, there are individual family farming
plotsallocatedby customarylaw as well as communallyheldland.
  An ejido is a land-holding consisting of either indigenous or non-indigenous members with rights, stipulated in law, in
communal resourcesunder which an individual family has a right to individual plot of land allocated by communaldecision as
well as access to communallyownedlands (oftenforest lands, pastureand watercourses).
  "Improved management" refers to the adoptionof management practices that contribute to the sustainable management of the
ecosystemin question. The project would not normally finance preparationof forest managementplans or UMAS because these
can be financedunder other CONAFOR programs, particularly PRODEFOR(qv.). However, such instruments can be considered
as products of the proposed project because the project catalyzes the preparation of such plans and will often help secure
CONAFORsupport for preparation.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-related CountryAssistanceStrategy (CAS) goalsupportedby the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 23849                   Dateof latest CAS discussion: 04/23/2002
The 2002 Mexico CAS, focuses on balancing growth and poverty reduction with environmental
protection. The CAS further states that Mexico needs to strengthen natural resource conservation
and management both to preserve environmental quality and to provide a more stable source of
income for forest owners. The total cost of natural resource and environmental depletion i s
estimated at about 10 percent of GDP. This includes the unsustainable depletion of forest
resources.

2. Mainsector issuesand Government strategy:
Of the 55.2 million ha of forested land in Mexico (FA0 2001), some 70 percent i s owned by
indigenous communities and ejidos (World Bank 1995).                                 Mexican land tenure has unique
characteristics in that since 1916, indigenous communities and ejido members (comuneros and
ejidatarios) have legaltitle (or legally recognizedrights) to their land and the natural resources on
them. Many of these communities are very poor andhave not had the tools to make good use of
the resources on their lands and many of them are still suffering from a legacy of exploitative
relations with State concessions. Policy makers have concluded that the only way to achieve the
conservation and sustainable management of Mexico's forest resources and other environmental
goods and services dependent on them (e.g., biodiversity, soil and water resources, sequestered
carbon, scenic beauty), i s by building the capacity of these communities to manage their own
resources. The alternative -- namely to seek to impose such changes through a system of
command and control -- i s not politically feasible nor i s it likely to be a successful strategy.

Untilsome twenty years ago, resourcesbelonging to many of these communities were subject to
private and parastatal concession contracts. In general, concessionaires managed communal
forests for maximum profit with little regard for long-term productivity, biological diversity
conservation, or other environmental externalities. They also continued a long-standing tradition
of exploiting indigenous communities with little regard for their traditions and their desire for
self-determination, exacerbating a legacy of distrust and resistance to outsiders. In many areas,
forested lands were converted to other uses (mainly agricultural production), exploited without
obtaining the necessary permits, contributing to a highrate of forest depletion which has recently
been estimated as high as 1.1percent of national forest cover (FA0 2001).

PROCYMAF Iwas the first project on a large scale to tackle the problem of empowering poor
communities to manage their own resources. By most measures, PROCYMAF Iwas successful
(see Annex 11). It demonstratedthat poor communities can generate significant income through
the sustainable management of natural resources. Departing from a more traditional production-
oriented approach to forestry, PROCYMAF Ifocused mainly on the forest-owning communities
and ejidos themselves, seeking to improve the capacity of villagers to make sound decisions and
helping raise living standards of the villagers through improved forest management. Until the
year 2000, most regulatory issues pertaining to forestry inMexico were handled by SEMARNAT,
the Environmental Secretariat and its enforcement arm, PROFEPA. In April 2001, the GOM
createdthe NationalForest Commission (CONAFOR) with abroadmandate to promote

applied including measures of interpersonal relationships, leadership, capacity for social action, levels of communication, capacity
to resolve conflict, and other measures. The baseline study would calibrate these variables for the type of community targeted by
the project and repeat the study using similar instruments to gauge change.

                                                                 3

sustainable production of forests and conservation of forest resources based on a Strategic
Forestry Program with a 25-year horizon, and a NationalForestry Program, (2001-2006). Among
the functions attributed to CONAFOR in its Charter are (a) stimulate the organization of forest
producers and assist them in the formation of associations under applicable legislation, and (b)
promote production forestry through support for viable projects that contribute to generating
employment and income in forest dwelling communities that have an aptitude for forest
production. The creation of CONAFOR, and its long-range plan, represents a powerful effort to
reverse the trend of natural resource depletion and to turn a national liability into a productive
asset. The environmental agency SEMARNAT, and its enforcement arm PROFEPA, remain
responsible for enforcement of environmental legislation and the National Biodiversity Council
(CONABIO) i s responsible for assuring conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. In
December 2002, Congress approved a Forestry Law, which provides a framework for long-term
planning efforts in the forest sector, primarily by strengthening and decentralizing institutions
aimingto protect andmanagethe forest resources.

CONAFOR has taken the lead in implementing a national forestry strategy. It is a decentralized
institution which maintains field offices in every state, created to encourage and support
conservation and forest production-related activities. These goals would be achieved through
long-term planning and by adopting standards of good governance, democracy, decentralized
management, transparency and accountability. CONAFOR has developed a long-termplan (PEF
2025)5 and a sectorial national program for the current administration, both for the development
of forest resources, and has launched a number of programs aimed at implementing these plans.
CONAFOR's Governing Body i s made up of representatives of various GOM Secretariats.6
CONAFOR's mandate follows Mexico's Strategic Forestry Plan and includes detailed guidelines
for sustainable management of forests, water, and soil.                           Through PROCYMAF Iand other
programs such as PRODEFOR and PRODEPLAN, CONAFOR offers important support in
environmental and forestry-related themes (see Box 1 for more details).                                     Its annual budget
approved for 2002 was 1,500 million pesos (approximately US$135 million).

The PROCYMAF Iproject made significant inroads in the areas where it operates, helping to
raise the area of forest under management plans.                               During the period from 1998-2003
PROCYMAF Ifinanced studies to develop Forest Management Plans for an estimated area of
127,690 ha. It also financed studies to update Forest Management Plans for an estimated area of
144,041 ha. Nevertheless, the rate andextent of deforestation and forest degradation inMexico in
general and particularly in areas yet untouchedby the PROCYMAF Iproject i s still unacceptably
high with negative implications for natural resource management. Inaddition, the efficiency of
timber and other forest-based industries i s low, particularly with respect to the forests under
communal and ejidu management.                         The importance of multiple use of forested areas i s
increasingly recognized as a responseto the generaleconomic deterioration inruralMexico.

       National Plan for Forestry Development 2025 active since June 2001, contains an analysis of the current situation and
establishes a strategic development plan for the forest sector until2025, and also establishes significant sectoral objectives. Some
o f these are: (a) to give priority to national economic strategy and national security in the forestry sector; (b) to strengthen the
capacity o f states and municipalities to manage their forest resources; (c) to integrate policies for sustainable use of forest
resources, watershed management, soil conservation, and biodiversity protection; (d) to promote community participation in
forestry projects; (e) to use economic instruments as incentives to conserve and restore ecosystems.

selectedits first group of subprojectsfor financing. Recentlyanationalcoordinator was named. Based
on recent discussions with the GOM, it was agreedthat the COINBIOproject would be moreclosely
linkedto the PROCYMAFproject andits National Coordinatorwill work within the CONAFOR
framework to assure complementarityandtake advantage of synergiesbetweenthe two programs.


It is widely agreed that diversification of income sources for the rural population is highly
desirable and that forest-based products can play a major role in achieving this. In addition,
attention has been given to the growing scarcity o f fresh-water supplies, conservation of protected
areas, conservation of biodiversity and the development of ecotourism. The G O M has officially
recognized that forests play important roles in the stabilization of ecosystems, and constitute an
important support for preserving biological diversity, contribute to air and water quality, help
conserve soils and have an effect on temperature regulation, Even more important, the policy has
shifted in favor of focusing on communities, not forest. Although it supports timber production,
PROCYMAF Iis primarily a people-centered project that aims primarily at improving the
economic and social well-being of the poor.

Indigenous people from communities are among Mexico's poorest people (see Table 1for data
on the numbers of indigenous people in the states which will be targeted under PROCYMAF 11:
Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoach, Durango, Jalisco and Quintana Roo).                    Many, perhaps most,
comuneros and ejiduturios are subsistence farmers, planting maize, beans, chiles and other crops
on hillsides.7 In absolute and relative terms, indigenous people have low levels of health and
educational attainment, poor housing and lower access to government services (Psachoropoulos
and Patrinos 1994). A CELADE report shows that 81 percent of indigenous people in Mexico
live below the poverty line, versus 18 percent o f the non-indigenous population. The indigenous
illiteracy rate in 1994, was 63 percent, versus 42 percent for the general population. Many
indigenous people and ejiduturios seek to overcome poverty by migrating to Mexico City and
other urbancenters and to North America, often as illegal migrant workers.

For many indigenous communities and ejidos, forest resources are the most marketable natural
resource they possess but, until the 1980s, these resources were either underutilized or virtually
plundered by outside concessionaires. Other natural resources controlled by communities and
ejidos include water, soils, and rare and endangered species. Traditional land-use patterns and
poverty have left the land relatively undegraded, particularly for communities located in
mountainous and other inaccessible areas. The importance of mountain and coastal forests and
the environmental services they provide has only recently been recognized.                 However, such
recognition has not yet led to the formation of markets for environmental services or
environmental services schemes. Thus, indigenous communities and ejidos often have little


                                                     6

capacity to take decisions regarding the resources on their lands and consequently were not able
to derive full benefit from the goods and services they own. Although indigenous communities
and ejidos have long traditions of communal resourcemanagementand have democratic decision-
makingprocedures, many are beset by poverty, out-migration, factional conflicts aggravatedby
party politics and religious schisms, and other problems that are corrosive to traditional social
structure.   There is also a legacy of government policies that leaves many communities
profoundly distrustful of new programs andpolicies. These difficulties also lower the capacity of
communities to take sound decisions regarding management of communally owned natural
resources.    The linkage between communal ownership, weakened organization and poorly
articulated markets made it mandatory to strengthen the social organization of indigenous
communities and ejidos as a precondition for better resource management and the acquisition of
technical knowledge required for competing inthe marketplace.

 3. Sector issuesto be addressed by the project andstrategic choices:
 The adoption of the World Bank Forest Policy (OPBP 4.36) in November 2002 provides a
 sound basis for proactive engagement with client countries to comprehensively address the
 challenges of forest management, conservation and sustainable development.                    The policy
 encourages the incorporation of forest issues inthe CAS and addresses the cross-sectoral impacts
 on forests as well as providing guidance for lending for forestry and conservation projects. It
 also encourages community forestry with consideration for social and poverty issues and it
 encourages the use of certificationas a means of assuring environmental quality.

 Among the general problems observed in Mexico's forests are a high rate of forest conversion
 (primarily to agriculture or grazing land, but also to roads, urban settlements and other uses), and
 unsustainably highdeforestation rates estimated at 250,000 hato 1.5 million haper year. FA0

 7There are some ejidos and some communities where modern agricultural practices are employed, producing for
 domestic and export markets.

                                                      7

estimated that the deforestation ratebetween 1981and 1991was approximately 678,000 haper
year. Assuming a constant rate of deforestation, absent replacement through reforestation, this
trend would lead to the conversion of half of Mexico's forests within 42 years, with likely highly
undesirable results for watershed functions, ecosystemstability, plus the global release of carbon
and loss of biological diversity. Even where forests are standing, poor management practices
have resulted inthe degradation of genetic quality and loss of regenerative capacity.

The communal owners of forest resources in Mexico have been ill-equipped to manage their
resources and to successfully market their products, especially as technology changes and
marketsbecome increasingly complex, globalized and competitive. Inmany cases, communities
andejidos have set up community enterprises (such as sawmills) to add value to timber butmany
of them have been operated inefficiently with considerable waste of raw materials. These
communities have also not been able to take advantage of non-timber forest products (NTFPs),
some of which have significant economic value and market potential (Wollenberg and Ingles
1999). Finally, although they have a traditional attachment to the forests, including a rich
spiritual tradition rooted in the forest, they have not, in general, had the capacity to conserve
natural areas that have both spiritual and material value (e.g., timber, NTFPs, environmental
services).

PROCYMAF Iand the proposed PROCYMAF IIseek to improve the capacity of communities
and ejidos to make use of technical services to prepareland-use plans, NTFP development plans,
and designs for enhancing production of specific products and environmental services. The
proposed project would not normally provide assistance to communities for preparing forest
management plans because they can be financed under the PRODEFOR project.                      The
PROCYMAF 11model requires a counterpart contribution from communities themselves on a
sliding scale (see Box 3). Communities are classified along a continuum ranging from Type I
communities that do not sell forest products on the formal market to Type IV which have
developed forest-basedindustries that not only harvest products but also add value to them.

further to contribute from ten to thirty percent of the cost of investments intechnical assistance.

A similar scale and the respective counterpart requirementsare compatible with that usedby the
PRODEFOR project, which prevents competition between the two programs. PROCYMAF I1
would continue this same approachwhich has been shown to be suitable for building community
/ejidocommitment to sustainableforestry inafashionthatisbothmarket- andenvironmentally
friendly. PROCYMAF I1would consolidate and extend this approach in Guerrero, Michoacin
and Oaxacaand expand the same services to Durango, Jalisco andQuintana Roo.

One situation encountered at the inception of PROCYMAF Iwas the lack of skilled private
service providers with the skill mix needed to serve indigenous communities and ejidos. The
approach taken in the project was to identify a pool of potential providers and to build up their
capacity to work with community / ejido forest owners. This involved a variety of skills
including community / ejido organization skills, environmental planning and forest management
skills, analysis of the biology of specific non-timber species, economic and market analysis,
technical assistance for community / ejido enterprises, etc.                         Over the past five years,
PROCYMAF Ihas built up a roster of 156 professional consultants, including individual
specialists, small firms, and N G O S ~ .These providers are required to participate in a
PROCYMAF trainingcourse, and to be accredited as service providers at which point, they are
added to the roster from which communities may select service providers. They are then added
to a roster of service providers from which communities can select to meet needs they have
identified. Many of these service providers have also participated in ongoing training under the
PROCYMAF "Continuing Education Program" offered to qualified and interested providers to
strengthen their skills in specific areas demanded by the communities. See Annex 2 for a
detailed description of the accomplishments of PROCYMAF I.




8While the number of providers is large, the roster is somewhat skewed by discipline and location. There are, as yet, few
providerslocatedin the States of Michoacin and Guerrero and there may be some gaps in some disciplines such as business and
financial professionals. While some providersspeak indigenouslanguagesand some are themselves indigenous,there may also
be a needto preparemorebilingual providersfor PROCYMAF11.

C. Project DescriptionSummary
1. Projectcomponents (see Annex 2for adetaileddescriptionandAnnex 3 for adetailedcost
breakdown):
A - Social Capital Strengthening

This component consists of activities designed to strengthen the capacity of communities and
ejidus to take decisions, particularly as regards natural resource management. It includes: (a)
forming and strengthening Regional Participatory Committees or other regional participatory fora
and providing support for their meetings; (b) conducting Rapid Rural Appraisal exercises in
which specialized consultants hold workshops incommunities and ejidus to help them to become
aware of their main problems and to set priorities; (c) inter-community seminars which are
designed to assist communities of different levels of development to define common goals and
share their experience in achieving them; (d) development of community statutes in which
specialized consultants assist communities indrafting by-laws for community governance; (e) and
supervisory activities by PROCYMAF staff.

B - Forest ResourceManagementTechnical Strengthening

Under sub-component (1) of this component, the PROCYMAF I1 project would respond to
community demand to: (a) contract specific studies to identify alternative resources for the
diversification of production and assist communities and ejidos in decision making; (b) provide
specialized consulting services to carry out land-use zoning in accordance with community goals
and available resources; (c) conduct studies and make recommendations for the strengthening of
community enterprises; (d) studies and recommendations for the development of inter-community
associations; (e) contract feasibility studies for non-timber forest products; (f) specialized courses
for human capital development including courses on identification and management of conflict;
and (g) offer courses to train communitylejidu forest technicians. Under sub-component (2) of
this component, the project would strengthen and diversify the supply of professional services
through courses. Under sub-component (3) of this component, forest management manuals would
be produced for each participating state covered by the project. Under sub-component (4) of this
component, the project would support specialized technical assistance teams to support
communities.

C - Diversification and Investment

Under sub-component (1) of this component, the project would (a) support diagnosis and analysis
of potential investments, and (b) invest in subprojects in ejidus and communities. Under sub-
component (2) of this component, the project would carry out studies and design payment for
environmental services schemes.        PROCYMAF I1 i s not intended to be a major source of
investment finance since other sources are available for this purpose. Any financing for actual
investments made under the project would be complementary to financing from other sources
including (a) other government programs such as PRODEFOR, (b) community funds, (c) private
donations. Thus, this component i s relatively small.

 Box 4  -ResinProduction.
 There are many potential NTFPs and markets for products and services. One example of an NTFP for
 which there i s an expanding demand i s resin extracted from pine trees. Such resin i s used in the
 manufacturing of paint and other products. While not providing a steady year-round income, resin can
 provide important supplemental income to individuals and communities. Inthe State of Oaxaca in 2001,
 about 208 tons of pine resin were produced and shipped to MichoacAn (some 460 km. away) for
 processing. However, the cost of shipping i s approximately 30 percent of the value of the product
 delivered to the gate of the processing plant. In order to capture a higher price for the product,
 PROCYMAF i s supporting a feasibility study for the possible development of a community-based resin
 processing enterprise in Oaxaca. Reducing the shippingcosts will createjobs, bring higher returns for
 Oaxaca's resin producers and stimulate production. PROCYMAF has the capacity to provide partial
 grant financing for NTFPs (as opposedto timber for which only technical assistancei s offered).



D- InstitutionalStrengthening

This component would provide support for aproject subunit coordination team ineach
participating state and for basic goods and services for the implementation of the project including
vehicles (not financed by the loan), information technology for the subunits inthe states, training
and support baseline studies of environment and social relations that will provide a basis for
monitoring and evaluation of project advances. It would also support strategic studies ineach of
the participating states proposedby CONAFOR and approved by the Bank.

E-Project Management

This component would provide support for the central project implementation unit (PIU) and
annual financial audits.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project would not promote policy reforms in general. Rather the project would seek to
consolidate the institutional gains made by the creation of CONAFOR, the PEF 2025, PNF 2001-
2006 and the 2002 Forestry Law. The project would support a process of legal and institutional
change, by designing and financing feasibility studies in environmental services markets and
payment for financial services (PES). This process i s supportedby the WB Forest Policy (OP/BP

                                                  11

4.36) which encourages linking country policy dialogue and project development to national
forest programs andother development processes.

3. Benefitsandtarget population:
The project would be carried out in selected areas of the states of Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco,
MichoacBn, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo. The areas were selected on abasis of the presence of high
value standing forest resources owned by indigenous communities or ejidos. The potential
benefits include strengthening of community decision-making processes, higher income from
forest production, and diversification of household incomes.              PROCYMAF I assisted
approximately 300 communities and ejidos in the States of Guerrero, MichoacBn and Oaxaca. It
i s expected that the new project would assist an additional 200 communities and ejidos on a
demand-driven basis, and continue assistance to some of the 300 original communities.
Eventually, additional States fitting the same description as above could be incorporated into the
project conditional on the availability of funds and staff. Loan financing for additional states
would needto be discussedand agreedto inadvance.

4. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements:
CONAFOR i s a decentralized agency of SEMARNAT.                   While CONAFOR is based in
Guadalajara, PROCYMAF Ihas been managed, since inception, from CONAFOR offices in
Mexico City. The existing CONAFOR Project Implementation Unit, located in Mexico City,
would be maintained and CONAFOR subunits would be maintained or established in each of the
target states.

Most of the activities to be carried out inthis project will consist of TA subprojects carried out in
a demand-driven modality as approved by CONAFOR. Activities for strengthening social capital
and forest resource management will be carried on a demand-driven basis by consultants drawn
from a roster of qualified technical experts. Each community seeking assistance will sign an
umbrella operating agreement (convenio de concertucidn) with CONAFOR and thereafter will be
eligible to contract service providers from the PROCYMAF roster @udro'n). While under
contract to communities, these providers will be paid directly by CONAFOR on behalf of the
communities and ejidos. Inaddition, the project will support investment subprojects to enhance
the diversification of forest resource use in communities. In these cases, communities would
receive resources directly in the form of matching grants under an Investment Implementation
Agreement (convenio de ejecucidn).         The project will also support training activities for
communities and ejidos andfor specialist forest technicians. It may also support inter-community
workshops. The latter activities may also require payment of modest per diems for committee
and workshop participants who need to travel to their destinations.          This travel would be
compensatedat rates reflectingactual costs to participants. Under component C, the project could
support investment subprojects that may involve minor works, goods and services. Insuch cases,
communities would manage project funds themselves, under CONAFOR supervision, following
agreed    procurement procedures described in the Project Operational Manual. All other
componentswill becarried out directly by CONAFOR.

D. Project Rationale
1. Projectalternatives considered andreasonsfor rejection:
Alternative project designs considered include: (a) a larger project encompassingnine states; (b)
fully decentralized State management; (c) directed credit for timber production; and (d) fully
privatizedservice delivery. A larger project would have had to be implemented in stages and was
considered undesirable from a fiscal perspective by the SHCP. The second alternative was
considered desirable as a long-term goal, but not feasible in the near term because of lack of state
capacity to manage a project of this complexity.                Most of the six states targeted for project
interventions lack a qualified forestry management unit or the skills needed to reach out to
indigenous communities and ejidos. One of the project input indicators i s the establishment of a
functioning CONAFOR subunits in each of the participating States. With regard to the third
alternative, experience with directed credit programs in the Bank has been negative, especially for
areas where credit markets already exist. Directed credit programs are costly to manage and it i s
difficult to avoid leakage from directed credit to non-targeted uses. The program would provide
matching-grant financing for NTFPs for which established markets do not exist and where the
technology i s largely unknown to the participating communities, provided that adequate
feasibility studies have been carried out. Finally, the existing PROCYMAF program relies
heavily on private-sector service delivery; however the overall management of the program and
regulation of the private-sector activity remains in the hands of PlU and direct contacts with
communities by project staff hasproven essentialto good project management.

3. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe project design:
The main lesson of PROCYMAF Iwas to demonstrate that communities can manage their own
forest resources9.       The approach to communities recognizes different capacity levels, and
encourages communities and ejidos to gradually acquire the capacity as they move through
various stages of development. The requirement of full community / ejido participation in the
design and implementation of program interventions has been one of the key contributions to
program success. Each intervention i s based on a formal solicitation made by the community /
ejido and voted upon by the community / ejido assembly. Communities appoint a team to
interface with the private-sector service providers and provide continuous input to the
implementation of the Program. The new project would maintain and strengthenthis feature.

The experience of PROCYMAF Ishowed that there i s a high likelihood of success in
communities where commercially viable forest resources are available. However, the program
also provided important assistance, and achieved gains, in communities where forest resources
were not abundant, often by assisting them in developing NTFPs and building their capacity for
other activities in addition to timber harvesting.

PROCYMAF also helped broaden the view of what constitutes marketable forest products.
Communities have learned, through PROCYMAF, that the forests can also yield other valuable
benefits such as jobs, NTFPs, recreation, eco-tourism opportunities, and a diversified livelihood
for the community.         Community enterprises are more likely to be successful where a good
feasibility study i s in place and where the community / ejido members are familiar with market
conditions. The more highly developed communities andejidos (Types I11and IV) have a higher
success rate in creating and operating community / ejido enterprises. Some Type I1communities
have also successfully created and operated community enterprises. Communities with some
experience and sophistication are more likely to create andmaintain viable enterprises.

Private service providers have not usually been prepared to work with indigenous communities
and ejidos. The PROCYMAF experience has validated the need for specialized and ongoing
training for service providers so that they meet the communities needs in a culturally sensitive
fashion.

4. Indications of borrower commitmentandownership:
The primary indicator of Borrower commitment to the proposed project is the ongoing successful
implementation of PROCYMAF I.A second indicator of commitment i s the adoption of a
National Forestry Strategy that incorporates and extends the goals and methods of the
PROCYMAF project. A third indicator i s embodied in the institutional development of the
forestry sector including the creation of CONAFOR, passage by Congress of a new forestry law
(LGDFS) in December 2002, and the amendment of the Loan Agreement to transfer
responsibility for implementation of PROCYMAF from SEMARNAT to CONAFOR. Taken
together, these events demonstrate the determination of the Government of Mexico to achieve the
objectives set out in the its forestry strategy and law, its willingness to apply scarce federal
resources to achieve these goals, as well as to seek loan funds from the World Bank.



 See Annex 11for a detaileddescriptionof PROCYMAFI.


                                                   14

Another important indicator of ownership is the strong commitment by the GOM to recognizing
the rights and needs of its indigenous communities and the embodiment of this commitment in
many programs of local development, healthand education. With regard to indigenous people, the
GOM has made poverty alleviation and the full recognition of their indigenous cultural
background part of its government program policy.

5. Value added of Bank support inthis project:
The World Bank has supported a wide range of forestry projects worldwide and particularly in
Latin America (see Section D-2). Most of these projects have been based on similar principles as
PROCYMAF, including: (1) community control over forest resources; (2) increasing local value
added forest products locally; (3) diversification of forest production; and (4) experimenting with
the identification and development of environmental services schemes from forests.           These
experiences have led to the accumulation of considerable knowledge and capacity in the design
and implementation of theseprojects, which have been applied to the current project design.

E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are inthe project file, seeAnnex 8)
1. Economic (seeAnnex 4):
Cost effectiveness NPV=US$million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)

PROCYMAF I1would finance demand-driven pilot investments whereby eligible communities
and ejidos would have access to funds for feasibility studies, market analysis and development of
pilot projects for timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Under PROCYMAF I,         similar
investments were pilotedin the states of Guerrero, Michoacin and Oaxaca. As such, this analysis
draws on the experience of this predecessor project inproviding an economic justification for the
proposed project.

Cost-Effectiveness: Several factors would lend support to the cost-effectiveness of investments
in training and capacity-building financed under the proposed project. First, the demand-driven
aspect of these investments (as was also the case under the predecessor project - PROCYMAF I)
would imply that scarce investment resourcesare allocated where these are most needed. Second,
the same demand-driven processes have proven to increase a sense of ownership on the part of
beneficiary communities regardingthese investments, especially when the expectedreturns to the
training are income-generation activities that are grounded in feasibility analyses and marketing
plans, also financed under the project.

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)

Internal rates of return were also estimated for the most common types of productive
subprojects. These exceeded, in most cases, 20 percent. The analysis was made assuming
constant benefits over a twenty-year subproject life cycle. In addition to these positive impacts,
benefits are largely concentrated inthe subprojects' beneficiary communities.

FiscalImpact:
All Bank-financed projects in Mexico operate within existing Federal budget allocations, in
accordance with the tight fiscal policy pursued by the Federal government. The project seeks to
improve the management practices of community-managed forests and increase the value-added

                                                 15

to forest-based production and NTFPs, both of which, if accomplished, would yield positive
revenue flows via taxation. Furthermore, revenue generated at the local level which i s reinvested
inpublic goods and services - a common practice in indigenous communities - could substitute
for and possibly reducethe demandfor fiscal outlays from the FederalGovernment.


3. Technical:
The primary issue lies in developing and communicating appropriate management techniques for
the wide range of forest types that are encountered in the six States that would be encountered in
the project. The distribution of differentforest types i s outlined inTable 2.

During project implementation, PROCYMAF I developed documents to promote best
management practices that considered critical environmental aspects and the protection of rare
and endangered species in the application of management. A manual was published for this
purpose by the PROCYMAF Iproject which provides detailed instructions on environmental
managementto preservebiodiversity and avoid unnecessary damage for all forest managers inthe
areas covered by the project in Oaxaca. As part of project preparation, a specialized study was
commissioned to identify the environmental risks posed by the project in the three additional
states (Durango, Jalisco and Quintana Roo) and to propose, in general terms, environmental
management procedures to be used in the management of the various types of forest. New Field
Manuals to promote best management practices that consider environmental issues would be
prepared during implementation. (see Section E. 5.2).

4. Institutional:
The major challenge of the proposed project i s to extend the project to three additional states in
different ecosystems with a diversity of institutional structures and indigenous and local cultures,
while preserving the high quality of operations achieved in PROCYMAF I.State coordinators
would be appointed by CONAFOR in each participating state and they would recruit field


                                                  16

workers (promotores) and establish offices in each state capital. There i s an understanding, that
would be reflected on the operational manual, that project activities would not be extended to the
new states (Durango, Jalisco, Quintana Roo) until the PIU has been authorized to recruit a state
team with a sufficient numberof professionals to achieve the project's objectives.

4.1 Executingagencies:

The Borrower i s the United Mexican States (UMS), and the proceeds of the Loan would be
managedby NacionalFinanciera (NAFIN), a federal development bank responsible for managing
many different projects with both local and foreign financing. NAFINtakes responsibility for the
overall financial management of the project and manages the Special Account; of all formal
transactions concerning the project including procurement and contracting, as well as matters
pertaining to the Loan Agreement.            The implementing agency is the National Forestry
Commission, CONAFOR, that would enter into a special agreement with NAFIN and the UMS
for the purposes of technical management of the project.

4.2 Projectmanagement:

Although CONAFOR i s a new agency, its management i s drawn from some of the most
politically and technically experienced personnel in Mexico. PROCYMAF Icurrently has an
implementation unit based in Mexico City with a Coordinator and a core professional staff of 7,
some of whom are CONAFOR staff members while others are on fixed-term contracts. The
project also has subunits in each of the States including State-level directors and a staff. The
Oaxaca subunit, with 7 staff, was the first to be established and has been the most active.
Michoachn and Guerrero states each have a staff of 5. The coordination unit for the proposed
project has accumulated nearly five years' experience in implementing the project and an
excellent core group of managers and field workers has been developed. It i s expected that there
would be a high degree of continuity between the current PIU and subunits. The approximately
156 accredited professional service providers will also provide a good base from which to recruit
additional providers.

4.3 Procurementissues:

PROCYMAF would utilize a roster of consultants and firms that are technically qualified and
trained to provide technical and professional services directly to indigenous communities.
Admission to this list is based on presentation of qualifications and successful completion of a
training course under commercial practices described in the Operational Manual. Communities
develop proposals for technical assistance and, if approved, they may select a consultant from the
official roster provided that consultant i s available and qualified for the task at hand.

4.4 Financialmanagementissues:

The PIU (formerly attached to SEMARNAT) has had five years of experience in managing a
World Bank Project. The World Bank's financial management assessment concluded that: (i)
CONAFOR's headquarters in Guadalajara did not yet have in place an adequate financial
management system specific to the project yet but that a reliable system i s under development and
during the life of the project CONAFOR will be supportedby: (ii)        existing financial management
systems inthe PKJlocated inMexico City, which are acceptable to the Bank and fully operational
for the proposed project; (iii)   disbursement arrangements are satisfactory to the Bank; (iv)

                                                   17

CONAFOR and NAFINwill maintainrecords, accounts, files and project documentation, and will
produce standard financial statements; (iv) an external private firm will carry out annual audit
reviews; (vi) the project will produce FMRs on quarterly basis; and (vii) disbursements will be
based on SOEs. Based on these findings, the implementation of an agreed financial management
action plan (see Annex 6b) would result inpropedspecific financial management arrangements in
place before project implementation.

The draft Mexico Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) covers public financial
accountability arrangements at the federal level: budget management, accounting and reporting,
Treasury, Management Information System (SIAFF), internal controls and external audit. Based
on the diagnostic work performed to date, the Task Team i s of the opinion that, at the federal
government level, Mexico has adequate public financial management capacity and reliable
information systems, and that there i s a considerable degree of external transparency.

Based on this assessment, it was agreed that two financial management supervision missions will
be conducted during first project implementation year and for the following years one mission on
yearly basis i s planned. The aim i s to avoid possible unfavorable results caused for the project
implementation capacity, of CONAFOR both in Mexico City and Guadalajara, in financial
management.

5. Environmental:                       Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment andEMPpreparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issuesand their treatment emerging from this analysis.

Based on the social and environmental studies carried during project preparation, no significant
adverse environmental impacts are expected from the implementation of this project. This
conclusion i s partly basedon experiencewith PROCYMAF I.

The relatively small scale of the project interventions and the built-inparticipatory mechanisms
requiring assembly approval of all activities are strong guarantees against adverse environmental
impacts.    The project would support many activities contributing towards the sustainable
management of forest resources by communities and ejidos. In order to achieve the latter the
project would (i)   continue and improve the provision of technical assistance and professional
services for forest management, as initiated under PROCYMAF I,(ii)               put in place sustainable
managementpractices that take into consideration the conservation of water quality, biodiversity,
and development of non-timber forest resources, (iii)           strengthen community / ejido forestry
enterprises, (iv) encourage product diversification and markets for environmental services, (v)
strengthenlocal andregional institutions, as providedunder the new forestry law (see section B.2)
and(vi) encouragecompliance with relevant laws andregulations.

The project would support performance-based certification of production forests by independent
third-party agencies (such as FSC) in communities / ejidos where appropriate.                      Not all
communities and ejidos would be encouraged to seek certification because the costs might
outweigh the benefits in several cases. B y promoting sustainable natural forest management, the
project i s expected to add value to standing forest rather than convert forests to agriculture or
pasture. The key stakeholders were identified as being: (i)           indigenous communities, (ii)    ejido
members, (iii)  consumers of wood products, (iv) consumers of other environmental services (e.g.,
water), (v) commercial timber dealers andprocessors, and (vi) the agencies of the State.

5.2 What are the mainfeatures of the EMPand are they adequate?

The EA report, preparedby a specialized consulting team, is summarized as Annex 12 and has
been publicly disclosed in Mexico. Through a series of field visits, extensive consultations with
specialists and representatives of the beneficiaries, the EA team determined that the direct and
indirect environmental impacts of the implementation of this project will be relatively light and
mostly positive in nature. The PROCYMAF 11EIA contains a description of the flow of project
interventions from assessment to intervention. It takes into account their potential environmental
impact by describing the safeguards requiredat the subproject level and at the regional level (e.g.,
cumulative impacts) to prevent irreversible environmental damage. The mechanisms comprise:
(i) conservation plansincludingzoning plansthat create set asidesinareas of high
    forest
biodiversity or vulnerability such as stream heads; (ii)     environmental training and technical
assistanceto communities andprivate service providers; (iii)    assistancein the management of rare
and endangered species, especially those with commercial value; (iv) environmental institutional
strengthening; (v) forestry research; (vi) environmental project monitoring; and (vii) the use of
certificationin some cases as an instrumentto assure sustainable forest management and possibly
help enhance the market value of products. Efforts will be made towards enhancing the capacity
of communities and ejidos to follow sustainable management plans and to protect designated
conservation zones within their lands.

PROCYMAF I1 would provide technical support to communities interested in achieving
independent certification of their forests. Under PROCYMAF I,some communities achieved
FSC certification covering atotal of 147,314 ha and it i s anticipated that other communities would
achieve certification of their forests with PROCYMAF I1support, covering some 75,000 ha. FSC
certification provides assurance of social and environmental sustainability. It i s recognized that
not all communities attended will have the resources necessary to seek independent certification.
However, the project would begin a process of improvements in community management that i s
substantially consistent with the Bank's forest policy (OPBP 4.36). See Annex 12for a detailed
description of how the project complies with OPBP 4.36.

As noted in Annex 14, there is a high degree of congruence between Mexican environmental
regulations governing forests and the Bank's policies. Any forest management scheme supported
under the project would be required to comply with Mexican legislation including filing of the
required Forest Management Plan (FMP) which contains safeguards to ensure that proposed
extractive activities would not cause damage to biodiversity, soils, or water quality. CONAFOR
provides financing under the PRODEFOR program preparation of FMPs. In order to assure that
completion of FMPs do not create a bottleneck, the project would provide financing of FMPs if
needed. Following SEMARNAT regulations would also prevent support for any activity in or
near a nationally gazetted conservation unit that i s not permitted under law.

It was agreedthat FieldGuides will be produced with project support duringthe first two years of
implementation. These will consist of (i)     a guide for each states containing specific advice
pertaining to forest types in that state, and (ii)    a guide containing general advice on forest
management and best practices on specific topics such as construction and maintenance of roads,
timber harvesting, protection of soils and water courses, and biodiversity conservation through
protection of nesting sites, etc. These guides will be based on existing sources, the experience of
PROCYMAF I,and on relevant international experience. In view of the relative sensitivity to
issues concerning humidtropical forests, it was agreed that the project would not support logging

                                                 19

activities in such areas and the relative lack of systematic experience in humid tropical forests,
untilthe appropriate manual had beendisseminated, except where the forest has received FSC or
equivalent certification.

5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
                    Date of receipt of final draft: 03/17/2003


5.4 How have stakeholders beenconsulted at the stageof (a) environmentalscreening and (b) draft EA
report onthe environmentalimpacts andproposedenvironment management plan? Describemechanisms
of consultation that were usedandwhich groupswere consulted?

Stakeholders listed under Section 5.1, including local, regional, and national government
representativesfrom the CONAFOR and other relevant agencies, non-profit organizations, private
entities, donors involved in the project area, and were consulted frequently during consultative
meetings were heldineach of the new target states (Durango, Jalisco and Quintana Roo) at which
different beneficiaries, NGOs, academics and other stakeholders could learn about the project.
The results of these meetings are summarized in Annex 15.                  During implementation, the
individual EA and management plans as required under Mexican law would be informed by a
wide consultation process with stakeholders in each respective locale. Each subproject financed
by the project would include evaluation of the pertinent environmental parameters.

5.5 What mechanismshave beenestablishedto monitor andevaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives andresults of the EMP?

The Project forms part of a larger government strategy which is embodied inother projects under
the overall management of Mexico's forestry commission, CONAFOR. Furthermore, the project
would follow the requirements of the WB Operational Policies (see section E.7.1). Among the
indicators that will be considered are: (i)the increments in areas brought under formal
managementplans; (ii)     increments in non-timber forest product production; and (iii) of forest
                                                                                            area
certified (although universal certification i s not a goal of this project).

6. Social:
6.1 Summarizekey social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project'ssocial
development outcomes.

The baseline condition of indigenous communities in Mexico i s generally one in which
indigenous communities enforce community solidarity through a system of rotatingcivil-religious
"cargos" which impose significant financial and work burdens on their holders during their period
of service. Ina tradition as old as the Spanishconquest, many indigenous communities tend to be
inward-looking and defensive. They place a high value on employment within the community /
ejidu and seek to minimize the need to migrate outside the community / ejidu, Nevertheless, in
many indigenous communities in Mexico, men migrate to distant cities and to the United States,
sometimes illegally, in search of employment. Men may remain away for years on end, but most
apparently intend to return and often remit part of their earnings to families at home.

Another social issue that arises in many of the target regions i s the existence of inter-community
conflict, often over land. Although indigenous communities own land, the exact boundaries are
often not clearly demarcated and conflicts over land and other issues may remain alive for many
years. They may result inlong legal battles and sometimes violence. Such conflicts may make it

                                                     20

difficult or impossible to implement the project properly, especially when boundary disputes
exist. The PROCYMAF Iproject generally did not offer services to communities where boundary
disputes prevail, or restricted such services to areas free of conflict. The proposed project would
not involve itself directly in dispute resolution. However, it would devote resources to training
staff and service providers to recognize and assess conflict situations, and, where appropriate, to
apply techniques to construct consensus within communities and reduce tensions between
communities. The staff would also refer cases to the pertinent legal authorities, mainly the
procuradoria agraria, which has specific tools for dispute resolution. The goal would be to help
communities to resolve their differences to apoint where they can benefitfromproject services.

Ejidos present another set of social issues revolving around the land rights held by ejidatarios.
Although ejidatarios have rights in specific plots of land, those rights are not equivalent to titled
ownership. Ejidos also include areas of communally managed land used as forest preserves,
communal pastures, hunting and other purposes. While in 1917, ejidos were seen largely as a way
of restoring of communal ownership to various rural populations, under President Lhzaro
Chrdenas (1934 - 1940), the ejido became an instrument of land redistribution and many new
ejidos were created. In 1992, the law was changedto allow individual ejidatarios to register their
plots, reducing certain rigidities in land managementand transaction of land. Some 70 percent of
ejido land is estimated to be under transferable public title. However, the law did not fully
"commoditize" ejido land with the result that distortions persist such as the widespread illegal
occupation of ejido land, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas, and the nonacceptance of
ejido land as collateral by banks10. Nevertheless, there are still thousands of ejidos in Mexico
holding substantial amounts of communal land. Individual ejido plots tend to be cleared and
devoted to agriculture or livestock, while communal lands are often forest lands or communal
pastures. There i s a tendency for people to invest primarily in individual lots while they remain
relativelyindifferent to communally held land.

The project design includes specific inputs and outputs that relate to strengthening social capital.
The project also aims at raising community living levels in the assistedcommunities.11 In order
to measure changes in social capital and levels of living, the project would support a systematic
baseline study of communities using a panel methodology in a randomly selected subset of the
universe of potential client communities.        The study would be carried out early in the
implementation periodand repeatedat two-year intervals to gauge the social impact of the project.

6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participatinginthe project?

OP 4.36 calls for the active involvement of people living in and near forest areas in all aspects of
the management, conservation and sustainable development of their natural forests.        There i s a
good experience from the PROCYMAF Iproject, that has stimulated the active participation of
the key stakeholders in participating communities and ejidos. Under PROCYMAF I,regional
committees were formed of key stakeholders (primarily community / ejido leaders and
comuneros)in eight different regions of the State of Oaxaca. These committees serve as fora for
the identificationof needs and for the discussion of the project, its procedures and policies. They
are constituted by and for the actual and potential beneficiaries of the project. Participation at the
community / ejido level takes different forms but the requirement that decisions be taken by the
broadestpossible community body is maintained inall cases.




                                                 21

In Type Iand IIcommunities, there frequently i s a need to help develop coherent community/
ejido organization to buildaprocessthat allows the community / ejido to discuss issues and reach
collective decisions. PROCYMAF staff help organize and attend community / ejido meetings to
guide the process. The project offers assistance in the preparation and approval of community
statutes which are important for the ongoing governance of the community ingeneral. The goal i s
to ensure that communities will adopt and adhere to democratic procedures, centered mainly
around the asamblea, or community assembly, which brings together the community / ejido
members to discuss issues and vote on community actions. The exclusion of women and, non-
ejidatarios and non-comuneros from asamblea decisions i s a matter of concern, but i s beyond the
scope of this project. It i s expected that inclusion of women in productive activities will help
raise their profile and promote the gradual change incommunity governancepractices.

Inmanycommunities the asambleais inplace, althoughthe PROCYMAF staff areready to assist
in organizing meetings and assisting in the general process of decision making.                In all
communities, PROCYMAF requires that all project activities carried out in communities must be
approved by a formal vote in the asamblea. Through the asamblea, a formal request i s sent to
PROCYMAF requesting specific services and, once the request has been granted, the asamblea
mustformally notify the CONAFOR PIUof this action.

The proposed project i s aligned with many other Bank-financed projects implemented in recent
years characterized as "community driven development" or CDD.                 Under this paradigm,
communities organize themselves to identify their needs and receive assistance in the form of a
matching grant to allow them to acquire or build some needed facility or improvement. The
benefits of such programs are that the community itself decides what its needs are, the community
manages the resource and decides how they will be used. Such projects are typically carried out
in a transparent fashion and with a high degree of participation. Communities also benefit by
strengthening their internal organization and capacity for joint action andproblem solving.

Unlike other CDD projects, PROCYMAF Idoes not have an open "menu" of choices regarding
the kind of investments that can be made since the project only supports actions relatingto forest
resources. Also, most of the funds will support technical assistance activities contracted by
CONAFOR on behalf of communities. However, PROCYMAF Idoes share other characteristics
andbenefits typical of CDD projects.

6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaborationwith NGOs or other civil society
organizations?

PROCYMAF Ihas created a space with which all the actors involved in the project within
subregions of each participating state have a chance to express their thoughts and exchange points
of view; this space is called Natural Resources Regional Committees, and it includes
representatives of communities/ejidos representatives, civil society,             state and federal
organizations. Many of the technical service providers are affiliated with the Regional Natural
ResourceCommittees.

6.4 What institutionalarrangementshave beenprovidedto ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?

The absence of many community residents and internal conflicts may make the process of
communal decision making more difficult. Therefore one of the issues that the project addresses

                                                   22

i s the strengthening of community / ejido organization. As in the first PROCYMAF project, no
actions would be taken by the project affecting any particular community or ejido that have not
been thoroughly discussed and agreed by a vote in the community assembly. The project would
also require that each community activity be carried with the direct participation of a group of
community / ejido members selectedby the community at large. A Mid-Term Review would be
held approximately two years after project effectiveness to measure the extent to which the
project i s achieving its objectives andto makeadjustments as necessary.

6.5 How will the project monitor performanceinterms of social development outcomes?

Early in the implementation of PROCYMAF 11, a carefully designed baseline study would be
carried out to measure social, economic and environmental aspects of communities inthe targeted
areas. A panel of randomly sampled communities and persons within these communities will be
selected from the universe of all communities that may participate in the project. Among the
parameters monitored will be those listed as indicators of project inputs, outputs and impacts
under section A.2.                The sampled communities and individuals will be revisited at two-year
intervals throughout the life of the project to measure changes, using the same methodology to
assess the impact of the project. The study will also take into account the number and type of
interventions carried out inthe communities studied.

7.2 Describe provisions madeby the project to ensurecompliance with applicablesafeguardpolicies.
Most of the clientele of the project are indigenous people organized as comunidades indigenas as
recognized under Mexican law, or indigenous people living in ejidos. There are also non-
indigenous people living in ejidos. Because of this an IPDP was prepared for this project,
although most of the project's activities are designed around the traditional indigenous community
(see Annex 13). The Social Analysis (Annex 13) recommended that special care be taken to
avoid exacerbating existing conflicts within communities, especially in multi-settlement
communities. The project design takes account of and strengthens many features of indigenous
organization, especially the process of community decision-making. It also provides support for
harmonizing the traditional cargo system (see above) with the demands of market-based

    It is not possible to predict securely that family or household incomes will increase with the project since it would be implemented at the
community level. Communities can benefit directly from income from forestry activities since often the proceeds from such activities are invested
inimprovedservices such asroads, schools andother amenities.

                                                                       23

enterprise. Technical service providers are specially selected and trained to work with indigenous
people. Thus, most of the project i s oriented towards providing culturally appropriate assistance
to indigenous people eventhough part of the clientele would not be classified as indigenous.

The environmental assessment (Annex 12) has examined the risks in every possible project
activity and has found that, in general, the risks are low. The analysis recommends a screening
function to identify possible risk from forest management practices that exceed the carrying
capacity of the localenvironment.

F. Sustainabilityand Risks
1. Sustainability:
The design of the project has from the beginning been designed and implemented with the
participation of forest communities and ejidos. The project empowers local communities and
ejidos to take decisions inrespect to the nature, extent andtiming of the assistance on sustainable
forestry managementpractices. The project objectives further supports GOM policies and are the
product of an extensive consultation process. The project buildsupon a successfully implemented
PROCYMAF Iproject and the preparation team included the staff from PROCYMAF and
CONAFOR, who will continue to be involvedinthe implementation of the project. It i s expected
that payment for environmental services schemes will also enhance the sustainability of the
management systems supported by the project. Project actions complement measures developed
and/or being implemented by the GOM, as well as Federal efforts under other programs such as
shown inBox 1.

                            Annex 4: Cost EffectivenessAnalysis Summary
                             MEXICO: Community ForestryII (PROCYMAF II)

The primary activity under PROCYMAF I1 would be investments in capacity-building and
technical assistance to communities and ejidos to both strengthen their social capital and to
improve their management capacity and conservation of forest resources.                                     Additionally,
PROCYMAF I1would finance demand-driven pilot investments whereby eligible communities
and ejidos would have access to funds for feasibility studies, market analysis and development of
non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Under PROCYMAF I,                         similar investments were piloted in
the states of Guerrero, Michoaciin and Oaxaca. The analysis set forth here draws heavily on the
experience of the predecessorproject -- PROCYMAF I-- in providing an economic rationale for
the proposed project.

The results reported are based on an economic analysis of PROCYMAF Iin one of the
participating states (Oaxaca). Field work was conducted during late 2002 by the Znstitut de
Reserches et d 'Applications des Methods de De'veloppement (IRAM),from which a final report
was submittedto the project team inMay 2003.

Cost-Effectiveness of Traininn Investments

A substantial proportion (US$7.4 million) of project cost would finance capacity-building
activities for communities and ejidos. While researchconcerning the private and social returns to
training and technical assistance are scant, it may be instructive to look at returns to investments
in education for which more evidence is available.1 Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2002) report
that, for a data set consisting of 42 countries (including Mexico), the average rate of return to an
additional year of schooling i s 10 percent, with the highest returns accruing to low- and middle-
income countries. Furthermore, average returns are highest in Latin America and the Caribbean
region and Sub-Saharan Africa. Sianesi and Van Reenan (2002) review the existing literature
regarding the macroeconomic effects of investments in human capital.                               They find that: (1)
compelling evidence points to increased productivity through human capital investment; and (2)
education is found to yield additional indirect benefits to growth (in particular, by stimulating
physical capital investments and technological development and adoption).

InMexico, the contribution of educational inequality to incomeinequality is secondonly to Brazil
among Latin American countries (Lopez-Azevedo 2001). Applying a decomposition model to
Mexican income inequality over the period 1988 to 1997, Lopez-Azevedo found that the gross
effect of education (Le., when considered in isolation) andthe marginaleffect (i.e., when included
in a model with other explanatory variables) provided the highest explanatory power among all
independent variables inexplaining income inequality.

  Using formal educationas aproxy for training andcapacity-building(Le., non-formaleducation) is risky, giventhe distinct
natureof eachtype of education,materialused, age groups, etc.

In addition to the literature, several factors would lend support to the cost-effectiveness of
investments in training and capacity-building financed under the proposed project. First, the
demand-driven aspect of these investments (as was also the case under the predecessorproject -
PROCYMAF I) imply that scarce investment resources are allocated where these are most
                        would
needed.         Second, the same demand-driven processes have proven to increase a sense of
ownership on the part of beneficiary communities regarding these investments, especially when
the expected returns to the training are income-generation activities that are grounded in
feasibility analyses and marketingplans, also financed under the project.

Economic Viabilitv of Pilot Productive Submoiects

Forest Production.

Forestry productionwas assessedinfour communities inOaxaca. Inthree communities (Santiago
Lachivia, San Antonino, San Pedro El Alto), comuneros engage in the sale of air-dried sawn
lumber, using traditional saw mills which produce from 6,000 to 10,000 board-feet daily. Ina
fourth community (Pueblos Mancomunados), production technology i s more advanced, the
lumber is kiln-dried, and daily production can reach 20,000 board-feet, with noticeable gains in
quality when compared to traditional methods used in the remaining three communities.
Summary characteristics of the four communities are given inTable 2.




     Source: Merlet, et al. 2003-08
     Type3 communities are those which own forest stocks, have authorized Forest ManagementPlans, and are involved inone or
     more phases of forest management. Type4 communities (inaddition to Type 3 characteristics) engage invalue-added
     activities of forest products and marketthem directly.

Inallfour communities, competition fromexternalsuppliers,namelyChileandthe UnitedStates,
i s particularly acute. Both countries market sawn lumber in Oaxaca at prices below those of
community mills. Foreign lumber i s uniformly kiln-dried and oftenjudged to be of higher quality
that local obtained lumber from community mills. Hence the challenge i s one of reducing



                                                            33

production costs and improving product quality, particularly through efficiency gains from
technology adoption.

These communities and projects typify the investments which could be financed under
PROCYMAF 11. Financing for such projects would be obtained through PROCYMAF 11, along
with other complementary sources (e.g., PRODEFOR, Alianza para el Campo, FIRA, FONAES).
Community counterpart contributions would range from 10 to 30 percent (see Box 2), as defined
by type of community. Bank financing would be catalytic in supporting feasibility studies,
training, marketing plans and other product development activities, while non-Project sources
would finance plant and equipment and other start-up costs associated with the proposed
communal forestry production. The community investments assessed inthis annex are typical of
those financed under PROCYMAF Iand are indicative of those which could be proposed under
the demand-driven processesto be continued under the proposedproject.

Detailed models of communal forestry production were compiled for each community sampled.
The economic analysis presented focuses on two fronts: (i)         internal rate of return and (2)
communal distribution of "value-added", defined here as gross income, less depreciation and
input costs. While the internal rate of return provides an indicator for the viability of the
communal forest production, the calculation of value-added and its distribution reveals the extent
to which each community "captures" the benefits which accrueto this production. A time horizon
of twenty years was assumed for the analysis. Timber extraction per year i s assumed to be
equivalent to the overall growth rate of the forest area managedby each community. Results are
reported inTable 3.

The models yield satisfactory internal rates of return for all communities, in excess of the
prevailingopportunity cost of capital. Note that in three of the four communities, the value-added
captured by the community itself exceeds 85%. In all cases, the community-at-large (vis-&-vis
individuals) captures the bulk of the value-added. When viewed on a per hectare basis, the value-
added becomes a proxy for the state of technology utilized by each community. For example,
Pueblos Mancomunados, with its kiln for drying wood and modern mill equipment, is able to


                                                 34

generate a value-added per hectare of forest twice that of San Pedro el Alto - also a type 4
community, even though the latter has thirty times more forested area available

Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs):

The proposed project will also finance feasibility studies of investment alternatives to forest
production. Financing arrangements for NTFPs would be similar to those for communal forestry
production project. Two NTFP examples considered here are resin extraction and spring water
bottling.

Pine resin productionhas severalpositive attributes, namely: (i) employment generation; (ii)
                                                                   rural
value-added to tropical pine forests which typically produce otherwise inferior quality lumber;
(iii)stabilization of the agricultural frontier; and (iv) incentives for forest parceling, given the
producers' desire to maintaincontrol over a given stock of trees. Under PROCYMAF I,          training
to resin producers was financed, as was a feasibility study for a resin processing plant inOaxaca.

Land-use planning has led to protection of springs and other freshwater sources, and water
bottling has arisen as a means of capturing the returns from this natural resource. In some cases,
communities have leveraged their forest production income toward plant and equipment needed
for this purpose. Summary results for these two types of NFTPs are presentedinTable 4.

Fiscal Impact
All Bank-financed projects in Mexico operate within existing Federal budget allocations, in
accordance with the tight fiscal policy pursuedby the Federal government. The project seeks to
improve the management practices of community-managed forests and increase the valued-added
to forest-based production and NTFPs, both of which, if accomplished, would yield positive
revenue flows via taxation. Furthermore, revenue generated at the local level which i s reinvested
in public goods and services - a common practice in indigenous communities - could substitute
for and possibly reducethe fiscal outlays from the Federal Government.

    The bulk of procurement activities in the project i s technical assistance amounting to
    approximately US$22 million, or 76 percent of project costs.                                                            In most cases, technical
    assistance activities will be conducted by consultants (firms and inviduals) retained by
    CONAFOR on behalf of participating communities, under TA procedures described in
    Section 11below. No ICB i s expected in the project. Goods to be procured amount to
    approximately US$200,000 and will be contracted under NCB procedures centrally by
    CONAFOR for computing equipment and software. NCB procedures will use standard
    bidding documents as agreed between the Bank and Secretaria de la Funci6n Ptiblica. No
    vehicles will be financed by the Bank. Operationalhecurrent costs in the project will be
    financed with counterpart funds.

    Technical Assistance to Communities and Investment Subprojects

    Profile of CommunitieslEjidos. The principal actors in the project will be organized groups
    that may be scattered-- sometimes inremote rural locations -- inproject areas. These groups
    will be organized to ensure a legal personality and thus be eligible to apply for matching
    grants under the project to finance their subprojects. The transactions that these communities
    may engage inwill be small, with aggregatevalues intheir activities not to exceedUS$50,000
    equivalent of a mix of inputs. However, the organized communities, who are the beneficiaries
    of the project, will decide all activities. Communities would be responsible for deciding the
    goods and services they need.

    Type of Activities. Participating communities will prepare technical assistance activities or
    productive investment subprojects, or both. The selection of service providers, goods, works
                                                                                               38

and related services, and consulting services would be the responsibility of the
communitiedejidos, implementing their activities or subprojects, supported by an ample range
of implementation tools and instruments.       The procurement method for contracting that
communitiedejidos would be using are simplified, streamlined requirements for documents,
accounting and controls.

Training Activities: Contracts for training activities managedby CONAFOR inparticipating
communities and ejidos may be awarded, on a competitive basis, to individuals, consulting
firms, NGOs or educational institutions. In some cases, however, training of short duration in
certain forest management specialties to be offered in participants' communities may be
contracted by direct contracting, in isolated, distant or remote communities and the difficulty
of finding qualified trainers willing and able to work in such communities. Such contracts
would have a maximum value of US$20,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate total of
US$800,000 equivalent.

Technical Assistance Activities.           Communities or ejidos, with the assistance of
PROCYMAF project staff, would identify their needs for technical assistance or for
strengthening their governance. Interested communities would sign an umbrella agreement
(convenio de concertucio'n) with CONAFOR conditional upon agreement by the community
or ejido assembly. Under such agreements communities could seek assistance for social
capital strengthening activities such as drafting of community bylaws, participatory rural
appraisal (PRA), or community-to-community seminars. Communities that seek technical
assistance could request assistance in land-use zoning, assessments of economic potential of
natural resources, design of productive activities, etc. Communities seeking this type of
assistance would select service providers from the PROCYMAF roster. After submitting a
preliminary proposals for the desired activity, CONAFOR would contract the selected service
providers through to perform the requestedservice.      Service providers could also be selected
from the roster by groups of communities to provide assistance for regional committees,
specialized training or assistanceinformation of community enterprises.

Most service providers will be drawn from a roster of qualified consultants (el pudrdn de
ProcymaJ) maintained by the PROCYMAF State Subunit in each participating state.
Admission to the roster would be conditional on presentation of technical qualifications and
participation in a training course provided by PROCYMAF. and would be subject to
satisfactory performance of consultants rated periodically on the basis of their technical
performance, drive for results, and work relationships with the communities. Competitive
selection of these providers will be on a fixed-budget basis (para. 3.5 of Guidelines). Fees for
these services will be paidby CONAFOR according to standard compensation table according
to the complexity of the task and the time required. Contract values for service providers are
not expected to cost more than the equivalent of US$20,000. The O M will detail the task
descriptions, minimumqualifications for each line of service provided, and terms of contract
using a standard simplified contract. The level of effort of the service providers and the
quality of their service would be monitored by the State Subunit. Each service provider i s
requiredto submit a written report to the contracting community and to CONAFOR.

Productive Investment Subprojects. Once communities have determined their productive
capacity, they may sign and Investment Implementation Agreement (Convenio de Ejecucio'n),
also conditional on approval by the community or ejido assembly. Experts can be recruited
by communities from the roster to design investment projects or to conduct feasibility studies

                                              39

for specific investments. Communities can apply for modest matching grants to support
investments in value-added production facilities, such as sawmills, furniture factories,
ecotourism facilities, etc. Communities will also invest their own resources in such projects
and will typically also obtain cofinancing from other sources including CONAFOR' s
PRODEFOR program, the Alianza para el Campo program, NGOs and other sources.
Communities will typically contribute their own labor, some of which may be paid from such
grants up to a level of US$20,000 equivalent.        Goods such as machinery, construction
materials, tools, minor field equipment estimated to cost above US$20,000 but less than
US$50,000 will be procured by communities under CONAFOR supervision following
commercial practices.      Goods and service contracts valued above US$50,000 will be
contracted under NCB procedures with CONAFOR supervision. For works, contracts with
values under US$50,000 will be awarded on the basis of commercial procedure under fixed-
priced, lump-sumcontracts, where at least three qualified local contractors submit quotations
in response to a written invitation, supported by minimum technical specifications. Direct
contracting of works will be used exceptionally when only one qualified contractor supplier i s
available in or near the community, and would be applicable to contracts of less than
US$20,000 equivalent, by the community in distant communities outside of metropolitan
areas of state capitals, and when regional reference price lists are usedto approve investment
subprojects.

Section11. Employmentof Consultants

Consultants services shall be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the use of
Consultants (January 1997, revised in September 1997, and January 1999 and May 2002) and
the following provisions of Section I1of this Annex. Consultants services will be contracted
under this project in skill areas such as the following: community organization, training,
preparation of technical specifications for minor works, land-use zoning plans, special studies,
preparation of manuals, capacity building, among others. Consultant services other than those
sought by communities through the Roster (contracted under fixed-price budgets, para. 3.5
Guidelines), will be contracted competitively by comparison of at least three resumes. Partial
staffing of the central and State Subunits will consist of consultants selected under this
procedure with annual contracts. They will be evaluated annually and, if their performance i s
satisfactory, they may be recontracted without competition as provided under Guidelines
Para. 5.4.

Firms: Large consulting services contracts are not expected in the project. Short lists
composed only of national firms may be contracted when contract value does not exceed
US$500,000 equivalent. The bulk of consultant services are for assignments of small value
underUS$lOO,OOO, with estimate aggregates of US$lO.O million equivalent. Contracts above
US$50,000 equivalent will be contracted by QBCS using the agreed RFP and standard
contract for lump-sumcontracts.

Individuals: Full-time individual consultants to assist in promotion activities, core staff in
the State Subunits and PIU, and other advisory services would be selected by comparison of
qualifications of at least three candidates and hired in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter V of Consultants Guidelines, up to an aggregate amount of US$5.1 million (US$4.5
by sole source).

Single-Source Selection. The Bank has agreed to a single-source contract with Colegio de
Postgraduados, the academic institutionpresently contracted under the first project, which is
expected to continue delivering training modules for operational chain of staff, supporting the
Program of Continuing Education.          The annual cost of this training i s estimated at
US$lOO,OOO equivalent. However, it has been agreed that CONAFOR will seek competitive
selection of other academic institutions for delivery of any new modules inthe Program, using
QCBS procedures.

Procurement Plan.

The Global Procurement Plan has been prepared for the life of the project for all non-demand
driven activities. A specific procurement plan for the first 18 months of project life will be
available by Boardpresentation.

Section 111. Procurement Responsibilities and Capacity

A procurement capacity assessment for the project was conducted by Rosa Estrada and
approved by the World Banks Regional Procurement Advisor on September 17, 2003. The
organization and staffing of the PIU in the ongoing project will remain intact and i s expected
to continue to operate in the second project with successful outcomes of its main
accountabilities (monitoring, supervision, and disbursements).         Procurement activities,
including preparation of bidding documents that would be required for centralized purchases
in the project will be conducted by the Procurement Unit (PU) at CONAFOR's Gerenciade
Recursos Materiales in Guadalajara. CONAFOR i s a recent executing agency in Bank-
financed projects however, the capacity assessment conducted for the second project (filed
with LCOPR) indicates that CONAFOR, both at its headquarters office and in the PIU in
Mexico, has seasoned staff with experience in government procurement. For additional staff
training and capacity building, an Action Plan will be agreed at negotiations. NAFIN, as
intermediary financial institution for the Government of Mexico will continue to supervise
procedures and contracts, including issuance of no objection to documentation and awards
under the delegation the Bank makes of its fiduciary responsibilities not included inthe prior
review arrangements.

Operational Manual.        The PIU will update its Operational Manual (OM) to include the
lessonslearned from the first project and will give special attention to fine tune procedures to
ensure successful outcomes of TA activities and applicable flow of actions for the selection
and eventual de-selection of consultants from the PROCYMAF roster.              For investment
subprojects (under matching grants), the O M will provide detailed instructions to insure
satisfactory commercial procedures to be used by communities and ejidos in the procurement
of goods, small works and services.

Section IV. Procurement Monitoring

The PIUwill be responsible for updating periodically the Procurement Plan, and will continue
to use the present institutionalcapacity to monitor project execution, impact, benchmarks and
maintain detailed records of procurement activities and contracts.

   CONAFOR has also made provisions to ensure that all control areadunits inthe institution are
   represented(with voice) inthe ad-hoc EvaluationCommittees for all contracts financed by the
   Bank. Furthermore, it has been agreed with NAFIN that it will enforce additional control
   mechanismsunder its supervisory role of project activities. Furthermore, the PIUmay engage
   the services of specialized firms to assist in the implementation and monitoring of investment
   subprojects.     These services may include training in small-scale procurement by the
   community, accounting, and document filing.

   Frequency of Procurement Supervision

   One ex-post supervision mission at least every 6 months.

   Overall RiskAssessment

   The procurement activities under this project are very straightforward with a limited number
   of major contracts duringproject execution. However, inview of (a) the large component of
   TA activities inrural and distantcommunities, (b) the limitedavailability of detailed
   proceduresinthe OM for activities to assist the PIUsinthe monitoring and supervision of
   purchasesby the community, and (c) the limited experience of CONAFOR's PUin

1. Summaryofthe FinancialManagementAssessment
Country Issues

The Mexico Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), nearly completed, covers
public financial accountability arrangements at the federal level: budget management,
accounting and reporting, Treasury, Management Information System (SIAFF), internal
controls and external audit. The CFAA will include a Fiduciary Risk Assessment which
covers financial management. Based on the diagnostic work performed to date, the Task
Team i s of the opinion that, at the federal government level, Mexico has adequate public
financial management capacity and reliable information systems, and that there i s a
considerable degree of external transparency.

Although Mexico continues to improve its public financial management framework,
procedures and systems, the sheer volume of transactions calls for expediting and
incorporating a more efficient and effective approach to the administrative aspects of public
finances management - including accounting and financial reporting - and for makinginternal
and external audit functions more systematic and risk-based. The CFAA report offers detailed
analyses, conclusions and recommendations on these areas.

Strengthsand Weaknesses

Strengths. FM officials' of CONAFOR have experience in project FMfor Bank projects and
existing systems are fully operational for a similar project currently under implementation
(PROCYMAF I).The PIU will be supported by key areas of CONAFOR (namely,
accounting, budgeting, treasury, information technology and internal audit) and NAFIN.

Weaknesses.                                 __                           __^___-_-""___.l"_""___----- -"

                                             produce FMRs. Those actions will be concluded to ensure
                                             that CONAFOR i s able to produce FMRs for project

Implementing Entity
The existing Project ImplementationUnit (PIU), located inMexico City, would be maintained
and State Subunitswould be maintained or set up in each of the six target states. CONAFOR
was founded in 2001 and i s organized as a commission and i s a decentralized agency of
SEMARNAT. Although it has a short track record, it has a strong central staff and has
already launched a number of initiatives. CONAFOR succeeded in maintaining a stable
budgetallocation for 2003 and asimilar situation is expectedfor 2004.

                                              44

Although CONAFOR i s a relatively new agency, its management i s drawn from some of the
most politically and technically experienced personnel inMexico. PROCYMAF currently has
an implementation unit basedin Mexico City with a Coordinator and a core professional staff
of 7, all of whom are CONAFOR staff members. The project also has State Subunits in each
of the States including State-level directors and a staff. The PIU for PROCYMAF I1would
benefit from nearly five years' experience in implementing the preceding project and an
excellent core group of managers and field workers. Staff will be maintained during project
implementation, will continue operating from Mexico City and will coordinate with
Guadalajara.

Staffing
Key FM stafl. The PIU FM staff includes three public accountants specialised in financial
management.      These officials, located in Mexico City and Guadalajara offices, have
qualifications and public sector experience adequate to undertake the FMtasks related to this
project. The main duties will be to: (i) project budgets, financial statements and
                                            prepare
disbursement requests; (ii)supervise internalcontrols and efficiency inthe execution of funds;
(iii)
    coordinate among them on FMissues, with the financial agency NAFIN, the Secretariade
Hacienda y Crkdito Pdblico and the Bank; (v) coordinate project audits; and (vi) prepare and
submit FMR reports 45 days after the end of the first semester of operation and after each
subsequenttrimester, following the same sequence each year.

Funds Flow
Current CONAFOR's programs, including PROCYMAF I, financed through the standard
                                                             are
budget inlocalcurrency. The national treasury, abranch of the MOF (Secretaria de Hacienda
y Credit0 Publico) transfers CONAFOR's budget via SEMARNAT. CONAFOR's HQ in
Guadalajara handles all payments (goods, services, works, etc.), transfers funds to finance
sub-projects (pilot projects in ejidos and communities) and manages bank accounts. All
financial management activities are carried out in Guadajara and the office in Mexico city i s
responsible of specific project activities such as preparation of SOEs, TOR, etc. but does not
handlefunds. Additionally, this office is infrequent contact with the financial agency NAFIN
to process project disbursements, submit required reports, coordinate audits and Bank
missions, etc. NAFIN manages the Special Account including the reimbursements to the
national treasury (thisbasedon applicable agreements e.g. financing percentage).

Funds of the proposed project will be disbursed to an Special Account (US dollar account),
which will be utilized only for project activities.

World Bank and Counterpartfunds. Funds will be disbursed to the Special Account, which
will be maintained in the Central Bank (Banco de Mexico). The financial agency NAFINwill
manage this account to support the project PIU. Local (standard) budget will pre-finance all
project expenditures. The reimbursement to the GOM of the equivalent inU S dollars will be
transferred out of the balance of the Special Account.

Accounting Policiesand Procedures
CONAFOR will maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with
practices compatible with International Accounting Standards and in compliance with local
requirements, its operations and financial condition, including records and separate accounts
for this project (Second Community Forestry, PROCYMAF 11). Administrative procedures

                                              45

are in place and coordination between the two offices (Mexico City and Guadalajara) will be
intensified to ensure that financial transactions are made with consideration to safeguarding
project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring systems. The project
accounting system complemented with information systems, has the capacity to record assets,
liabilities and financial transactions of the project, and produce financial statements and
reports useful to project management and meeting Bank's fiduciary requirements. The office
in Mexico City will be responsible for all information related to disbursements.            The
Operational Manual will clarify the respective roles and responsibilities for accounting and
monitoring systems between the PIUand CONAFOR's headquarters inGuadalajara.

Reportingand Monitoring
Financial statements and reports will be prepared in formats satisfying local and Banks
monitoring and fiduciary requirements.

Monthly.    CONAFOR will prepare (i) project's Statement of Expenditures, a matrix
                                          the
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source, disbursement
category and component and (ii)   the Special Account Reconciliation. NAFINwill support or
carry out these activities depending on existing arrangements for the preceding project.

Quarterly. The project financial statements (the Statement of Receipts and Payments by
Funding Source, with expenditures classified by budgetary line and disbursement category;
the Uses of Funds by Project Activities; and the Special Account Reconciliation Statement),
along with the physical progress and procurement sections of the Financial Monitoring
Reports, will be submitted to the Bank no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter (May
15, August 15, November 15 and February 15 of each calendar year). The content of this
reports have been discussed and the initial design of the reports has been agreed with
CONAFOR. Final agreed format will be included in the Operational Manual, which i s a
boardcondition.

Annually. The annual Financial Statements will include the cumulative information of the
quarterly financial statements cited above, plus the schedule of Statements of Expenditure
(SOEs) presented during the year in support of Withdrawal Applications. This information
will be complemented with annual audit reports.

A financial managementsection of project manual will include detailed information on
reporting andmonitoring.

InformationSystems
CONAFOR operates multiple systems which are not integrated but that are acceptable to the
Bank. The following are the main FM systems: (i)         Sistema de contabilidad por polizas
Cheqpaq and Contpaq -commercial software- ; and (ii) new Multilan, which is a
                                                               the
commercial software with in-house applications.       Those systems produce information on
budget execution, accounting andfinancial operations.

         management. A Financial Management Specialist mustreview the annual audit reports.

         2. Audit Arrangements

         InternalAudit
         CONAFOR's internal audit department (CIAD) i s responsible for permanent internal audit
         reviews. No internal auditor will be assigned specifically to the project, although the PCIU
         will supervisethe project to insurethat proper internalcontrolprocedures are followed. CIAD
         will include project operations inits annual audit plans.

         ExternalAudit
         Audit compliance. The audit report corresponding to the previous project (PROCYMAF I)
         was reviewed by LCOAA and considered satisfactory to the Bank. Secretaria de la Funci6n
         P6blica (SFP) in coordination with the financial agency NAFIN will timely submit to the
         Bank the last project audit report. Discussions with those institutions, CONAFOR,
         SEMARNAT and the auditors indicate that opinion will be unqualified without major audit
         findings. As of date of assessment (May 2003), all project funds were properly supported or
         refunded to the Bank andthere are no outstanding audit reports.

         Audit arrangements. The new auditpolicy will apply to this project. Annual project Financial
         Statements will be audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, by an
         independent firm and in accordance with terms of reference (TORS) satisfactory to the Bank.
         The audit opinion would cover project financial statements and will be complemented with a
         report on the internal control structure for the project. The Project Operational Manual will
         include a section on auditing in which detailed information i s provided. The auditors would
         perform at least one interim visit per year.

The Borrower will furnish annual audit reports to the Bank as soon as available, but in any
case not later than six months after the end of each audited year.

3. DisbursementArrangements
Method. Disbursements would be in accordance with guidelines set out in the Bank's
DisbursementHandbook i.e. transaction-baseddisbursementprocedures. Project is not ready
to use FMR-based disbursements and; if ready during project implementation, before to
migrate to this methodology, an agreement between the GOM and the Bank must be reached.
Project will establish (in Banco de Mexico), maintain and operate an Special Account in U S
dollars, and NAFINwill support project in SA'Smanagement (additionally to coordination of
reporting and auditing).

Otherprocedures. Project will not require other procedures, however uponrequest from
CONAFOR and subject to Bank's approval, payments may be made: (i)              directly to a third
party (supplier or consultant) for goods, works, and services; (ii) a procurement agent; or
                                                                      to

 Use of statements of expenditures(SOEs):
    Loan withdrawal applications will be supportedby SOEs for expenditures relating to contracts
    that are not subject to the Bank's prior review. Reimbursement of other expenditures would
    require submittal to the Bank of full supporting documentation.

    Documents in support of SOEs must be maintained by CONAFOR at least untilone year after
    the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last loanwithdrawal was
    made. Such documents must be available to review by the external auditors and Bank staff at
    all time.

 Special account:
    Special account (SA). Project will establish (in Banco de Mexico), maintain and operate an
    Special Account in US dollars. NAFIN will support project in SA management and will
    coordinate reporting and auditing.

    The SA is only to be used for eligible expenditures under this proposed loan. Under no
    circumstances may funds in the SA be used to cover the share of expenditures corresponding
    to the counterpart. Transfers from the Special Account to other bank accounts will only be
    permittedto meet eligible expenditures for a limited periodof less than 30 days i.e. to project
    account inlocal currency. Fundsflow chart (above) provides details on SA.

    Total advances to the Special Account (assuming a four-year project for US$28.9 million) at
    any given time would not exceed an authorized allocation of US $3 million. However, that
    unless the World Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to the
    amount of $2. million untilthe aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus
    the total amount of all outstanding special commitments shall be equal to or exceed the
    amount of $7 million.

    For replenishment of the advance, the PIU will prepare monthly (in any case, no more than
    quarterly) requestsfor reimbursement of expenditures made.

      Additional Annex 11:Accomplishmentsof PROCYMAF I (1998-2001/2002)
                    MEXICO: CommunityForestry II (PROCYMAF II)

The PROCYMAF Iproject (Loan 4137-MX) (1997 - 2003) pursued goals similar to the
proposed PROCYMAF I1project inthe States of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoach. The main
aim of the project was to assist indigenous communities and ejidos living in forested areas to
better their standards of living through improving management and conservation of forest
resources and by increasing the range of options for entrance to local communities and ejidos
inregional, national and international markets. Specific objectives of the project were to: (i)
improve natural resource management and conservation by community and ejido forestry
resource owners; and (ii)   increase the range of forestry-based income generating options
available to them.
The main accomplishments achievedduring the project period are listed according to the main
activities proposed by the project:

(A) Strengthen the capacity of communities and ejidos to manage their forest resource
      base

Eligible communities and ejidos of Guerrero Michoach and Oaxaca received 454 technical
assistance studies during 1998 - 2003. Implementation began in Oaxaca in 1997. Activities
were first implemented in that State, with subsequent development of full-scale activities in
Guerrero and Michoachn in 2002. Oaxaca therefore had the longest sustained period of
implementation and around 350 communities and ejidos that received support under the
project.
The project also conducted 61 `Community to Community Seminars' (Seminarios de
comunidad a comunidad) during 1998-2003. These seminars are carried out in order to
improve the organizational and operative capacity of the participating communities through
the direct interchange of experiences acquired by those having had successful experiences in
implementing project strategies. In the same period a total of 113 `Participatory Rural
Evaluation Exercises' (evaluacionesrurales participativas) were conducted for communities to
help them identify their primary issues and improve their capacity to manage and conserve
their natural resources as acommunity.

   (B) Strengthen the capacity of the private sector to provide forestry services to
         communitiesand ejidos

   The project identified a pool of potential service providers from among interested and
   technically qualified professionals and organizations (consulting firms and NGOs) and
   assistedthemto raise their capacity to work with communities andejidos. They were selected
   among the skills impartedto these individuals or organizations were: community organization
   skills, environmental planning and forest management techniques, analysis of the biology of
   specific species, economic analysis, technical assistancefor community enterprises, etc. Over
   the project period a roster of some 156 professional consultants, including both individual
   specialists, small firms, andNGOs has been established. These providers have all participated
   inaPROCYMAFtraining course, andhave beencertified as service providers. Many of these
   service providers have also participated in ongoing training called "Continuing Education".
   The latter component offers scholarships to qualified and interested providers to strengthen
   their skills inspecific areas demandedby the communities.

(C) Design strategies to promote timber, non-timber, and nontraditional products from
      community and ejidoforests:

A number of strategies for the promotion of timber, non-timber, and nontraditional products
were developed and thought through a number of capacitating courses. For the year 2002 a
total of 69 courses were carried out. Furthermore a total of 312 technical studies were carried
out in specific communities during the entire project period.

               Additional Annex 12: EnvironmentalAssessment Report
                    MEXICO: Community ForestryII (PROCYMAF II)

Paragraph 10 of OP4.36 stipulates the requirements of a sound forest management strategy
necessary for any independent scheme but also that serve as benchmarks for community
management schemes. The following paragraphs analyze the principal requisites of sound
forest management, usingOP4.36 as a guide, showing how the proposed project would

a) Compliance with relevant laws

Any forest management initiative supported (directly or indirectly) under the project will be
required to demonstrate the proponent community has complied with pertinent national
legislation. Project resourceswould be withheld from subprojects out of compliance with law
except where it can be demonstrated that compliance i s pending and that the necessary steps
leading to compliance have been taken. Under Mexican law, harvesting of timber or other
forest products and other management practices require prior submission of Forest
Management Plans (FMPs) preparedby qualified professionals. The forest owner must file an
"Notice of Forest Use" (Aviso de Aprovechamiento), a Forest Management Plan (FMP), for
review by a local office of the Federal Environmental Secretariat (SEMARNAT) to receive a
license for the proposed activity. Many forest owners, particularly impoverished indigenous
communities and ejidos find the preparation of FMPs expensive and complicated and may
skirt such measures or to forego FMPs altogether. SEMARNAT, and its enforcement arm
PROFEPA, do not have the manpower to review each plan in situ, nor to follow up on
compliance with license restrictions.     These conditions discourage forest management
planning, encourage illegality, and are ineffective as a deterrent to unsustainable practices.
FMP's can be financed under programs supported by CONAFOR, particularly PRODEFOR.
The Legal Agreement will provide for supplemental financing by PROCYMAF I1 for
preparation of FMPs and related documents if PRODEFOR financing i s not available in a
timely fashion.

b)Recognition of and respectfor any legally documented or customary land tenure and
use rights as well as the rights of indigenouspeoplesand workers

Indigenous communities and ejidos are guaranteed landrights under Mexican law. In some
cases, there are competing land claims by neighboring communities or ejidos. Until such
conflicts can be resolved, the PROCYMAF I1project will normally refrain from providing
support for forest management or exploitation inside the disputed areas.           However,
PROCYMAF promotores would be trained to recognize cases of land conflict and may take
some measures to help reduce tensions and to refer communities embroiled in conflict to
appropriate sources of assistancefor conflict management.

Most of the labor utilized for forestry activities in ejidos and indigenous communities i s
suppliedby community members. There i s little risk of labor exploitation. Some community
labor i s unpaid labor donated by community members as part of their tequio, or community
service obligation. Inother cases, members are paid for their work at rates set by communal
decision. Water-bottling plant workers in Oaxaca, for example, are paid at about 150% of the
minimum wage. The project will take measures to avoid the use of child labor, specially
where such activities interfere with schooling. Some communities also use non-community
members as workers, mainly unskilled workers paid at a daily rate or per production. It

                                            60

appears from inquiries that such workers are paid at local market rates, normally slightly
higher than legally required minimum wages. Such workers do not normally receive the
benefits of formal-sector workers as required under national labor legislation. Under the
project measures will be taken to bring community enterprises into compliance with labor
legislation, first aid and other services.

It would be virtually impossible to raise labor standards in poor indigenous communities and
ejidos to the full standards of the Mexican formal-sector labor force in the context of the
proposed project. However, in order to upgrade these standards in communities benefiting
from investments or technical assistance for utilization of forest resources, the PROCYMAF
project team would undertaketwo measures:

(i) eachcommunityreceivingbenefitsthatindirectlyordirectlyinvolveextractionof
    require
forest resources to include a Statement of Commitment, between communities and
CONAFOR, in which the community pledges to pay wages in a timely fashion, in,cash,
equivalent to regionally prevailing wages for comparable tasks; take measures to avoid child
labor in detriment of health or school attendance; and to provide appropriate personal
protection gear to workers, etc.

(ii) technicalassistancetocommunitiesrequiringimprovements inlaborpractices.
    provide
This could include development of schemes that allow children to help their parents in their
work but not expose them to risky activities or keep them out of school. This would involve
adding relevant experts to the PROCYMAF roster.

c) Measures to maintain or enhance sound and effective community relations

A substantial portion of the project's resources are devoted to strengthening community
governance and building capacity for communal decision making. (See Section SUPPLY).
The PROCYMAF I1project, like its predecessor, i s designed around community participation.
No subproject or other activities are undertakenwithout an official action by the community
or ejidos assembly.

d) Conservation of biologicaldiversity andecological functions

Among the technical inputs available to communities under PROCYMAF Iand I1are the
creation of community protected areas which for cultural or environmental are maintained
within the community or ejido lands without direct use or, if appropriate, specific low
intensity uses. Many communities have sought to protect sensitive areas within their lands,
particularly those where there are watersheds, rare or endangered species present or special
cultural concerns.      The project would provide support for general land-use zoning;
identification, demarcation and management of protected areas. The related Indigenous and
Community Biodiversity Project (COINBIO) provides similar support that would be
coordinated with PROCYMAF. Under both PROCYMAF Iand COINBIO, support has been
provided to help communities manage specific species that are useful or considered at risk. In
addition, the COINBIO National Coordinator intends to seek a form of official recognition of
protected areas within indigenous lands and ejidos. This could potentially make communities
and ejidos eligible for benefits under schemes to compensate landowners for environmental
services.


                                            61

e) Measures to maintainor enhance environmentally sound multiple benefits accruing
from the forest

One of the main goals of the PROCYMAF program is diversification of the use of forest
resources by indigenous communities and ejidos as means of increasing income, as a way of
reducing the pressure on any single resource, and finally as a means of increasing the value of
the standing forest. Among the specific activities aimed at diversification, the PROCYMAF I
project has supported such activities as mushroom production, pine-resin production, bottled
water production, ecotourism, and studies aimed at the management and conservation of other
forest resources including plants and animals. The proposed project would continue such
activities and seek additional diversified opportunities for sustainable use of forest resources.
In addition, PROCYMAF I1 would support studies and pilot projects for payment for
environmental services under which communities could seek compensation for such services
such as pure water, biodiversity protection, or carbon sequestration.

f) Preventionor minimization of the adverse environmental impactsfromforest use

The project would not support any activity leading to the conversion of forested areas to other
uses; in addition by supporting activities that add value to the standing forest and diversifying
the use of forest resources, the project would contribute to the sustainablemanagementof
forest properties and to reduced attractivenessof alternate landuses.

g) Effective forest managementplanning

The entry point for forest communities in PROCYMAF is the conduct of Participatory Rural
Appraisal (PRA) which normally leads to land-use zoning exercises.               In nearly every
community served by PROCYMAF I,          landis set aside for conservation or light management
particularly around streamheads, along water courses, in areas of high biodiversity or in areas
with high cultural significance to the community. Other areas are designated for resource
extraction at levels of intensity designed to maintain ecosystem integrity and a steady source
of income. PROCYMAF I1would help communities to strengthen their decision making
capacity, after which such communities would receive the necessarytechnical assistance from
the project itself, or other CONAFOR programs to develop a comprehensive management
plan consistent with best practice under Mexican law. The project would also offer assistance
to communities and ejidos seekingto achieve FSC certificationfor their forests.

h)Active monitoring andassessmentof relevant forest management areas; and

The project would sponsor a comprehensive social and environmental baseline study, with
two additional studies at two-year intervals to measure changes over time and to review the
impacts of the project. These would include such variables as changes in forest cover,
measures of forest health, areas under effective land-use zoning or management plans,
possibly the abundanceof designatedindicator species, etc.




                                              62

i)Maintenanceofcriticalforestareasandothercriticalnaturalhabitatsaffectedbythe
operation.

The project would apply screening procedures to avoid any interference with critical natural
habitats. Project support for protected areas such as UMAS hasbeendescribed above.

Under Mexican law, harvesting of timber or other forest products and other management
practices require prior submission of Forest Management Plans (FMPs) prepared by qualified
professionals.    The forest owner must file an "Notice of Forest Use" (aviso de
aprovechamiento), a kind of Forest Management Plan (FMP), for review by a local office of
the Federal Environmental Secretariat (SEMARNAT) to receive a license for the proposed
activity. Many forest owners, particularly impoverished indigenous communities and ejidos
find the preparation of FMPs expensive and complicated and may skirt such measures or to
forego FMPs altogether. SEMARNAT, and its enforcement arm PROFEPA, do not have the
manpower to review each plan in situ, and to follow up on compliance with license
restrictions. These conditions discourage forest management planning, encourage illegality,
and are ineffective as adeterrent to unsustainablepractices.

                     MEXICO: Community ForestryII (PROCYMAFII)

1. Introduction

The Mexico Community Forestry Project (PROCYMAF) has, at this point, achieved most of
its objectives to varying degrees of success and i s entering its second stage. PROCYMAF I1
aims at widening and deepeningthe scope of the challenges of its predecessor. It would work
with a greater number and a greater diversity of indigenous communities in the Mexican
States of Oaxaca, Guerrero andMichoacin, which were already covered under PROCYMAF I
andwould expand its reachto the states of Jalisco, Durango and Quintana Roo.
In order to ensure the adequate participation and assistance of the Mexican indigenous
population, a strategy has been developed that considers the specific conditions of each group.
Such conditions include, but are not limited to, social, economic and political organization
around natural resources, labor divisions, history, state of surrounding environment, as well as
the overall relationship with the Spanish language. Understanding and harnessing these
differences i s a key to the successfulimplementation of PROCYMAF 11.
2. Legalframework and indigenousrights
The PROCYMAF program exists within the context of several laws and ordinances that touch
upon the rights of indigenous peoples and the use of natural resources at federal and local
levels. Some examples are:
Articles 2 and 27 of the Mexican Constitution establish the basic rights for indigenous peoples
and the legal framework for land ownership, respectively. Article 2 recognizes the country as
having a multicultural composition, basedon the indigenous population, which the state must
recognize and protect through the promotion of indigenous culture, languages, organization
systems, etc. Article 2 further assures the right of the indigenous populationto participate in
agrarian proceedings involving land ownership issues through their own customs and
practices.
Article 27 deals with the types of land ownership in the country and establishes the existence
of property schemes central to PROCYMAF, such as ejidos and agrarian communities.
The Agrarian Law regulates article 27 of the Constitution; it spells out the rules and
regulations which govern the functioning of the above mentioned property schemes. Some
other relevant laws and codes include the Forestry Law, the Law of Ecological Equilibrium
and Environmental Protection, the Wildlife Law and diverse legal standardsknown as Normas
Oficiales Mexicanas.
None of the three new states under PROCYMAF 11have specific legislation related to
indigenous peoples and the environment, such as that found inMichoacin and Oaxaca.
Mexico has signed diverse international treaties that involve indigenous affairs, such as
Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization and the Convention on Biological
Diversity.
3. Basicinformation
The Social Evaluation study for PROCYMAF I1 involved the use of several different
information gathering tools. Careful consideration of the information on indigenous peoples
contained in this study i s important for the successful implementation of the new program.

                                             64

The census data, shows significant indigenous population percentages in each of the new
PROCYMAF states (See PAD Section B, Table 1). Common to the three states i s the
presence of important nucleuii of indigenous populations, and in the three cases this
population has an important presenceinthe forested areas. InDurango, for example, the areas
proposed for action concentrate close to 70% of the total state's indigenous population,
whereas in Quintana Roo and Jalisco the indigenous population has migrated to urban areas in
great numbers during the last 10 years. In these two states however, the remaining rural-
dwelling indigenous populations reside mainly inregions to be coveredby PROCYMAF 11.
4. Socioeconomicprofile of the new PROCYMAFstates
Durango - Inthe forested regions of Durango, the ejido i s the main form of land ownership.
Population density i s low and the population shows a highly dispersed pattern. Economic
activities are mainly forest based, although small-scale agriculture also contributes to
household income. Inthe Mezquital region, the indigenous population i s a majority and the
agrarian community i s the prevalent form of ownership, though ejidos are not entirely absent.
Jalisco - There i s great diversity in the socio-economic and cultural conditions of the forested
regions of Jalisco. There are areas of low indigenous presence as well as high. Inthese latter
areas, agrarian communities are also prevalent and inter-ethnic conflict over land property
issuesoccurs frequently.
Quintana Roo - The Maya population has a high presence in the north of this state, and
mainly presents a pattern of subsistence agriculture as well as a long history of chicle
production, although forest extraction i s also practiced in the areas where mahogany and cedar
can be found. Migrationto tourism centers in this state i s an economic strategy with growing
popularity. In the South, on the other hand, indigenous presence is low and the ejido i s the
exclusive form of land ownership.
5. Organizationand landownership forms
There are several different complex forms of land ownership in Mexico and a complete
analytical comparison i s beyond the scope of this work, but some of the more pertinent
differences are important to point out:
Agrarian communities tend to be more inclusive than ejidos, in terms of who participates in
the decision-making processes. Furthermore, conflict tends to arise more easily in ejidos or
agrarian communities that encompass several settlements than the ones that have only one.
Therefore, PROCYMAF 11will favor working with single communities and be careful when
dealing with multi-community schemes and seek the highest level of consensus possible
among these communities prior to any interventions. Finally, ejidos and communities, where
the traditional system of government by cargos (civil-religious roles) i s deeply rooted and
better organized, tend to be more functional and efficient and commitment to common
objectives tends to be stronger.
6. Indigenous participation strategy
Inorder to begin the work of PROCYMAF I1inthe new regions, it is essential to take into
account their ethnic and organizational conditions. To this end, three regional workshops
were carried out in each of the new states (the minutes of these meetings, in Spanish, are
attached [Annex 151).
Given the success that the participation strategy of PROCYMAF Ihad in the state of Oaxaca,
PROCYMAF I1will follow the same program lines, with some adaptations to the specific

                                               65

conditions.     Some of the characteristics of this program are:         formation of Regional
Committees, as a tool to promote information and knowledge sharing and trust between
communities, thus building social capital. InOaxaca such committees have proven to be very
useful tools for promoting "ownership" of the program, in some cases even serve as
mechanisms for dispute resolution. Intense field promotionhas been central to the success of
PROCYMAF, as a source of local knowledge about the conditions and needs of specific
groups.    Promotion efforts have effectively complemented the regional committees and
facilitated the knowledge sharing efforts of the community-to-community program. These
practices will be maintained andextendedinPROCYMAF II.
 Finally, PROCYMAF I1will make use appropriate communication media for disseminating
information, focusing on the media most widely usedin the participating regions (i.e. posters
and radio) and working with indigenous languagesAS neededand appropriate.
7. Strategic lines

The strategic lines proposed inthis document are a result of information compiledinthe three
previously mentioned workshops as well as through interviews and fieldwork inthe regions
proposed for PROCYMAF 11. These lines have also been included inthe social assessment.
There are a number of themes that arose inthe three workshops and are common to the three
states. These include the demand for training the populations of ejidos and agrarian
communities intopics like fire prevention, certificationschemes, forest resources
management, accounting techniques and business administration. Commonto the three states
i s the need to buildsocial capital through inter- and intra- community knowledge sharingand
through participatory decision-making processes. Some needs specific to each state were also
identified, particularly for Jalisco (i.e. support for ecotourism development and deer
protection schemes) and Quintana Roo (Le. agro-forestry systems development andtropical
forest-specific managementtraining).

8. Institutional commitment
The National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) will be the implementing agency for
PROCYMAF 11. Although it has no formal responsibility for indigenous affairs, such affairs
are highly influenced by CONAFOR's actions, due the fact that a high percentage of the
population that inhabits forested areas is of indigenous origin. Nevertheless, other agencies,
such as state-level environmental ministries and protected areas authorities are also highly
influential. CONAFOR has recruited a number of indigenouspromotores and others who are
familiar with andhighly sensitizedto conditions inindigenous communties and ejidos.
9. Institutional capacity for project implementation
The project depends greatly on the capacity of local professionals to provide services to
indigenous communities. The six different states in question have different conditions in
terms of institutional capacity for the implementation of PROCYMAF.               Durango, for
example, i s limited in terms of human capital, in contrast to Quintana Roo, where a tradition
of forest management professionals exists. In Jalisco, the local State University and that of
neighboring Colima would provide support for the implementation of PROCYMAF I1
programs. Michoacin has both an important number of forestry technicians and academic
institutions able to provide the human capital. The PROCYMAF roster would seek services
providers inthese institutions.



                                               66

     10.Monitoringand evaluation
     A monitoring and evaluation component, including monitoring by an independent entity is
     included in this new stage of the program. Financingi s assuredinthe project budget.
     Regional committees constitute the natural spaces for monitoring and evaluation of the
     program. In addition, the PROCYMAF - the implementation team would follow up and
     evaluateproject impact as well as PROCYMAF's formal structure.
     11.Risksofprogramimplementation innewindigenousregions,possiblemitigation
     measuresand agents responsiblefor the actions

     -   An increase in the marginalization of certain communities arising from the selectivity in
     groups benefitingfrom PROCYMAF.
     -   The increase ininter- and intra- group conflict (mainly inJalisco and Durango) over land
     ownership related issues or from possible operational and administrative malfunctions within
    PROCYMAF.
     -   The marginalization of the young population in indigenous communities is a risk if the
    program i s not implementedor if it neglectsthese population segments.

     There i s also a risk that PRODEFOR (a similar program also carried out by CONAFOR - see
    Box 1 in PAD) attracts such a large pool of qualified forest technicians so as to lower the
     standards within PROCYMAF. Coordination of both programs i s key to avoid this scenario.

0   Support for fire preventionandprotection activities that could complement similar activities that exist
    inother projects.
0   Support for lower altitude areas with tropical anddry forests that are not contemplated in other
    programs.
0   Support for investment projects to renovate the industrial stock that complement existing investments
    andcontribute value adding to forest products (i.e. carpenter shops, wood molders, computing
    equipment).
0   Promotion of certified products and protection of localproducers from the competition of less
    expensive importedproducts.
0   Support innegotiatingschemes of resource combination for the financing of larger investment
    projects.
0   Support for restoration and management of projects for environmentalservices relatedto water in
    urbanareas.

The following propositions were made:

    0   Projects needto have a larger reach, with more resources and a real impact on producers at the
        local level. Furthermore, proposals shouldhave good technical foundations andbe economically
        feasible.
    0   There needs to be assurancethat resourcesreach producers directly and are not lost to
        intermediaries.
    0   There should be pilot projects for protection against water run-off usingfruit trees.

Referringto causes of the forest sector crisis in Durango, the following explanations were presented:

    0   There has been a reduction in the authorized volumes of timber at a time when the need for
        resources at the ejido level was high.
    0   Foreign forest products with lower prices have pouredinto the market.
    0   There has been inadequate management of forests dating back to the concessions period, leadingto
        reduced volumes available for harvesting.

The following thoughts were presented inrelation to the processesand activities that are required inorder
to strengthen forest organizations and ejidos:

                                                     71

         Capacity buildinginitiatives are neededfor producers for every level of the production chain, as
         well as for other primary productive activities.
         Needs andrequirements for capacity buildingshould take into account the particular
         characteristics of each Union and ejido (usingthe PRODEFORtypology).
         Training i s neededintopics like commercializationand administration.
         The regionalization scheme developedby the social consultancy was recommended. Based onthis
         scheme, a diagnostic process at the regional level should be developed, inorder to identify needs
         andpriorities of organizations, ejidos andcommunities.
         Itwas suggestedthat the PROCYMAF process should be linkedto CONAFOR's "Productive
         Chains" initiative, in order to improve the industrialinfrastructureof ejidos and communities.
         Itis necessaryto support the searchfor alternatives inforest andnaturalresource management.
         Economic resources are neededfor the acquisition of infrastructure that supports the
         industrialization and modernizationprocess of ejidos.
         Process integration should be promotedto correct the current situation in which social forest
         production i s highly fragmented.
         Along these same lines, the integration of ejidos was also recommended in order to reduce
         production costs.
         A strategy needsto bedesignedto modernize anddiversify productive activities inejidos and
         forest communities.
         There needs to be a change with the "utility sharing" culture in ejidos.
         The promotion of evaluation andreflectionactivities inside ejidos was recommendedto achieve
         the cultural change mentioned inthe previous point.
         Each ejido andcommunity shoulddecide the process or project that it wishes to follow, especially
         when faced with the dilemma of modernizationand efficiency on one side andhighlevels of
         employment on the other.
         The level of organization reflects the ejido's activities.
         There i s a need to elaborate ejido- and organization- specific diagnostics inorder to properly
         identify their needs andpriorities.

strengthening of community management, the weight of sustainability inthe use of their forests andthe
need to generate regional instruments to increase social capital amongst the forest dwellers. The need to
design mechanisms to market environmentalservices was also discussed, mainly relatedto water provision
insub- andmicro- watershedsinsomeof the regions ofJalisco andthe needto have institutional
arrangements with the involved municipalities. It was also mentioned that PROCYMAFI1could begin
execution in some regions of Jalisco from the year 2004 onwards, if negotiations with the World Bank are
