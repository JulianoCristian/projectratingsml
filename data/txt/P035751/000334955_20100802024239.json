Ratings for the Second\n            Community Forestry Project for Mexico are as follows:\n            outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: improved stewardship of natural resources is\n            probably the main contribution of community forestry in\n            Mexico. Community forestry will not wipe out rural poverty\n            in Mexico because the program is necessarily limited to\n            communities with abundant forests and no land conflicts; and\n            even in these communities incomes from forest activities\n            will always make up only a small share of total incomes. Nor\n            by itself will community forestry reverse the declining\n            supply and lack of competitiveness of timber in Mexico. But\n            it is an important part of the broader effort to protect the\n            natural resource base. There are no quick fixes for building\n            community capacity and institutional arrangements to manage\n            and conserve forests. Plugging technical and infrastructure\n            gaps is easy compared to the work of building trust in\n            communities that have been ill served by Mexican governments\n            for decades. The hefty contribution made by Procymaf\n            communities to training and investment initiatives, the\n            broad-based participation in land zoning exercises and the\n            significant survival rate of the forest enterprises\n            established by Procymaf is the best evidence yet that the\n            programs are building capacity and sustainable institutional\n            arrangements. It is important to embed support to individual\n            communities within a broader framework that strengthens\n            cooperation between communities and municipal and state\n            governments and develops a network of professional expertise\n            on forest-centered activities."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
