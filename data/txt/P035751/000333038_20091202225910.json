Some lessons\n            learned included: the project helped beneficiaries to\n            capitalize on their natural resource assets and bring focus\n            to their community development process. Many of the\n            communities had been affected by long-standing conflicts\n            regarding land tenure, and high emigration rates. The\n            forestry activities and investment opportunities provided by\n            the project resulted in a positive focus for the\n            communities, while generating greater income and employment\n            opportunities. The project provided a solid platform for the\n            expansion of conservation and sustainable land management in\n            globally important ecosystems through its zoning, forest\n            management, and conservation plans. The incorporation of\n            increasing areas of forests using these instruments is\n            conducive to environmentally and socially-sustainable\n            economic development of the sector. The community forestry\n            sector does not exist in isolation from the regional,\n            national, and international/global forestry markets. Mexico\n            continues to be a net importer of wood and increasingly, the\n            national forest sector is challenged by the presence of\n            low-cost or competitively priced wood and paper products\n            from such remote places as Chile and Uruguay. As community\n            forestry enterprises develop their growth will be\n            increasingly challenged and guided by this competition.\n            Several communities supported by CFP II entered into\n            voluntary certification programs. However, there are few\n            financial incentives for doing so and transaction costs for\n            certification are high. Communities that rely on local or\n            national markets have difficulty using their certification\n            to gain market share, improve prices or find niches.\n            Increased efforts are needed to develop market mechanisms\n            and create financial incentives for certified wood."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
