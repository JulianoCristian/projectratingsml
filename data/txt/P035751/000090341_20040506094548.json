The\n            project's specific objectives are (i) to strengthen\n            community institutions by means of the consolidation of\n            social capital and management capacity to improve the\n            benefits flowing from use of forest resources; (ii) to\n            strengthen technical and administrative capacity of ejidos\n            and communities for the development of local and regional\n            productive processes; (iii) to identify and develop\n            investment alternatives and productive diversification for\n            communities and ejidos, and to promote local and regional\n            arrangements to facilitate access by these communities to\n            schemes for payment for environmental services. The areas\n            were selected on a basis of the presence of high value\n            standing forest resources owned by indigenous communities or\n            ejidos. The potential benefits include strengthening of\n            community decision-making processes, higher income from\n            forest production, and diversification of household incomes.\n            PROCYMAF I assisted approximately 300 communities and ejidos\n            in the States of Guerrero, MichoacBn and Oaxaca. It is\n            expected that the new project will assist an additional 200\n            communities and ejidos on a demand-driven basis, and\n            continue assistance to some of the 300 original communities.\n            Eventually, additional states fitting the same description\n            as above could be incorporated into the project conditional\n            on the availability of funds and staff."}, "docdt": "2003-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
