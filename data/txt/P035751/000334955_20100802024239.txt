 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.

About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
 lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk t o Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Perfonnance Assessment Report (PPAR) examines two back-to-back
community forestry projects in Mexico. The Community Forestry Project (total cost
US$18.4 million) was supported by an IBRD Loan (No. 4137) of US$15 million. The
loan was approved on February 18, 1997 and closed on December 3 1, 2003, 18 months
behind schedule. The Second Community Forestry Project (total cost US$26.2 million)
was supported by an IBRD loan (No. 7207) of US$21.3 million. The loan was approved
on December 9,2003 and closed on December 3 1, 2008, about six months later than
expected.

The PPAR was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). It was based on
review of the project appraisal and completion reports, the Loan Agreements, background
studies and academic literature, as well as discussions with beneficiaries, government
officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations, academic researchers and
Bank staff. John R. Heath conducted the assessment mission in Mexico in February 20 10,
visiting various project sites in the states of Jalisco and Oaxaca. He was assisted by
Arturo Puente Gonzalez (IEG Consultant), who prepared a report on the competitiveness
of community forest enterprises assisted by the two projects. A list of all those
interviewed by IEG is attached at Annex C of this report. The cooperation and assistance
of all stakeholders, particularly the National Forestry Commission (Conafor) and the staff
of its Community Forestry Program (Procymaf), is gratefully acknowledged; as is the
support of the World Bank Country Office in Mexico.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to relevant
government officials for their review and comments. Comments from the Borrower were
taken into account and included in Annex D.

Summary
This report assesses the performance of the First and Second Community Forestry
Projects in Mexico, which supported a government sector strategy based on
decentralizing the management of forests through the promotion of indigenous
communities and ejidos (communal properties created through land reform) that own
forestland. About 10,000 communities own over two-thirds of Mexico's forestland.
Between 0.5 to 2.0 percent of the forest stock is subject to deforestation each year,
emphasizing the importance of improved strategies of management and conservation that
involve the owners of forestland. The design of the two projects was based on lessons
learned from an unsuccessful Bank-supported forestry operation in the early 1990s. The
failure of this operation drew attention to the following issues: the need for a more
decentralized approach to project preparation, including participation by state
governments; the advisability of starting out with a small-scale, pilot operation; and the
requirement to communicate more effectively with non-governmental organizations,
which had criticized the Bank for failing to give a more central role to the indigenous
communities that occupied much of the land in the project area.

The objectives of the two projects were essentially the same:

    0   Objective (A) sought to improve natural resource management and conservation
        by community/ej ido forestry resource owners;
        Objective (B) aimed to increase the range of forestry-based income generating
        options available to community/ejido forestry resource owners.

The projects supported the work of the National Forestry Commission (Conafor) and its
community forestry program (Procymaf). The first project covered the states of Guerrero,
Jalisco, Michoacan, Oaxaca, and (partially) Chihuahua and Durango. The second project
covered six states: Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo.

The components for the two projects can be sorted into the following categories: (i)
community strengthening, which involved training and technical assistance activities,
with a strong emphasis on sharing experiences between communities; (ii) diversijkation
into non-timber forest products, which involved diagnostic studies, subproject
investments and the design of payment schemes for environmental services (carbon
sequestration, groundwater recharge, soil erosion control); (iii) development of a roster of
proven private sector forestry professionals providing services to the communities; and
(iv) project management, comprising a central implementation unit in Mexico City and
affiliated units in the participating states.

Outcome is rated moderately satisfactory for the first project and satisfactory for the
second project. Although output targets related to community capacity building were
exceeded by both projects, the evidence of outcomes is less complete for the first project
than for the second project. The first project specified few outcome indicators. With
respect to Objective (A), the area target for bringing forest under sustainable management
was only half-met. In the case of Objective (B), there is no indication how the "success"
of forest enterprises was measured and it is not clear how many of these enterprises were
still operating at the time of the assessment mission. By contrast, for the second project,
                                              xii


outcome targets were more clearly defined and, in most cases, exceeded. In particular,
over two-thirds of forest enterprises supported by subproject investments approved five
years ago were still operating in early 2010. The single most important category of
subproject was ecotourism, consistent with the objective of diversifying forest-based
incomes away from timber harvesting. Objectives were substantially relevant for both
projects. Also, for both projects, the financial rates of return were generally higher than
expected at appraisal. The final cost of the first and the second project was respectively
78 percent and 91 percent of the appraisal projection; given that output targets for both
projects were generally exceeded this is further evidence that resource use was
substantially efficient.

Both projects faced the same risk to development outcome and in both cases this is
rated moderate. Positive indications that the project results will be sustained include: the
creation of a dedicated community forestry unit in the National Forestry Commission; the
hefty contribution that communities have made to subproject costs; and the high survival
rate of timber and non-timber forest enterprises sponsored through subproject
investments. On the other hand, there is still a need to strengthen the business model in
order to build long-term competitiveness. Also, there is a concern that outmigration may
potentially sap the foundations laid by the two projects. In addition, near closing of the
second project there were substantial cuts in the pay of Procymaf promoters, which may
limit prospects for program consolidation in the twelve states now covered by the
program.

Bank performance is rated satisfactory for both projects. In general, the design of both
projects was solidly based on lessons learned from a previous (less successful) forestry
operation. For both projects, the level of consultation and collaboration with Mexican
counterparts was exceptionally high.

Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory for the first project and
satisfactory for the second project, the difference being based on the substantial delay in
the release of counterpart funding during the first project. During the course of the two
projects, the federal government remained committed to project objectives. This was
reflected in the passage of a new Forestry Law, creation of a National Forestry Strategy,
and set up of the National Forestry Commission (Conafor), which included creation of a
specialized community forestry unit. State governments were also generally supportive of
project objectives. The Procymaf leadership and the team of promoters have alike been
distinguished by their professional excellence and their dedication.

This assessment identifies three major lessons:

       Improved stewardship o natural resources is probably the main contribution o
                                 f                                                     f
       communityforestry in Mexico. Community forestry will not wipe out rural
       poverty in Mexico because the program is necessarily limited to communities
       with abundant forests and no land conflicts; and even in these communities
       incomes from forest activities will always make up only a small share of total
       incomes. Nor by itself will community forestry reverse the declining supply and
       lack of competitiveness of timber in Mexico. But it is an important part of the
       broader effort to protect the natural resource base. The community zoning plans
                                    xiii

successfully sponsored by Procymaf offer a platform for developing synergies
with the (well-funded, high-profile) schemes that are now paying for
environmental services.

There are no quick f i e s for building community capacity and institutional
arrangements to manage and conserve forests. Plugging technical and
infrastructure gaps is easy compared to the work of building trust in communities
that have been ill served by Mexican governments for decades. The hefty
contribution made by Procymaf communities to training and investment
initiatives, the broad-based participation in land zoning exercises and the
significant survival rate of the forest enterprises established by Procymaf is the
best evidence yet that the programs are building capacity and sustainable
institutional arrangements. But there is still a long way to go in fostering the
business acumen that communities need to develop and exploit the niche markets
for timber and non-timber goods and services.

It is important to embed support to individual communities within a broader
framework that strengthens cooperation between communities and municipal
 and state governments and develops a network o professional expertise on
                                                    f
forest-centered activities. Although Procymaf has so far made little headway with
 supply chain development with respect to timber processing, from the beginning,
 it emphasized the creation of regional forums which brought communities and
 state governments together to set priorities and discuss the allocation of
 investment resources. This framework supports the development of the
 complementary infrastructure (roads, schools) that will help to make forest
 communities more viable. Equally important is the assistance that Procymaf has
 given to building up networks of accredited private sector professionals able to
provide technical assistance to communities across the full spectrum of forest-
centered activities (not confined to harvesting timber).

    1. Background
    1.1     The First and Second Community Forestry Projects supported a government sector
    strategy based on decentralizing the management of forests through the promotion of
    communities that own forestland. Indigenous communities and land reform communities
    (ejidos) control between them over two-thirds of Mexico's forestlande2Since the 1980s'
    government strategy has focused on increasing the capacity of these two types of community
    to manage their forest resources. The approach assumes that that production and conservation
    are best tackled jointly. The strategy was first set out in the 1986 Forestry Law and has been
    reinforced by subsequent forest policy legislation, which has deregulated the forestry
    industry, liberalized forest technical services and promoted producer associations in the
    communitie~.~

    1.2     Up until the 1980s, Mexico's forests were managed as concessions granted by the
    government to private firms. Communities had no rights to manage their forests or harvest
    timber. They received a stumpage fee from the concessionaires, but the process for
    calculating the amount paid and who in the community received it was not transparent. The
    concession model encouraged overexploitation by firms and illegal logging by communities.
    The model sharply discounted the future because, after timber has been harvested, some
.   forest systems need 70 years or more to regenerate. The short-term bias of the concession
    system undermined both forestry and forest con~ervation.~

    1.3     Mexico's forests are a major natural resource and a significant source of livelihood,
    but they make up only a small part of the economy. Mexico ranks 12thworldwide in forest
    cover, with more than 65.6 million hectares of forests, accounting for about one-third of the
    national territory. The pine forests of Mexico are ecologically significant. Mexico contains
    about one-half of the 96 globally-registered species of pine, with 2 1 species that are
    endemics5About 10,000 communities own over two-thirds of forestlands6Roughly one-third
    of the area under forest (around 20 million hectares) is commercially viable. Only 9 million
    hectares are managed for production.




     1. In this report, unless otherwise indicated, "community" refers both to the indigenous communities, which
    predate the Spanish colonization, and to the land reform communities set up following the Mexican Revolution
    of 1910-1920 (ejidos). Members of both types of community have rights, stipulated under law, to an individual
    family plot allocated by the community as well as access to the communally-owned land (typically, forest,
    pastures, and waterways).
    2. Leticia Merino and Gerard0 Segura, in Leff, Escurra, Pisanty and Romero-Lankao (2002), p. 240, say that
    the area of forestland owned by ejidos and indigenous communities is 80 percent of the total; but the completion
    report for the second project gives a figure of 65 percent (World Bank (2009), p. 1). As a result of the radical
    land redistribution that followed the 1910-20 Revolution, 53 percent of Mexico's territory is classified as
    "social sector" land, meaning that it belongs either to indigenous or land reform communities.

1.4     Estimates of the rate of deforestation range from 300,000 to 1.2 million hectares per
year (0.5 to 2.0 percent of the forest stock)-moderately high by international standards,
although the trend appears to be downwards. 7

1.5    Officially, 300,000 people are employed in forestry, but this does not take account of
informal sector activity. Of the 13 million or so persons living in the forests, 55 percent are
extremely poor. Forestry generates 1.8 percent of GDP and the country is a net importer of
wood products (including paper), most imports coming from the United States, Chile and
Uruguay (Figure 1)'

1.6     Between 1997 and 2006 the national output of timber fell by 16 percent: pine (which
accounts for about three-quarters of total output) contracted by 23 percent and was offset by
an increase of 1 13 percent in the output of timber from tropical species. The decline in timber
output was particularly marked in the states of Michoachn (-54 percent) and Guerrero (-46
percent). Followin the signing of the free trade agreement with Chile, sawn wood imports
                           f
rose from 11,751 m in 1999 to 862,573 m3in 2005, before falling back to 383,775 m3in

deforestation is 300,000 hdyear. This is consistent with the figure cited in the current Country Partnership
Strategy, which gives a figure of 3 14,000 hdyear (World Bank, 2008, p. 28). The rate appears to have dropped
since the turn of the century. Merino and Segura (in Leff, Escurra, Pisanty and Romero-Lankao 2002, p. 239)

wood goes hand-in-hand with underuse of sawmill capacity (although many of these plants
are obsolete).

1.7     The National Forestry Commission (Conafor) is candid about Mexico's lack of
competitiveness relative to its main supplier of imported wood, Chile. In 2010 it estimated
that the f.0.b parity price of kiln-dried sawnwood in the sawmill yard was US$7.00 per board
foot in Chile, compared to US$8.30 per board foot in Mexico." Procymaf recognized this
challenge early on: "Prices of forest products from commercial plantations in South America
and Southeast Asia are around 30 percent lower than similar products from the most efficient
of Mexico's community forest enterprises". l 2

1.8     Sawnwood from Chilean commercial plantations is more competitive than the output
from equivalent plantations in Mexico: there is less wastage in the cut, dimensions are more
even, drying is more thorough and there are fewer variations in production costs. This
explains the upsurge of imports from Chile (facilitated by the free trade agreement with
Mexico that was signed in 1999). The Mexican product is able to compete to the extent that
markets are segmented and infrastructure deficiencies (particularly roads) raise the cost of
delivering the imported product to local markets. This source of protection will probably
diminish over time.

The World Bank and the Mexican Forest Sector
 1.9    The community forestry projects assessed aimed to incorporate lessons from the
unsuccessful Forestry Development Project, the Bank's first Mexican operation in this sector,
which was approved in August 1989 and closed in July 1994. The project focused on the
states of Chihuahua and Durango and sought to revitalize the forestry sector of those states
by improving road access, upgrading timber harvesting and processing, and strengthening
sector institutions. The project was shut down prematurely. The lessons drawn by the Bank
included: the need for a more decentralized approach to project preparation, including
participation by state governments; the advisability of starting out with a small-scale, pilot
operation; and the requirement to communicate more effectively with non-governmental
organizations, which had criticized the Bank for failing to give a more central role to the
indigenous communities that occupied much of the land in the project area.I3

1-10 Partially in response to the problems of the project, the Bank and the Mexican
government jointly carried out a wide-ranging review of the forest sector and natural
resource conservation. l 4 The review identified three major problems: deforestation and the
lack of a sustainable management strategy for forest resources; the declining competitiveness
of a sector severely challenged by the removal of trade barriers in the 1980s; and the lack of
alignment between the ownership of forestland (most of which belongs to indigenous and
agrarian reform communities) and the distribution of the rents obtained from forestry. l 5

1.11 The design of community forestry projects was informed by this critique and was
based on the following guiding principles:

         Respect for the customs and administrative structures of communities that control the
         bulk of forestland;
         Support for decentralized, demand-driven community development, based on a
         strategy that takes into account variations in the development level of forestry in the
         various communities (stratification into four groups);
         Development of a cadre of private-sector forestry professionals capable of providing
         long-term technical assistance to the communities. l 6

1.12 The 1993 Bank forestry policy emphasized conservation of tropical moist forest
rather than timber harvesting. This helped steer Bank intervention in Mexico away from the
tropics toward areas of pine oak; and (in the case of the first community forestry project at
least) removed the option of including investment projects involving timber harvesting.
Oaxaca was selected as the starting point for the new forestry project because it had a long
history of community mobilization and community development. Oaxaca became the
"laboratory" of Mexico's community forest program (Procymaf).


2. Project Overview
0bjectives
2.1     In terms of the formal statement of objectives there was little difference between the
two projects. For thefirst project, the Loan Agreement stated that: "The objectives of the
Project are to: (a) improve natural resource management and conservation by Community
and Ejido forestry resource owners in Mexico; and (b) increase the range of forestry-based
income generating options available to such owners". For the second project, the Loan
Agreement stated that: "The objective of the Project is to assist Communities and Ejidos who
own forests in Priority Regions in the Participating States to improve the management and
conservation of their forest resources and to generate alternative sources of income in a
sustainable manner". Statements in the appraisal documents provide more detail on project
objective^.'^

 16. Merino, Rodriguez, Ortiz and Garcia (2008), pp, 192-193.
 17. The full statements are as follows. Community Forestry Project: "The overall objective of the project is to
support the implementation of the key elements in the government's refined natural resource management
strategy. Specific objectives of the project are to: (a) improve natural resource management and conservation by
community and ejido forestry resource owners; and (b) increase the range of forestry-based income generating
activities available to them. To this end, the project would (a) strengthen the capacity of communities and ejidos
to manage their forestry resource base; (b) strengthen the capacity of the private sector to provide forestry
services to communities and ejidos; (c) design strategies to promote timber, non-timber, and non-traditional
products from community and ejido forests; and (d) strengthen the federal and state institutions working in
forestry conservation and development" (World Bank, 1997, p. 13). Second Community Forestry Project:
"The general objective.. .is to assist indigenous communities and ejidos that own forests in priority regions of
Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoachn, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo to improve the management and

    2.2     This assessment considers how each project performed in responding to the two
    objectives common to both:

            (A) Improve natural resource management and conservation by community/ej ido
            forestry resource owners; and
            (B) Increase the range of forestry-based income generating options available to
            community/ejido forest resource owners.

conservation of their forest resources and to generate alternative sources of income in sustainable manner. The
project's specipc objectives are (i) to strengthen community institutions by means of the consolidation of social
capital and management capacity to improve the benefits flowing from the use of forest resources; (ii) to
strengthen technical and administrative capacity of ejidos and communities for the development of local
regional and productive processes; (iii) to identify and develop investment alternatives and productive
diversification for communities and ejidos, and to promote local and regional arrangements to facilitate access
by these communities to schemes for payment for environmental services" (World Bank, 2003, p. 2).

Components

2.3     The components for the two projects (Table 2) may be sorted into four categories.
First, Community Strengthening involved training and technical assistance activities intended
to support: preparation of management plans for timber harvesting, reforestation, and
resource conservation; forestry research; control of fire and insects; boundary demarcation
and land use zoning; conflict management; and access to credit, markets and technologies.
There was a strong emphasis on sharing experiences between communities, including joint
training exercises. Also, consultants assisted communities in drafting by-laws for community
governance.

2.4     Second, Diverszjkation covered diagnostic studies, subproject investments and the
design of payment schemes for environmental services (such as carbon sequestration,
groundwater recharge, soil conservation). Under the first project (1997-2003), subproject
investments were limited to non-timber forest products, reflecting the Bank's 1993 forestry
policy, which discouraged timber harvesting generally (even though it was aimed at humid
tropical forests of the sort not included in the first community forest operation). The second
project (2003-2008) financed timber subprojects as well as those devoted to non-timber
forest products.

2.5     Third, although not included as a discrete component under the second project, both
operations financed the Training of Private Service Providers. Through a process of training
and accreditation the aim was to consolidate the roster of forestry professionals providing
services to the communities. These private consultants helped communities to develop forest
production and conservation strategies. Particular emphasis was given to broadening the
training of professionals, adding environmental management capacity to the existing
(dominant) repertoire of production forestry skills.

2.6    Fourth, various Project Management Activities were financed, including a central
implementation unit in Mexico City and affiliated units in the participating states. These units
were responsible for procurement, auditing and monitoring and evaluation. In the first project
this component financed studies, conducted in Oaxaca, of deforestation and forestry-related
community income.

2.7     Under the first project, Component C funded forty-three Non-Timber Forest Product
subprojects (NTFPs), including bottled water, pine resin, mushrooms, medicinal plants and
ecotourism. Under the second project, the Component C diversification investments included
the design of schemes for paying for environmental services.

2.8     Table 3 aims to facilitate comparison of the two projects, showing differences in the
cost breakdown. The administrative overhead was lower in the second project (but still
significant) and the share of total project costs devoted to investment subprojects was higher.

Timing and Geographic Scope
2.9     The loan for the first project became effective in November 1997 and closed in
December 2003. The loan for the second project became effective in July 2004 and closed in
December 2008. The first project covered the states of Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoach,
Oaxaca, and (partially) Chihuahua and Durango. The second project covered six states:
Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoach, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo. Project implementation
began in Oaxaca (on a pilot basis) in 1998, gradually spreading to Guerrero and Michoachn
(where work began in 2001), and followed by Jalisco (2003). Durango and Chihuahua
entered towards the end of the first project; and Quintana Roo entered during the second

project. A third project (which is presently financed solely by the government but may
eventually attract fresh Bank funding) adds a further six states to the six covered by the
second project. Thus, 12 of the 32 states in Mexico now fall within the remit of the
community forestry program.

2.10 Each project targeted selected communities in areas of pine oak forest.18 The projects
deliberately excluded communities with forest resources of limited commercial value, as well
as those embroiled in boundary conflicts. In the six states it covered, the second project
carried out activities in two-thirds of all communities, and 91 percent of communities where
the majority of inhabitants take part in forest-related activities. This still only provided
coverage of 17 percent of the total forest area in these states; given that, nationwide,
communities control over two-thirds of forest area, this is some indication of the large share
of forestland that is not of prime commercial value-and therefore did not qualify for
inclusion in the project."

Institutional Framework
2.1 1 Until 2000, oversight of the forestry sector lay with the Environment Secretariat
(Semarnap; subsequently renamed Semarnat) and its enforcement arm, Profepa.
Responsibility for the Community Forestry Development Program (ProcymaQ-which
embraces the two projects assessed in this report-was initially vested in Semarnap but
shifted to the National Forestry Commission (Conafor) following that agency's launch in
April 2001, Conafor has a mandate to promote sustainable forestry and forest resource
conservation. According to its charter, the functions of Conafor include: (a) stimulating the
organization of forest producers; and (b) promoting production forestry through projects
intended to create jobs and incomes in forest communities. Semarnat and Profepa remain
responsible for promoting and enforcing environmental legislation while the National
Biodiversity Council (Conabio) promotes natural resource conservation. The Forestry Law,
passed by Congress in December 2002, provided a long-term planning framework and aimed
to strengthen and decentralize institutions charged with protecting and managing forests.20

2.12 The Procymaf projects had a two-tier management structure consisting of a central
coordinating unit (UCP) based in Mexico City and decentralized project implementing units
(UIPs) based in the participating states. The Oaxaca UIP was the first to be set up (in 1998),
followed by other units in the states of Guerrero and Michoach (established in 2002), and in
the state of Jalisco (created in 2003). UCP's responsibilities included coordination of the
state programs, collation and dissemination of project performance data received from the
state offices, liaison with other departments of government and with the World Bank, and
conduct of monitoring and evaluation studies. The UIPs were responsible for statewide
promotion of the program and for the preparation and implementation of annual operating
plans (including monitoring and evaluation) in their respective states.

2.13 In 2006 a Community Forestry Unit (GSC) was established in Conafor. Thus,
Procymaf is no longer hostage to the project-driven funding cycle but has become a regular
part of the government's forestry program. The staff hired by the project implementing units
was, for the most part, absorbed by GSC.

2.14 The community capacity building that the project sought to promote was predicated
on the previous existence of enabling institutions. For both indigenous and land reform
communities the right to forestland is communal and enshrined in Article 27 of the
constitution that was prepared following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. The constitution
underpins a legal framework that guarantees members of these communities access to land.
Some academics have argued that, in terms of securing access to the forest resource, this land
rights legal framework is more fundamental than any of the subsequent forest-specific
legislation that was passed.21Thus, the concession system that prevailed before the 1980s did
not formally revoke communities' rights to the forest although it ceded management
responsibility (and part of the revenue from timber extraction) to private operators. Under the
current legislation, management as well as ownership is vested in the communities and the
revenues from timber and non-timber forest products accrue to the community at large (under
the aegis of the elected general assembly), not to individual community members. In
addition, a number of nationwide schemes offering payments for environmental services
have been introduced in recent years, The revenue from these schemes-estimated on a per-
hectare basis-also flows to the community as a whole.


3. Relevance
Relevance of Objectives
3.1     The objectives were essentially the same for both projects and the discussion in this
section covers both operations.

3.2     Given that communities control over two-thirds of forestland in Mexico, no strategy
can afford to ignore the communities' potential contribution to the development of the forest
sector.22The community forest program (Procymaf) was founded on this premise. Previous
forestry development initiatives had centered on private sector concessions, a system that
offered no incentive for sustainable harvesting or conservation, denying communities the
opportunity to manage the forests that legally belonged to them. But in the 1980s, driven
mainly by a push from the communities themselves, there was a radical shift in Mexican
policy. The concessions were replaced by a new approach which gave the communities the
authority to manage their forest resources. Procymaf was part and parcel of this reorientation.
Since the program's launch in 1996 there have been some ups and downs in the level of
federal government support (2004-2006 was a low point; see "Borrower Performance"
section below). But throughout the span of the two projects the community forestry initiative
has continued to feature in the contemporaneous statements of strategy that the Bank and the

government have committed to (Table). The recurring themes of community development,
decentralization and targeting of indigenous communities strike a chord with the
development objectives of the two projects. Also, project objectives are consonant with the
government?s sector initiatives, building on the Forest Laws of 1986 and 1992 which
deregulated forestry activity, promoted competition between providers of forest technical
services and supported the development of producer associations in communities.

3.3     The discussion of relevance of objectives needs to take into account the plausible
objectives that were omitted as well as the ones that were included because it is important to
ask whether the omission was justified. The plausible objectives include three obvious
                                                         11


candidates-poverty reduction, forestry sector growth and improved stewardship of the
environment. The first two are not cited in the statement of development objectives for the
two projects but are higher-order goals that could have been referred to as such. The potential
of Procymaf to reduce poverty was limited because forestry accounts for only about 10
                                                         .~~
percent of the income of Procymaf c o r n m ~ n i t i e sMore substantial than earnings from the
various forest activities are the incomes from farming and-sometimes more important-
money remitted to Mexico by those who have moved to the United States. No matter how
much of the forest potential is developed (and there is not a large unused resource left to tap),
this will not by itself remove these communities from poverty.

3.4     Also, Procymaf is not particularly relevant to tackling the weak growth and
competitiveness performance of the sector (Figure 1 above), and it is therefore valid that this
was not identified as an explicit objective. The project covers on average only 17 percent of
forestland in the six states (see paragraph 2.1 1 above), partly because much of the rest has
limited commercial potential or is subject to disputes over land rights (criteria for excluding
these lands from project coverage). In the areas that were covered by the project, the forestry
stands are generally small and scattered, making it hard to mobilize the timber volumes
needed to compete with imports. These limitations help to explain why Procymaf accounts
for only 7 percent of the 2010 budget of Conafor; in contrast, support to commercial forest
plantations accounts for 17 percent.24Moreover, a big part of the problem of Mexico's lack
of competitiveness in forestry falls outside the remit of the relevant sector agencies, including
Procymaf. The inadequate infrastructure of access roads and highways is an important
obstacle to competitiveness, but this is a matter for the transport strategy of federal and state
governments to address.

3.5       It is with respect to the plausible objective of sustainable management and
conservation that Procymaf is most relevant. Payments for environmental services are now
the single largest item in the Conafor budget, accounting for 58 percent of the total. This
program (which includes substantial support from the Bank) aims to provide five years'
worth of payments (in the first instance) to communities that can be shown, through regular,
independent inspection, to have complied with the requirement to set aside and protect blocks
of forestland earmarked for conservation. The approach, unlike Procymaf, does not invest in
community capacity building, but relies on incentive payments that, in principle, need to be
extended indefinitely in order to guarantee that the forest is conserved. This is an important
experiment, for Mexico and for the world. Procymaf includes a small component promoting
the affiliation of communities to these payment schemes. Some years from now it will be
possible to compare Procymaf communities with non-Procymaf communities to see whether
the former have a better record of stewardship based on the patient and prolonged investment
in building social capital.

Relevance of Design
3.6   The essentials of the capacity building process were the same for both projects. The
Procymaf approach was to build slowly, starting with a pilot initiative in three states,

consolidating the project model, and gradually expanding to include other states.
Implementation at first centered on Oaxaca, which made sense because: (a) it had strong and
well organized forest communities; (b) the forests under community management had a high
level of biodiversity that required protection; (c) the communities were experienced in
working with private providers of forestry services; and (d) the State Governor strongly
supported the first project.25

FIRSTPROJECT

3.7      There was an iterative design that evolved in the course of the first project and was
generally well thought out. 26 The thoroughness of this process meant that much of the first
project was devoted to identifying the communities and designing how best to build
community capacity; investment subprojects took a back seat. From 1997 to 2002 the
implementation team identified the indigenous communities and ejidos possessing a large
enough forest resource to potentially qualify for inclusion in the first project. Eligibility
criteria also excluded communities involved in land rights disputes and boundary conflicts,
thereby helping to ensure that the trust building and community organization efforts would
succeed. This work involved preparing detailed diagnostic reports on the environmental,
social and economic characteristics of each community. The technical assistance, training
and investment needs of each of the potential beneficiary communities were spelled out in
detail.

3.8     In the final year of the first project (2003) the potential beneficiary communities were
invited to participate in a competitive bidding process for the selection of subprojects. Private
sector forestry professionals helped communities prepare subprojects. These professionals
received no upfront payment; they were only paid if the subproject was selected. Each of the
subprojects submitted was evaluated technically and the selection of successful projects was
made through a transparent process involving Conafor, Semarnat, the state governments and
the prospective project beneficiaries themselves.

3.9     To be eligible to participate in the competition, communities needed to.agree to
undergo training in environmental impacts. Also, only professionals on the Procymaf-
approved list of forestry service providers were eligible to work with the communities.
Finally, the general assembly of each community needed to approve the community?s
participation.

3.10 Communities preparing subproject bids were divided into four types according to
their level of development:

    Type I: Owners of commercially viable forest stocks but lacking authorized Forest
    Management Plans;
    Type 11: Owners of forest stocks practicing forestry through concessions to third parties
    without participating in management;
    Type 111: Owners of forest stocks with authorized Forest Management Plans involved in
    one or more phases of forest management; and

                                               13

    Type IV: Owners of forest resources who add value to forest products and market them
    directly.27

3.1 1 According to their level of development, communities paid a certain share of the costs
of technical assistance and training: the least developed (Type I) communities paid nothing;
and the most developed (Type IV) communities paid 40 percent.

3.12     The sequence of project activities was as follows:

    0    Promotion of the program in potential participating communities;
         Expression of interest by communities wanting to participate;
         First filter: subproject proposals vetted in regional fora;
         Second filter: technical evaluation of proposals;
         Selection and signing of subproject proposals;
    0    Delivery of training and technical assistance needed to conduct subproject; and
         Implementation of subproject.28

3.13 There is one significant flaw in the design of the first project. This was essentially a
pilot and as such the investment in monitoring and evaluation was inadequate: this limited
the scope for learning lessons about what it was realistic to expect from Procymaf with
respect to the scope for generating employment, reducing poverty and conserving the forest.
A legacy of this-particularly the neglect of a baseline survey-is a continuing lack of hard
evidence about outcomes (a gap that applies to all the states now covered by the program).

     PROJECT
SECOND

3.14 The design of the second project was essentially the same as the first project. The
process developed during the first operation was extended to the second. Three features were
different. First, now that the process had been satisfactorily worked out, a larger share of
project resources could be devoted to investment subprojects. Second, there was a stronger
results framework, specifying a wider range of indicators and setting clear targets. There was
a bigger effort made to collect data on project outcomes, with targets set for the increase in
area subject to sustainable management and conservation, jobs created by subproject
enterprises and the incremental incomes generated from goods and services delivered under
the project. (The nature of these indicators is spelled out in the next section.) Third, the
formula for estimating community co-payments for technical assistance and training were
modified slightly: Type I communities were required to pay 10 percent of the cost; the most
developed (Type IV) communities paid 30 percent.

4. Achievement of'Objectives
4.1      Because the overriding objectives were the same for both projects the approach taken
here is to examine progress toward each objective separately, presenting the output and
outcome evidence for each project.

outputs

4.2     There was only limited specification of output targets. The two that were specified
(Table 4) were both exceeded. Irrespective of the absence of targets there is plenty of
evidence that the project generated a high volume of outputs. The technical assistance that
was provided to help improve forest management and conservation generated 472 studies,
1 13 participatory rural appraisals, 593 training courses for community members and 49 inter-
community seminar^.^' Figure 2 shows the wide range of technical assistance studies
produced and the particular emphasis given to development of forest management and zoning

4.3     A critical ingredient of capacity building was the development of a roster of private-
sector forestry professionals capable of helping communities to develop and implement
resource use plans and subproject investments. This target was exceeded (Table 4). The
roster was regularly refreshed. New names were added but also, in response to negative
reports by communities on the quality of service delivered, some names were dropped. The
roster was not limited to "old-school foresters" (focused on extracting timber) but included a
wide range of professionals (e.g. biologists) with a broader vision of the services provided by
forests (particularly, their role in protecting the environment).

Outcomes

4.4     The area of forestland brought under improved management (including sustainable
harvesting) is a valid indicator of outcome because these areas are not simply plans on paper
but are subject to regular surveillance and enforcement by the community. During the first
project this target was half-achieved (Table 5). On the other hand, the area brought under
conservation (which is also subject to community surveillance) was four times greater than
the target. Although no targets were specified, significant areas were also made subject
respectively to land use zoning ordinances (536,000 hectare), and independent, performance
based certification conducted by an international body, the Forestry Stewardship Council
(147,OOOhectare).

Although this was not an explicit objective of the project, some communities were
"promoted" from lower to higher development classifications (see paragraph 3.10 above for
explanation of community types). Ten percent of communities were reclassified upwards in
Oaxaca, 19 percent in Guerrero and 17 percent in M i ~ h o a c a n . ~ ~

Outcomes

4.6      The second project exceeded all three of the specified outcome targets (Table 7 ) .
Targets for the area under improved management and, more specifically, the area certified as
sustainably managed by the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC), were both surpassed. Also,
the number of community statutes adopted was more than seven times the target. These
statutes have the force of law and were passed by the general assembly of the community, an
elected and representative institution. But the passage of statutes is only properly regarded as
an outcome if statutes are enforced, and sustainable management and conservation are
consequently achieved. There are three sets of evidence that suggest that enforcement is the
norm: first, the evidence of sound management and conservation gleaned by IEG during the
field trips; second, the certification by a credible international body (FSC) that a significant
area is being sustainably harvested; and third, the consideration that communities entering

4.7      Although not covered by an indicator, another noteworthy outcome was the
institutionalization of the process for updating the roster of accredited professionals
providing fee-based forestry services to the communities. The roster is a living record that is
updated based on the comments receiver from service users: professionals that do not
perform well may be dropped from the roster. This is a form of institutional development that
has permanently enhanced the pool of forest product expertise.

Effect on Rate o Deforestation
                f
4.8     Reducing the rate of deforestation was not an explicit objective of either the first or
the second projects; but it is valid to ask whether the projects have made a contribution in
this respect. For obvious reasons there are no data on the amount of illicit timber extraction
in the project area; but, for Mexico as a whole, it is estimated that 30 percent of the timber
from forests is illegally logged.33 IEG investigated the possibility of using remote sensing
data to assess if there had been any slowing in the recession of the forest margin. Nationwide,
the data sets are very incomplete and do not allow for comparisons to be made over a period
of years. Also, there are no images specific to the project areas and the forest stands in these
areas are typically small and scattered, complicating the task of "adding up" the impact on
net deforestation. Nevertheless, outside the project, some recent studies of land use cover
change based on satellite imagery argue that community forest management in Maya areas of
Mexico and Guatemala tends to reduce d e f ~ r e s t a t i o n . ~ ~

4.9     The community forest enterprises that were promoted through subproject investments
related to Objective B probably helped to check the unregulated harvesting of timber
(thereby slowing deforestation) because they created alternative income sources centered on
non-timber forest products. The extent of this diversification is explored in the following
section.

Objective (B): Increase the range of forestry-based income generating
options available to community resource owners
4.10 This objective could be achieved by altering the timber product mix (typically, by
moving upstream from supplying logs, first to producing sawn wood and then further
progressing to more highly-processed products, such as furniture and flat-pack kits); by
introducing new lines of non-timber forest business; and by signing up for schemes that pay
communities to set aside areas of forest to conserve soils, regulate runoff and trap carbon.
These three options were promoted by both Procymaf operations (although the first project
did not finance subproject investments in timber production).

FIRSTPROJECT

outputs

4.1 1 The first project did not contain any output targets bearing on Objective (B). Several
of the technical assistance studies (Fig. 2 above) were geared to promoting enterprise
development, including diversification into non-timber forest products (NTFPs). The first
project financed the launch of 43 NTFP enterprises.

Outcomes
4.12 In the first project, the target for "successful" NTFP subprojects was succeeded
(Table S), although it is not clear how success was measured. One measure of success is
whether or not enterprises are still operating three or so years after launch (this indicator was
adopted in the second project). All of the subprojects financed by the first operation were for
non-timber forest products. Owing to monitoring deficiencies it is not clear how many of
these subprojects (financed between 1998 and 2003) are still operating today.

     PROJECT
SECOND

outputs

4.13 Output targets for the second project were exceeded, with the investment in NTFPs
more than double what was expected (Table 9). Ecotourism was the largest single category of
subproject overall, making up 61 of the 198 subprojects funded since 2004 and one-fifth of
the total volume of investment (see Annex B). The other main NFTPs were spring water
bottling and production of resin (which is used in paint thinners, glues and pitch). Within the

class of timber subprojects, sawmills was the most frequent type of enterprise (37 percent of
all timber enterprises).

4.14 The monitoring framework for the second project was more thorough in specifying
and tracking progress toward outcome targets. In early 2009, an external evaluation surveyed
a stratified random sample of 67 communities drawn from the six participating states.35The
evaluation estimated the increase in the net value of goods and services from these
communities by taking into account the ex-ante projections of net benefits from approved
timber and non-timber forest subprojects, and adding to this the value of benefits from land
set aside for conservation. The value of the set asides was based on what Conafor pays
farmers under the Proarbol program; this payment for environmental services was equivalent
to US$34/ha, which is a measure of opportunity cost, reflecting what must paid to plant 1
hectare of maize in central Mexico. Incremental net values exceeded appraisal targets.36
Based on results from the same 2009 survey, the increase in'number of jobs generated
relative to control communities fell just short of the target (Table 10).

4.15 The CONAFOR data for 2004-2009 shows that the number of jobs created in
subproject enterprises was small in relation to the total subproject cos;(Table 11); although
this does not take into account the indirect job creation associated with these investments (the
multiplier effect of the incremental incomes on the demand for local services). The mean

4.16 The high cost of the subprojects is obviously less relevant than whether or not they
are turning a profit and surviving. Data on profits (or ex-post estimates of financial rates of
return) are hard to come by because the communities are generally reluctant to open their
books (even to trusted Procymaf promoters). One way around this is simply to observe
whether subproject enterprises continue to operate. According to the completion report the
"subproject survival" target was not met (see Table 10 above). The report noted that the data
were still incomplete because when the loan closed most of the approved subprojects had not
yet had three years to run.

4.17 IEG's review of the Conafor database found that over three-quarters of 198
subprojects approved between 2004 and 2009 were still in operation at the time of the
assessment mission. Significantly, 58 of the 198 subprojects were approved over five years
ago. These subprojects have had "more time to fail", but the proportion that are still
operating today is not significantly less than the total survival rate for all 198 subprojects
(Table 12). Of the six states covered by the second project, the one with the highest
subproject survival rate since 2004 was Oaxaca (92 percent); this may be because Procymaf
started'off in Oaxaca-with almost fifteen years of experience the level of community
capacity is probably significantly higher than elsewhere, creating a more supportive
environment for forestry enterprises. The state with the lowest survival rate (Quintana Roo,
52 percent) is a relative newcomer to the program.

4.18 Various Conafor and Bank staff interviewed by IEG said that non-timber subprojects
were less likely to be viable than timber sub-projects but, in terms of survival rates at least,
they have performed somewhat better than timber subprojects. Also, the non-timber
subprojects have generated more direct jobs per unit of investment (and, given the less
physically taxing nature of the work, a larger share of these jobs probably went to women-
but the exact proportion has not been calculated by Conafor).

4.19 Under the second project, income from forest enterprises was successfully used to
leverage counterpart funding from state and municipal governments for building and
maintaining community infrastructure: schools, roads, health posts and electricity
connections. There was significant spillover of these benefits to people living on the edge of
the communities (who often outnumber community members and are typically worse off).
Disaggregating the population census data by communities served by the second project
shows that whereas 75 percent of these communities had no access to health services in 2000,
by 2005 the proportion without service had fallen to 70 percent. Between 2000 and 2005
there was also an increase in the average number of years of schooling received by
community members. Also worthy of note, there was a fall in the share of Procymaf
communities affected by outmigration: from 87 percent in 2000 to 63 percent in 2005.37It is
impossible to say how much of this positive trend is attributable to Procymaf intervention
because Conafor has not obtained a special tabulation of the census data for non-Procymaf
communities. For example, it is not clear to what extent these improvements are the effect of
the nationwide cash transfer program that is targeted at the poor, delivering a transfer each
month to mothers, based on evidence of their children's attendance at school and health
clinics.

5. Efficiency
First Project
5-1 Economic or financial rates of return were not estimated for the first project at
appraisal or completion; possibly because the 43 non-timber forest subprojects it supported
were small enterprises accounting for only 4 percent of total project costs. However, a 2003
external evaluation of the first project surveyed four communities in Oaxaca, finding that                    ,


timber harvesting and processing yielded rates of return well above the cost of funds.38

5.2      The investment subprojects accounted for only 4 percent of the total cost of the first
project. (Table 3 above). Therefore, the rates of return on these subprojects are an insufficient
guide to the overall efficiency of the first operation. More to the point, the final cost of the
first project was only 78 percent of the appraisal projection (Table 2). While the specification
of output and outcome targets was incomplete, 4 of the 5 targets that were set were exceeded
(Tables 4, 5 and 8 above).

5.3     It could be objected that project administration absorbed too high a share of total
costs in the first project (23 percent). Some criticism of the administrative burden of
Procymaf has been voiced within Conafor and by the Finance Ministry. Other Conafor
programs have an administrative overhead of about 5 percent. But allowance must be made
for the intense supervision that was needed for Procymaf promoters to win the confidence of
the communities and to build capacity.

Second Project
5.4      At appraisal, no rate of return analysis was conducted for the project as a whole.
Given that the investment subprojects were demand driven and could not be known in
advance the absence of an ex ante estimate was reasonable. On the basis of results from the
first project, however, the appraisal document includes a forecast that the financial rate of
return for the most common types of investment subproject would exceed 20 per~ent.~'       For
the completion report, a stratified sample of 22 subprojects was randomly selected,
representing 11 percent of all subprojects. The financial rate of return varied between 14
percent and 150 percent. The 15 timber subprojects achieved an average financial rate of
return of 20 percent and the 7 non-timber subprojects reached a mean financial return of 22
percent.40

5.5     The completion report also estimates the rate of return for the whole project at 20
percent. Two categories of benefit were considered. First, the benefits from forestland
conserved (set aside) by the communities was estimated based on the fee paid by
environmental service schemes. Second, timber and non-timber forest products were valued
based on returns to the sample of investment subprojects that was surveyed (see previous

paragraph); the value of incremental goods and services produced outside these subprojects
was valued using nationwide aggregate prices contained in annual forestry reports. This
estimate excluded other benefits that have may flowed from the project: improved
stewardship resulting from training, reduced pressure on existing native forests, the
employment multiplier, improved land-use, improved soil quality and decreased erosion.

5.6     There is also some case study evidence that bears out the overall estimated rates of
return. For example, a 2007 study of a community forestry enterprise in Durango that
produces sawnwood estimated the financial rate of return at 97 percent.41

5.7    The total cost of the second operation amounted to 91 percent of the appraisal
estimate. The project exceeded 13 of the 15 output and outcome targets set at appraisal
(Tables 6 , 7 9 and 10 above). The share of total project costs accounted for by project
administration was 10 percent (under half the percentage recorded by the first project but, as
operations go, still on the high side).

Caveats
5.8      While the mean financial rates of return estimates for both projects were well above
the cost of funds, it should be noted that these are ex ante projections (made at the time the
subprojects were prepared). It is not clear how good a guide they are to actual financial
results. These results are hard to come by. Communities are leery about sharing their
accounts with outsiders (including Procymaf staff), raising doubts about how close to reality
the modeling exercises are. Also, most of the subprojects studied involved expanding
existing enterprises rather than launching startups making it harder to estimate the "without
project" scenario.42

5.9     Set against these reservations are two positive considerations: the survival rate of
subproject enterprises; and the likely benign influence of Procymaf on other sector programs.
Most of the enterprises set up five or so years ago are continuing to operate-despite the
competition from foreign imports. Although imported wood is cheaper at the port of entry,
the distances to local markets and the poor quality of infrastructure (high freight costs) helps
to protect the Mexican product. Despite the rise in imports, the average rural price of
pinewood actually rose, in real terms, by 2 10 percent between 1997 and 2006.43

5.10 Survival of the enterprises is partly based on the existence of sheltered markets. IEG
visited one of the more advanced community sawmill enterprises (in Oaxaca) and was told
that 80 percent of the output of furniture is earmarked for state and federal government
contracts to supply schools and hostels. The existence of this guaranteed outlet lessens the
urgency for finding private buyers (reflected in the weak marketing strategy of the two
furniture stores operated by the community in the capital of Oaxaca).

5.1 1 Also, even if Procymaf administration costs were higher than other programs it is
possible that the capacity built by Procymaf helped to make those other programs (notably,
Prodefor) more viable and less costly to implement, and not just in the communities common
to Procymaf and the other programs (there was spillover to regions not covered by the
project). As noted in paragraph 3.4 above, Procymaf has been incorporated within the large,
high- profile "payment for environmental services" initiatives, which probably gives added
leverage to the resources invested in the Procymaf projects.


6. Risk to Development Outcome
6.1    This discussion applies to both the first and the second project because the risk to
development outcome was the same for both.

Positive Indications
6.2     There are four main respects in which Procymaf's results are likely to be
consolidated. First, establishing community forestry as a dedicated unit in the environment
ministry was a major step toward ensuring the continuity of Procymaf. The link between
Procymaf and the large schemes paying for environmental services may also enhance the
program's prospects of sustainability. Since implementation of the second project ended in
December 2008, the government has continued to fund the program with its own resources
and the budget for the program is higher now than it was in the middle of the decade.

6.3      Second, the hefty contribution that communities made to the total cost of project
activities-72 percent for timber subprojects and 53 percent for non-timber sub-projects-is
a sure sign of community endorsement of the program, making it more likely that the
initiative will survive.44

6.4     Third, the sustainability of the community forest enterprises is an important test of the
community forest program's viability. IEG sought but was unable to obtain information
about the fate of investment subprojects financed under the first operation. It is not clear how
many of these subprojects (financed between 1998 and 2003) are still operating today. But,
under the second project, the survival rate of community forest enterprises is high enough to
suggest that an enabling culture has been developed: over two-thirds of the enterprises set up
in 2004-2005 were still operating in 201 0 (Table 12 above). Moreover, of all the subproject
investments made between 2004 and 2009, the survival rate was 92 percent in the state with
the longest history of Procymaf intervention (Oaxaca), suggesting that sustained commitment
pays off.


44. World Bank toolkits on the design of community-driven development recommend that communities
contribute to subprojects costs, but do not say what share of the cost they should pay. Based on evaluations of
completed projects, the average share tends to be under 20 percent (e.g. "analysis of qualitative data from Benin
and Uttar Pradesh found that villagers see participation in a Bank project primarily as a requirement for them to
meet part of the subproject cost, and they see the advantage of meeting the 10 to 15 percent community
contribution requirement, if that amount can leverage a much larger sum of money", OED, 2005, p. 22).
                                                25

6.5     Fourth, whereas many projects and programs work with subsets of the community
(for example, the Ministry of Agriculture targets farmers; safety net programs target women),
Procymaf is distinctive because it works through the general assembly to build support for
forest resource activities throughout the community. The merit of this approach is that it is
transparent and helps to strengthen local democracy. It could be argued that, because most
community leaders are men, the needs of women are less likely to be served than they would
be through a targeted program. But, increasingly, it is the younger and more educated
members of community who assume leadership posts and they may perhaps be more
responsive to women's needs.

6.6     There are several other factors which bode well for Procymaf s continuing influence.
The design of the program has already influenced other operations in Mexico; and a recent
workshop in the Bank presented the Procymaf approach to forestry practitioners from
countries all round the world. The skills of private forestry professionals nurtured by
Procymaf are likely to continue to be put to good effect. The roster of accredited
professionals continues to be updated-a vital development in a country without a public
sector extension staff. Even if the building of trust between communities has not progressed
as far as trust within communities, the projects invested in an approach that will plausibly
bear fruit in the longer term: a system of state-wide forums that set priorities for Procymaf
investments across a wide range of communities; and the use of community-to-community
seminars to compare progress and share lessons.

Areas of Concern
6.7     Now that the externally-funded projects have ended it is harder to maintain the
previous level of payments accorded to contract staff. The government has recently cut the
pay of promoters (who are hired on one-year renewable contracts, unlike Conafor staff) by
up to 40 percent. The promoters are the life blood of Procymaf because they are the people in
whom the communities vest their trust. Even if the number of promoters has remained stable
(5 per state), some of the best people have left and there is a concern about further attrition of
the program's human capital.

6.8     The jury is still out with respect to the long-term competitiveness of Procymaf-
sponsored businesses. "Certainly, the viability of the community forestry enterprises will
depend on their capacity to compete in the new context of global markets that are
                                                           There
increasingly more demanding and more s p e ~ i a l i z e d ~ ' . ~ ~ are major challenges ahead
with respect to developing market niches and holding on to them. It remains to be seen how
many small bottlers of water can compete with Coca Cola's recent ventures in this direction;
and how much demand there is for stays in cabins in remote spots of the woods. IEG visits to
subprojects suggested that market intelligence and awareness of the power of branding is still
limited (with striking exceptions-one being a project that successfully markets zip-wire
ravine traverses, mule rides and tequila tasting to cruise passengers docking at Puerto
Vallarta). But these are still early days.



45.Procymaf (2003), p. 105.
                                                 26


6.9      Profit-driven initiatives may not flourish if they are beholden to community-wide
approval, expressed through the general assembly. The consensual approach favored by
Procymaf is often protracted, potentially obstructing business initiatives by the most
entrepreneurial members of the community. For example, the leadership may prefer to
maximize job creation even if this undercuts the efficiency of forestry enterprises. There are
still not enough communities prepared to hire and pay attractive salaries to managers to run
investment projects, rather than relying on the enterprise of community leaders (who are for
the most part unpaid and are only elected to their posts for a year or so).

6.10 Ultimately, an important test of capacity is whether communities engage in supply
chain development. In this regard, the communities have a long way to go. Although
communities in Oaxaca have been nurtured by Procymaf for more than a decade (and
probably have more capacity than communities in other states) there are only two cases so far
of Oaxacan communities working together to harvest, process and market timber products.
The scope for cooperation along these lines is limited by the frequent, deep-rooted boundary
disputes between neighboring communities. Also, one of the Bank task managers observed
that communities often prefer to invest in new sawmills with which to process their own
timber rather than work with neighboring communities who already have mills, but don't
have the timber supply to operate them at full capacity. The potential for forward linkages is
also limited. The exploitation of the communities that took place under the earlier concession
system reduces the willingness of communities to enter into contracts with paper mills,
furniture manufacturers and other private sector operators. For equally sound reasons, the
private sector is skeptical about the capacity of obtaining a timely supply of timber of
sufficient volume and quality from the communities. It is more attractive for them to use
imported supplies (or the output from Mexican plantations), rather than to buy timber from a
large number of small, scattered suppliers.

6.1 1 Although both projects added to the area of forest subject to external certification
(paragraph 4.3 and Table 7 above), communities are not offered a strong incentive to remain
in certification schemes: entry into these schemes involves a cost that is not recouped
because there is no price premium for timber extracted from certified areas. (Buyers in
Mexico do not care about the origin of the timber they use and buyers overseas do not find
Mexican timber to be competitive with timber from other countries.) However, green
labeling is now a force to be reckoned with in many countries and it is likely that this will
spread to Mexico.

6.12 Procymaf s work may be partly undone by countervailing forces. First, there is the
effect of government programs operating in the same communities as Procymaf, programs
that target a subset of community members rather than building community-wide consensus.
A particular example is the Ministry of Agriculture's provision of direct income support to
maize farmers (Procampo). Originally designed as a temporary program intended to cushion
the fall in producer incomes resulting from the freeing of trade in maize, there is presently no
end in sight for Procampo. The program pays $1,200 pesos per year per hectare of maize
(compared to the $350-400 pesos per hectare from environmental service payments). Even if
the area covered by Procampo is capped (removing the incentive to convert forestland into
arable), the existence of this support may encourage community members to devote their
resources to farming rather forest-based activities.
                                                     27

6.13 Second, outmigration (mainly of young men) removes from 10 percent to 50 percent
of the labor force of Procymaf communities, arguably draining the most enterprising
elements of the community. Although there is some partial evidence that between 2000 and
2005 outmigration slowed in Procymaf communities relative to non-Procymaf
                 there
cornmunitie~,~~ is a continuing concern that the net effect of outmigration may be to sap
the commitment to forest-based livelihoods. (It is not clear to what extent the sizeable
community contribution to investment subprojects was funded from money sent home by
migrants; but anecdotal evidence suggests that these remittances are used primarily to meet
the consumption needs of the migrants' families rather than applied to investments that
benefit the community at large.)

7.1     Although the outcome of both projects falls in the satisfactory range, the second
project performed better than the first one in terms of design of monitoring and evaluation
and the stronger evidence of results.

7.2     Relevance. The objectives of both projects were substantially relevant, based on their
solid grounding in analytic work (the major 1995 forestry sector review), the consistency of
objectives with the three statements of country strategy corresponding to the implementation
period (Table 4 above), and the way that the projects built on new laws passed by the
government (see paragraph 3.2 above). The design of both projects is also rated substantially
relevant. For the first project, contrary to expectations for a pilot project of this sort,
insufficient attention was given to developing a monitoring and evaluation framework
capable of assessing outcomes. But this failing was outweighed by the careful attention given
to developing a participatory process in communities that responded to lessons learned from
an earlier (unsuccessful) forestry project (see paragraph 1.9 above), the pragmatic
methodology for establishing which communities were eligible to participate (paragraph 3.7),
and the adjustment of the approach according to the development level of the community
(paragraph 3.10). Each of these features was critical for building trust in communities

subjected to years of neglect by government programs. The design of the second project built
on that of the first, and differed from it in only significant respect: more effort was made to
define outcome indicators and to strengthen monitoring and evaluation (see paragraphs 7.1 1-
7.14 below).

7.3     Efficacy. The evidence of results is less complete for the first project than for the
second project. Few outcome indicators were defined (see paragraphs 4.4 and 4.13 above).
With respect to Objective (A), the area target for bringing forest under sustainable
management was only half-met. Achievement of this objective is rated modest. In the case of
Objective (B), there is no indication how the "success" of forest enterprises was measured
and it is not clear how many of these enterprises were still operating at the time of the
assessment mission. Achievement of this objective is also rated modest. However, with
respect to both objectives, significant outputs-consistent with satisfactory outcomes-were
produced, helping to explain why efficacy was rated modest and not negligible.

7.4      For the second project, achievement of the two objectives is rated substantial in each
case. In relation to Objective (A), all three of the outcome targets were amply exceeded (see
Table 8 above). With respect to Objective (B), over two-thirds of forest enterprises supported
by subproject investments approved five years ago are still in operation (Table 13).

7.5      EfJiciency. In addition to the evidence from both projects that ex ante financial rates
of return exceeded the opportunity cost of funds, it is a compelling indication of efficiency
that, although total costs were less than forecast, output targets were amply exceeded. Both
projects are rated substantial on efficiency.

7.6    Outcome. According to IEG guidelines, the three components of outcome add up to
outcome ratings of moderately satisfactory for the first project and satisfactory for the
second project.

Risk to Development Outcome
7.7     The issues were the same for both projects. While there are several factors that bode
well for the sustainability of project results (for example, the establishment of a dedicated
community forestry unit in Conafor), these are offset by a several other concerns, including
questions about the long-term competitiveness of subproject investments. To reflect the
balance between these countervailing trends risk to development outcome is rated as
moderate.

Monitoring and Evaluation
FIRSTPROJECT

Design

7.8     The first project was a pilot and it was therefore reasonable to assume that particular
attention would be given to monitoring and evaluation in order to assess the outcomes that
might be expected from this type of project; and to identify the design modifications that
                                               29

might be needed to support possible scaling up. While some provision was made for
monitoring project outputs, the change in community incomes and livelihoods, and the
change in the management of the forest resource were not quantified. There was no base line
survey of communities conducted.

Implementation

7.9     Project outputs and their associated costs were fully quantified and a year-by-year
breakdown was presented to IEG before the mission. In addition, an external evaluation of
project results was commissioned towards the end of the first project, although its
conclusiveness was limited by the lack of baseline data. In the course of implementation,
project management was facilitated by the establishment of three sector monitoring tools
(partly funded by Procymaf): an Automated System of Evaluation and Monitoring Forest
Management Procedures, which specified indicators relevant to tracking compliance with
forestry regulations; a Decision Support System which provided access to updated
information about the environmental, socioeconomic and administrative situation of the
forestry sector in Guerrero, Michoach and Oaxaca; and the National Forest Information
System (SNIF), a regularly updated compendium on forests and forestry in Mexico,        '


including forest inventories, data on plantations, information on forest fire prevention, pest
control, legislation, forest programs and l i t e r a t ~ r e . ~ ~

Use
7.10 The monitoring data collected under the first project were essential for day-to-day
project management and helped to build a case for the launch of a second project by showing
that the first operation was reasonably cost effective. Although significant outcomes were
reported (e.g. the increased area under conservation), overall, the specification of targets and
results was patchy.

7.1 1    Monitoring and evaluation is rated modest.

     PROJECT
SECOND

Design

7.12 The second project was more thorough in setting and tracking output targets and also
made a bigger attempt to track outcomes (see Table 11 above).

Implementation
7.13    Some improvements were made during implementation of the second project. "The
Bank requirements for project monitoring stimulated Conafor to develop a more
comprehensive and robust database", with particular efforts to consolidate information from
the participating states.48Procymaf developed a comprehensive information system (SISCO)
with intranet connections to project implementing units in the states. SISCO is now linked to

the large and sophisticated databases operated by the National Institute of Statistics and the
National Agrarian Registry. In principle, this should allow for comparison between Procymaf
and non-Procymaf communities at various points in time, making up somewhat for the
absence of a project-created baseline. However, the population census data presented at the
time of the IEG mission did not make an attempt to construct a counterfa~tual.~~   Two
external evaluations were commissioned after 2004.

Use
7.14 A potential has been created for future monitoring of the quality of resource
management; a potential that is not yet being fully exploited. The various land use zoning
plans developed under the project may be used as a baseline that can be revisited at regular
intervals in the future to see whether sustainable harvesting practices have been pursued and
how much land remains set aside for conservation purposes. Use of the cheap, hand-held
GPS instruments that are now available may facilitate the process of regular resurvey by
community members and forestry professionals trained under the project.

7.15     Monitoring and evaluation is rated substantial.

Bank Performance
FIRSTPROJECT

Quality at Entry

7.16 The design of the first project reflected lessons learned from the failure of a previous
Bank-supported forestry project (see paragraph 1.5 above) and was strengthened by the
findings of a comprehensive review of forest and natural resources that was jointly sponsored
by the Bank and the g~vernment.'~  Project design also benefited from previous experience
with community-to-community training" and was enriched by social assessments and close
dialogue with stakeholders.

7.17 Overall, the level of consultation and collaboration with Mexican counterparts was
high. The guidance that the Bank provided extended beyond core forestry matters, including
recommendations on business practices, market systems, environmental assessment, and
participatory evaluation. For the first project, the Bank was careful to promote state
                                                                            '~
government ownership by setting up an advisory committee in O a ~ a c a . The design ensured
that major decisions regarding project activities were ratified by community assemblies and
validated at the regional level. The project sponsored regional inter-community forums to
help communities create alliances needed for cooperative efforts. These regional forums
promoted community engagement with state and federal governments, facilitating needs
                                      The

of the monitoring and evaluation framework but this was offset by the quality of the project
process that was developed with respect to gaining the trust of communities and building
capacity.

7.18    Quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

Supervision
7.19 The completion report for the first project acknowledges that the Bank team was
highly skilled in natural resource management, and environmental and social assessment; but
would have benefited from "a stronger business orientation", including microenterprise
                   .~~
e ~ p e r i e n c eSupervision was distinguished by the closeness and openness of dialogue with
Conafor and the Environment Ministry, and the helpful guidance given on procurement and
disbursement procedures. Supervision performance is rated satisfactory.

Overall Performance
7.20    The overall performance of the Bank is rated satisfactory.

     PROJECT
SECOND

Quality at Entry

7.21 The design of the project was essentially the same as the tried and tested model
developed under the first project. The primary difference was the addition of more indicators
and targets, with a bigger attempt to track outcomes as well as outputs. Procymaf was
satisfactorily scaled up to six states. Quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

Supervision
7.22 There was an intense supervision effort, involving two to three missions each year,
with lengthy periods spent visiting communities. When there was a temporary falling off of
support for Procymaf within Conafor (see next section), the Bank redoubled its efforts in
support of the community forestry model and these efforts probably contributed to the
subsequent revival in the program's fortunes. Supervision is rated satisfactory.

Overall Performance
7.23    The overall performance of the Bank is rated satisfactory.

    Borrower Performance
    FIRSTPROJECT

    Government Performance

    7.24 The government showed a solid commitment to the community forestry program. The
    strongest support came from the Environment Ministry (initially, Semarnap; subsequently
    Semarnat). The federal government passed a new Forestry Law, created a National Forestry
    Strategy, and set up Conafor. The three state governments also contributed, providing office
'
    space, logistical support and supplementary funding for community investments. The state
    government of Oaxaca was particularly supportive.

    7.25 During the first project, the Finance Ministry (SHCP) criticized Procymaf for being
    slow to disburse project funds; but SHCP was implicated in the delay. "During the [first]
    project cycle, allocation of budget by the Finance Ministry was often lower than requested by
    the project coordinating unit, which resulted in slower progress and smaller disbursements
    than originally planned"; and delayed project closing. Also, the shift of project oversight
    from the Environment Ministry (Semarnap) to the newly-created Conafor in 2001 called for
    an amendment to the loan agreement; the delay in the signing of this agreement "resulted in a
    long disbursement lag for the project".5sOverall, government performance is rated
    moderately satisfactory.

    Implementing Agency Performance
    7.26 The Procymaf leadership stqod out for its professional excellence and the dedication
    shown to advancing the cause of community forestry. Commitment by the leaders was
    matched by the commitment shown by the teams of promoters in each state. The quality of
    their work is manifest in the high regard in which they are held in the communities, as
    expressed to IEG in the field visits. This is no small achievement given the legacy of ill will
    toward government generated by the concession system and the decades of discouraging
    communities from sustainably managing the land that belongs to them. On the other hand,
    the implementing agency shares responsibility with the Bank for failing to develop an
    adequate monitoring and evaluation framework (including the neglect of the baseline surveys
    needed to facilitate assessment of outcomes). Performance of the implementing agency is
    rated satisfactory.

    Overall Performance

     PROJECT
SECOND

Government Performance

7.28 The government remained committed to project objectives during the second
operation. The strongest expression of this was the decision to open a dedicated community
forestry unit in Conafor in 2006. With some exceptions (Jalisco, for example, has been less
engaged), the state governments also provided significant support to Procymaf, through
supplying office space, logistical support and supplementary funding for community
investments.

7.29 There were two shortfalls. First, the Conafor leadership came close to stifling
Procymaf around 2005, possibly reflecting the temporary ascendancy of a management group
that was primarily concerned with addressing Mexico?s declining competitiveness as a
timber producer. The management changed and support for Procymaf was restored before
implementation of the second project ended. But, at the same time, there were deep cuts in
promoters? pay, a problem still not redressed at the time of the mission. This could threaten
the quality and sustainability of the program (see paragraph 6.7 above).

7.30 The most skeptical a m of government is the Finance Ministry (SHCP), which has
                             r
tended to dismiss Procymaf as a ?boutique? project with a high administrative overhead and
limited scope for tackling the economic and environmental challenges linked to Mexico?s
forests. When the second project was near closing, SHCP turned down proposals for a third
Procymaf-specific project, indicating that it was only interested in negotiating external
funding for a much larger package of sector support (which would include funding of
Procymaf). (SHCP did not participate in the evaluation mission).

7.3 1 But these reservations were not substantial enough to stop the project exceeding most
of its targets. Therefore, government performance is rated satisfactory.

Implementing Agency Performance
7.32 The professional excellence and commitment manifested by the leadership of
Procymaf and by the team of promoters during the first project was sustained throughout
implementation of the second project. The implementing agency satisfactorily handled the
transition from a small coordinating unit within the Environment Ministry to a permanent
a m of Conafor, well equipped to defend the model it has developed but also capable of self-
 r
criticism and competent enough to make necessary adjustments such as the steps taken to
develop a comprehensive information system and to expand its operation from three to
twelve states. Performance of the implementing agency is rated satisfactory.

Overall Performance
7.33   The overall performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory.

8. Lessons
8.1     Improved stewardship o natural resources is probably the main contribution of
                                 f
community forestry in Mexico. Community forestry will not wipe out rural poverty in
Mexico because the program is necessarily limited to communities with abundant forests and
no land conflicts; and even in these communities incomes from forest activities will always
make up only a small share of total incomes. Nor does it promise to reverse the declining
supply and lack of competitiveness of timber in Mexico, because communities have been
slow to affiliate horizontally and vertically, restricting the scope for reaping scale economies.
Nevertheless, it is an important part of the broader effort to protect the natural resource base,
because communities own over two-thirds of Mexico's forestland. By promoting zoning and
forest management and conservation plans, the Procymaf projects provided a solid platform
for the expansion of conservation and sustainable land management in a globally important
ecosystem. The community zoning plans successfully sponsored by Procymaf offer a
platform for developing synergies with the (well-funded, high-profile) schemes that are now
paying for environmental services (carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, soil erosion
control).

8.2      There are no quick fmes f o r building community capacity and institutional
arrangements to manage and conserve forests. Plugging technical and infrastructure gaps is
easy compared to the work of building trust in communities who have been ill served by
Mexican governments for decades. The hefty contribution made by Procymaf communities to
training and investment initiatives, the broad-based participation in land zoning exercises and
the significant survival rate of the forest enterprises established by Procymaf is the best
evidence yet that the programs are building capacity and sustainable institutional
arrangements. But there is still a long way to go in developing the business acumen that
communities need to develop and exploit the niche markets for timber and non-timber goods
and services. One way to reward community initiative in this respect would be to develop
better schemes for certifying that timber is sustainably produced: the lack of a price premium
for certified timber in local and national markets limits the incentive for communities to
harvest and process timber more sustainably.

 8.3     It is important to embed support to individual communities within a broader
framework that strengthens cooperation between communities and municipal and state
governments and develops a network o professional expertise on forest-centered activities.
                                        f
 Although Procymaf has so far made little headway in promoting supply chain development
 centered on timber processing, from the beginning it emphasized the creation of regional fora
 which brought communities and state governments together to set priorities and discuss the
 allocation of investment resources. This framework helps to promote the development of the
 complementary infrastructure (roads, schools) that will help to make forest communities
more viable. Equally important is the support that Procymaf has given to building up
networks of accredited private sector professionals able to provide technical assistance to
communities across the full spectrum of forest-centered activities (not confined to harvesting
timber).

Estimados colegas:

En relacion al Informe de Evaluacion preparado por el Grupo de
Evaluacion lndependiente del Banco, y en nuestra calidad de Agente
Financier0 del Gobierno Federal, designado por la Secretaria de
Hacienda y Credit0 Publico para la administracion de 10s recursos de 10s
prestamos y la supervision de 10s proyectos, me permito detallar unos
breves comentarios respecto al mismo:

COMENTARIOS DE NACIONAL FINANCIERA

El Proyecto Forestal Comunitario I (prestamo 41 37-ME), se disefio
originalmente como un proyecto piloto para abordar un nuevo esquema
de intervencion para el manejo y conservacion de 10s recursos
forestales en Mexico, partiendo de un aterrizaje a nivel de las
comunidades y ejidos propietarios de estos recursos naturales.

AI ser disefiado bajo este contexto, es imprescindible sefialar que en la
elaboracion de sus indicadores para evaluar el cumplimiento de
objetivos de desarrollo, asi como el sistema de monitoreo y seguimiento
del Programa, existia una aka posibilidad de carecer de elementos
importantes para el seguimiento de estas actividades. Por lo tanto, en
una justa dimension de este laboratorio que represento el PROCYMAF
I, resultan justificables las deficiencias que se pudieron presentar en la
evaluacion expost del Programa.

Las lecciones aprendidas de este primer proyecto, fueron rescatadas
para el disefio integral de la segunda operacion (prestamo 7207-ME).
Tanto para el Banco como para el Ejecutor (CONAFOR), fue importante
el aprendizaje obtenido.

La institucionalizacion de un Programa de esta naturaleza, resulta un
tema relevante de resaltar a nivel de 10s Planes y Programas que un
Gobierno ofrece a la sociedad. AI integrarse el PROCYMAF a la
CONAFOR, inicialmente se visualizo como un proyecto piloto que debia
demostrar sus virtudes e impactos. Sin embargo, al ser elogiado por el
Banco y otros paises en su modelo de intervencion en la poblacion
objetivo, derivado de la combinacion al fomentar y desarrollar
capacidades locales, cohesion y capital social, aunado a la
conservacion de 10s recursos forestales; genero tal confianza que
permitio que a la conclusion del PROCYMAF II, la CONAFOR adoptara
como lineas de accion a financiar en sus programas tradicionales
(PROARBOL), diversas modalidades de este Programa.

Efectivamente coincidimos con la percepcion del Informe, en el sentido
de fortalecer la informacion documental y de seguimiento financier0 de
10s subproyectos de inversion; adicionalmente a generar capacidades
de "management" y "competitividad" en las empresas forestales.
Consideramos que este sera un reto para una proxima operacion con el
Banco, o bien para el Programa que hoy dia se ha institucionalizado en
la CONAFOR.

Proyectos de esta naturaleza, en donde se trabaja a nivel de la base
mas importante para generar 10s cambios, resultan relevantes para
cualquier Estado-Nacion.

Borrower's Comments - Mexico PPAR - English version

Unofficial translation: Comments from Nacional Financiera, June 25,2010
With respect to the evaluation report prepared by the Bank's Independent Evaluation Group,
and in our role as financial agent of the federal government, designated by the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit to administer loan proceeds and to supervise projects, allow me to
comment briefly on the report:
The Community Forestry Project (Loan No. 4137-ME) was designed originally as a pilot
project, launching a new approach to the management and conservation of forest resources in
Mexico, grounded in participation of the communities and ejidos that own these natural
resources.
Designed as it was in these circumstances, it is important to recognize that the development
of indicators to evaluate the achievement of the development objective, as well as the system
for monitoring and evaluating the program, was likely to lack critical elements needed to
track project activities. Therefore, the deficiencies pointed out by this ex-post evaluation
appear perfectly justifiable given the experimental nature of the project (Procymaf I).
The lessons learned from this first project were incorporated in the design of the follow-on
operation (Loan No. 7207-ME). The learning thus obtained was important both for the Bank
and for the executing agency (Conafor).
Institutionalizing a program of this type is an important theme for government to emphasize.
When Procymaf was incorporated by Conafor, it was initially seen as a pilot project whose
positive aspects and impacts remained to be demonstrated. However, the project's approach
to the target population, based on promoting local capacity and building social cohesion, as
well as conserving forest resources, was praised by the Bank and by other countries, so that
when Procymaf 2 was completed its approach was applied throughout Conafor (applied to
established programs such as Proarbol).
Indeed, we agree with the report's observation about the need to strengthen the
documentation and financial monitoring of investment subprojects; as well as the need to
develop the "management approach" and "competitiveness" of the forestry enterprises. We
consider this is a challenge for a next operation with the Bank, as well as for the program that
Conafor is now institutionalizing.
Projects of this nature, which involve working at the base where change takes place, are
relevant for any nation-state.
Sincerely,
Lourdes GonzCilez-Carmona, Sector Executive, Financial Agent, Nacional Financiera
