1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Sector Background
Mexico ranks eleventh worldwide in forest cover, with more than 65.6 million ha of forests ­
about a third of which are considered commercially viable. Despite this vast resource, only 9
million ha are managed for production, and the country is a net importer of wood products.
Moreover, 55 percent of the 13 million inhabitants living in the forests suffer from extreme
poverty. About 10,000 indigenous communities and ejidos1 own around 65 percent of the
country's forests. Yet most lack the capacity needed to manage their forests sustainably and
thereby generate badly needed employment, ensure the protection of biodiversity and watersheds,
and combat climate change by reducing deforestation and degradation.

The country's forests are grouped into two major formations; about half are found in the rugged
temperate pine and oak forests in the mountain ranges in the east and west, with the remaining
half in the lowland tropical forests of the Atlantic and Pacific. With its wide range of ecosystems,
species richness is expectedly high and the country ranks fourth worldwide in terms of its overall
biological diversity. Officially around 300 thousand people are employed in the forest sector, but
in reality the number is probably much higher including informal employment. Forestry activities
account for only 1.8 percent of GDP and the country imports most of its wood products
(including paper) from the United States, Chile and Uruguay2.

Official rates of deforestation for Mexico in 2008 were moderately high; at about 330 thousand
ha annually (or about 0.5 percent). The major drivers for deforestation are forest conversion to
agriculture and pasture in the lowland areas; though deforestation is found in the uplands as well.
Although deforestation and land-use change is illegal, the government has yet to find the means
to control it. Forest degradation is also high; estimated at approximately 457 thousand ha
annually (0.7 percent). Causes of degradation include over logging, illegal logging, high grading,
bad management, forest grazing, pests, fires and other human impacts.

Government's Actions. Prior to the 1992 Forestry Law, all of Mexico's forests were managed as
concessions, without regard to actual land ownership. Concessions were granted by the
government and managed by private firms. Indigenous communities and ejidos had no rights to
manage their own forests, harvest timber or generate revenue from forestry activities. This
situation discouraged good forest management by both concessionaires and the communities; and
encouraged over-exploitation by the former and illegal logging by the latter. Due to long rotation
periods in some forest ecosystems (70 years or more), significant areas of forest are still under
stocked due to past over cutting and other abusive practices ­ and it will take many decades more
for them to recover fully.

 Communities and ejidos are land holdings with either indigenous or non-indigenous members who have
rights, stipulated in law, to communal resources under which an individual family has a right to an
individual plot of land allocated formally by the community as well as access to communally owned lands
(often forest lands, pastures and waterways).




                                                   1
1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal, the first Community Forestry Project (CFP I) was in its final stage of
implementation. The CFP I had been successful in increasing the capacity of communities/ejidos
to make sound decisions and to raise living standards through improved forest management.
Moreover, the project helped forest owners, producers and policymakers create a shared vision
for poverty reduction in rural areas through sustainable forest management.

Nevertheless, deforestation and forest degradation in areas untouched by the CFP I were
extremely high, with estimates of national forest loss ranging from 250,000 ha to 1.5 million ha
annually ­ mostly due to their conversion to cropland or pastures. The total cost of natural
resource and environmental depletion was estimated at about 10 percent of GDP. Assuming a
constant rate of deforestation, half of Mexico's forests could disappear within 42 years.

Indigenous people from communities are among Mexico's poorest people. At the time of
appraisal, a CELADE report showed that 81 percent of indigenous people in Mexico live below
the poverty line, versus 18 percent of the non-indigenous population. Many comuneros and
ejidatarios are subsistence farmers, planting maize, beans, chili's and other crops on hillsides.
While most of Mexico's forests (65%) are owned by indigenous communities and ejidos, most
still lack the organizational and technical capacity to manage them sustainably in order to
generate revenues. Consequently, rural areas suffer disproportionately high rates of migration to
urban areas and to other countries.

Until 2000, most regulatory issues pertaining to forestry in Mexico were handled by
SEMARNAT, and its enforcement arm, PROFEPA. In April 2001, the GoM created the National
Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) with a broad mandate to promote sustainable production of
forests and conservation of forest resources based on a Strategic Forestry Program with a 25-year
horizon. CONAFOR's charter mandated it to: (a) stimulate the organization of forest producers
and assist them in the formation of associations and (b) promote production forestry to generate
employment in forested communities.

The creation of CONAFOR was a strategic move by the government aimed at reversing the trend
of natural resource depletion and to turn a national liability into a productive asset. SEMARNAT
and PROFEPA remained responsible for enforcement of environmental legislation and the
National Biodiversity Council (CONABIO) was responsible for assuring conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity. In December 2002, Congress approved a forestry law, which
provided a framework for long-term planning efforts in the sector, primarily by strengthening and
decentralizing institutions charged with protecting and managing forests.

Rationale for Bank Assistance. The first IBRD effort, the US$15 million Community Forestry
Project, 1997 to 2003 (P007700) proved highly successful in developing and piloting new
approaches to community forestry in the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoacán, and was
considered a good candidate for scaling up. A larger community forestry project was also
consistent with the 2002 Mexico County Assistance Strategy (CAS). The CAS focused on
balancing growth and poverty reduction with environmental protection, stressing the country's
needs to strengthen natural resource conservation and management both to preserve
environmental quality and to provide a more stable source of income for forest owners.

The adoption of the World Bank Forest Policy (OP/BP 4.36) in November 2002 provided a sound
basis for proactive engagement with client countries to address forest management, conservation
and sustainable development. The policy encourages the incorporation of forest issues in the CAS


                                                2
and addresses the cross-sector impacts on forests as well as providing guidance for lending for
forestry and conservation projects. It also encourages community forestry for addressing social
and poverty issues and the use of certification as a means of assuring environmental quality.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The objective of Second Community Forestry Project (CFP II) is to assist indigenous
communities and ejidos that own forests in priority regions of Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco,
Michoacán, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo to improve the management and conservation of their
forest resources and to generate alternative sources of income in a sustainable manner.

The project's specific objectives were: (i) to strengthen community institutions by means of the
consolidation of social capital and management capacity to improve the benefits flowing from use
of forest resources; (ii) to strengthen technical and administrative capacity of ejidos and
communities for the development of local and regional productive processes; (iii) to identify and
develop investment alternatives and productive diversification for communities and ejidos, and to
promote local and regional arrangements to facilitate access by these communities to schemes for
payment for environmental services.

The project's key performance indicators for outputs and outcomes were included in the PAD, as
follows: (i) 20 percent increase in the value of forest goods and services, produced by assisted
communities and ejidos; (iii) 30 percent increase in jobs available in assisted communities vs.
control; (iii) Significant increase in social capital in assisted communities; (iv) 80 community
statutes adopted by community or ejido assembly; (v) 75,000 ha receiving independent,
performance-based certification; (vi) 9 payment for environmental services schemes in place;
(vii) 12 associations and 65 community enterprises functioning three or more years after launch;
(viii) 800,000 ha of forest area under improved management; and (ix) 350,000 ha under zoning
plans.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO remained relevant throughout the project's tenure and did not change. There were no
changes in indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target group of the project comprised poor indigenous and non-indigenous people
from communities and ejidos (comuneros and ejidatarios) in forested areas in the states of
Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán, Oaxaca, and Quintana Roo. The areas were selected on a
basis of the presence of high value standing forest resources owned by indigenous communities
or ejidos. CFP I assisted approximately 300 communities and ejidos in the states of Guerrero,
Michoacán and Oaxaca. At the time of the appraisal, it was expected that the second project
would assist an additional 200 communities and ejidos on a demand-driven basis, and continue
assistance to some of the 300 original communities.

Private technical professionals and service provider firms also benefitted from the program. They
received scholarships and grants to participate in a "Continuing Education Program" to update
and/or diversify their skills, thereby enhancing the range of technical services available to assist
communities and ejidos.




                                                 3
CONAFOR benefitted from the project through strengthening the government's approach to rural
development, forest management, and environmental stewardship. Field personnel from the
project staff (promotores) worked directly with the communities and ejidos, to help build capacity
and guide community forestry development activities. They also helped to coordinate activities
between the project and other CONAFOR field programs, such as PRODEPLAN and ProArbol.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project had five components: (i) Social Capital Strengthening; (ii) Forest Resources
Management Technical Strengthening; (iii) Diversification and Investment; (iv) Institutional
Strengthening; and (v) Project Management. Total project costs at appraisal amounted to US$28.9
million (US$21.30 million IBRD and US$7.60 million GoM).

Component A. Social Capital Strengthening (US$4.80 million; 16.6% of total project cost)
The general objective of this component was to strengthen the capacity of communities and ejido
to take decisions, particularly regarding natural resource management. It included: (a) forming
and strengthening Regional Participatory Committees or other regional participatory fora and
providing support for their meetings; (b) conducting Rapid Rural Appraisal exercises in which
specialized consultants hold workshops in communities and ejidos to help them to become aware
of their main problems and to set priorities; (c) inter-community seminars which are designed to
assist communities of different levels of development to define common goals and share their
experience in achieving them; (d) development of community regulations in which specialized
consultants assist communities in drafting by-laws for community governance; (e) and
supervisory activities by project staff.

Component B. Forest Resources Management Technical Strengthening (US$12.39 million;
42.9 % of the total project cost) The objective of this component was to assist the ejidos and
communities to improve the forest management practices by providing tools as well as to create
an enabling setting for them to derive economic benefit from forestry activities through training
and studies.

Under subcomponent 1 of component B, the project would respond to community demands to: (a)
contract specific studies to identify alternative resources for the diversification of production and
assist communities and ejidos in decision making; (b) provide specialized consulting services to
carry out land-use zoning in accordance with community goals and available resources; (c)
conduct studies and make recommendations for the strengthening of community enterprises; (d)
provide studies and recommendations for the development of inter-community associations; (e)
contract feasibility studies for non-timber forest products; (f) specialized courses for human
capital development including courses on identification and management of conflict; and (g) offer
courses to train community/ejido forest technicians. Under subcomponent 2, the project would
strengthen and diversify the supply of professional services through courses. Under sub-
component (3) of this component, forest management manuals would be produced for each
participating state covered by the project. Under subcomponent (4) of this component, the project
would support specialized technical assistance teams to support communities.

Component C. Diversification and Investment (US$3.60 million; 12.5 % of the total project
cost) The objective of this component was to promote diversification of the income sources of the
community and ejido beneficiaries. Under subcomponent 1, the project would: (a) support the
diagnosis and analysis of potential investments, and (b) invest in subprojects in ejidos and
communities. Under sub-component 2, the project would carry out studies and design payments
for environmental services schemes. The project supported feasibility studies in light of the
subsequent investments in viable subprojects; however, the finance allocation of the component


                                                 4
was relatively small as CFP II was not intended to be a major source of investment finance as
other sources were available for this purpose. Any financing for actual investments made under
the project would be complementary to financing from other sources including: (a) other
government programs such as PRODEFOR, (b) community funds, (c) private donations.

Component D. Institutional Strengthening (US$2.70 million; 9.3 % of the total project cost)
The objective of component D was to provide support for a project subunit coordination team in
each participating state and for basic goods and services for the implementation of the project
including vehicles (not financed by the loan), information technology for the subunits in the
states, training and support baseline studies of environment and social relations that will provide a
basis for monitoring and evaluation of project advances. It would also finance strategic studies in
each of the participating states proposed by CONAFOR and approved by the Bank.

Component E. Project Management (US$3.10 million; 10.7 % of the total project cost) The
objective of this component was to provide support for central project implementation unit and
annual financial audits.

Not applicable (no revisions)

1.7 Other significant changes

During the execution of this Project, one amendment, two reallocations and one extension were
granted as follows:

Amendment and Reallocation: At the request of the borrower, the Loan Agreement was amended
on October 25, 2007. The amendment included the following changes:

            Increase the disbursement percentage in accordance with country financing
            parameters from 83% to 100% under all disbursement categories;
            Include an investment category for "operating costs" in order to include operating
            costs required for the Project;
            Reallocate loan proceeds as follows: of the US$2.0 million from Category 2
            (Consultant Services) US$1.5 million distributed to Category 3 (Training, Workshops
            and Regional Committees) and US$0.5 million to Category 9 (Operating Costs).
            Transfer US$1.5 million from Category 8 (Unallocated) to Category 5 (Investments
            Subprojects) and US$0.5 million to category 9 (Operating Costs).
            Amend the project agreement schedule, Section 1, Part B.2 to say that goods and
            works for investment subprojects estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent
            may be procured in accordance with commercial practices of the community and
            ejido, acceptable to the Bank and described in the Operational Manual.

Project extensions: The project had one extension for six months, to December 31, 2008, in order
to complete the original project objectives.

Reallocation: A request from the borrower to reallocate funds among disbursement categories
was approved in October 2008 to increase funds available for technical assistance, training, and
community subprojects. Proceeds from categories 1, 2, 3, and 9 were transferred to categories 4
and 5 in the amount of US$1.7 million. The transfer was logical, as more funds were needed to



                                                 5
support increasing numbers of communities and ejidos that were now ready to undertake more
complex investment subprojects.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation. The project was well conceived and had a sound technical design that
targeted the issues and was based in part on the experiences and lessons learned during the
implementation of the first IBRD Community Forestry Project (US$15 million), as well as those
highlighted in the Bank's forest sector review of 1995. Project preparation was supported by a
PHRD grant (US$372,000) and CONAFOR conducted a social evaluation and produced a
Development Plan for Indigenous Peoples, which included the requisite consultations.

The project expanded the geographic coverage over the first project to include the states of
Jalisco, Durango and Quintana Roo (as well as Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Michoacán). The primary
target group of the project was poor indigenous and non-indigenous people from communities
and ejidos (comuneros and ejidatarios) in forested areas in the states. The areas were selected on
the basis of the presence of high-value standing forest resources owned by indigenous
communities or ejidos. At the time of the appraisal, it was expected that this project would assist
200 communities and ejidos on a demand-driven basis, and continue assistance to some of the
300 original communities from the first project.

The Bank preparation team was composed of forestry, environmental, social, and economic
experts, as well as procurement and financial management specialists. The FAO CP played an
important role in providing technical experts to work side-by-side with national counterparts in
project formulation.

Project Design. The underlying premise of the project's approach was to empower indigenous
communities and ejidos to plan, organize and implement forestry and related activities, while
respecting traditional forms of governance and community management. Other design elements
supported this principle. For example, technical and organizational support helped to build
capacities at the community level and to strengthen self reliance. Technical service providers
reported directly to communities, rather than to the PIUs, to ensure ownership of activities.
Communities were required to co-finance technical assistance and investments. Moreover, all
major decisions regarding project activities had to be ratified by community assemblies and
validated at the regional level. The project sponsored regional inter-community fora to help
communities create alliances needed for cooperative efforts. Regional fora promoted community
engagement with state and federal governments, for the identification of needs and priority setting
for assistance programs.

At the regional level the project created permanent venues in all six states (Regional
Participatory Committees) for the identification of community needs and concerns, to solicit
support, and to obtain more information about the project. The committees included key
stakeholders (community/ejido leaders and comuneros) technical service specialists, NGOs and
CONAFOR staff and project personnel, SEMARNAT and others. Other program personnel, such
as those from COINBIO participated also. The events were organized with the support of the
promoters of the project, who distributed invitations to the meetings. (During the meetings
promoters were also assigned to work with specific communities.)




                                                 6
A call for proposals (RFP) was published in state newspapers and internet to invite
communities/ejidos to present technical proposals for project funding. Dissemination of the RFPs
was also carried out through the regional fora and local radio, sometimes in the native dialect.
Participating communities (sometimes with help from the TSPs) prepared proposals for technical
assistance activities or productive investment subprojects.

At the end of the call for proposals, the state PIUs carried out a validation process of each
proposal in the Regional Participatory Committees. The social validation included (i) a review of
the activity's potential contribution to the economic and social development of the country (ii) its
contribution to resolve and avoid conflict within or among communities and (iii) its
environmental sustainability. The proposals were then submitted to a technical committee of
CONAFOR staff specialized in environmental, social and economic concerns for evaluation and
eligibility for funding through the project. SEMARNAT reviewed project proposals to screen
them for adverse environmental impacts.

The final approval of the proposals was made by a Committee composed of the Regional
Manager of CONAFOR, and representatives from the PIU, SEMARNAT, the state government
and the beneficiaries of the Program designated by the Regional Participatory Committees. The
results were published by the State Approval Committee in state newspapers, and posted on
CONAFORs webpage and in the regional venues.

At the community level (as a result of the regional fora) project promoters received invitations to
participate in community assemblies. There, they provided detailed project information to the
entire community about the project. This direct dialogue with the communities helped to develop
trust and to ensure that the all members of the community had the opportunity to voice concerns
or learn about the project directly.

When communities decided to participate in the project, the community representative would sign
a framework agreement (convenio de concertación) with CONAFOR, which was conditional on
its approval by the community assembly. Community assemblies also were required to approve
project proposals for their communities. Documentation certifying approval by the community
comprised an important part of the proposal package.

The design specified that during the execution of projects, communities would participate
directly, usually with the guidance of a technical service provider of their choice, and with
ongoing overall supervision of the state PIU promoters. This approach helped to ensure the
ownership of the project activities by the communities and enhance their capacity for making
decisions at the community level. Communities in their early stages of development were eligible
for direct assistance to help them become more organized, so that they could eventually take on
more complex activities and investments. Community-to-community outreach was also included
in the design, and helped to demonstrate best practices and disseminate lessons learned directly
by other project beneficiaries.

Beneficiary co-financing was required. However, the project design allowed for the less
developed communities to provide lower amounts of co-financing for technical assistance
activities (below). Subproject co-financing was set at 50% (1:1) for all community types.

    IV        Owners of forest resources who add value to forest products            30 percent
              and market them directly.


Technical Service Providers (TSPs) were both beneficiaries and part of the project
implementation design. These private technical consultants (individuals, firms and NGOs)
benefitted from the project by receiving training and certification, which enabled them to become
more effective in working with indigenous people and in community forestry. Once the TSPs had
successfully passed the training, they were included on a roster of qualified service providers
available for eligible project activities. Annual recertification was required and TSPs could be
dropped from the roster if they did not re-certify or performed poorly.

This TSP roster was made available to the communities and ejidos to choose the person or firm
most qualified based on their specific needs for a project activity. The communities sought TSP
assistance for drafting community bylaws, conducting participatory rural appraisals, land-use
zoning plans, NTFP studies, forestry plans, agriculture, finance and administration, industrial
security, sociology, marketing etc. Service providers were also trained to recognize, assess and
resolve community conflicts. TSPs reported directly to the communities with whom they worked,
while the administration of the contract was with the PIU in CONAFOR. The authorization of
payments to TSPs was made by the communities to CONAFOR, once they were satisfied with the
delivery of the final product or service.

The project design designated CONAFOR as the primary executing agency, for which a
separate "Project Agreement" was formalized between the Bank and CONAFOR. The project
was largely decentralized with a PIU established in each of the six target states, along with a
small administrative and technical unit in CONAFOR's headquarters. The state PIUs conducted
the day-to-day activities with the communities and with CONAFOR's regional offices. Promoters
assigned to the PIUs worked extensively in the field to initiate and maintain a physical presence
on site with the communities. Experienced professional foresters and natural resource
professionals were contracted as state coordinators, who provided the overall leadership and
vision for the PIU management. The state coordinators also engaged with state
forestry/environment programs, SEMARNAT and other CONAFOR programs, to ensure a
coherent approach to assisting the beneficiary communities.

Coordination with other projects. The project was partially blended to the IBRD GEF Indigenous
and Community Biodiversity Conservation Project (COINBIO), which had the development
objective "... to achieve more effective biodiversity conservation in the states of Oaxaca,
Michoacán, and Guerrero by strengthening the capacity of indigenous and ejido communities to
manage and protect their biological and cultural resources based on traditional values and
practices". The two projects coordinated activities to ensure coherency in their approach to
communities and to prevent the duplication of efforts. State project personnel from the IBRD
project participated in the review of proposals for COINBIO and exchanged information


                                                 8
routinely. As a result of CONAFOR's increased interest in community forestry, it adopted the
COINBIO activities after closure. The project also coordinated with the Mesoamerican Biological
Corridor project, which was active in Quintana Roo.

Risk Assessment. The risks identified during the preparation were i) expanding the
marginalization of groups in certain communities; (ii) deepening of existing inter-and intra-
community conflicts; (iii) marginalization of the younger population in indigenous ejidos; (iv)
creation or deepening of conflicts in ejidos and communities based on administrative problems;
(v) forestry technical service providers will deliver low quality technical assistance and training
in the forestry management plans.

To mitigate the first risk the population of all the agrarian communities were informed about the
project activities. The second risk was mitigated by establishing conflict resolution venues
promoted within the agrarian groups. On a very selective basis, the project also encouraged land
and boundary surveys to delineate community land holdings to help alleviate inter-community
conflicts. To mitigate the third risk, conflict resolution fora were promoted within the agrarian
communities. The fourth risk was mitigated by technical assistance and capacity building
activities for management and accounting issues and transparency and accountability practices
within the agrarian groups. That risk was mitigated through coordinated efforts with
PRODEFOR to jointly raise quality standards and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of
the work carried out by forestry technical service providers (with PRODEFOR and CFP II
resources) and within the Regional Technical Committees.

Borrower Commitment. Borrower commitment was demonstrated through the successful
implementation of the first Community Forestry Project (1997-2003) and Mexico's National
Forestry Strategy which incorporated the participatory approach of the first community forestry
project. In 2001, the government elevated the role of forestry by establishing the autonomous
agency CONAFOR (The Comision Nacional Forestal to manage and oversee the country's
forestry sector. In recognition of the growing importance of community forestry, CONAFOR
established the "community forestry" unit in 2006, which now provides a permanent institutional
platform for addressing the issue.

2.2 Implementation

The loan agreement was signed on December 9, 2003, and the project became effective on July
15, 2004. The project was allocated MX$35 million at signing, and in September 2004 received
an additional MX$35 million. During the initial six months, the project prepared an operational
manual, which was approved in July 2004. Prior to the Bank's approval of the operational
manual, which was a condition of effectiveness, the project was rated unsatisfactory for
development objectives3. Once the manual was approved, both the development objectives and
implementation progress were upgraded to satisfactory. Even though the project had not been
effective for about 6 months, in the meantime CONAFOR had done a good job in identifying
qualified project staff for the state PIUs, which facilitated rapid implementation thereafter.

Following effectiveness, implementation progress began to accelerate through its peak in May
2005, when it was rated highly satisfactory. Paradoxically, later that same year, project support

3
 IP was considered unsatisfactory until an advanced draft of the operational manual was delivered in June
2004, when it was upgraded to moderately satisfactory. Once the manual was approved the following
month, IP was then upgraded to satisfactory.



                                                    9
within CONAFOR softened with the new authorities and implementation slowed as a result of
the PIU's relocation to CONAFOR's headquarters in Guadalajara. While the move was necessary
to ensure the project maintained close ties with CONAFOR, it was disruptive and some of the
staff left the project. Around the same time, the project's budget was reduced and there was a
downturn in performance as a sizable disbursement lag began to accumulate. Later in the year,
the Project Coordinator resigned and in June 2006, IP was downgraded to moderately
unsatisfactory.

In discussions between the Bank Team and the new authorities, it became clear that CONAFOR
wanted to mainstream the project into its main field program, PRODEPLAN, and enforce
operational procedures consistent with CONAFOR's other programs. As this would most likely
have compromised the project's community-driven approach to forestry, the Bank team did not
agree with the proposal. Moreover, the strong demand for the project by communities and ejidos
made CONAFOR reluctant to impose changes to one of its most popular programs. During this
period, the Bank team continued with its routine supervisions and played an important role in
advocating the project's participatory approach with the CONAFOR authorities.

The overall lackluster project performance persisted through early 2007, until a more interested
and sympathetic management entered CONAFOR with the new president's administration.
Thereafter, performance began to steadily improve. The new authorities took a special interest in
the project and the community approach and maintained the operational procedures agreed to in
the operational manual. They were also quick to follow up on the preliminary MTR
recommendation to authorize additional promoters for each of the state's PIUs, needed to increase
the project's outreach to the communities.

Later in 2007, CONAFOR requested an amendment to the loan agreement to boost
implementation, which included inter alia an increase in the IBRD disbursement percentage to
100% and increasing the ceiling for prior review of investment subprojects to US$100,000 (see
section 1.7 for details). Following the approval of the amendment, there was a dramatic uptick in
both performance and disbursements. A single 6-month extension gave the project the small
amount of additional time it needed to make up for earlier delays and by closure on December 31,
2008, the full amount of the loan was expended.

Personnel Changes ­ There were three coordinators during the project's tenure. The resignation
of an experienced project coordinator (forester) in 2005 was a particular setback to the program,
as was his replacement, who lacked forestry credentials and community development experience.
However, in 2007, another highly qualified coordinator (and forester) was recruited, and proved
instrumental in bringing the project through to successful closure. There were other changes in
personnel at the technical and state levels. However, these did not materially affect the project
implementation.

MTR. The project Mid-Term Review (MTR) was initiated in 2006. However, due to delays in the
contracting of the external evaluators for social, environmental and economic themes, and
delivery of their reports, it was not concluded until April 2007. The main findings of the exercise
were that the project had made substantial progress against the target indicators, showed it was on
track for a successful closure, and validated the overall participatory community-driven approach.
Important recommendations included and acted upon by the project were inter alia: increasing
the number of promoters in the state PIUs to enhance project outreach; increasing the threshold
for prior review of subprojects to US$100,000; improve TSP diversity to include more
administrative themes; monitoring the evolution of the TSP approach to ensure it did not create
dependencies; updating the typology classification; and preparing for a third phase of the project.


                                                10
Risk Status. During 2005, as implementation began to flag, the project was considered at risk, due
to the substantial disbursement lag (42%). The team urged CONAFOR to process outstanding
replenishment requests to cover ongoing project activities. However, little progress was made
until the change of administrations in early 2007. Shortly thereafter, implementation began to
improve as did disbursements. An amendment to the LA that same year was instrumental in
correcting both implementation and disbursement issues (see section 1.7).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design ­ The project design included performance and impact indicators to monitor the
Project's objectives. During the implementation, no indicators were changed. Most of the
indicators were simple and straightforward, with the exception of the indicator to measure "12
associations and 65 community enterprises functioning three or more years after launch."
Because the operation was executed over four and a half years, only those enterprises and
associations created in the first 18 months of the project qualified for reporting, while in reality
many more were created over the following 3 years of the project. Though in retrospect targets
for indicators may appear conservative, they were, in fact, based on lessons learned and the
performance of the first Community Forestry Project to ensure they were realistic and achievable.

M&E Implementation ­ In general, the PIU took measurements during the entire project cycle
and updated the table of performance indicators annually, with the exception of 2005. During the
field visits and supervision missions, physical inspection was carried out by the Bank team to
verify progress. Data for indicator measurements are considered good.

The Bank requirements for project monitoring stimulated CONAFOR to develop a more
comprehensive and robust database monitoring and reporting system for the Community Forestry
Directorate and project. By project closure, they had developed a comprehensive information
system (SISCO) with intranet connections to the state PIUs for data transfer and use and VPN
connections for the proposed six states for a next phase.

SISCO is now linked to INEGI (the National institute of Statistics) and the National Agrarian
Registry for cross referencing project information with other national and local statistics. The
INEGI data is available for 180,000 locales and 32 states. The National Agrarian Registry
contains the latest agricultural census data for 30,000 different properties. SISCO contains listings
for 31 indigenous ethnic groups, 60 financial institutions, and approximately 1,600 registered
consultants.

Project data includes a registration module for all project-financed proposals, co-financing
information from states, information on project proponents, evaluations of project proposals,
outputs, and other information. The database was developed in Foxbase and is able to download
documents to Word and Excel, as well as print documents in official formats. Information can be
sorted and classed for various analyses and are being used for the design of new programs, as
well as the final evaluation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement. During the execution of the project four ex-post reviews were conducted by the
LC1 procurement team, that covered all the entire life of the project; the first one in May 2006
covered the procurement plan 2005, the second one in November 2006 covered the contracts in
the procurement plan for 2006, the third one carried out in January 2008 included the
procurement transactions in the procurement plan for 2007 and the last one in October-


                                                 11
November 2008 covered the contracts in the final procurement plan. Three of the ex-post reviews
included field visits to the subprojects in the participating States (Jalisco, Oaxaca and
Michoacán). The conclusion of the ex-post reviews was always satisfactory and confirmed that
the Coordination Unit for the Project and CONAFOR applied methods and procedures consistent
with the legal documents and the procurement Guidelines. The Project had no cases of
misprocurement.

Financial Management. Two FM supervision missions were carried out in 2008 and one in 2009.
Based on the mission findings it was concluded that CONAFOR complied with the Bank's FM
requirements and provided adequate implementation support and oversight, contributing to the
overall satisfactory financial management of the project. The Bank determined that FM
arrangements were adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the grant proceeds were being
used for the intended purposes.

NAFIN, as financial agent, maintained records and accounts adequate to reflect the project's
operations and financial condition (this included records and separate accounts for the Bank-
financed projects under implementation). Internal control arrangements for the project fulfilled
Bank requirements. The project was audited by an external private firm on an annual basis.
Neither the auditors nor the Bank identified any major FM-related issues. The Bank FM team
reviewed and commented on the Bank loan audit reports each year. Throughout the whole life of
the project, CONAFOR prepared and submitted quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR)
which were considered acceptable for the Bank.

The main FM-related weaknesses identified were delays in the process of preparation and
submission to the Bank of the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), as well as delays in
clarifying Bank's observations.

Safeguards. Safeguard issues were rated satisfactory throughout project implementation. The
Bank team included an experienced team of foresters, biologists, sociologists and anthropologists
trained in Bank safeguards that contributed to the project's good compliance with Bank policies.

Environmental Evaluation (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01). The project was classified as a Category
B and its impacts considered positive, given its focus on expanding and improving
environmentally- and socially-sustainable forest management and best management practices for
other natural resource activities.

Investments under the subprojects category focused on the development of community forestry
through the regulated and sustainable use of timber and non-timber forest products. Investments
involving the transformation of forests required official permits from SEMARNAT to ensure
compliance with environmental standards. Through its participation in state committees,
SEMARNAT screened proposals, identifying those too risky for implementation, needing
environmental evaluations, or requiring mitigation measures. The project also complied with
restrictions prohibiting activities in Natural or Protected Areas which were identified and mapped
in the preparation-stage EA.

Other investments, such as participatory planning, the strengthening of technical and organization
capacities, the preparation of technical and economic feasibility studies and development of
management plans were employed to help communities build the capacity needed to manage their
resources in the long-term. Other instruments mainstreamed into community projects included the
registration of wildlife management areas and setting limits for extraction of non-timber products.



                                                12
Industrial operations improved environmental health, safety and labor standards by obtaining
permits and training for the use, management, storage, and disposal of industrial chemicals.

The World Bank supervision team included forestry and environmental specialists to supervise
the screening of activities and compliance with the conditions established by the environmental
authority, SEMARNAT. The team participated regularly in field visits and confirmed with other
stakeholders and the beneficiaries that the environmental safeguards were being fulfilled.

The experience in the application of the environmental safeguards was positive. Emphasis by the
project in strengthening human and social capital in the ejidos and communities improved their
capacity to evaluate, plan, manage and conserve the environmental resources within their domain.
Additional environmental benefits were accrued through the restoration of degraded lands with
native species and expanding biodiversity conservation, though community reserves, protection
of riparian corridors, springs, and areas designated for ecotourism.

Natural Habitas (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04). The protection of natural habitats was an important
aspect of the project. The project design included a sector study that identified the main gaps for
project interventions needed to ensure sustainable management of the native forests by country by
ejidos and communities. Through the project, over 760 thousand hectares of new conservation
areas were designated through the zoning plans as either community conservation areas or
wildlife preserves. Beneficiaries were trained to become better stewards for the conservation and
sustainable management of natural habitats as well. Finally, the project facilitated and catalyzed
the protection of about 50 thousand hectares of natural areas through payments for environmental
services schemes.

Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36). The project focused on improving forest management practices,
diversification of forest use (including NTFPs), restoration of degraded lands with native species,
and community conservation with indigenous communities and ejidos. During the execution of
the project, best practice guides were developed for forest management practices, land-use
zoning, protection of riparian areas, forest harvesting and roads. World Bank forestry specialists
participated in the supervision missions and field visits to verify compliance with the forest
policy.

The project helped the beneficiaries achieve high standards in their forest management practices
through: (i) building technical and organizational capacities; (ii) strengthening of community
institutions, including the preparation or updating of the community regulation and bylaws that
regulate natural resource use; (iii) the training of technical community members in land-use
planning, forest and natural resource management, and (iv) by incorporating best practices into
their forestry operations needed to meet certification requirements. The impact of these activities
is reflected in the high number of approved forest management programs by the environmental
authority (SEMARNAT), the 913,000 ha under improved management and the certification of
over 90,920 ha under sustainable forest management by independent entities (Forest Stewardship
Council).

Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). The CFP II was conceived as an indigenous people's project
given the high level of representation that these communities have in the target states. It was
specifically designed to have a positive effect on indigenous peoples and indigenous
communities. A sociologist or anthropologist from the Bank participated in the majority of
missions and field visits to monitor compliance and provide guidance to the local team.




                                                13
The basic strategy of the Project was to directly involve indigenous peoples in the management of
their forest resources based on the principle of informed decision making. During preparation,
consultations were carried out as a part of the social evaluation in compliance with OP 4.10. One
of the principal aspects that resulted from the social evaluation was to identify the main socio-
cultural and socio-economic characteristics of the indigenous peoples including levels of
organization, typology of the communities, traditional knowledge regarding biodiversity
conservation, and land tenure to ensure both cultural and environmental sustainability. The
principal of free prior informed consultation was one of the principal factors included in the
project as prerequisite for any financed activity.

Socio-cultural values: The Project respected and included social-cultural values and traditional
organizational practices of the ejidos and communities in the design of the Project, consequently
strengthening its social capital and possibilities of success. The project has also worked to ensure
that sacred places were protected, which frequently correlate with areas of high biodiversity,
springs and other environmental services.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

CFP II and the Mexican model of community forestry has been studied and emulated worldwide.
The country is second only to Papua New Guinea in total area of forests under community
management. In addition, Mexico has the highest levels of community certified forests and
forests under improved management worldwide, providing a basis for their environmentally- and
socially-sustainable forest utilization.

The successful community-driven approach employed by the project is already being scaled up
by CONAFOR to include six new states, as well as the six covered by the project. Discussions are
ongoing at the time of the ICR between the Bank and the Government relative to possible
assistance from the Bank in the new activities along with help in integrating them into an overall
framework for addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation. A new challenge to be
considered in a next investment would also be to increase the engagement and cooperation with
other governmental organizations such as CONABIO, SAGARPA, CDI and SEMARNAT.

Sustainability of the project activities is a function of institutional, economic, environmental, and
social factors:

Institutional. At closure, the project's activities were fully incorporated into CONAFOR's
Directorate of Community Forestry (La Gerencia de Silvicultura Comunitaria), created in 2006,
which received an allocation of MX$128.4 million from CONAFOR in 2009 for support to 1,380
proposals from 792 agrarian communities in the 6 project states and 6 additional ones, thereby
scaling up community forestry efforts to 70% of all forested areas of the country. Beneficiary
state governments allocated an additional MX$11.6 million while communities provided
MX$201 million for sustainable forestry activities. CONAFOR also established the goals for the
2009 ­ 2012 period which include: 1000 rural communities in the process of developing their
natural resources in sustainable ways, 3 million ha with community resource plans (OTCs), 350
special events to encourage inter- and intra-community resource use, 450 community regulations
and bylaws approved, and 60 community technicians trained and responding to community
forestry and natural resource needs.

Economic. With 65% of the country's 21 million ha of productive forests located in community
and ejido holdings and a strong domestic demand for wood products, the sector holds important
opportunities for community forestry enterprises (EFCs). Nevertheless, imported wood products


                                                 14
from the U.S., Chile and Uruguay out-compete domestic wood sources in many areas of the
country and in 2008 Mexico was a net importer of wood products. In order to regain market
share, community enterprises have to become much more efficient and business oriented. The
project provided the tools and training to many communities, which will help them increase
efficiency. Project support helped communities and ejidos form cooperative arrangements. As a
result, many are now working in joint ventures, which are helping to increase production
volumes, distribute risks, and generate economies of scale. Since 2006, the Mexican government
now requires the procurement of wood products only from certified sustainably managed
domestic forests. This type of market incentive by the government provides an excellent though
limited opportunity for encouraging sustainable forest management.

Initiatives such as payments for environmental services, watershed protection, and carbon
sequestration piloted by the project demonstrate how communities can generate income without
capital, by simply maintaining and protecting the forest. For communities just beginning to enter
the sector, such capital can be critical to help start or catalyze more substantive investments.
Future efforts, such as payments for reductions in deforestation and [forest] degradation (REDD),
will find an ideal terrain for testing and implementing the system in Mexico's forested ejidos and
communities using the project's participatory and community-driven approach.

Environmental. Environmental sustainability through the project's community forestry focus has
been achieved through improved forest management over 913,000 ha where biodiversity is
maintained in ecosystems of global importance. In addition, over 760 thousand hectares of new
conservation areas were designated through zoning plans as either community conservation areas
or wildlife preserves. The ecosystems targeted by the project are highly diverse, some of which
include the largest number of pine species in the world and almost 130 species of oak.4 Highly
threatened dry ecosystems and tropical areas were also conserved (a process strengthened by the
GEF Indigenous and Community Biodiversity Conservation Project, TF 24372) and, in the case
of the former, inadequately protected by the national system. Moreover, recent studies have
shown that well-managed community forests have better protection levels and lower deforestation
rates than poorly managed areas under protection by the national systems.5 Half of the certified
community forests in the world are found in Mexico, which also has the second highest forest
area under community ownership.

Environmental sustainability is enhanced by the formal inclusion of protected areas in the
community and ejido by-laws and zoning plans. As a result of recent changes in Mexican law,
some communities have now formally registered conservation areas through CONABIO.
Stronger links to the national system and better incentives for establishing community-protected
areas hold potential for consolidating environmental gains.

Social. The strengthening of social capital was a cornerstone of the project and helped ejidos and
communities to improve their governance, foment community participation, reduce conflicts,
mitigate emigration, and increase income through improved forest management and the
generation of revenue. The resulting improvements in organization, planning, and economic

other government and NGO development programs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objective of the CFP II project was to assist indigenous communities and ejidos
that own forests in priority regions of Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan, Oaxaca and
Quintana Roo to improve the management and conservation of their forest resources and to
generate alternative sources of income in a sustainable manner. The project objectives,
outcomes and activities were fully completed and continue to have a high degree of relevance to
the country and development priorities, as reflected in the current (2008) CAS, which emphasizes
environmental sustainability and promoting social inclusion, and strengthening institutions.

In 2009, the project approach was scaled up by CONAFOR to include 6 new states, total 12,
indicating its growing relevance and high priority accorded to it by the government (see section
2.5 for details). These activities will be executed by the CONAFOR's Community Forestry
Directorate (la Gerencia de Silvicultura Communitaria) using the same approach as the project.
In addition, based on the strengths and successes of the project approach, CONAFOR has
mainstreamed the community-forestry approach into ProArbol, its main instrument for overall
forestry development. ProArbol activities now include community forestry technician training,
community- to-community training and capacity building seminars, community land-use
planning, the development and strengthening of community by-laws and participatory rural
appraisals.

Outside of the 12 states, Community Forestry personnel are providing training and guidance to
ProArbol and other CONAFOR staff on best-practices for adopting the project's community and
participatory approach to forestry development. In this way, the community-forestry approach is
gradually being mainstreamed and replicated throughout the forested areas of the country.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project was based on socially- and culturally-appropriate means of technology transfer,
organization and decision making through traditional community processes and empowerment. A
"coaching" approach was employed to ensure that communities were assisted through the many
steps required to help them develop the capacity to manage their forests and wood industries
independently, at their own pace and in their own way. The project area had 1.1 million
inhabitants distributed in over 1000 agrarian communities (nucleos agrarios). Around 50 percent
of the beneficiaries came from indigenous groups including the Zapoteco, Maya, Purepecha,
Mixteco, Chatmo, Nahua, Tlapmeco, Mixe, Triqui, Chinanteco and Chontal peoples.

Community planning tools mainstreamed through the project help beneficiaries develop a broader
vision for their own future. Consensus building and the participation of community members in
decision-making to increase social capital helped to ensure the sustainability of the project's
actions.

Significant impacts in the target area and for beneficiaries include:

    ·   an estimated 6,204 people that did not migrate from the project states



                                                 16
    ·    an increase in employment in the forest sector by 27.2% between 2004 and 2008
    ·    a 36% increase in net value of forest goods and services
    ·    353 regulations and bylaws adopted
    ·    90,920 ha of forests certified as sustainably managed by independent parties
    ·    51 payment for environmental services schemes in place
    ·    41 associations and 179 community forestry enterprises strengthened
    ·    913,000 ha of forest area under improved forms of management
    ·    1,783,574 ha under 274 community zoning plans (OTCs)

The PDO was fully achieved through the completion of three specific objectives, as follows:

Specific Objective 1: To strengthen community institutions by means of the consolidation of
social capital and management capacity to improve the benefits flowing from use of forest
resources

The "social capital"6 of community and ejido institutions was strengthened through investments
to help them become better organized, to establish a platform of community bylaws and norms
for regulating forest and land use, and to build capacity for making informed decisions
concerning their welfare and resources. The project design required communities to approve
investments by their governing bodies, which helped to create an environment of participation,
transparency and ownership. The design also empowered communities to choose their own
technical assistance providers from a list of certified providers, who reported directly to them (not
the PIUs).

The project correctly targeted assistance on social themes. A total of 1072 or 62% of all of the
2776 community investments were made in lesser developed communities (Type I and Type II).
Of which, 48% of the activities in Type I and 41% in Type II communities focused on
strengthening their capacity for carrying out more complex productive activities in the sector.
These activities included assistance in developing bylaws and regulations, community land
management, participatory rural evaluations and community-to-community seminars. The more
advanced communities (Types III and IV) also benefitted from activities to strengthen community
institutions. However, needing less support, only 15% and 25%, respectively, of their combined
1056 project-financed activities focused on institution building themes.

                                                        17
Through the efforts of the project, 353 community regulations and bylaws were designed and
promulgated (735% of target) to support sustainable resource management. The bylaws
formalized such products and agreements as the zoning and management plans, enabling
communities to ensure compliance with their tenets. Thirty regional participatory committees
were formed (120% of target) which now provide permanent fora for all six states for the
identification of community needs and concerns. Committees include key stakeholders from the
communities, technical service specialists, NGOs, CONAFOR staff, project personnel,
SEMARNAT and others.

Some 179 community forestry enterprises (EFCs) and 41 associations were created or
strengthened (138% and 164% of targets, respectively). The community forestry enterprises
represent the nexus between the community and the business world. Through their creation and
strengthening, the project helped to mainstream communities into the national economy, while
maintaining and respecting their traditional cultural forms of management. As some EFCs
developed into successful businesses, they have begun to reevaluate their management policies
and, with the community assembly's consent, adopt more business-like management systems to
ensure their growth and sustainability ­ gradually eliminating traditional approaches. However,
the struggle is ongoing to find the balance between good business practices and traditional
expectations in most of the communities.

Participatory community planning furthered the building of communities' social capital. This was
accomplished through 241 participatory rural evaluations, or rapid rural appraisals, (161% of
target) through which communities worked alongside qualified technical advisors to evaluate and
map land cover and use within their communities. The baseline information generated through
this stock-taking exercise helped communities become aware of their own resource situation and
visualize areas for improvements, thereby setting the stage for future investments.

The project funded 225 community-to-community seminars (469% of target), whereby the more
advanced communities demonstrated by example, new ways of improved resource management
to those in earlier stages of improving their capacity. Such seminars included visits between
communities to show first- hand the results of a particular community's efforts. Inter-community
seminars also supported groups of communities and ejidos to define common goals and ways of
working together -- fundamental when resources or capacities are insufficient in individual
communities and collective efforts are needed.




                                               18
At project closure, 915 community or ejido members had participated in community- to-
community seminars and 3,968 in the regional seminars. Some 93% of the beneficiaries in the
communities and ejidos reported that the social situation in their community had improved as a
result of the project. During the final evaluation, community (and ejido) beneficiaries ranked the
project highly favorably (8 on a scale of 9) and felt that the project should continue unchanged.

Specific Objective 2: To strengthen technical and administrative capacity of ejidos and
communities for the development of local and regional productive processes

The highest amount of project financing was dedicated to Objective 2, which focused on
strengthening the technical and administrative capacity of beneficiary communities and ejidos,
and for co-financing of preparatory activities needed for specific sector investments. Studies were
carried out to explore ways to strengthen community enterprises and intra-community efforts, as
well as to assess the feasibility of investments, including those for non-timber forest products.
Training was conducted to upgrade and diversify the skills of private-sector professionals and
community technicians to better serve community and indigenous needs.

In general, efforts to support Objective 2 built on achievements in Objective 1 which prepared
communities and ejidos to organize and make informed decisions for the detailed planning
needed to take on investments for forestry, conservation and sustainable natural resource
management. The approach was demand-driven and proposals for project financing required
formal endorsement by community assemblies before they could be considered for financing.

Some 448 professionals and technical service providers were trained and incorporated (299% of
target) into CONAFOR's list of certified service providers. A total of 752 specialized courses for
human capital development were conducted, including courses on identification and management
of conflicts and to train community/ejido forest technicians. At project closure, 3,123
beneficiaries had participated in training courses. The project conducted 176 technical feasibility
and community organization studies (220% of target). Five forestry best-practice manuals were
produced for the participating states for community zoning plans (OTC's), forest management
practices, protection of riparian areas, forest harvesting and forest roads.

The development of Community Zoning Plans (OTC)7 was one of the first steps in helping
communities translate their visions for development into a practical planning tool, usually in the
form of a written document and map. OTCs draw heavily on the baseline resource information
generated in the participatory evaluations (Objective 1). Some 65% of all OTCs carried out by the
project were with Type I and Type II communities, where they were frequently needed most.
During the elaboration of OTCs, communities work side-by-side with qualified technical advisers
(TSPs) to decide how to organize their land use and best manage their resources. Typically OTCs
delineate community holdings for forest management, non-timber forest products, protection and
conservation, agriculture, and settlements, among others.




7
  Community Zoning Plans: Known as Ordenamientos Territoriales Comunitarios in Spanish, have been defined by
CONAFOR as..."a planning tool that determines the land use in ejidos and communities in the short, medium, and
long-term. Its general objectives are to guide productive activities in communal forested areas, drive production toward
sustainable use of natural resources and support conservation and protection activities..." (CONAFOR 2007). The
plans are prepared in a participatory way and seek balance between productive aspects, natural resource use and
conservation, while linking the process to strengthening internal community organization and bylaws.




                                                          19
To finalize the process, OTCs are voted on by assemblies and once approved become part of their
bylaws. This ensures that the community as a whole agrees with the plans, and provides a formal
means for the governing bodies to regulate land use. Several iterations of the OTCs are
sometimes produced until the communities reach an internal agreement on their content. Some
274 zoning plans (OTCs) were prepared under the project (232% of target) covering over 1.7
million hectares, with an investment of MX$32.8 million. This is four times the number of OTCs
supported under CFP I which financed 63 OTC's over 536 thousand ha. The combined total of
OTCs from the two projects covers 26% of all the forested communities and ejidos in the six
target states. Over 760 thousand hectares of new conservation areas were designated through the
CFP II zoning plans as either community conservation areas or wildlife preserves.

Many communities now utilize the zoning information generated by the OTCs to coordinate
efforts with other government and non-governmental programs. Because the project's OTCs have
become recognized as effective planning instruments for the sector, other organizations have the
confidence that their investments will be properly directed and well used by the recipient
communities that have them. (In Oaxaca alone, OTCs helped communities to access over MX$46
million in payments for environmental services in 23 communities.) Based on the success of the
project's OTC exercises, in 2007 it was replicated and scaled up by the largest GoM forestry
program, ProArbol. In the last two years of the project, ProArbol invested MX$63.8 million in
the preparation of an additional 451 zoning plans, for another 2.64 million ha covered by
community-approved plans.

Once agreements and plans were formalized through approved OTCs, communities and ejidos
could begin planning for specific investments. This was frequently accomplished through the
development of forest management and conservation plans. Forest management plans consolidate
the community vision for forest use by delineating harvest areas, identifying species to be
harvested, volumes to be extracted and annual allowances for cutting, regeneration schemes,
mitigation measures, conservation areas and restricted species. Plans for protection and
conservation areas identified the areas and conservation/protection objectives (eg. biodiversity or
watersheds) and associated management strategies.

Forest management plans had to be approved in the assemblies and by SEMARNAT, as the
environmental authority, before they could be implemented. Conservation plans had to be
approved by assemblies and were optionally certified by CONABIO, as government-recognized
community protected areas. Under the project, 203 forest management and conservation plans
(127% of target) were developed or updated, through which approximately 270 thousand
hectares were brought under improved management. About 84% of all forest management plans
were developed in Type III and IV communities, where capacities were stronger, and
communities ready to carry out more complex investment subprojects, such as forest management
or forest-industry applications.




                                                20
By encouraging cooperation between communities and ejidos to work together, the project helped
beneficiaries to address common sector problems requiring broader efforts, such as fire
suppression and pest management, or to pool resources needed to increase their efficiency and
competiveness. The project successfully launched or strengthened 41 such associations
(Asociaciones Regionales de Silvicultores) (164% of target), some of which were working in
cooperative efforts to improve sales volumes, competitiveness and marketing of forestry products
and services. In Oaxaca alone, 24 associations including 378 communities were supported.

To promote environmental sustainability in productive areas, the project helped communities
diversify forest production and mainstream conservation into their productive activities by
financing 176 feasibility studies for non-timber forest products. Among the non-timber products
promoted were pine-resin, royal palm, medicinal plants, oregano, mezcal, and gum. Wildlife
management projects included white-tailed deer and wild turkey management areas, and the
rearing of honey-bees and iguanas. Many of the ecotourism subprojects were closely tied to
sustainable management and establishment of community conservation areas.

Over 0.5 million hectares of forests are now certified as sustainably managed in Mexico, with
over 90 thousand certified through the current project (120% of target) by independent auditors.
Certified forest management operations meet the highest criteria of economic, social and



                                               21
environmental standards. Because certification requires that workers and communities are
properly compensated, it is especially compatible with the community forestry approach.
Nevertheless, costs can be high to reach the certification standard, and frequently it's a process
that takes many years to achieve.

Specific Objective 3: to identify and develop investment alternatives and productive
diversification for communities and ejidos, and to promote local and regional arrangements
to facilitate access by these communities to schemes for payment for environmental services.

Communities and ejidos that successfully organized themselves to plan and execute more
complex activities were eligible to submit proposals for investment activities for project co-
financing, or through alternative sources (eg. PRODEPLAN, PROARBOL, PSA, Alianza para el
Campo, FIRA, FONAES, etc.). The project helped to mobilize MX$474 million from these
government programs to support the project objectives, MX$11.6 million from state governments
and MX$201 million from communities and ejidos themselves.

In general, subproject financing was modest, designed to be catalytic and promote the
diversification of income-generating activities in the communities and ejidos. Subproject proposal
screening criteria included (i) the activity's potential contribution to the economic and social
development of the country; (ii) its contribution to resolve and avoid conflict within or among
communities; and (iii) its environmental sustainability.

Eligible subprojects included the co-financing of value-added production facilities, such as
sawmills, kilns, and furniture manufacture equipment; ecotourism facilities; non-timber forest
products processing equipment; and assistance for taking advantage of payment for
environmental services schemes (i.e. water-purification and bottling equipment). Frequently
communities contracted technical service providers to help them with the design, debugging and
startup of the subprojects, as well as to train community members to operate the new machinery.

A total of MX$75 million was invested in 198 investment subprojects and the identification and
analysis of 122 potential investments for non-timber forestry products. US$5.62 million (244% of
target) was invested in NTFP subprojects.

Broad efforts were made through the project to promote the involvement of ejidos and
communities in regional payment for environmental services programs. During the project's
tenure, 206 communities and ejidos received an estimated MX$395 million covering payments
for protection or sustainable management of 299,255 hectares of forests. Payments were
distributed to communities and ejidos for providing services, such as conserving biodiversity in
priority areas, carbon sequestration, and maintaining and protected watersheds. About 30% of the
PES subprojects implemented by the PES program (below) were the direct result of the OTC
activities carried-out by the CFP II project which identified appropriate areas for implementing
the schemes and targeting the interventions.

Estimated direct and indirect employment generated from the subprojects is estimated at 2,549
and 6,839 persons, respectively. Improvements were made to administration and organization of
48% of the community forestry enterprises and 49% improved their manufacturing operations.
These investments by the project led to an increase in profits of 34%, increased sales of 39% and
growth in manufacturing capacity of 33%.




                                                 23
With an average IRR of 20.16% for the forestry subprojects and 22.06% for NTFPs, the IRR
values show that productive subprojects are clearly attractive from a financial perspective (see
sec. 3.3 on Efficiency for details).

3.3 Efficiency

No economic analysis for the project as a whole was conducted during project preparation. At
project closure, however, it was deemed useful to capture an overall economic indicator through
an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to reflect the general impact of the project: the IRR for the
overall project amounts to 19.63%. The three main categories of project-generated benefits were
considered for the economic analysis: (i) the benefits from community based forest protection /
conservation; (ii) the benefits from forest management; (iii) the benefits from the productive
subprojects.

Productive subprojects

CFP II financed 198 demand driven productive subprojects for a total amount of US$6.9 million
(IBRD) (around 33% of total project cost). Community counterpart contributions for productive
subproject implementation were 50% of the total cost (1:1).

The financial analysis of the productive subprojects used the results obtained through the field
work conducted by the "Universidad Autónoma Chapingo ­ (UACH) in late 2008 for the final
external evaluation. Project recorded data from 2004 to 2008 were also used and, in particular, the
calculations made for subprojects proposals which included a financial analysis to justify the
investments.

The sample on which financial calculations were made from data collected for 22 financed
demand-driven productive subprojects (11% sampling intensity). To compare the results with the
calculations ex ante made in the PAD, the study divided the productive subprojects in two
categories: (i) Community Forest Production such as improved saw mills or kilns and (ii) Non-
timber Forest Products (NTFPs) such as resin extraction, spring water bottling and ecotourism
projects. The sample had 15 subprojects labeled "Community Forest Production" and 7
subprojects labeled NTFPs. The results are as follows:

With an average of 20.16% for the Community Forest Production projects and 22.06% for
NTFPs, the IRR values obtained show that productive subprojects are clearly attractive from the
financial point of view (rates to be compared with a cost of capital around 12%). These values do
not depart substantially from the results obtain at the appraisal stage as they appear in the PAD.




                                                24
Community Zoning Plans

Community Zoning Plans (Ordenamientos Territoriales Comunitarios) were carried out
extensively during CFP II implementation. OTCs helped the communities and ejidos identify and
implement, in a participatory way, some of the project's principal activities: forest conservation,
forest management and productive subprojects. CFP II financed 274 Community Zoning Planning
exercises, for the same number of ejidos or communities, on an area of 1,783,574 hectares for a
total cost of US$2.45 million. As a result of the Community Zoning Planning exercises, a
significant share (17.25%) of the ejidos or communities assisted by CFP II have obtained
additional financing such as 26 projects for biodiversity (US$883,000), 16 projects for carbon
capture (US$277,000) as well as payments for environmental services.

Employment and incremental benefits

The total population of the ejidos and communities under CFP II coverage was estimated at
1,174,680 people of whom 48% are of indigenous origin. Over the project implementation period
(2004 -2008), 1005 ejidos or communities benefited from the project. Estimated direct and
indirect employment generated from the subprojects is estimated at 2,549 and 6,839 persons
respectively. The community forestry enterprises backed by CFP II employed around 159,930
people.

The increase of jobs generated by the project within the community was estimated8 at 27.2%
which is marginally below the target of 30% set in the PAD. From the survey made by the
Universidad Autónoma Chapingo ­ (UACH), the increase in net value of forest goods and
services has been evaluated at 36%9 compared to the 20% project at the time of appraisal in the
PAD10.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The Second Community Forestry Project was successful on many levels. From a quantitative
standpoint it exceeded nearly all of its targets at outcome and output levels, as well as rates of
returns for investment subprojects. However, its primary impact has been in scaling up and
mainstreaming the model for sustainable forestry based on building social capital in ejidos and
communities in key forested areas. The three pillars of sustainable forestry were strongly
advanced through the project (i.e. social, environmental, and economic values.)

At the social level, CONAFOR was able to successfully engage communities through a process
of empowerment and participation that helped them to decide and evaluate for themselves the
results of new approaches to forest and enterprise management. Community development issues
were integrated into a system of internal management and consultation, decision-making and
planning. All of which contribute to the development of social capital needed to improve the use
of natural resources.

The outcomes and output levels were higher than planned at the outset due in part to the catalytic
effect of community-to-community capacity building which "spread the word", lessons learned
and opportunities for support available for community organization and sustainable forestry.
"PROCYMAF", the Spanish acronym for the project, became widely known and program sought
out by the communities. Despite the closure of the project, the name "PROCYMAF" continues to
be used as a reference to the community forestry program.

The process of supporting communities was innovative and advanced a virtuous cycle of
increased services available to growing numbers of sustainably managed forestry efforts. These,
in turn, are generating more raw materials for industry needed to enhance growth in the sector
and bring employment to rural communities. The economic analysis supports this supposition as
demonstrated through the positive rates of return on the productive investments, as well as
important inroads in supporting community enterprises and even multi-community partnerships
with certified production.

From an environmental sustainability perspective, the project effectively increased the protection
of areas of natural habitat by bringing almost 3 million hectares under sustainable management
plans or strict conservation. These efforts maintain coverage in key forest ecosystems such as the
Sierra Juarez and Sierra Madre Ecoregions considered of global importance by conservation
organizations and conservation priority-setting exercises such as the World Bank-World Wildlife
Fund Conservation of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean (1995).

Conservation areas under the stewardship of the ejidos and communities provide good protection
to natural habitats, as they are formally recognized by the community assemblies and protected
by the enforcement arms of the communities. Communities also provide permanent patrols,
conservation and forest-management groups, and fire brigades to protect their resources.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Social Development. Forestry management in Mexico continues to be a male-dominated
enterprise based on overall low-levels of involvement of women in forestry activities (including
industry) and especially the decision-making ejido/community management bodies. The project
evaluation noted some progress in increasing employment for women in the forest enterprises, the
production of non-timber forest products, and the provision of products and services for
ecotourism. More efforts however must be directed at expanding opportunities for young people,
women, and residents of communities and ejidos with no formal rights (avecindados) through
future projects in Mexico.

Overall the project did an outstanding job of addressing social development aspects of rural
development in the indigenous communities and ejidos. The total population of the ejidos and
communities under CFP II project included 1,174,680 people11 of which 48% are of indigenous
origin: Maya (15%), Purepecha (15%), Zapoteco (15%), Nahuatla (10%), Mixteco (8%), Amuzgo
(5%), Chinanteco (5%), Tlapaneco (3%), Mazateco (3%), Mixe(2%), Mazahua (2%), Cuicateo
(2%), Mazahu, Chontal, Triqui. From the civil-society perspective, the increase in social capital

helps to ensure that advances are now formalized in community bylaws and in the increased
capacity of the beneficiaries to manage their own forests and resources.

Notwithstanding, the participation of the indigenous communities of the Huicholes y Tepehuanos
of Jalisco and Durangowas below expectations. These groups proved reluctant to engage in
project activities and resisted outside influences. Special efforts need to be incorporated into a
next phase of the program design to address these shortcomings and to forestall any
marginalization of the communities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Directorate of Community Forestry (La Gerencia de Silvicultura Comunitaria) was formed
in 2006 and provides a permanent institutional home for community forestry in CONAFOR.
Shortly after closure, in 2009, the project's activities were fully incorporated into the Directorate,
which received an allocation of MX$128.4 million from CONAFOR for continuing its work in
community forestry using the project model. In addition, CONAFOR has now mainstreamed the
community-forestry approach into ProArbol, its main instrument for overall forestry
development. In 2009, ProArbol activities include community forestry technician training,
community- to-community training and capacity building seminars, community land-use
planning, the development and strengthening of community by-laws and participatory rural
appraisals.

Beneficiary state governments now provide substantial support to community forestry and in
2009 allocated an MX$11.6 million to support them.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Based on the success of the project's OTC exercises, in 2007 the OTC approach was replicated
and scaled up by the largest GoM forestry program, ProArbol. In the final two years of the
project, ProArbol invested MX$63.8 million in the preparation of an additional 451 zoning plans
covering an additional 2.64 million ha with community-approved plans.

In 2006, CONAFOR through the Programa para el Fortalecimiento de la Autogestion Silvicola
(PROFAS) assisted the Regional Participatory Committees by providing them with a legal
foundation, regulations for their functioning and the physical space for the meetings.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The project enjoys support for community forestry efforts through civil-society, the private
sector, and national/state governments to ensure the development outcomes are maintained and
potentially expand in the future. From the civil-society perspective, the sustainability of the
outcomes at the community level are strengthened by the new community bylaws and statutes.

The investments in the six target states has helped stimulate a demand from other forested states
along with corresponding increases in government allocations to support the program's
expansion. CONAFOR allocated MX$128.4 million to support the 2009 community forestry
program which is targeted to fund 1,380 proposals from 792 agrarian communities in 12 states.



                                                  27
The state governments also provide support for the expansion (MX$11.6 million in 2009). While
gains have been substantial and positive, risks are rated as moderate, as the forest sector as a
whole has not yet fully embraced the community model and externalities from the global
financial crisis have impacted the forestry sector in all countries, prompting a slowdown in
demands for fiber and timber for construction.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation was satisfactory
and the resulting project was highly pertinent to both Bank and country priorities. The Bank
conducted an appropriated diagnosis of community-managed forestry issues, challenges and
alternatives to confronting them, highlighting the need for a highly participative process,
fundamental for a country with about 10,000 indigenous communities and ejidos who own around
65% of the country's forests. The Bank focused its efforts on developing and employing
effective approaches for community forestry development with indigenous peoples in six highly
forested states, helping to reorganize hundreds of rural communities, promoting and advancing
certified sustainable forest management and sustainable land-use planning, creating a cadre of
trained private sector professionals to work in community forestry and implementing a common-
sense system for advancing community forestry according to their own capacity to gradually take
on more complex tasks. CFP II was able to benefit from lessons learned during the
implementation of CFP I. The risks were adequately assessed including the risk of an increase in
the marginalization of certain communities arising from the selectivity in groups benefiting from
the project.

This project and its predecessor are internationally recognized as best practices and have become
models for other countries.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank supervision team included foresters, sociologists/anthropologists, biodiversity,
economists, rural development and fiduciary specialists. The project had three Task Managers
during the life of the project. The Bank team maintained a strong relationship with the Borrower
during most of the project. For the period of time when CONAFOR's support was softening
(2005), the Bank Team remained firmly committed to the project and kept the focus on the
development objectives, while diplomatically promoting the project approach within CONAFOR.

The team's experience and technical expertise contributed substantially to the success of the
project. On average, supervision missions were carried out two or three times per year with 11
supervision missions in total. Most included extended and substantive field visits. The combined
knowledge of the Bank and experience in the implementation of CFP I helped to guide the
project's evolution. The project was almost completely decentralized, which demanded additional
supervision efforts by the Bank team.

The operation is considered highly successful in the forestry community in Mexico and by
SEMARNAT, CONANP, NAFIN, CONAFOR, and CDI. The Bank has been widely recognized
for its commitment to the project, which contributed to the success of an innovative and


                                               28
culturally-appropriate means of technology transfer, based on empowerment and strengthening of
social capital of indigenous communities and ejidos.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In consideration of the ratings for preparation and supervision (above), the overall rating is
considered satisfactory. The Bank fostered and supported a project that was innovative in its
approach to community forestry through participation, organization, and empowerment
(especially of indigenous groups). The project was implemented in a highly decentralized way.
The Bank team managed the risks and challenges and was able to guide the project to a successful
closure in concert with a wide range of stakeholders (communities, federal and state
governments, and beneficiaries) and to meet or exceed most of the targets.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government of Mexico supported project preparation and implementation. They collaborated
with all work required by the Bank. They generated a successful model and platform for
community forestry that is a best practice for Latin America and the global forestry community.
The project succeeded in developing and employing effective approaches for community forestry
development with indigenous peoples in six highly forested states. The project also promoted
inter-institutional coordination and collaboration between many of the agencies involved in
forestry, environmental and natural resource management, such as CONAFOR, SEMARNAT,
CDI, CONANP and state authorities in high-priority areas, where poverty rates are high and
environmental impacts due to deforestation and poor management are significant. The
Government passed a new Forestry Law, created a National Forestry Strategy, assigned
implementation of the project to CONAFOR and created a "community forestry" unit within
CONAFOR to address community forestry issues in Mexico. NAFIN provided administrative
support to the project implementation unit in Guadalajara and maintained routine contact with the
Bank team, and participated in supervision missions. The Secretary of Hacienda also maintained
contact with the Bank for high-level functions relative to the loan agreement, amendments, and
reallocations. They routinely cooperated in the supervision missions and provided an important
link between the project, the Bank and the government.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The PIU was composed of qualified technical professionals and administrative staff based in
Mexico City and Guadalajara offices and state offices. Based on the number of subprojects (198)
and almost 3000 activities implemented under the project and supervised by the PIU, it was
highly efficient in its work. During the course of the project, CONAFOR's Community Forestry
Unit was established as a permanent part of the institution. Six state coordination offices were
established, staffed, and strengthened and received a high level of support from many state
governments (budgetary, office space, logistics, financing and other support). Some 30 state-
based regional committees and 41 associations were established to provide a participatory
stakeholder mechanism for the CFP II program and other issues related to forestry in the
communities and ejidos. The regional committees and associations now function on a regular
basis.



                                               29
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is considered satisfactory given the level of government
commitment during the project's tenure to provide the funding for execution, satisfactory
performance of responsible agencies, including the high levels of results obtained and the
sustainability of impacts generated. There were no cases of corruption, misprocurement or
safeguard violations during the project's implementation.

Results from the project include 90,920 thousand ha of forest certified as sustainably managed,
913,000 ha of forest area under improved forms of management, 1,783,574 ha under 274 zoning
plans, 51 schemes established for the payment of environmental services, and the integration of
the private sector into community development programs. Over 760 thousand hectares of new
conservation areas were designated through the zoning plans as either community conservation
areas or wildlife preserves.

6. Lessons Learned

Broad

Assessing quality of life and social capital can be a complex process facilitated by the use of
proxies tailored to each context and project needs. The use of the terms "quality of life" and
"social capital" are widely-used in development projects such as the CFP II. The project
incorporates the "consolidation of social capital" as a specific objective and provides a definition
for its use in the context of the ejidos and communities. Indicators such as formal legal
regulations, levels of participation in assembly meetings and number of assembly meetings,
community zoning plans, and seminars between communities proved to be excellent indicators of
community social capital and success of the approach.

Viable economic activities such as forestry can catalyze community development and
strengthen social capital. The project helped beneficiaries to capitalize on their natural resource
assets and bring focus to their community development process. Many of the communities had
been affected by long-standing conflicts regarding land tenure, and high emigration rates. The
forestry activities and investment opportunities provided by the project resulted in a positive
focus for the communities, while generating greater income and employment opportunities.

The inclusion of greater surface areas through forest planning and management strengthens
conservation and environmental sustainability. The CFP II project provided a solid platform for
the expansion of conservation and sustainable land management in globally important ecosystems
through its zoning, forest management and conservation plans. The incorporation of increasing
areas of forests using these instruments is conducive to environmentally- and socially-sustainable
economic development of the sector.

Project Level

Sustainable forestry provides an excellent framework for generating positive benefits to
biodiversity and ecosystem services but often require investments in building community social
capital and technical assistance. Forestry in a community context often requires more than
technical and infrastructure investments. Communities need assistance in organization,
governance and training and capacity building to help them become empowered to make
informed decisions and to generate a vision for the sustainable use of their forests.


                                                 30
The project provides a valuable model for the engagement of indigenous communities in
climate change mitigation. Through its participatory and community-driven approach to forestry
development, the project provides a reliable model for the engagement of indigenous
communities in the reduction of deforestation and [forest] degradation (REDD). The project's
approach serves as a best practice for consideration by other countries for engagement in REDD
at a time when many are being challenged to do so. It also serves as a foundation for the Mexican
Forest Sector to broaden its efforts for climate change mitigation with indigenous communities,
which own around 65% of the country's forests.

Improvements in the efficiency and output of community forest enterprises goes hand in hand
with improvements in the community's livelihood and helps to alleviate negative impacts on the
forest, especially degradation. Some of the CFP II communities and ejidos inherited a natural
resource base which was degraded from over logging and poor management by the
concessionaires. The investments in efficiency, diversification, and long-term management based
on capacity building of community and ejido members proved to generate a positive or virtuous
cycle. This is contributing to improved forest health and greater productivity of the sector.

Weaker communities from a forestry standpoint (those in more diverse ecosystems, lacking
sufficient standing volume or having extensive areas of degraded forests) can benefit by
pooling resources and capacities with other communities and forming cooperatives.
Ejidos and communities are highly diverse in terms of their natural resource holdings, which
ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of hectares. As a result of the project's promotion of
community organization, community-to-community activities, and long-term planning,
communities and ejidos were able to establish cooperative efforts to market their products
through new inter-community associations. Such arrangements must be nurtured over many years
following improvements in social capital and even then, are complex in their management.

Community Zoning Plans (OTCs) are excellent tools for communities to bring focus to their
development and conservation efforts while facilitating access to other donor and government
programs. The large number of high-quality OTCs generated through the project and ProArbol
helped stimulate other community investments. The zoning plans have developed a reputation for
providing information needed to target and direct investments in the communities for the project,
as well as The Payment for Environmental Services Program and NGO financing. Because OTCs
are approved by the communities, investors know that ownership is high, which helps reduce the
risks to the investment outcomes.

Globalization and increasing competition have to be considered in the context of productive
and industrial investment, even at the community level. The community forestry sector does not
exist in isolation from the regional, national, and international/global forestry markets. Mexico
continues to be a net importer of wood and increasingly, the national forest sector is challenged
by the presence of low-cost or competitively priced wood and paper products from such remote
places as Chile and Uruguay. As community forestry enterprises develop their growth will be
increasingly challenged and guided by this competition.

Market incentives for certified wood products are inadequate. Several communities supported
by CFP II entered into voluntary certification programs. However, there are few financial
incentives for doing so and transaction costs for certification are high. Communities that rely on
local or national markets have difficulty using their certification to gain market share, improve
prices or find niches. Increased efforts are needed to develop market mechanisms and create
financial incentives for certified wood.


                                                31
Promoting linkages across sectors, themes, and institutions can foster greater impacts in the
forest sector. Forestry has important ties to other sectors including social (and indigenous), the
environment and conservation, water, agriculture, housing, transport, energy, land administration,
and others. While it may not be feasible or necessary to address all sectors at once, an
understanding of the linkages and communication with key sister agencies can help to guide the
development of the forestry sector and foster greater impacts. Good communication and
collaboration is particularly needed with line agencies working in environment (SEMARNAT),
indigenous issues (CDI), agriculture and watershed management (SAGARPA), and conservation
(CONABIO).

Component D Outputs

Support for 6 State PIUs (Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, Jalisco, Durango and Quintana Roo)
included basic goods and services, and vehicles (not financed by the loan). It also included the
design, development and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system tracking and
database (SISCO). Two strategic studies were carried out for the state of Oaxaca and for
Guanaceví in Durango.

Component E Outputs

The main output was the support for a central (HQ) PIU and implementation of project audits for
each year of the life of the project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Project as a whole

The Internal Rate of Return for the overall project amounts to 19.63%. Three categories of
benefits were considered for the economic analysis of the project: (i) the benefits from
community based-forest protection / conservation which were valued by taking the total area
under conservation and applying the fee for environment services paid in Mexico12; (ii) the
benefits from forest management which have been valued for timber and non-timber forest
products according to the statistics available from the "Anuarios Forestales" from 2000-2004 at
national level; (iii) the benefits from the productive subprojects which have been calculated
separately (see below section on Productive Subprojects). Benefits not taken into account
included: (i) educational activities; (ii) reduced pressure on existing native forests; (iii) increased
employment; (iv) improved land-use; and (v) improved soil quality and decreased erosion.

Productive subprojects

CFP II financed 198 demand driven productive subprojects for a total amount of US$6.9 million
(around 33% of total project cost) whereby eligible communities and ejidos have had access to
funds for feasibility studies, market analysis and development of productive subprojects. Some
65% of these communities and "ejidos' that carried out the subprojects have been implemented
have indigenous people. Community counterpart contributions for productive subprojects were 50
percent (1:1).

12
  The economic price taken is USD 34.23/ha which is currently paid by CONAFOR to farmers via the PROARBOL
programme for environmental services and represents the cost to plant 1 ha of maize in the central part of Mexico. This
economic price is considered to represent the opportunity cost to maintain one hectare under conservation.




                                                          38
The financial analysis on the productive subprojects has used the results obtained on field work
conducted by the "Universidad Autónoma Chapingo ­ (UACH) in late 2008. Project recorded
data from 2004 to 2008 were used as were the financial analyses made for subprojects approval to
justify these investments.

The sample on which financial calculations were made was based on data compiled from 22
demand-driven productive subprojects (11% sampling intensity) (see Annex 1). To compare the
results with the calculations ex ante made in the PAD, the study has divided the productive
subprojects in two categories: (i) Community Forest Production such as improved traditional saw
mills or kiln-dried devices and (ii) Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs) such as resin extraction,
spring water bottling and ecotourism projects. The sample consisted of 15 "Community Forest
Production" subprojects and 7 "Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs) projects. A synopsis of the
selected productive subprojects is in Annex 10.

The financial indicators chosen to illustrate the results of each to the 22 productive subprojects
have been: the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), the net present value (NPV), the cost/benefit ratio,
the accounting rate of return and the payback period. The discount rate employed was of 12%
over a 20 years period. Annex 4 presents these financial indicators for each category of
productive subprojects and Annex 5 gives the calculation details for each of the productive
subproject sampled.

With an average of 20.16% for the Community Forest Production projects and 22.06% for
NTFPs, the IRR values obtained show that productive subprojects are clearly attractive from the
financial point of view (rates to be compared with a cost of capital around 12%). The values
obtained range from 13.55% to 44.14%. These values do not depart substantially from the results
obtained at the appraisal stage as they appear in the PAD: the four Community Forest production
projects had IRR values of 21%, 50%, 24% and 16% for the two NTFPs appraised (resin
extraction and water bottling) had rates of 25% and 26% respectively13.

Productive subprojects have a good cost/benefit (C/B) ratio, above 1 (Annex 4, refers), meaning
that the return on investment is always positive. Some C/B ratios suggest that some projects have
low costs which indicate a good project to be financed but more often than not the costs are
underestimated and benefits overestimated; in order words some C/B ratios seem too high for
such projects.

The accounting rate of return show values much dispersed ranging from 8.87 to 170.96 % and
135.95%. This is an indication that projects have probably been approved with different criteria.
Accounting rates of return have to be examined together with the payback period. An accounting
rate of return with high result but with long payback period, suggest that the project is modestly
efficient or the costs are too high (for whatever reason) compared to sales, (average sales per year
may be high but the related costs do not permit a rapid return on investment). On the other hand,
a low accounting rate of return and small payback period show that annual sales may be low
compared to investment but costs are contained making an efficient project.

Community Zoning Planning Exercises
Community Zoning Plans (Ordenamientos Territoriales Comunitarios) has been used extensively
during CFP II implementation and helped to determine and implement, for "ejidos" and
communities, in a participatory way, project activities: forest conservation, forest management
and productive subprojects. CFP II financed 274 Community Zoning Plans, for the same number
of ejidos or communities, on an area of 1,783,574 hectares for a total amount of US$2.45 million.

One of the objectives of Community Zoning Plans was to catalyze additional financing for forest
conservation. A significant share (17.25%) of the ejidos or communities assisted by CFP II has
obtained additional financing: 26 projects for biodiversity (US$883,000); 16 projects for carbon
capture (US$277,000); projects related with payments for environmental services on an area of
271,870 hectares for a total amount of US$26.58 million. It is estimated that 28% of the payments
for environmental services resulted directly from CFP II.

To date, due to CFP II, a total of 347 Community Zoning Planning exercises have taken place
(CFP I undertook 63 and CFP II, 278) for a total area of 2,320,260 hectares which represents a
cover of 26% of the "ejidos" o communities of the 6 States where CFP have been implemented
(Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán, Oaxaca y Quintana Roo).

Employment and incremental benefits

The total population of the ejidos and communities under CFP II coverage has been estimated at
1,174,680 people14 of which 48% are of indigenous origin: Maya (15%), Purepecha (15%),
Zapoteco (15%), Nahuatla (10%), Mixteco (8%), Amuzgo (5%), Chinanteco (5%), Tlapaneco
(3%), Mazateco (3%), Mixe(2%), Mazahua (2%), Cuicateo (2%), Mazahu, Chontal, Triqui.

The increase of jobs generated by the project within the communities and ejidos has been
estimated15 to 27.2% on average which is slightly below the target of 30% set in the PAD (see
logical framework in annex 1: Project Design Summary p.26).

Over the project implementation period (2004 -2008), 1005 ejidos or communities have benefited
from the project. The community forestry enterprises backed by CFP II employed around 159,930
people. The main benefits reported, as a result of CFP II intervention, have been: administration
and management (47.8%) and an increase in commercialization aptitude (38.6%) From the

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

An external evaluation was conducted in the communities of all six states through questionnaires.
In each community the following people were polled: commissioners, representative of civil
society (municipal president or delegate or agent of the municipality) direct beneficiaries,
presidents of the associations, administrators of firms, employees of firms, and technical service
providers and promoters who were contacted via internet. Each person had to respond to a set of
questions tailored to the type or role these played within the community and in relation to the
project.

All of the questionnaires asked for name, sex, age, level of education, ethnic affiliation, and
native language. Depending on the role and responsibilities, the rest of the questions were
standard as they pertained to number of people in the community, number of people in the
firm/association, participation in the assemblies, frequency per year of assemblies, comparison of
how many people participated before and after the project. Other questions focused on whether
or not opinions of different participants in the assemblies were taken into consideration, how the
assemblies carried out their mandates, established sanctions, and the type of decisions taken in
this forum. Other questions focused on the participation of people in activities promoted by
project from workshops to training courses or regional forums, etc. Other included the impact of
the project on relations among and within communities and if consequently an improvement in
social relations and organization related to production had taken place. Opinions about the project
and possible continuation as well as the role of the implementing agency where also included.

Beneficiaries were asked about changes in livelihoods, types of supports received, and what type
of improvements were noted related to the project in education, health, quality of food available
and material objects. Specific questions regarding training received, if useful or not, among
others. The benefits of feasibility studies whether or not these had resulted in investments.

As a result of the project, the general survey found:

    -   an increase in investments in the forest sector from $84.98 to $134.33
    -   improvements in housing index from .28 to .46
    -   13% noted improvements in natural resources
    -   25% noted improvements in legal activities
    -   18% noted improvements in community seminars
    -   43% noted improvements in training activities

Technical service providers were asked about time associated with the project, how they learned
about it and opinions about the diffusion of the project. General questions were asked about the
operation of the program such as ideas for improving the project, main obstacles encountered;
reason why proposals were rejected, and availability of resources to the communities.

In the six states the results were tabulated. In summary a high percentage of all of those polled
attended the assemblies and the number increased due to the project. An average of 8 assemblies
was held per year. Opinions most regarded in the assemblies were those of representatives,
technical service providers and assistants with those of external authorities a bit less.


                                                 44
Participation in training events, rural participatory workshops, community to community
workshops and regional seminars was in the hundreds and thousands. General opinion about the
project was high in most cases very favorable. People showed an interest that the project should
continue but with some modifications. The perception of the implementing agency was generally
consistently good.

Direct Beneficiaries: About 48% of the direct beneficiaries belonged to ethnic groups and 31 %
spoke a native language. Some 93% of direct beneficiaries in the six states attended the asamblea
in their community or ejido since the beginning of the project (around 8 were held per year).
Assembly attendance increased as a result of the project by 23% as a result of the project. The
opinions of technical service providers, representatives, and assistants were highly regarded by
beneficiaries during the asambela (with opinions of external authorities less so).

According to the survey; 3,123 beneficiaries participated in training courses; 915 in community-
to-community seminars; 3,968 in regional seminars and 1,833 participated in the conduct of
studies. Some 93% of the beneficiaries felt that social relations had improved favorably as a
result of the project. Beneficiaries ranked the project highly favorably (8 on a scale of 1-9) and
believed that the project should continue. Their perception of change at the institutional level was
6 on the same scale or moderately favorable.

Administrators: The average age of administrators was 47. About 97% participated regularly in
the asamblea, about 8 of which were held annually. They commented that the number of people
that attended the asamblea has increased. From the administrators surveyed: 929 participated in
rural participative workshops; 1,833 in training courses; 559 in community-to-community
seminars; 2,495 in regional seminars; and 1,191 participated in the conduct of studies. Some 94%
of the administrators believed that social relations had improved as a result of the project, as had
relations with other communities. Most agreed that the project should continue without changes.
The perception of the institution in charge was 5 on the 9 point scale.

Workers: The average age of the workers is 40. About 84% participated in the 9 annual
assemblies. They commented that participation in the assemblies had increased from about 28%
as a result of the project. They placed high value on the opinions of the technical service
providers, representatives and their assistants, but less value on the opinions of external
authorities. In general, they felt that agreements made in the assemblies were acted upon.

According to the survey: 485 workers participated in rural participative workshops; 1,027 in
training courses; 203 in community-to-community seminars; 903in regional seminars; and 1,191
in the conduct of studies. Some 91% of workers believed that social relations improved as a
result of the project and 62% said the project should continue unchanged. The perception of the
institution in charge was 5.67 on the 9 point scale.

Commissioners: The commissioner's average age is 51. Most participated in the asambleas of
which 8 are held on average per year. The number of those assisting the asamblea has risen from
98 before the project to 120 after. They commented that participation in the assemblies had
increased from about 20% as a result of the project. They placed high value on the opinions of the
technical service providers, representatives and their assistants, but less value on the opinions of
external authorities. In general, they felt that agreements made in the assemblies were acted upon.

From the commissioners surveyed: 708 participated in rural participative workshops; 1,203 in
training courses; 300 in community-to-community seminars; 5,171 in regional seminars and
1,097 participated in elaboration of studies. Commissioners' opinions were mixed as to whether


                                                45
or not social relations had changed as a result of the project (5 on a 9 point scale). Some 62%
believe that the project should continue without changes. The perception of the institution in
charge was 6.04 (on the 9 point scale). Of the benefits received by the community, they believed
about 35% were a direct result of the project.

TSPs: Responses by PSTs are insufficient to be representative ­ of 17 subprojects in the sample
only 4 responded, providing partial information. The PSTs stated that the project is a good
program but is underfunded and should include more training for beneficiaries. They also noted
that more work needs to be done to identify good markets for wood and other products. Relative
to subproject implementation, results were mixed. Two TSPs responded they had subprojects still
underway due to delays in the procurement and installation of equipment. One noted a positive
experience in a NTFP subproject involving mescal.

Summary of Borrower's ICR

Introduction
The original project objective was to assist indigenous communities and forestry ejidos of Mexico
to increase their standards of living through improved management and conservation of forest
resources, increasing their potential to enter regional national and international markets. Specific
objectives were to: (a) improve management and conservation of natural resources by the
community and ejido owners of those resources and (b) increase income based on their forest
production.

The objectives reflected the priorities in Mexico for the forestry sector at the time of preparation
which were focused on the modernization and increasing the economic output of the forestry
sector to reduce poverty through sustainable development. This was the first project to focus on
income generation through sustainable means on a broad scale in Mexico. The project was also
designed to improve and take advantage of growing demand for technical assistance, services,
and products from the forestry sector. The objectives were clearly designed however the gradual
expansion of the project from one state to several states was a challenge that was very demanding
of a project envisioned as a pilot.

Design Aspects and Consistency with Government Priorities
Mexico is a country with a very high potential for production of forest-based goods and services,
however several factors have not allowed it to play an important role in the overall GDP of the
country, nor has it been recognized for its positive impact on the conservation of natural
resources. In addition, other external factors such as migration have reduced pressures on forests
and changed the context for forestry activities. Communities and ejidos own over 80% of the
remaining forests in Mexico and it has been shown that those that manage their forests for timber
and non-timber products, conserve their natural resource base and show higher income levels and
improved social development indicators.

The project was consistent with the GoM 2007-2011 National Development Plan, based on
environmental sustainability while improving quality of life. In addition, the model for service
provision selected for the project was innovative and participatory thanks to Regional
Roundtables for Forestry Promotion (Foros Regionales de Promocion) and Regional Natural
Resource Comittees (Comites Regionales de Recursos Naturales) which established periodic
meetings for discussion, decision-making, and priority setting with the legal representatives of the
communities and ejidos. Finally, the project incorporated several lessons learned from other
programs in the sector such as the COINBIO (GEF/WB Indigenous and Community
Conservation Project), PROCREF (Forest Conservation and Restoration Program), PRODEFOR
(Forestry Development Program), PROFAS (Zoning and Forestry Management Project), and
PSAH (Hydrological Environmental Services) programs.

Achievement of Objectives and Outcomes
Based on the final evaluation of the project, CFP II can be considered highly successful, given
that it generated substantial impacts and changes in communities regarding forest resources
management and broadening their income-generation options. From a quantitative standpoint the



                                                48
project increased the surface area covered under new and improved management plans by
working with 1005 communities and ejidos in the six states it operated in. Much of the support
was also for non-timber forest products with investments of over US$4.4 million.

Outcomes
The outcomes were achieved in a satisfactory way under CFP II. Key indicators were developed
and reviewed as part of the evaluation.

Component 1 ­ Social Capital Strengthening       Rating: HS
150 participatory rural evaluations were planned at the project outset and 241 were actually
carried-out (160%), 48 community-to-community seminars were planned and 193 implemented
(402%), 48 community statues or regulations were planned and 353 ultimately developed (735%)
which clearly demonstrates the satisfactory outcome and interest of the communities in these
instruments.

Component 2 ­ Technical Assistance for Management Rating: HS
Technical assistance studies were carried out in support of community natural resources
management as well as workshops and capacity building programs for forestry producers. These
support programs were carried-out in many cases by trainers from other more advanced
production communities. Unfortunately, in many cases trained people migrated out of the
communities. Some activities included under this component include preparation of zoning
plans, pre-certification exercises, establishing community forestry enterprises and developing
sustainable forestry management plans.

Component 3 ­ Diversification of Investments Rating: HS
Following the community organization, social capital strengthening, and improving
technical/management capacities, investments were made in developing products and markets for
timber and non-timber products, and ecosystem-based services. The project invested significant
resources in developing investment plans and funding specific community investments. 51
payment for environmental services schemes also increased access by communities and ejidos to
this government program.

Other impacts
Forestry Communities and Ejidos           Rating: HS
When ejidos and communities formally recovered the control of their forests in the mid-80's they
were challenged by low levels of technical capacity and a lack of experience in sustainable forest
management. In addition, capacities were needed in operating community forestry companies
and other business/marketing skills necessary for success beyond the traditional forestry
activities. The project focused on all these needs, supporting their capacities and organization
through four typologies ranging from 1 (potential producers) through 4 (producers with
transformation and marketing capacities). In addition, some producer associations were
supported outside this typology structure of the project. In addition to those ejido and community
members with property, the project benefited non-owners of the community and began a slow but
increasing trend of including women in the productive sector, particularly in the non-timber forest
product activities.

Support to the Private Sector    Rating: HS
The project improved the service-provision sector by generating an important number of
providers (450) throughout the six states of the CFP II. Although this is a substantial number,
they are primarily focused on timber products and forest management. Other services, which



                                                49
were also covered under the service-provider training, include conservation area management,
flora and fauna, marketing, and accounting among others.

Forestry Activities and Natural Resource Management Rating: HS
The project approved 77 projects for conservation activities in addition to 257 conservation and
management plans which represented a total of 2.9 million hectares under formal conservation
and management plans including several under certification through the Consejo Civil Mexicano
para la Silvicultura Sostenible based on criteria and indicators approved by the FSC.

Promotion of Non-traditional/Non-timber Forest Products           Rating: HS
The CFP II provided an important stimulus to the production of NTFP's, improving the
generation of employment and income-generating opportunities for young people and women in
the communities that typically have less options in this regard. The most important investments
were made in activities such as pine-resin production, medicinal plants, mushrooms, and
ecotourism.

Institutional Strengthening              Rating: Substantial
The project improved articulation among several projects within CONAFOR which also help
target its outreach in a more focused manner however coordination on the dissemination and
communication of project activities and objectives could have been more substantial. The project
coordination unit was moved to Guadalajara to increase integration with the CONAFOR.

Lessons Learned
   · The focus on community capacities is an effective approach to sustainable rural
       development that can produce social, economic, and environmental impacts. The typing
       of communities however is a practice that needs to be reviewed for future phases of the
       program.

    ·   Improving technical capacities and commercial relations among communities is
        important to gain the necessary scale for achieving sustainable forest management.
        Regional resource management visions and plans need to be developed.

    ·   Linking communities through coordinated production and sales of forestry and non-forest
        products generates positive economic and development impacts.

    ·   Strengthening community institutions through CFP and with private-sector involvement
        has improved ejido member confidence in their own organizations and other government
        programs involved in the rural sector.

    ·   Benefits have been noted for advancing employment of women through the project
        investments.

    ·   Conflicts between and within indigenous communities continue to be an important issue
        that needs greater investment.

    ·   Forestry enterprises must be prepared to compete in a global market. Community
        enterprises must be strengthened in their administrative, management, and marketing
        capacities.
