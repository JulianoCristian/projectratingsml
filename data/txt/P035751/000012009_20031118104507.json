The\n            project components would: 1) strengthen the capacity of\n            communities and ejidos to take decisions, particularly as\n            regards natural resource management. Regional Participatory\n            Committees will be established, and Rapid Rural Appraisal\n            exercises will be conducted to set priorities, designed to\n            assist communities at different levels of development, with\n            the assistance of specialized consultants, particularly in\n            drafting by-laws for community governance. 2) The forest\n            resource management technical strengthening will respond\n            through specific studies, to identify alternative resources\n            for the diversification of production, provide specialized\n            consulting services concerning land-use zoning, and make\n            recommendations, and, includes as well, feasibility studies\n            for non-timber forest products, and specialized courses for\n            human capital development. Specialized technical assistance\n            will support communities. 3) The diversification and\n            investment component will support diagnosis and analysis of\n            potential investments, which includes investment in\n            subprojects in ejidos and communities. 4) The institutional\n            strengthening component will support project subunit's\n            coordination in participating states, and financing of basic\n            goods and services, including vehicles (not financed by the\n            loan), information technology, training, and baseline\n            studies on environment and social issues."}, "docdt": "2003-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
