PROGRAM", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall objective of the project is\n            to promote rational energy policies and to establish the\n            basis for efficient utilization of Rwanda's energy\n            resources, while minimizing adverse environmental\n            implications.  The project comprises two main components:\n            (a) strengthening of the institutional regulatory and policy\n            environment; and (b) rehabilitation of key infrastructure in\n            the power subsector.  The first component will include:  (i)\n            restructuring the Rwandese Utility Company to permit\n            contracting out its operations to a private operator; (ii)\n            consulting services to prepare new statutes and organization\n            chart for the utility and bidding documents for the\n            selection of the private operator, and to assist in\n            implementing its contracting under a lease type contract and\n            in establishing two companies; (iii) implementation of a\n            series of make-ready measures in order to attract qualified\n            private operators; (iv) introduction of incentives to\n            rationalize and improve the efficiency of the charcoal\n            subsector; (v) implementation of environmental and technical\n            guidelines for future development of Lake Kivu's\n            methane gas by private investors; (vi) studies to design and\n            implement a strategy for development of solar home systems\n            as a cost-efficient alternative for electricity in rural\n            areas; and (vii) technical assistance and training to\n            strengthen the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and\n            Handicrafts's capacity to deal with petroleum products\n            issues. The power subsector component includes:  (i)\n            rehabilitation and improvements of key power infrastructure\n            for five cities; (ii) improvement in the medium voltage\n            sections; (iii) overhauls of power station and hydraulic\n            structures; (iv) feasibility studies for hydroplants; (v)\n            constitution of a strategic stock of spare parts for plants\n            and substations; (vi) capacity building and training through\n            scholarships and strengthening of the investment planning\n            and monitoring capacity of the utility staff."}, "docdt": "1993-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
