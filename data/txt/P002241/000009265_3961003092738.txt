constition of a strategic stock of spare parts for plants and substations; (vi) capaciq
building and taining through scholarships and stegening of thfe investment
planning and monitorbi, capacity of tfie utility staff.
l: lk.       Tlhe proposed poject would help increase the reliability and cost-ectiveness of the
deecity system and inreas  efficiency In the use of the cowntry's overll energy
resources, which would improve living and working conditions for burtess and
household consumers In the major cites and In rura areas while allteviang
deforetion problems. This would be achieved through (a) establishing the basis
for the utility to become autonomous and commercially viable thus providing a more
favorable business climate; (b) restoring an adequate and reliable supply of electricity
to meet the unsemead demand of the coy; (c) ening adequate and cost-effective
supply of energy resources in Rwanda over the medium- and long-term. The
economic rate of return for the physical investments is 19 percent.
EmlJect Risks:      Ihe physical risks are minimal because rehabilitation of tasmission and distbution
network is routne and would be carried out under well4rown conditions. The other
riss are mainly of managerial and institutional nature and include: difficulty of
finding private operator willing to take over ELECTROGAZ' operations and
government's commitment to the effective implementation of a long-term, stable
corporate culture with the private sector playing a key role in electricity and water.
Up-front measures including tariff increases and major staff reductions, as well as
key principles to be embodied in the utility new statutes and organization chart, the
involvement of a private operator in the management of the utility operations, and
the program for Implementation of financial objectives and capacity building reforms,
would sutanly reduce these risks.

0.1   Rwanda Is a small, landlocked country in Cntra Africa coveig some 26,000 square kilometers
on mountinous land. With a total populat  estimated at about 7.5 miion, Inresig at an anu rate
of 3.7%, Rwada Is the most deselypecoutry in Africa (290 people per knel. GDP per capia,
estmad at about US$310 (1991), ns amng the lowest of the on_ent Rwanda'OCs onomy is
heavily dependent on coffee and tea, which account for 80% of its epot. Some 95% of the population
lives in rural areas and derives Its livelihood from subte   agriculure and the cultvation of coffee
andtea. The Industrial s , apart from some agro-industrial activities, remain small and Isufficiey
diversified, in spite of Govermen's efto  to expand the    base. After years of contraction
in mining sector activity, the mining of tin, the principal product, stpped in 1987.
0.2   From 1970 to the mid-1980's, Rwanda followed generally prudent fisc policies that resulted In
fincWa stability, low inflation and sustined growth (aveaing 4% per annum). Since early 1987,
Rwanda has been faced with precipitous declines in world coffee prices and unfavorable climatic
condtons w   hid an advee impat on agricultura production. As a resut,   re '- stagaed in
1987 and 1988 and leclined sharply in 1989 by 6.6%, causing real income per capita to drop by almost
16.5% from its 19£6 level. rhe initi policy response to adverse economic developments was not
appropriate and, as ; result, serious Internal and external imbalances and declining per capita income
persisted through the end of 1990.
0.3   To correct these economic imbalacs, the govemnt embarked in 1990 on a comprehensive
economic reform program, supported by the fist adjustment credit (SAC) approved in June 1991. 'Te
governmnt's program includes a comprehensive packap to stenen m     mic management,
create an inentive fimework to stmuate expors and enhanco private ser  nfidence, rerm Public
E prises (PEa), improve publi expeadiue mangement, incea the effiieny of the finaca sector,
liberaize the labor market and implement well-tarted measure aimed at alleviatg poverty. The
project described in this report b an iortant element of the governmes ecnomic restucturing
program. It will improve the efficiency of the largest public utility of Rwanda, address pricing issues
in a key sector of the economy, implement needed reforms in one of the most important public
entetprises, Improve the quality of the public invesme program, srngthen institutions in the energy
sector and improve the reliability of enW  supply for domestic and industil uses. It will also address
major environmental concerns through the improved woodfiuel efficiency program and the establishment
of a monitoring system for the waters of the Lake Kivu and volcanic acdivity in the surunding areas.
0.4   Rwanda's principal ener resource is its forest, which is being depleted In cetain areas for
firewood and charcoal. Agricuural by-products phy an important tole to meet household energy needs.
Peat is available in some areas but s not widely used. The poteni for hydroelectric power exit but

respectively. 'The  is no evdeo of the prsene of oil Ia ie country but there  a unique source of
methe gas In the deep waters of Late Kivu. Although coa b found in neighboring Zaire, none has
been locted in Rwanda. In terms of nOw and rewable sources of eneqr, solar energy is abundant and
may have some commerca development potential.
Goverment's Ener= Stratey and Poiy
0.5   Ihe Governmens declared energy policy, reflected In a detailed Energy Sector Policy Statement
Letter, which has been received (Amu I 1), places emphasis on: (i) adoption of least cost solutions for
investmens In the sector; (ii) region  cooperation; (ii) regeneration and expansion of the potential for
fuelwood production; (iv) Improved efficiency in the production of electricity and water, of  wcoal and
the use of woodfuels; (v) Idntfication of alternative competiive sources of energy such as peat, blogas;
(vi) rehabiliton of key power Infratuctures; and (vii) extension of electricity supplies to ru  areas
and to cottae  idustries. In a key step towards helping achieve these objectives, the govemment has
agrd to contract out with a prime opator te opeation of ELECrROGAZ, the public utlity
company of the country. In addition, It has decided to (i) strenten the lega framework for sector
nstutions, its investment planning, coordination and contol; (i) set approprate tariff policy for
elecricity, waer and gas; (i$ Implement a major staff reduction plan within ELECIROGAZ; and (iv)
promote ratona pricing polies for wood, charoal and petroleum products while addressing
enviroental implations. The goverment has also intoduced a stumpage fee for wood from publc
forests to disourage over exploitationI. Th proposed operation would help the government in
implementing its ste  as descrlbed above.

1.1   lbe energy situation in Rwanda is characrized by a high reliance on three sources of energy:
woodfuels, agulta  by-products, and imported peteu  products. In 1990, Rwana's fin  energ
compton totalled about 1,44 million tons of oil equivalent CrOE) of which 93% was in the form of
felwood, charoal, and agricr by-products, and the bale was povided by imported petroleum
products, hydroelectricity, and a small quantity of methan gs (rable 1.1). The largest consuming sub-
sector was households (91.6%), followed by trsport (4.2%), industry (2.5%), and public services
(1.6%). Commecial ener  consumpton per capita (16kgoe) is low because of the low level of income,
tie relivey high price of petroleum, the high cost electricity cneon, the small size of the iustra
sector, and the dominan  of subsisce agricture in the economy. The conmption of mmcial
nrg (electicity and petoleum products) grew at an average annual rae of about 10% over the perid
198047, considerably fister than GDP growth.   proximaely 80% of non-traditional energy is
Imported and accounted for an aveage of 18% of merchandise imports during the period 198347.

1.2    Electrical energ  demand grew at an average anmal rate of 10% from  1980 to 1990  and its
composiion evolved in fvor of domesdc conumpton and to the detriment of nduti  and commercial
consumption. This patn Is explained by te economic slowdown In the mid 1980a w4 the gradua increase
in the number of connection for domestc clients, both In urb  and nrd areas. Peak power demand grew
at a somewhat fasWr rate for the same period (11.2%), wifth a consequent decrease In the system's load factor.
Energy suppied to the network amouned to 173.9 GWh in 1990, in response to a demand of 148.6 GWh,
wih the diffrc equivalen to the losses. Correcdve metur  taken by the utilft  for non technical losses
resulted in reducing the level of to  losses from 17% in 1988 to 14.6% in 1990, whIch compares well to
an average of about 16% for sub-Sahara counties. Past evoludon of demand is shown in Table 1.2.

1.3   As of the end 1991, ELECTROGAZ had a tot of about 25,000 electricity consumers. Per capita
consumption of electrcity, which was only 20 kWh in 1990, i one of the lowest In sub-Sahara Afiican
(SSA), where the average is about 70 kWh. Despite an average anmual increase of 19% in the number of
low voltage connecdons from 1985 to 1990, only a small fraction of the total popuation (1.8%) is connected.
Consumption per customer has declned from 5,268 kWh per year in 1980 to 3,536 kWh per year in 1990.
lbis phenomenon is explained by the fact    electrificaton expansion to new regions and residences is
progressively integrating areas of lesser development and lower inomes. All major urban centers are
supplied. by the national grid, but only a smal percentage of their respective populations actually uses
electricity. In 1990, while Kigali's consumption represented 61% of the country's total consumption, only
20% of its population was connected to the power network. The etensions of the distribution network for
five cities including Kigall, to be exeted and fiaced &tough the proposed project, would help address
this issue.
1.4   Increasing the popults use of electricity is among the objectives of the Rwandese Govermment
for the electricity subsector. First priodty i being given to expanding connections in areas where service
Is aleady available, by dealing with the high cost of an electricity connection. According to the existing
regulations, conumers must pay all tie costs of the connection study, equipment and works plus a 10% fee,
normally In one Instanent when the connection is contracted. Whle an effort was made in January 1988
to lower this cost somewhat by decreasing the sarge fee from 15% to the present 10%, the average
connection charge is still high, about US$630 as compared to the GNP per capita of only US$310, in 1991
prices. Ihe high cost of connections is in part explained by the overly demandng technical specifications
applied in the construction of distribution networks. The Electriciy Master Plan to be completed In January
1993 will provide least-cost technical specifications for future connections and constructions to be caried out
under the proposed project.
Fuur D2W                                                                  . .wt
1.5   WithI the framework of the Master Plan, a preliminary demand projection to the year 2010 has been
recenty completed using three different sceios c pding to low, medium and high growth rates.
According to the medium sceaio which I consiered the most likely to materize, energy demand will
grow from 148.6 OWh in 1990 to 223.6 GWh in 1995 and 330.2 GWh in 2000, equIvent to an average
anmual growtrate of 8.4%. As in the previous decade, most of the growth will come fiom the low voltage
consumption. In 1980, low voltage sales reprented 40% of the total sales; taperage inhesed to 51%
in 1990 and sxld reach a level of about 63% in 2010.
1.6   Based on the anumpton that losse wM decuease to 10% in 1995 and will remain constant at that
level thereafter total energy reqrements will be 249 GWh in 199 and 367 GWh In 2000. Peak power
demand was esdmated based on energy demand, by applying a load factor of 0.50 for low voltage and 0.65
for medium voltage. Given the increase that is foreseen in the prportion of the low voltage within total
demand, this would result in a furher slow reducdon of the system's load factor from 55.8% in 1990 to
54.7% in 2010. Peak load would go fom 35.5 MW in 1990 to 51.0 MW in 1995, and 76.2 MW in 2000.
All these restlts are shown in Table 1.3.

30 km downstm from SNE's Ruizi I power station. Both plants cost e       l thrfo  a system in cascade,
for which Lake Kivu serves as a resrvoi tht i capable to provide anual regulation of flow.
1.8    Each of the national electric utilities  sedtitled to one td  of the energy produced by Ruzizi II,
whose ave        anual eeg producton has been set at a nominal value of 140 GWh, to be Increased to 200
GWh when a  id  generatng unit   ntaed in 1995. ELECTROGAZ has also a conact with the Zairian
power utility, SNEL, to import power from Ruzizi I. Given tis ingration of the Rwandese network within
a regional grid, ELECTROGAZ has tre categores of sources avaiable to satisfy the Itnal demad of
electriciy: (a) the domestic plants; (b) the part of Ruzizi Ir's power and energy to which Rwanda is entided;
and (c) any Zalrian and Bundn supluses, which may include their parts of Ruzizi IUs power and energy.
In 1990, 51% of Rwanda's electricity rtequrme   of 174 GWh were satsfaed with er  produced at
Ruzizi U, and 4% were Imported fim Zaires Ruzizi I.
1.9   Ihe domestic genating capaciy is predominanty hydro. 'Me four extng hydrodectic power
stations - Ntauka, mubngw    Gisenyi and Giira - with a combined Instaled capacity of 26.5 MW, are
all located In the nort and norwest of the country. The first two, which are te lagest with a combined
capcity of 23.7 MW, constu  a systm  irn cascade, with the aal lakes of Bulera and Luhondo
respectvy seving as their reservirs.  bere  e also four diesel pla  with a totl caacity of 3.6 MW,
of which the largest is Gasata, located nw Kigal, wih 2 MW Istalled. At preset the thermal plants are
rarely utilized. Amex 1.3 includes Inraon on the generating facilities.
1.10   At the time of h consuction of Ruzizz  U and of the creation of SINELAC, not enough aention
was paid to the operatio    aspects, with th reult that t  present form of operaion does not achieve an
efficient utilization of the resoure available to the pater states: there is no joint operations planning, since
considerable amounts of water that coud be used to produce energy are released at Ruzi I, without going
to the turbines, and ar spied at Ruzizi IL  lhere is no regional operations planning either, aimed at
optimizing dte use of  ailble resources. Finally, under the presn operang rules, biltera energy
exchanges be        ELECTROGAZ ad the oher natal utilities are vitualy impossible, even when there
is energy avaiale for such exnges. The proposed project would address these issues through technical
asise  and traing in the area of bInerconnt  system operation.

1.11 IThe power and energy balance shown in Annex 1.2 reals that for the medium term Rwanda will
contnue to depend heavily on extern  sources, and could fAce shorages begining In 1994. The only way
that this siO    can be alleviated in the short term is through better utilization of the Ruzizi I - Ruzizi 11
system. For the longer run, vaious hydwelectric sites have been idenfied for fmture epansion of the
genating capacity. One of the most interting is Ruzumo fals, with an installed capacity of 82 MW and
a firm capacity of 61.5 MW, which would also be a muldtnaonal project, shc  t s to be built at the border
between Rwanda and Tania. Rwandas share of fim capacity would be 20.5 MW. A donors meeting
with the participation of the Bank will be organized in the first quarter of 1993 to mobilize the required
financial resources for a detailed pre-feasibility study. this project will involve Rwanda, Burundi and
Tanzania and the implementing institution would be the "Organsation pour l'AmI agement et le
D6veloppement du Bassin de la Riviere Kagera (OBEKA).
1.12  The et alternative would be the Mukungwa I hydroelectric plant (2.2 MW); is design Is being
reviewed to reduce investment costs. Other options for addidonal power include (i) the istalation of a third
unit at Ruzizi I, (Hi) the building of hydroelectric plants on the sites of Nyabarongo, Rukarar and possibly
Akanyar, and (iii) Ruzizi m  for which a feasibility study financed by Belgium is being carried out.
Complementary options would be defined after the completion of the Electricity Master Plan (para. 1.4). The
proposed project would finance the completion of detafled feasibility studies for two of the sites identified in
the Master Plan.
[ansmission
1.13  Ihe backbone of the Rwandese transmission network is constituted by a sequence of 110 kV lines
tnding from the Muktngwa hydro power station in the north to the substaton of Mururu I in the south-
west. Kigali is located about midway between these points. Annex 13 shows a single line diagram of the
system, as well as information on the main transmission lines. Ihe structure of the transmission system
mkes it pardculaly vulnerable to collapse in the cases of loss of genation or line fauts. To counter this
Miherent weakaess, high speed reciosing and automatic load shedding schemes have been implemented, with
ssfactoy results.
1.14  At the tme thepower faciuitiesbelongto SINELAC werebut, SINELAC's Mururu    bstaon,
which is on Rwandese tefritory, was actually inserted into the Rwandese high voltage networ, interposing
it between ELECTROGAZ's 110 kV substadons of Mururu I and Karongi. In ftis way, ELECrROGAZ's
substation of Mururu I, serving the Cyangugu region of Rwanda, and which has a connection to the Zairian
power station of Ruzizi I, was separated from the rest of the Rwandese high voltage networks As SINELAC
does not allow bilateral energy transfers to pass through its installations, ELECTROGAZ -which had
previously been importng about 20 GWh per year from Ruzizi I- can no longer Import substantial amount
of energy from it (except for the small qutities needed to supply the CyanFgu region). Tbis situation will
be coffected under the proposed project by financing two l10 kV bays to the Mururu I substation, to which
the li  to Mumru II and to Karongi will be connected.
Disbutio
1.15  The dbution networks in the main load centers prest a wide range of problems: while parts of
the networks, mainly low voltage feeders, are ovedoaded, there is also a good number of ases where the
exisng Insalls are overdimensioned with respect to the loads served; maintenance has been neglected
due to the diffilties to purchase spare parts and maters, so that there is a bacldog of repairs to be
executed; fially, while there is a lot of pote    new custme  in the aready electrffied urban areas, the
constc         stan d   adopted -with almost exclusively t -phe  dition, and extesive use of



-? -
underground mbles- result in connection costs that are prohibitive for most of those potential new consumers.
The proposed project wfll address these problems through the introduction of lower cost construction
standards, and the financing of a rehabilitaton and extension program for the distribution networks of the five
largest cities in the country.
System Qperation and Maintance
I.16 A series of dry years combined with relatively high levels of production at the hydro plants led to
critically-low levels of the Bulera and Luhondo lakes in 1989. Production from Ntaruka and Mulungwa had
to be limited in 1990, while ELECTROGAZ compensated for the reduction with energy imported from Ruzizi
H. GTZ (the German Cooperation Agency) is presently providing assistance in operations planning, with
emphasis on a proper management of the reservoirs. Table 1.4 shows how the diffrent sources were used
in 1990 to satisfy total demand. Maitennce of the installations is hindered by the limitation of foreign
exchange for power sector expenditures, that translates into insufficient spare part stocks, and lack of an
adequate provision of equipment and tools for maintenance. These issues are being addressed under the
proposed project (para. 2.32).

1.17 The electricity tariffs in effect at the beginning of 1991 were approved in January 1988. They
replaced tariffs that had existed since December 1981, reducing nominal charges per kWh from 10 to 6.5
RWF (35%) for low-voltage (La) users and between 9% and 11% for medium-voltage (MV) users. Since
the average inflation in the period 1982-86 and 1988-91 is esdmated to have been 13% and 26% respectively,
there has been a substantial deterioration in the real level of electricity and wate rates. As part of the first
SAC, electricit rates were raised in real terms by about 26% in June 1991. Details of tariffs from 1974 to
date are given in Table 1.5 below.

1.18   As shown in Table 1.5 above, for LV  users, there Is an energy chage of RWF  10/kWh
(approximtately US$0.07/kWh) for a maximum consumption of 30 kwh/month for rural are user and 40
kwh/month in urba  centers; MV users have chages for energy and for peak demand, the charge for peak
demand varies in accordanc with the capacity of the instaled equipment For a capacity below 100 kW, the
tariffs are RWF 10/kWh and RWF 616/kWlmonth of registered peak demand, while for capacities above
100 kW the charges are RWF 10/kWh and RWF 1,064/kW/month of registered peak demand. The present
chages are inconsistent; for instance, while average annual number of hours of utilization are 2,985 for
capacities below 100 kW and of 3,760 above 100 kW, average charges per kWh for MV users are RWF 12.8
and RWF 13.6 respectivel  apoiaely         US$0.09). It should be the other way arond, alike in the
precdin  structure (before the 1990 devauation), where these repreented about US$0.13 and US$0. 10. To
correct this situaton, agreement was reached at negotiations that Goveament would submit a proposal
satsfctryto MDA on a new tarff structure for LV Cmn excess of 40 kwh/monith) and MV electrcity users
by March 31, 1993 and implement It as a conditon of Credit effectivenes.
1. 19 Itoe results of the March I99 ELECTROGAZ restructuring study inicated that the existing tariff
srcueprovides the lagest subsidies from the Government to residentia users of electricity (consuming
more than 500 kwh/mont), who represent a low proportion of total populaton and are likely to) be in the
higher per capita income brackets, as opposed to thoe consuming less tha 45 kwh/month, who should be
eligible for a social tarff As the number of new LV consumers grows, the pattemn of declining consumption

lower income groups. This tand can only continue if access to electricity is mae easier for these groups.
Lower initial connection charges (para. 1.15) including extension of repayment period coupled with a social
tariff to be financed by higher raes on large domestic consers, would be adopted under the proposed
project. At negotiations, agreement was obtained that a social tff conrsponding to the cost of providing
the service (remuneration of the private oprator) would be implemented for small domestic consumers (up
to 40 kWh/month).
1.20  As also confirmed in the study, the present tariff levels ar too low both in real terms and for
ELECrROGAZ to fully cover its opeating costs inluding assets depreciato  A comparisou of present rates
with those in some other sub-Saharan African countries is given in Anmex 4. Under such conditions,
establisiing the ful rate, to meet the sectoa  restuctring objecdves, i.e., remunerate the future prvate
operator and purchase energy and fuel, service the debt obligations of the asset holding company and finance
the sector expansion, would require strong Goverent commitment and cooperaion. The approprate tariff
action plan that has to be implemented under the proposed project to esuro the self-reliance and autonomy
of the sector as described in the objectives mentioned above is provided in para. 5.7 and shown in Table 5.3.
C.    The Woodful Subsector
1.21  Biomass in the form of firewood, charcoal and agricutura resides is by far the most important
energy source used in Rwanda and contrbutes about 95% to the total end-use energy balance. Socio-
economically also, biomass is the most important fuel: virtaly 100% of the rural population relies entirely
on wood for most of their energy needs, while 80% of the population of Kigali and, to a smaller etent, the
population in secondary cities like Butare, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, rely on charcoal for their primary energy
demand. The remainder of urban households use wood, even though there is a minority of mainly high
society households and expatriates tha uses electicity or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Charcoal is
considered a mode fuel and is the fuel of choice for urban households, and the totavalue of annual retail
sales in Kigali is esimated at RWF 0.7 billion, or about 50% of the naonal anmual electricity sales.
Charcoal consumption increases at 7.5% per year in Kigali and 15% In other cities, which is faster than the
overall 3.7%  population growt, reflecting both the rapid degree of utbaizato  and a trend of
modernization. A sustainable woodfhel swpply shoud be guaranteed to cover the demand since woodfuels
are so important in all strata of society. Furthermore, alternative fuels sch as kerosene, LPG or electricity
are flnancial!y at least 3.5 tmes more expsive than    coal or wood, and this is not likely to change in
the near future. When wood fuel demand exceeds sustainable swpply, ecological dmae such as deforestation
and soil degradation can be severe, as can be observd in several prefectes.
1.22  Rwanda has a total of 436,200 ha of natur forest located in and around three National Parks. In
addition, there are 35,200 ha of forestry domains, 44,600 ha of commud  forests, 149,000 ha of private
forests and an apximat total of 655,000 ha of -agrofbrestry- '. This is the equivalent of 25% of the
country's total land area. As recently as ten years ago, agroforestry as part of a deliberate aempt to improve
fuelwood supply was viruly non-xstent Due to initiatives taken by the Direction Geal des Forts
(DGF), and followed up by farmers, agroforesy is now one of the pme instuments in the eforts to
increase wood production. The 'Natlonal Forestry Fund' (NFF) estimated that 90% of all wood (1991) was
used for energy purposes, and the remainder for constuction, etc. Although only about 15% of all fuelwood
is used to produce charcoal, it presents a larger eviroamenta problem than firewood since the charcoal chain
is entirely commercialized whie the firewood collection basically is resticted to gathering of (dead) branches
and twigs.

1.23  While 8S% of the pre-1987 charcoal supply came from natrl resources mainly in the savannah zone
in the Southeast, at present more than 85% stems from small holders plantations mainly in the South and
Northwest. The estimated demand for w'oodfuels seems to outweigh sustainble supply and this is obvious
in certain prefecturem. Four out of the 11 prefectures recorded a net deficit, the largest in absolute terms
being Kigali with 239,000 tons and the largest in relative terms being Ruhengeti (with almost 50% of the
demand not being satisfied from resources within that prefecture). Thus, consumption Is creating net
depletion of tree resources, indicating that corrective action is required. Ihe situation threatens to deteriorate
in the future. Even at the ambitious pace of reforestation depicted In the Goverment's "National Forestry
Plan". it appears that the gap between demand and sustainable supply will continue to grow. Thus, on the
optimistic assumptions of the plan, only 3 out of the 9 prefectures would experience a deficit in year 2002
(as explained in tnne4.), but the total deficit would be more than double that of 1987, which would have
serious fmancial/economic and emironmenal consequences. To illustrate this, rough calculation shows that
the plantation area would have to be increased by 70,000 ha by the year 2002 (with a productivity of 15
t/Wyear) to make it possible to supply woodfuel on a sustnable basis: this objective is clearly beyond reach
under current circ_um es. Corrective actions to improve the balance between demand and supply through
demand management and better wood supply management would be taken   neously under the project
(parm. 4.10).
1.24 Charcoal making is a relatively new activity in most of the charcoal producing regions in Rwanda;
it is not a respected profession and is often left to the unemployed. Traditional charcoal kilns were observed
to have an average charcoaling efficiency 2 of between 5 and 9%, with a corresponding energy efficiency
ranging from 12 to 22%. This implies that more than 80% of the energy is wasted in the process of
carbonization. Ihis noted inefficiency in current charcoal production is partly due to the specific
circumstances under which charcoal is produced: i.e., in mouainous regions with steep hills, with a high
r11fai patten. As a resut, urban households using charcoal as their principal cooking fuel, use far more
energy than necessary: if a household udtizes 3 kg of charcoal per day, it consumes the equivalent of 30 to
60 kg of wood per day, while a household utilizing directly wood, consumes only 6 to 15 kg of wood. Since
t is nearly Inpossible to convince households to switch back to using wood instead of charcoal, subsantia
improvements in the charcoal production efficiency are urgently needed.
1.25 Ihe joint UNDP/World BanklDutch GovernmentESMMAP progra's project *Assistaunce to the
Traditional Charcoaling Sector" showed that professional charcoalers can more than triple the efficiency of
the charcoal making process. t furthermore created an association of full-time pro&ssional charcoalers
"IGAMA^, which to date has about 18 groups working throughout the country (i 350 charcoalers). This
project demonoated the need for cetain policy changes In the wood sector. First, wood fo charcoal making
is sold below the economic cost of replanting (between 10% and 20%), with the result that rural wood
suppliers subsidize urban charcoal users. A small charge levied on the transport of charcoal can correct this
problem while also promoting the use of lesser valued tree species (such as Pine) which are not presently
used. The government has agreed to put in place such a taxadon system, details of which is provided in
Ann 1.iL and to accordingly change the existing Forestry Law as a condition of Credit effectiveness (para.
4.17). These changes would affect two articles of the Forestr Law, the draft of which was agreed upon at
negotiations. Secondly, although the Government issues permits to transport charcoal from certain zones
2  Carboization is defied au ths hemical process (als: pyrolysia) whereby wood is conveted into charcoal
in an oxygen-lmited environnme   Charcoaling is defined as the ratio of aWr-y weit of thd carcoal

their resources are the least known. Based on this information as well as demand projections, a management
plan would be designed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbadry (MINAGRI) with the
assistance of consultants to utilize wood resources at their sustaiable maximum. All these issues are being
addressed under the proposed project (paras. 4.10 and 4.17).

1.26 Rwanda consumed about 66,000 Tons of petroleum products in 1991, aU of which was imported
overland from the Indian Ocean ports of Mombasa and Dar-Es-Salaam, a distance of about 1,700 km. The
oil Import bill of US$34 million represents about 35% of Rwanda's export eanings. Details of the
consumption pattem by product since 1983 are given in Annex 1.5 Gasoline and diesel account for over
two-thirds of sales. The consumption of petroleum products rose at an annual rate of 10% from 1980 to
1988, when it peaked. It then fell as a result of reduction in economic activity. Products are distributed by
three large Importers (one of which, PETRORWANDA Is majority stateowned) who account for about 80%
of sales. Several small companies account for the remainder. There are no restrictions for other finrs to
import petroleum products. The county is well served by a network of about a hundred filing statons,
nearly half of which are less than five years old. The Government holds buffer stocks of petroleum products
amounting to nealy 1.5 months consumption, in addition to stocks held by the importers themselves. These
ocks are low for a country so far from the ocean and would not cover a major supply disruption. However,
tot storage capacity in the Government-owned bulk storage depots is ample (25,000 cu. m). The depots
are managed by PETRORWANDA on behalf of the Government in return for a fee levied on all imports.
This arrangement, which proved unsatisfactory and is inefficient according to all importers, is being revised
under the project (Para. 4.9).
1.27 The cost of petroleum products to Rwanda is bigh because of the small size of purchases, the near-
impossibility of buying cargoes from oil traders who are not represented in Kenya or Tanzania and most
critically, the poor transport links to the coast. Products are either piped to Nairobi from Mombasa and then
tmcked to Kigali or transported by rail or road from Dar Es Salaam to Isaka (Tanzania) and then trucked to
Rwanda. Road transport is provided by private truckers both Rwandan and from neighboring countries.
Trsport costs amount to about US$180\MT, as much as the cost of the products at the Indian Ocean ports.
Significant savings of about US$60\MT could be obtained if ral transport and oil storage facilities in
Tanzania were upgraded, or if the most economic route through Uganda was used. The Tanzania Petroleum
Sector Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2202-TA), presently under implementation, addresses the former
obstacles. The Uganda route is presently closed due to political tensions at the Rwanda-Uganda border.
1.28 Additional issues affecting petroleum products in Rwanda relate to taxation and petroleum pricing
structre. Maximum pump prices are set by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Handicrafts
(MICOMARI), and are uniform throughout Rwanda. Large consumers negotiate discounts from the
distbuo  who compete for their business. However, retail prices at the pump do not vary. Taxes on
petoleum products are amongst the highest in the region and accotmt for more than 50% of the pump price.
in 1990, taxes were the equivalent of US$500JMT out of the averaga prices of all products of US$1,0201MT.
The govenm   raised the equivalent of US$34 million from this source in 1990. This level of taxation has
created a strong incentive to smuggle fuel into Rwanda. It is estimated that over a third of all diesel
consumed in Rwanda enters the country illegally, mainly from Tanzaia where diesel costs less than half as

much.' This issue was disussed, inte ail. at a September meeting In Ansha Canzania) between the
Tanzanian and Rwandese authorities. The Tanzanian Goverment plans to take steps to bring its petroleum
products pricing levels closer to those in Rwanda In 1993. Ihl% would reduce the incentive for smugglng.
In addition, the Rwandese Govement has prepared a set of administrative measures to be applied by
customs agents at border posts to stop the smuggling. These measres were discussed at negotiations and
assurances were obted      they would be implemented as a codtion of Credi effectiveness.
1.29   The exitng pricg strre (detailed In Anniex 1  prwvides liftle incentive for Importers to seek
the lowest possible FOB prices. Furthermore, It is overly complex and consists of five separate taxes levied
by different agencies and at different points between arival in Rwanda and final sae at the pump. To
address these taxation and pricing structure issues while maintaing the overall Government revenues from
petroleum taxes, agreement was reached at negotiations that, as condition of disbursement for the petroleum
products component of the proposed project, the Govenment would submit to IDA by 30 September 1993
and implement by January 1, 1994 an action plan including simplification of the taxation stmcture and price
liberalization for petroleum products.

1.31   The enviromnat prevailing In the energy sector during the past years has not been conducive neither
to the formulation nor to the implementation of coherent longtem subetor strategies. Public investment
programming has not been carried out within a multi-year framework; govermment contributions to multi-year
rojects have baa to be reconfirmed each year, with no clear guidelines for project selection. The risks of
slecting economically non-viable projects were high, partly reflecting the lack of eoomists and financial
perts in the Directorate of Enera and Hydrcarbons and the need for training to improve skills in project
aalysis   ologies and energy planming. Also, in the power subsector, ELECrROGAZ' inability to
generate fimds for new investments has been a major problem.
1.32  To remedy this situation, starting in October 1991, the Govemment introduced in connection with
the SAC-supported reform program, a system of three-year roiling PIP with a view to integraing the selection
of projects into clearly defined sectord objectives and a comprehensive macroeconomic frdmework. Project
selection crtkeria include: (i) economic viability (rate of return not less than 10%); (0) least-cost solution for
social projects; (1ii) consitenc with sectoral and macroeconomic objectives, and (iv) sustainability. Major
donors have agreed to support priority energy sector investments and related selection crteria under the
proposed project.
1.33   The energy sector PIP for 1992-1994 comprises 29 projects. During the review process, the
application of least cost technical alteruatives resulted in the re-designing of three projects. Ihis was the case
for: (i) the extension of the methane gas project at Cap Rubona, for which the iniial size and cost were
reduced to limit the production capacity to satisfy dte needs of the sole customer, BRALIRWA, a brewery
company, (i) the Rural Eectrication Project, for which initia cost of about US$14 million was reduced by
20%, following review of the technical design, md (di) the Mugwa II Hydro Project (US$16 million),
which is being reviewed to reduce its Investent costs. The final PIP for 1992-1994, foilowing the above
described adjustments, is RWF 11.3 billion or US$80.7 millin  t represens about 11% of the global PIP
for Rwanda In 1992, the sector PIP amounts to RWF 1,7 billion or 0.79% of the projected GDP. The

1I. THE ENERG- SECTOR INSulrr ONS
A.   ITe Polic_ Maldng Institdions
2.1   The Directorate of Energy and Hydrocarbons (DGEH) in the Ministry of Public Works and Energy
(MINiRAPE) has the lead role in formulating sector policy and development strategy, preparing and apply-
ing energy legislation, executing studies, supervising projects, and m  sector statistics.  Its
involvement in the electricity subsector goes far beyond policy making. ft has assumed responsibility for
planning and execution of power network investments, and for generation and transmission. On the other
hand, in spite of the dominating role of woodfuels in the energy picture, the Directorate has not undertaken
a detailed analysis of this subsector. This reduces the possibilities of applying an integrated approach to
woodful efficiency and substiution issues, as well as to overall energy sector issues.
2.2   The institutional sibion regading woodfuels is far from ideal. MNITRAPE considers that actions
and data collection In this field are the responsibility of the Forestry  epartme  (DOF) in the Ministry of
Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MINAGRI). To avoid overlaps and, conversely, gaps in the management
of woofels resources at all stages, household energy planming should be the responsibiity of one unit within
I1ITRAPE. Its main purpose would be to monitor the situation in the household ener field, especially
on the demand side as well as to make policy proposas in this field. There is no institution responsible for
assessing the environmental impact of energy projects. Under the proposed project, M WIIE would be
in charge of the latter and of household energy planning, while MINAGRI would handle the supply side
(as. 4.16-4.17).
2.3   Petroleum pricing policy is determined by the MinistrY of Commerce, Industry and Handicrafs
(MICOMART which also has responsibility for managing the Government's buffer stocks and monitoring
the quanity and quality of imports.4 Given the diverse responsibilities of this ministry and its Sck of energy
sector specialists and economists, monitoring of international petroleum prices (so as to provide a quick
response to change) has been inadequate. This arrangement has hindered the forLz !ation of comprehensive
en    policies. To correct this situation, the capacity of MICOMART to implement reform of the laxation
and pricing for petroleum products would be enhanced as part of the proposed project.
2.4 In the gas subsector, SOCIGAZ, a company jointty owned by the governments of Rwanda and Zaire
is responsible for managing the  m e gas resource of Lake Kivu and exrcising the regulatory power to

exploit the gas from Lake Kivu. This includes grantg concessions to third parties, managing the shares of
the two States, collectng royalties, establishing tariffs, and monitoring legally, technically and
environmentally the exloitation of the gas resource by third parties. The two govemments have agreed that
these SOCIGAZ' activities would be coordinated with MNITRAPE. In March 1992, the Governments of
Rwanda and Zaire and major donors involved in the subsector also agreed to the following: (i) exploitation
of this resource will only start, but on a pilot basis, once an appropriate reglatory famework is In place,
and (ii) concessions should be granted to private sector operators without Government's financing. Under
the proposed project, a study would be financed to prepare the regulatory framework for future development
of the Lake Kivu methane gas resource.
B.    The OpQRang Institution
2.5   El CTROGAZ, a wholy Covernment-owned enterprise classified as an 6tablissement public of
commerci character, created by Decree Law No. 18/76 dated April 20, 1976, is responsible for generating,
brans_httng and distributing electricity, water and gas, and has the monopoly rights for these services. In
theory, the ELECTROGAZ management team has considerable power, but In practice its authority in areas
such as personnel, salary policy and tariff setfing has been undermined by government Intervention. For
eample, appointments to senior positions bave to be approved by the President of the Republic. Ihis
situation has deprived management of his most powerfiu tools and has led to acute over-staffing and
hiproprlate skill-mix as fulrther detailed in paras. 2.8 and 2.9. In addition, ELECrROGAZ' involvement
In plamning and execution of power network investments is limited to distribution as explained in para. 2.1.
Finally, the composition of ELECROGAZ' Board and its limited involvement in key decisions, particularly
those relating to tariff setting, as well as collecting Government arrears, which amounted to 32 months of
sales at the end of 1991, have also been a major contributing factor in eroding the utility autonomy and
fnancial viability. These issues are being addressed under the proposed project.
i. ELEE1ROGAZ
QxgaanintiQn andManagement
2.6   ELECIROGAZ is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of five members including a
Chairn who is also the Director General of Energy in MINlTRAPE. Board's members are appointed for
three years by the President of the Republic from nominations made by MIN1TRAPE and four other
ministries. The Board is empowered with complete supenrision of the management and administration of
ELECTROGAZ. Responsibility for day-to-day management of operations is delegated to ELECMROGAZ'
manager assisted by three department directors-aminitrive and financial, electricity operations, and water
and gas- all appointed by the President of the Republic. Statutes and organzation of the departmeMs are
proposed by the Board and issued by Presidential Decree. The Government and ELECTROGAZ have agreed
to change ELECTOGAZ' existing Law, stautes, and organization as well as to review and clearly define
the functions and responsibilities of Government and of ELECTROGAZ' Board and Management. In this
connection, the exisig Law, as defined in para. 2.5 is being reviewed by consultants to take into account
the provisions of the draft Law on PEs' regulatory and instiutional reform5 that is currently unde discussion
witi the Government. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the provisions of the draft Law on
PEs' regulaty framework which is available in the Project File. The Law has been submitted to Parliament
for its approval; in the meantime its main features will be incorporated in the lease contract with the future
private operator to be approved by the Government and ELECTROGAZ or its successor, as discussed in
s  Prepared by consiltants under the IDA-finced PE Reform Prject (CR. 2113-RW).

2.7 As of March 31, 1992, ELECIROGAZ had a total of 4,108 staff. Of this total, 1,253 were under
permanent contract, 670 were temporary agents with status similar to permment contract, and 2,185 were
temporary workers of which 7C0 were used for force account works. During appraisal, ELECMROGAZ has
agreed to contract out to the private sector activities currently carried out under force account. This resulted
in the laying off of about 700 temporary staff on August 31, 1992. In addition, during negotiations,
agreement was obtained from the government that necessary measures would be taken so as to bring and
thereafter maintain its staff at level not to exceed I,2536 by Credit effectiveness. Severance payments would
be secured from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE, the French Aid Agency) as part
of its financing under the proposed project. Meanwhile, a local consultant is being hired to assess its cost
and legal implications in accordance with the Rwandese labor legislation, and to propose appropriate measures
to deal with the side effects of this exercise.
2.8 Out of the 1,923 permanent agents or with similar status, 66 (3.4%) are middle managers, 77 (4%)
are engineer tecicians and 1,780 (92.6%) are technicians and unskilled workers. Also, 846 agents (44%
of the 1923 mentoned above) are assigned to electricity and 1,043 (54%) to water, while electricity revemnes
represent about 69% of the utility total revenues for about 25,000 customers and waer revenues 30% of total
revenues for about 16,000 customers. Gas revenues on the other hand represent 1% of the utility's total
revenues; 34 agents are assigned to this activity which concerns one customer only. ELECTROGAZ'
personnel allocations are therefore unbalanced. Ihe ratios of total customers to permanent agents were 30
to 1 for electricity and 16 to 1 for war  in 1991, which are among the lowest levels of efficiency in sub-
Sahn Africa, where these range between 33 and 116 for electricity and between 53 and 186 for water.
Under the proposed project, improved efficiency through the taking over of operations by a private operator
coupled with the implementation of the above staff reduction plan are expected to bring these performance
indicators in line with the standards of efficient uility companies (7% and 25% of total staffing for middle
managers and engineer technicians respectively).
2.9    ELECIROGAZ has difficulties in identifying and recruiting qualified personnel. This is further
exacerbated by the requirement in the utility's present stattes that its middle managers including university
graduates be recruited with the approval of the President of the Republic, which in many cases takes up to
2 years. As a result, only 7% of ELECMROGAZ' personnel are university graduates, with an additional 13%
being high school graduates. Promotion and salary incentives are given on the basis of seniority and
hierarchy rather than on qualifications and job performance. Engineers and other skilled technicians are paid
almost the same low salaries as civil servats.  New personnel magement policies for recruitment,
performance evaluation and salary incentives as well as new personnel stattes would be introduced on a
performance basis for the asset holding company. The proposed project would as provide training for the
asset holding company's managers, electricity and gas technicians and non-technical personnel (adminon,
accounting, finance and commercial aspects), and medium-term training for six electricity sudents at the
Ecole Interafricaine d'Electricitd located in COte-d'Ivoire.

Accounting. Audit and ms
2.10   UndertheFirstPowerProject(CR 1495-RW), ELECFROGAZ' accounngsysemhasbeenreviewed
to correct deficiencies identified by the audit reports from 1983 through 1988. In connection to his, a
consultant had designed and inmlemented a comprehensive manaement nformation system, including an
acceptable computerized accounting system  'Me utility's books a  maitined In accordae with
internationally-accepted acounting practies. Accounts are kept on an hisorical cost basis and foreigp debt
and related  asactions are maued annually at prevailiog year-end exchange  tes.  All exchange
gains/losses are treated in accordance with international standards. However, ELECTROGAZ is currety
experiencing significant delays in the flow of accouting infomation due to lae aerival of data from staions
and branches. Consolidated annual operational, financial and commercial reports are inconsistent and
inaccurate. Furthermore, because of the absence of trained personel in the financial department, the
accounting framework is not used properly and the anua financial s  are inadequat.
2.11 As a mixed-product utiity, ELECITROGAZ' electricity, water, and gas operations share common
administrative, financial, and support services (workshops, garage, training facilities, etc.). While this ar-
rangement may be more economical by making the best use of scarce managerial resources, the absence of
separate cost accounting for each activity complicates the analysis of their finacial viability. Also, for
commercial operations, water and elericity consumptions are billed joindy, so that management of
receivables is more difficult, and outstanding customer accounts cannot be derived and followed through.
Transparency would be introduced into ELECTROGAZ' cost accounting so that key policy decisions,
especially for pricing, would be based on complete information. With the assistance of Price Waterhouse,
ELECTROGAZ has now prepared separate accounts for each of Its 1991 operations.
2.12 ELECMROGAZ's financial statements for FY89, FY90 and 1991 have been audited by external
auditors (Price Waterhouse).  The audit report for FY90 was qualied, particularly regarding
ELECIROGAZ' Accounting Department's inability to record the exchange risk of about RWF 2.5 billion
reated to the debts contcted from the CCCE and written-off vis-h-vis the Rwandese Government by the
French Government. Ihe report also highlighted the unreliability of the low voltage consumers balance
account, with substantial discrepancies between the Accountg and the CommercWia  Departments.
Furthermore, the report indicated that there is an increasing nunber of errors in the biling system, the
correction of which creates a workload on the Commercial Dartment, delays the reording of the related
accounting transactions and impedes the timely collection of revenues. Finally, there is no reliable accounting
system for capital works and the projects costs are obtained and registered from incomplete estimates. The
FY91 audit report noted that significant progress has been made In reconciling the diseancies in the low
voltage consumers balance account and in recording accounting trsactions.  The restructuring of
ELECrROGAZ to be financed under the project wiUl help correct the remining deficiencies. During
negotiations, it was agreed that ELECIROGAZ will continue to employ qualified external auditors and will
provide the Bank annually with audited financial statements including a long-term report no later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year.
2.13 In the past, insurance, apart from statutory insurance, has only covered freight and transport of goods
as ELECTROGAZ has operated on the basis of self insurance, widtout making any provision for an insurance
fund. The coverage does not reflect the devaluation of the Rwandeso Franc, nor does it take account of the
realistic values of its assets. 'he new insurance premium contracted by ELECTROGAZ, effective September
30, 1992, provides coverage beyond the statutory insurance, as it is based on the revaued costs of assets,
and contains provision for an insurance fund.

2. Propsod Instditonal Rdefon  PrM=  and Poicy Measures
2.14   lhe insufficient involvement of ELECTROGAZ in sectoral planing and investment decisions and
the excessive government presence in the utility management has had a significant impact on its operations
and finances. Its poor financial siuation, characterized by RWF 8.3 billion (US$57.6 million) of accumulated
losses at the end of 1991, also stems indirecdy from the insdtutional weaknesse described in para. 2.5, and
the low level of ts as explained in parm. 1.20, high accounts receivable from Government (pa. 5.9),
chronic over-staffing (one of the lowest ratio of consumers/agent in sub-Saharan Africa) and poor quality of
service.
2.15   Following a review in March 1992 of a proposal made by cosulants for the restrucuring of the
sector Government, ELECTROGAZ and donor representatves participated In a joint review of alternative
management tools idenified by the consultants as possible solutions to the insttutional weaknesses as outlined
above. As there was a consensus that neither local investors exist with the financial capacity to acquire the
assets, nor foreign investors wUling to Invesv in the utility in its present state, full privatzation was
eliminated. Other options included (i) retning ELECTROGAZ as the sole operator in the sector, (ii)
creatidng a second public utility through separation of water from electricity operations, ii) introducing a
performance-based management conact or a lease coract with an outside party, and (v) granting an
exclusive concession to run the assets of the sector to a private operator.
2.16   While attempts could be made to Improve ELECMROGAZ performance without major institutiona
reform, problems of excessive government intefeence, in issues such as staffing and compensation policy
would persist and ELECTROGAZ' finances would always remain vulnerable to government reluctance to
authorize tariff increases and to sette its own bills promptdy. Equally, the option of splitting water and
electricity operations was ruled out because of the unnecessary duplication and higher overhead costs arising
from the creation of parallel structres.
2.17   Ihe Government sought a means of bringingprivate sector management iltO the sector without selling
the assets of ELECrROGAZ. Given dtat under a concession, full tie to the assets would be granted to a
private firm for a long period (0-40 years), this option was excluded for reasons similar to those against
immediate privatzatlon. The final choice was between a lease or management contract with a private
operator to run ELECIROGAZ' assets. The Government decided to select a leae contract for the fuAture
operations of the electricity and water sectors.
2.18 The lease contract option entails the creation of a public holding company which retains ownership
of the sectoral assets that are then leased to a private firm to operate. The holding company retains
responsibility for investment planning and system expansion. Compared to a management contract, leasing
out the assets offers several advantages. Firsy, the privateoerator, in additon to its know-how, has to put
some of its capital at dsk and has a strong incentive to perfrm as efficiendy as possible. As he is only
allowed to charge an agreed tariff to customers and must provide sufficient revenues to the holding company
to meet its financial needs, the lower the costs the higher his remuneration. Tis eliinates the need for an
elaborate peromamce monit    system to be nedated and constantly observed by both parties. Secondly,
the management fee or a substantial element of it that has to be paid under a management contract regardless
of the profitability of the udlity or the performance of the manager does not exist under a lease contract.
Finally, with a lease contract, pressure to mme costs pushes any potential foreign investor to quickly
indigenise the top management to the full extent possible, thus keeping expatriates to a minimum. Ihis is
another positive feature compared to a management contra

for ELECIROGAZ or Its successor and for a private operator to taxe over these responsibiities respectively,
while providing them with freedom to recruit and fire and set incentivebased salary levels, (iv) strengthening
the planning capacity of the utflity by transferring 3 to 4 engineers from MItNRAPE to staff the Planning
Unit of ELECTROGAZ or of its successor, and (v) opening the composition of the Board of ELECrROGAZ'
successor to include more private sector agents, and enabling it to be more involved in key policy decisions
including tariff setting.
2.20  As detailed analysis carried out by the consultant in connection with ELECTROGAZ' restuctring
study confirmed ta the utility staffing needs are close to the number of those currently holding permanent
contract, the Government decided to implement a major staff reduction plan with a view to laying off all the
temporary agents including those with status similar to permanent agents. Tibs decision affects about 2,155
(about 70%) out of the total 4,108 agents. The proposed project will support this Government's decision by
providing the necessary severance payments to these agents before the taking over of its operations by the
private operator, at a cost of about RWF 261 million, so as to ensure a successful implement  of the
privatzation program. The Calme Centrale de CoopEration Economique (CCCE, the French Aid Agency)
has agreed to finance this operation. The private operator and the asset holding company would be free to
select their respective employees among the remaiig 1,253 agents. The number of agents to be employed
by the asset holding company is being determined by a consutant. Additional measures to avoid that
unemployment be a major problem for the Governent would be identified by the local consutant currendy
assessing the cost and contractual implications of the staff reduction plan with respect to the Rwandese labor
legiation (para. 2.7).
2.21   A successf implemeionof the lease contract will also require strng Governent's commitment
and cooperation in promptly settling its bills and setting appropriate tariff policy. Under the proposed project,
the contratual anagements between the private operator and the holding company/Government would
include provisions for Oi the Government to rationalize its electricity and water consumption, and pay its bills
within 60 days upon reception, and (ii) the private operator to implement systematic power cut policy for all
consumers including Government's agencies and to deduct from revenues it collects unpaid Government
consumption before any further allocation. Agreement on this, as well as on a first 15% average tariff
increase for electricity and water by January 15, 1993, followed by another 15%, effective April 15, 1993,
as given in para. 5.8, was reached with Government at negotiations, to ensure the autonomy and self-reliance
of the subsectors. An automatic adjustment formula that is based on the rates of exchanges between the
Rwandese Franc and the US$, on price of purchasing electricity from SINELAC and on salaries, as well as
an anmual report reflecting the adequacy of tariffs to meet the above objectives, would be used.
3. The New Insttutions
2.22  Ihe ulimate objective for ELECTROGAZ is to become a financialy-viable and operationally-efficient
power, watr and gas uility. Given past poor pefomance, the Government decided that this can only be
achieved through contractig out of Its operations to a private operator with an adequate degree of autonomy
and responsibility to guantee efficient operations. The underlying sectoral restructuring that was agreed
upon at negodations involves the establishment of two companies:
(a)    a National Utility Authority, 'SociEt  Nationale de Patrimoin  (SNP), or the successor of
ELECTROGAZ, 100% owned by the Government, which would be the owner of the assets and



-19 -
facilities and be fiiily responsible for future sector development including identdfication, preparadon,
financing and Implementation of new projects. It would also issue consolidated financial statements
(for SNP and the private oprating company), service the power sector debts, and provide traig
to its staff under the proposed project The mmber of staff to be employed by the SNP is being
assessed by a consultt, and would need tobe coneinedIn the rcua        documel2   for the
institution  arrangements between the SNP and the Governmen; and
(b)    a Private Management Company, 'Soci6  Prve d'Exploitatioe (SPE), to be held by a professional
private utility operator, with partial ownership by the State (up to 20%); this company would be
responsible for production, transmission and distribution of electricity, waer and gas. It would
operate and maintain the assets and facilities of ELECrROGAZ, biUl the custome  and collect the
revenues, invest in short-term fixed assets (maintenance) and in all items covered by worling capital,
within the framework of a ten-year lease contract with the Nation  Utility Authority (the SNP).
2.23  The separation of planning/flning and executing Investments from the daily opeadng activities of
utility woud allow for strong involvement of a professional private company in the technical and commercial
operations and therefore an increased efficiency without putting the burden of capital expenditures on the
lter.
The Lease Contact
2.24  The exact terms of the lease ontact including the State equity contribution to the SPE will be defined
by consultants with whom a contract has been signed, along the outline given in Ann 2.2. and with
guidance from models of contract documents for the water utility in Guinea, and the water and electricity in
Cfte-dfvoire, where the electricity sector was successfully pdvatized about two years ago.
2.25  The consultants wil assist the Government In drafting the bidding and contractuld doCUment and
evaluaing the proposals, and will provide legal advice throughout the selection process of the private
operator.  Availle backgound reports to be also used as direct input to their work include
ElECLROGAZ' restucturig, electricity demand, audited financial  for the past two years, the
draft Law on the new regulatory and legal firaework of Public EnterprD   (PEs), which are available in the
Project File. IThe TORs for these consultants are provided in Annmz 2.
2.26  Key elements of the draft lease contrac have been agreed with Govement and include: (I) the
stat  of the SNP, the delineation of responsibilities between the SNP and the Government, the
SNP/Governmeft and the SPE; (ii) detailed agreements on the allotm  of revenues between the SPE and
the SNP/Government; Iiii) the electricity, urban water supply and gas generd regulations defining the SPE's
permanent rights and obligations vis-&-vis Its shareholders; (iv) the responsibility and process for tariff
review; 01v) the freedom to recri and fire and to operte independenty from political itefrence (v) timely
payment of bills by government agencies, or otherwise procedures for systematic power cut-off; (vi) contents
and periodicity of operation and acounting reporing; technical norms for works to be executed and
respective responsibilities of the SNP and SPE in supevision; and (vii) genera rues for operation,
maintenance, including employees per customer, sales, technical and non-achnical losses, collections from
sales. The lease contract will detail treatment of purchase of electricity and other opeating costs, debt service
charges, and taxation and Insrancm arrangements. Addional areas to be covered nclude clear stae_m
of objectives and the rights and obligations of the pardes; the selection process of the SNP's general manager
and key staff positions indluding the nominato process of is Board members; the shareholders agreements
and statutes of the joinly-owned SPE, and the standard 'supply contractsu with its custmers.

2.27   As It will ta  a few years before an independen and effestive regulatory capacity can be developed,
the lease contra  will be the main tool for reglaig the operator, with automaticity for the primary
regulatory variable, tariff seting. Agreement was reached at negodations on the following: (i) the lease
contract award would be tied upon conclusion of contcal arragements, satisfactory to IDA, for the
establishment of the private operatig company, the SPE; (1i) detailed progrm of critical milestones necessary
to monitor progress in this area; (ill) launching of bids for the selection of operators would be a condition
of Credit effectiveness; (lv) disbursemnts for the rehabilitation and extension of the distribution networks
would be made upon enactment and implemention of the reguatory framework and program including the
establishment of the SNP, the SPE and related contractu  arrangements ussfactory to IlDA, and upon
confirmation of the availability of the State equity contribution (US$1 milMion equivalent) to SPE's capital,
and the hiring of the private operator; and (v) key milestone dates: selection and starting of negotiations with
the successful professional private operator - August 31, 1993; signature of the lease contract - before
November 30, 1993.
Eilnaing the gratiog of tihe new insitutions
2.28   The SPE would: (a) collect from the customers the full rate for electricity and water, defined as the
re that is sufficient to cover reasonable opeating expenses for the SNP and SPE, including the purchase
of energy and fuel, the remuneration of the shareholders' equity, the depreciation of the SNP's assets, the
service of its debts as well as the financing of the substa  inment program, and to yield a reasonable
rate of ret  on the SNPs assets; (b) retain part of it, the 'lease contractor rate' (LCR), to cover its own
operadng expenses, including the remuneation of its equity; (c) use part of it to purchase imported electricity
and (d) give back to the SNP for each kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity and cubic meter (m3) of water
collected, the difference between the full rate on one hand and the LCR and cost of imported electricity on
the other. The LCR would be the basis for the selection of the lease contactor.
2.29   The private operator thrugh the SPE would operate and mainain the systems at its own risk and its
only revenues would be the LCR. In that way, it would have real Incentives to improve the collection ratio,
cut operatig costs, and reduce the unaccounted for water and losses for electricity. It would also implicitly
be encouraged to replace eWpensive but ily needed expatriates, with correctly trained and paid local staff.
Since the only revenues of the SNP would be what remalns once the SPE retains its remuneraticn and
purchases energy, the SNP would have real inceives to obtain from the Government consumer rates always
sufficient to at least maintain a positive cash flow siuation.
2.30  It is eential for the successful implentation of the sector restrucing to have appropriate tariff
policy (the fiul rate). As a first step toward reaching the full rate, the averag electricity and water tariffs
were increased by 15% on Januay 15, 1993, and would be inceased by another 15% on April 15, 1993.
Ihese levels would cover the SPE's own expenses and the purcha  of energy, and would be sufficient to
meet the SNP's operatng expe  including only 45% of its assets depreciation, with no resources left for
subsectoral debts and investmn. The features of fhr  increaes are described in para 5.8 and shown
in Table S.3. In any case, diefinal increases would not be less than what is needed to reach the fuU rate,
and would be phased to reach the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) by the mid-term review in June 1995.
2.31 Water tariffs would need to be raised by additional 40% and 20%7 to reach full rates of RWF
142.55/rn and RWF 171.06/rn respectively, even ater the two 15% increases menioned above. The
Immdiate priority in implementig a ful rate for water is to restore the customers' willingness to pay for
7  Due to new invesments fo watw rlaed to te next ptoject Kigali 2000.



-21 -
water, and to enfre sound and secure billing and collecdon procedures, including cut-off as needed. As
this priority would be progressively achieved in parallel with Improvement of the quality and availability of
water service following the rehabilitaon and upgrading of connection installations, the increases needed for
water tariff to reach the fidl rat mentioned above would be phased. During negotiations, it was agreed that
the Government would fiance every yea untl 1998, the differential between the current water tariff (after
the yearly increae mentioned in pram 5.8) and the ful rate. This pragmatic subsidization scheme is deemed
effective and appropriate since: (a) the process is entirely transparent as subsidies would be conveyed through
budgetary channels; and (b) the arrangements would last only a limited period of time. In this connection,
the Government's contribution to water tariff (details of which are provided in Annex S. that is necessary
to maiain the full rate for water over the project implementation would be determined and adjusted, when
needed, by October 31 in each year for the succeeding year, taking into account the yearly water tariff
increases as described in para S.8.
Private Operator A,ccess to Forefign E3xchae
2.32 Past experience In the sector with ELECMROGAZ as well as experience elsewhere demonstrated both
the importance and the problems In having ready access to foreign exchanges to cover operations needs.
Continued difficulties in this area could result in delays in timely implementation of conactual obligations
by the private operation under the proposed arngements. This risk is now significantly reduced in Rwanda
which under the SAC-supported refm program, has established on July 1, 1992 a non-discriminatory
foreign exchange allocation regime through an Open General License (OGL) system administered by
commercial banks. This system is funded by foreign exchange eanings, as well as by the proceeds of the
DM's SAP and the first SAC operation. Other donors will also utilize this system in their balance of
paymens assistace to Rwanta  It Is therefore exected that the OGL system would provide the fuiture
private operator tat wl oper  ELECTROGAZ access to foreign exchange at the prevailing exchange rate
to fiance e a  spare parts and service In the nomal course of business.
iL. -ANK SUP PORT TO THE SECTOR
A     Bank A_tce to the S
3.1   In the past, IMA has provied funds to help address key energy issues under four different projects.
Ihe Fntegrated Foresty and Livestock Development Project (Cr. 1039-RW, July 7, 1980), which did not
meet the andtipated expectations, financed experimental work for improved woodstoves in rural areas and
for transformtion into charcoal of the bamboo cleared from afforested areas of the Gishwati forest zone.
The Ruzizi I project, approved by the Bank on December 6, 1983 (Cr. 1419-BU, 1420-RW and 1421-ZR),
provided additional electriciy to Bunudi, Zaire and Rwanda as a least-cost option. The Ruzizi It power plant
has been successfudly completed and is operational since 1989, but, as explained in the project completion
report (PCR) for this project whih was Issued on April 26, 1992, the pricing isse of the energy sold is yet
to be resolved8. Improved charoal stves and efficiency improvements in charcoal production were
successlly intoduced under he joint UNDPIWB ESMAP program in 1987.
SIBIC was expected to cm 10% rat of rtun on the asset over the ifeof th proect Mm aca
sals pnc, inly SDRO.025/kW  ws increased to SDRO.04IkWh, and i July 1992 to SDRO.05/WMh.
This is below the economic price of SDRO.071/kWh as weU as below th lewis that are neesay for the
prqject to eam the 10% rat of rwn required to eue the financial viaiity of SIELAC. A furher
price inca  is to be codered in Jamuary 1993.



- 22 -
3.2   IDA also financed a project to Improve reliability of the production, tnsmission and distribution of
electricity so as to serve additional consumers, and to strengten ELECTROGAZ in its planning,
management, general operations and maintenance, with a Credit of SDR 8.5 million (Cr. 1495-RW),
approved on June 12, 1984. The PCR for this project, which was Issued on March 26, 1992, indicated that,
while the major physical works for this project were satisfactorily completed, there are still somne ounding
technical problems related to the rehabilitation of the Ntaruka hydroelectric plant, and a need for improvement
In the quality of ditribution services. Concerning ELEC1ROGAZ' operations, a planning unit was created
but planning responsibility de fao remained with MINlRAPE, and few of the financial performance targets
were met owing to inadequate tariffs, stagnant sales revenues and accumulation of Government receivables.
Ihese Issues have been dealt with in the proposed project through upfront actions (paras. 5.6 - 5.7 and 5.9).
3.3   To reflect the increasing emphasis on the role of the overall policy and insiutional environment in
the adjustment process at the macro level, the restructuring of the public enterprises (PEs) must particularly
focus on PEs whose performance is critical to the success or failure of other actors in the economy. This
approach has led IDA to finance in 1990 a PE reform project (CR. 2113-RW), under which a new legal
framework for PEs has been prepared and agreed upon with IDA. Ile main features of this framework that
refer to Stated-owned Corporations are available in the Project File.
B.    IDA SMrate, and Rationale for Involvement
3.4   To assist the Government In meeting its declared objectives as stated in para. 0.5, under the proposed
project, IDA would support policy reforms in the energy sector by restructring key sector institutions
icluding ELECIROGAZ, and introducing rational investment and expenditu  programming for the sector,
through continued dialogue and support for highest priority investment program. IDA would also help
expand the role of the private sector by encouraging its participation in (i) taking over the operations of
ELECIROGAZ, which is a fundamentally-different approach from the past, where technical assistance to
management has proved ineffective and inefficient, (H) the rational use of existng woodfuel resources, (iii)
a small-scale approach for development of Lake Kivu's methane gas if warranted from an economic and
environmenl point of view, and (iv) managing the resources available for quality and quant  control of
petroleum products. Among others, these would restore ELECIROGAZ' efficiency and financial viability,
its service reliability and consumer satisfaction. IDA's involvement is further neede to assist in coordinating
donors' actions, improve the management of available resources and foster economic development and
growth. Finally, IDA would help ensure that the institutional arngements and policy measures are the most
appropriate to attract the maximum number of interested bidders, and that the interests of the Government
and the consumer are also preserved.
IV. THE PRJECT
A.   Erjgd OWives
4.1   The main objective of the proposed project is to promote rational energy policies while minimizing
adverse environmental implications, and establish the basis for efficient udlization of Rwanda's energy
resources. Specific objectives are: () create an enabling regulatory and policy environment; (i) enhance
the efficiency of ELECrROGAZ' operations; (iii) provide technical assistance and training to key sector
Isitutions to build up investment planing capacity, and strengthen government capacity to formulate a
coherent sector policy and to monitor sector activities including those related to woodfuel, methane, petroleum
products, and least-cost power supply alternatives for ural areas; and (iv) rehabilitate key power



-23 -
infrastructure. IThe basic principle underpinning this project is that the Government establishes the policy
environment, but commercial decisions are left to private economic agents.
B.    Poelt Descrigtion
4.2   The main feures of the project are summarized as follows:
(a)    Strnghening Re=uator and Policy Enviroment
(i) institutional reform program of the power subsector, including consulting services to revise
ELECITOGAZ' exoistng Law and staes to permit the contting out of the utility operations to
a private operator and prepare the bidding documents for its selection, and assist in implementing the
specMfics for operations contracting under a lease type contract, and in establishing two companies,
the Societe Nationale de Patrimoine (SNP) and the Societe Privee dExploitation (SPE); and
implementation of a series of *make-ready" measures in order to attract qualified private operators;
( i) introduction of incentives to rationalize and improve the efficiency of the charcoal subsector; (di)
implementation of environmental and technical guidelines for fiture development of Lake Kivu's
methane gas, creation of a data base and dissemination of information to private investors, both
national and foreign, interested in the development of the Lake Kivu's methane gas; and setting up
of laboratory facilities and training local technicians to monitor Lake Kivu's waters (chemistry,
stafication) and volcanic activity in the surrounding areas; (iv) studies to design and implement a
strategy for solar home systems as a cost efficient alternative for electricity in the rural areas; and
(v) technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of MICOMART to implement the
reform for the taxation and pricing of petroleum products;
(b)    Rehabilitation and Improvement of Key Power Infucture.
(1) rehabilitation and etension of the distribution network for five cities; (d) improvements in the
tranmission network substations including the addition of two 110 kv bays in the Mururu I
substations ta are complemenry to those carried out under the Energy I Project (Cr. 1495-RW);
(ii) overhaul of the Mukungwa I hydro power station, and of the hydraulic structures of the Gisenyl
and Gihira hydro plant; Ov) feasibility studies for hydroplants; (v) constitution of a reerve stoCk of
spare parts for plants and substions; and (vi) capacity building and trainig for the staff of the
Project Coordination and Adminsaion Unit (PCAU) and Project Implemention Units (PIUs) in
area of project monitoring and management, and training through scholarships to four students to be
trained at the Ecole Superieure dElectricite in COte-d'Ivoire, and strengthening of the investment
planning and monitoring capacity of the utility staff,
A more detailed explanation of these components is provided below.
InsXtimfonal Restructuring Program of the Subsector
4.3 In order to attract qualified international private operators, a number of *make-ready" measures are
necsary. Ihese measures, which would bring the facilities and means of the utility to a minimum
acceptable level, have been identified as follows: 0i complete inventory of delivery points and updaing of
customer files; (O) updating and completion of plans and drawings for the distribuion installations of
electricity and water; and (ii) and upgrading of electicity and water consumer connections and metering
facilites to make it possible to account for electricity and water supplied, as well as to cut service to
delinquent customers. In addition, this component would include the costs pertuaning to the severance



- 24 -
payments for ELECTROGAZ' excess personne to be laid off as part of the restrucuring measures, which
the CCCE, as a cofinancier has agreed to fine. Fmally, the compone  Includes the costs of consulting
services to help prepare the bidding documents and assist in the selection of the private operator. The cost
esmate for this component iS US$6.70 million, of which US$2.71 mifllion would be provided by CCCE.
Infsraucture Rehabilitation and E3xtensions
4.4   This project component would finance rehabilitation and extension works for the distribution networks
of the five largest cities of the country: Kigali, Butare, Gisenyi, Nyabisindu and Ruhengeri. The definition
of works to be executed and the estimate of the corresponding costs as prepared by a consultant and found
reasonable by IDA is available in the Project File. A qualified consultant will be hired once the private
operator is on board to prepare bidding documents for the procurement of equipment and mateial, and for
the execution of works. The latter will be bid locally, since it has been determined that the project consists
of a collection of a large number of interventions from small to medium scope that can be carried out by local
expertise. The SPE will ensure compliance with norms and the conditions of its involvement would be
clarified in the contex of the contatua arrangements to be implemented under the proposed project. lhe
cost estimate for this component is US$9.77 million.
4.5   In order to improve the condition of the substaions of the transmission network, a series of works
will be carried out. These would mainly affect the medium voltage sections that were not included in the
rehabilitation works executed under the Energy I Project (Cr. 1495-RW). The works also include the addition
of two 110 kV bays in the Murum substation to (i) recontute the integrity of the Rwandese high voltage
network hat was separated into two parts by the creation of SINELAC's instaations, and Cii) facilitate
energy imports from Zaire. The services of a qualified consultant wil be retained to undertake a technical
audit of the network, which would be used to define the scope of work to be executed. Its terms of refeence
are provided in Annex 4.9. The cost estimate for this component is US$5.53 milion. The Government has
agreed to provide US$0.26 million and the European Investment Bank (EIB) has been requested to finance
US$5.27 milion, as a cofinancier of the project.
4.6    As the Mukumgwa I hydro power station (commissioned in 1982) has completed ten years of
uninterrupted operation without any major maintenance, a complete overhal which is by now overdue,
would be financed under the proposed project. Rehabilitation works will also be executed on the deteriorated
hydraulic structures of the Gisenyi and Gihira hydro power stations. A general inspection of these
Instaons has been conducted by an ELECTROGAZ' team wih the assistance of an expert from GTZ
(Germany) resulting in a preliminary identification of the required works, equipment and materials. A
qualified consultant for which terms of reference are also provided in Annex 4.9 will be hired to finalize
definition of works and materials and prepare the bidding docments. EIB has also been requested to finance
this compent for US$2.65 million, as a cofinancier of the project; the total cost esdmate for this component
is US$3.05 million.
4.7   The maintance of all ELECIkOGAZ' installations has suffered in the past from lack of adequate
provision of spare part, tools and maintenance equipment, due to financial problems and difficulties in
obtaining the necessary foreign exchang;. The proposed project would fiance the procurement of minimum
stocks of spare parts for the plants artd substations, and mai ace equipment and tools on the basis of a
list prepared by ELEC[ROGAZ whh assistance from GIZ and reviewed by IDA during the appraisal
mission. The cost estimate for this project component is US$2.96 million.
4.8   Petrolemn pducts coa =onent.  At present the Government does not adequately monitor the
international petroleum market. Under the proposed project, the capacity of MICOMART to implement the



- 25 -
needed reform for petroleum products taxation and pricing will be strengtened. lTe project will finmce the
costs of equipping and training a small petroleum monitoring and analysis unit. The cost estimate is US$0.69
millionL
4.9   The present tax of 2.32% on the CIF value of all imports (about RWF 62 million in 1991), levied
by the State for PETRORWANDA to manage the petroleum storage depots on behalf of all importers, is
sufficient to cover the annual operating and mainenance costs of this activity. However, the management
of these instalations is inefficient, and the quality and quantity contol of imported petroleum products is
poorly executed. Laboratry facilites as well as calibration and quadity control equipment at the main
petroleum storage in Kigali are inadequate and not well mainained. At negotiations, agreement was reached
with Government that: in order to improve management of its petroleum storage depots, responsibility for
this shall be transferred from PETRORWANDA to a new management company as a condition of
disbursement for the petroleum products component. This service company will be created and joindy owned
by all the oil importers9, including PETRORWANDA, and will be run on a minimum cost-recovery basis
and not as a profit center.
4.10  Rationalization of the Urban Charcoal SupVpl. Consumption of charcoal is expected to contiue to
increase ister than urban population growth. This will have ein"ronmental consequences unless corrective
action is undertaken, particularly since charcoal is currently produced through a wasteful process, leading to
a loss of about 80% of the energy contained in wood. To ensure that charcoal is produced and used as
rationally and efficiently as possible, the proposed project would therefore finance equipment and services
required to establish a self-financing program after three years through atlocation of part of the tax on
charcoal transport, details of which is provided in Annex 1.8. The services of local and foreign experts
would be financed to design a master plan for the supply of charcoal to urban areas. This includes (i) studies
to identify existig private, village, state resources, using aedal photographies and mappings, the maximum
annual sustainable wood supply of these resources as well as projections of wood demand by source and
product type and by city; (ii) preparation and implementaton of wood use management plans at the village
levels through training, semiars, sensitzation and promotion campaigns; CMii) pinewood promotion to increase
its competitiveness with eucalyptus wood, and (iv) equipment to moderize the wood and charcoal subsectors.
This plan of actions would help implement pricig and taxation policies to facilitate rational use of these
resources. Wood consumption with and without the proposed project including savings is presented in Annex
_U. The estimated cost of this component is about US$4.56 million.
4.11   Strategy for Solar Home Systems (SHS) Development. Presently, most rura areas will have to wait
years before being reached by an extension of the electricity network. Under these circumstances, the least-
cost alternaive to grid connection is a stand-alone solar home system which could provide similar benefits
to households. Since many activities including fimancial and technical assistance to importers and local
producers are already financed by German bilateral assistance (GZ), the proposed project wil provide
funding for two studies, to design a strategy for SHSs through a market study and prepare proposals for
innovative financing schemes for SHS. The esdmated cost for this component is about US$0.3 million.
4.12   Future Development of Lake Kivu Methane Gas. During a seminar on Lake Kivu's methane gas,
attended by representatives of the principt donors involved in the gas subsecor, including the European
Community (EC), the Belgian Cooperae   Agency (AGCD) and the Government of Rwanda, it was
9  Petroeum products ae importd and disttibted by sx companie. PETRORWANDA (Ajonity-owned
by the Govenazet) has 24% of the maet ERP (owned by Rwm*de ptivate  _ ) hols 40X
of the market, two subsidiaries of h lae intertional companies (SHELL and BP-FINA) have 30% of
tie maret with the rman  shae left to two Rwandes private 



-26 -
recommended that development of methane gas be limited to private sector at matket conditions with no
Government's financing. The seminar helped clarify the environmental Issues associated with development
of Lake Kivu methane gas. To this end, It was agreed that fnding be provided for studies and projects to
encourage private sector involvement in the future exploitation of this resource. An environmental issues
papor and a mitigation plan are available in the Project File. The proposed project would therefore provide
financing for (i) the editing of a manual with proper standardized technical and environmental specifications,
adequate concessions arrangements, tariff structure, royalties and appropriate legal framework for the future
exploitation of Lake Kivu's methane gas, (ii) the seting-up of monitoring system for the chemistry of
dissolved gases in the Lake Kivu and volcanic activity in the area; (iii) the provision of specialized training
for local scients  and tedhnicians; (iv) the establishment of a warning system and evacuation plan for the
event of a disaster; and (v) a complete bathymetric survey of the Lake including environmental impact on the
identified sites. Before proceeding with the surveys and studies related to the implementation of
environmental and technical guidelines for future development of Lake Kivu's methane gas, the Government
has agreed at negotiations to include in their terms of reference an eamination of any potential riparian
issues. The estimated cost for this component is about US$1.54 million.
C.       roWeet Costs
4.13   Project costs are detailed in Annex 4.1 and summarized in Table 4.1. Total cost, including physical
and price coningencies and duties and taxes, is estimated at US$38.95 million, of which US$33.09 million
are foreign exchange costs. The cost estimates for the energy sector instutional reform program were
prepared by IDA, while the costs of the other components were estimated by ELECrROGAZ and consultants,
reviewed by IDA and found to be reasonable. Physical contingencies of 10% were added to each component
to provide an allowance for unforeseen increases in the volume of work. Price contingencies assume local
inflation of 12% in 1992, 5% in 1993, 4% in 1994 and thereafter, and international inflation rates of 4.1%
for 1992, 5.4% for 1993, 4.7% for 1994 and 3.6% for 1995.

4.14 The Borrower would be the Government of the Rwandese Republic. The Minstry of Public Works
and Energy (MINIPE) would be responsible for the overall coordination and supervision of the program
and would directy implement some of the activities related to woodfuel, gas, and solar systems. nTe
Mistry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MINAGRI) would coordinate the implementaion of the
charcoal master plan whereas the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Artisanat (MICOMARI) would be
in charge of implementing the petroleum products component. ELECrROGAZ and its successors would be
the implementing agency for the power subsector components. A project coordination and adminisonunit
(PCAU) would be established within MINiTRAPE, and project implementation units (PIUs) would be set
within ELECIROGAZ or its successor, MINlTRAPE, MINAGRI, and MICOMART.
EI .$            lemet
4.15 A Project Preparation Facility (No. 701-RW) has been approved for the preparation of the
rehabilitation and etension of the distribution network, and for the instutional reform of ELECTROCAZ.
Selection of consultants for these activities as well as the related studies have now been completed. Work
on all other components of the proposed project would follow the detailed schedule given in Annex 4.4. The
physical execution of the project would be completed by June 30, 1998. A mid-term review by the
Government and IDA would be organized by June 1995 to assess the overall project implementation and
achievements and take the corrective actions that may be needed. The areas to be covered are detailed in
para. 4.30, while Anne4.11 provides the set of indicators that was agreed upon during negotiations.
4.16   The Project Coordination and Adminion Unit (PCAU) to be established within MINITRAPE
would be the main counterpart for discussions with the Bank. The PCAU would include the Director General
of Energy and Hydrocatbons, one representative from MICOMART, MINAGRI and MfiNTRAPE each, and
a representative from ELECrROGAZ. Its main functions are detaied in Anmne 4.2. Each implemeting
agency would es.ablish a focal point for project implementation within its existng adminisutve framework,
herefter referred to as Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIUs to be established include: (a)
ELECIROGAZ or its successor. the SNP: for the rehabilitation and extension of the distribution network
for Kigali, Butare, Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Nyabisindu, the rehabilitation work for the power substations and
transmission network, and the provision of spare parts, software and other equipment; as explained in para.
4.4, the SPE would ensure the compliance of these works with norms; (b) MURAPE: for the establishment
of a woodfuel consumption database, and other demand aspects of the charcoal component, for the
coordination and supervision of the solar energy and methane gas activities; (c) lNlNAGRI: for the
preparation and execution of the charcoal component; (4) MICOMART: for the implementation of the
petroleum products component. As a condition of Credit effectiveness, the PCAU and PlUs would be
established; each of the PIUs would appoint a manager; and one accountant and an assistant accountan for
the PCAU would be appoined.
4.17  Implementation of the Charcoal Component. This component would involve two insttions: the
DGEH (MEAP ) and the DGF (MINAGRI). The supply side would be handled by MINAGRI and the
demand side by YMITNRAPE. Specificaly, (i) the PCAU would be responsible for the overall coordination
between MINITRAPE and MINAGRI through their respective PIUs; (ii) data collection on the avaability
of rsources would be managed by MINAGRI, (iii) demand projections would be prepared by MINrrRAPE
for the wood-energy side and by MINAGRI for the non-energy side (construction wood, pole wood, etc).
Preparation and implementation of village wood management plans would be handled by MINAGRI, with

assistance from MINJTRAPE through Its Programme Special Energ. Modernizaon of the charcoaling
sector including levying a tax on charcoal transport, as wel as protion and sensitzation campaigns to
increase the competitiveness of pinewood with eucalyptus wood is MlNAGRl's responsibility. This would
require a change in the exisng Forestry Law as this presently excludes taxation on the transport of charcoal.
Ihe draft changes affecting two articles of the Law which have been prepared by consultant was discussed
and agreed upon at negotiations. Implemeon of the Ministerial Decree promulgating the new taxation
on charcoal transport, including its collection, allocation through the National Forestry Fund (NFF) would
be a condition of Credit effectiveness. Anmex 1.8 provides detais of the new taxation system.
4.18  Implementation of the strategy for the Solar Home stm  Comnonent. This component would
mainly assist the Government in creating a solar energy policy and help the private sector develop a better
strategy to commercialize SHS. MINITRAPE would coordinate the studies through a PIU, and G02, which
already has a "Programme Special Energie' in place within MINTRAPE, would also be involved in the
Implementation of this component.
4.19 Implementation of the Lake Kivu's Methane Gas Development Component. Monitoring of
environmental risks and of studies would be organized and coordinated by MINITRAPE through SOCIGAZ.
4.20   mementaton of the Petroleum Pouct Copne. MICOMART would be responsible for the
implementation of this component.
4.21  Impementon of tb Power Subserm          nt Engineering, rehbilitation and extension of the
distribution network and rehabilitation of the power substations and transmission notwork would be executed
by foreign or local companies. The SNP would be responsible for the supervision of all these works.
responsibility of the SPE in ensuring compliance of these works with norms including the cost implications
would be clarified In the con    amrrngements between the two parties.
F. 
.Procrnen,
4.22 A summary of procurement methods is presented below in Table 4.2. Since the leasing out of
ELECIROGAZ' operations to a private opar is akin to contracting specialized services, it was deemed
necessary to ensure prior to bidding that only qualified potential contractors be invited to bid. Consequently,
a pre-qualification process was agreed upon with the government. The related documents have been
completed and were advertised in July 1992 through the proper channels. The future private operator would
be selected among the prequalified firms. Four utility operators have submitted their proposals for
prequalification: Sogea-Denys (France), Tractebel (Belgique), Saur-Afrique/ Hydro Quebec International
(France and Canada), and Imatra Voima Oy-Ekono Energy (Finland). The only parameter to be taken into
account would be the LCR, exclusive of taxes and customs duties, that the SPE would retain on each kilowatt
hour of electricity and cubic meter of water biUled and collected. The studies for the rehabilitation and
xctension of the distribution networks for the five cities and to restructure ELECIROGAZ were financed
under the PPF advance for the proposed project
4.23  Internional competitive bidding (ICB) would be used to procure equipment for the rehabilitation and
extension of the distribution networks and for the upgrading of service connections. Aeral survey, photo
interpretation and map printg, all related to the charcoal program would also be procured through ICB for
a total amount of US$350,000. For the distribution rehabilitation works, local competitive bidding would

be used. It has been agreed that the works for upgrading the service connections, which wil have a
potentially-large impact on commercial operations and thus on the financial performance of the selected
private operator, should be procured through LCB and executed by contractors ur4er the supervision of the
SPE (the Socit Privee d'Exploitation) under conditions satisfactory to the Bank. These would be included
in the lease contract. IDA financing for these works will not exceed US$250,000. LCB would also be used
for purchasing of vehicles, office furniture and equipment, and computers pertaining to the charcoal program
for a maximum amount of US$270,000. Spare parts for existing power plants and power stations would be
purdhased directly from the original mnufacurers for a total amount of US$2.61 milion. Laboratory
equipment for the monitoring of Lake Kivu, as well as equipment to repair and modemize the fuel depots
would be procured through prudent shopping (minimum of 3 price quotations from at least 2 different
countries), for a maximum of US$440,000. The financing of scholarships for ur students to be trained at
the Ecole Superieure Interafricaine d'Electricite in COte-d'voire would also be treated as direct contractng.
All consulting and other services would be procured in accordance with World Bank guidelines. All
ivations to bid, proposed awards and final conts esmatd to cost the equivaent of US$100,000 or
more will be subject to prior IDA reviews. In aU cases, the Bank's sample bid documents will be used.
4.24 All procurement for items not financed by IIDA will be carried out accrding to the guidelines of the
respective financing agencies, which would involve competitive bidding.

4.25   Adyce proluement  d Mr              ficnaning.  Out of the proposed Credit, the Govnmen has
proposed to use up to US$1.3 millon (or 5% of the total IMA Credit) for advance procurement and
retroacdve fiancing of eseni  consulting services for preparg the contract   agreements of SNP and
SPE. Such advance pocureme  Is necessary to continue the restructring of the utility in antcipation of its
privation. I would avoid creaig a gap between the finmcing of restuctring effrts and disb
for the credit. Alternatives sources of financing are not available. All retroactve finacing is expected to
be within the maximm perod of twelve months startng from August 31, 1992.
G.    Flgandng Plan
4.26 The proposed IDA Credit of US$26 million will finance about 67% of the estimated project cost of
US$38.95 million and 73% of the foreign currency expenses of the project (US$33.09 million). Table 4.3
summrizes the financing plan for which further detail Is provided in Annem 4.3. IDA will also provide
US$1.69 million for incremental local costs. The local project costs represent about US$5.86 million. The
CCCE will provide the equivalent of US$2.71 million of which about 1.63 million will finance severance
payments and the rest will be used for the upgrading of water connections, both as part of the institutional
reform program. EIB has been requested to finance the equivalent of US$7.92 million for improvemens in
transmission and hydro plants ovehals. The Government will provide the equivalent of US$2.32 million.
Confirmation of the project financing plan would be a condition of Credit effectiveness.
4.27 The Govenmet would onlend to ELECIROGAZ up to US$13.44 million of the proceeds of the
proposed Credit at IBRD rate plus 1 % commission, for a period of 25 yeas, including a 5-year grace period.
The Government would assume the foreign exchange risk. The indicated amount corresponds to the total IDA
Credit for physical invesments in the power subsector. A conact acceptable to the Bank would be signed
as a condition of Credit effectiveness.

4.28 The proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed over 6 years, which closely corresponds
to the standard Disbursement Profiles for the Africa Region (An     4.S, and constiutes an improvement as
compared to disbursements under Credit 1495-RW, mainly due to involvement of the private operator. Ihe
closing date would be December 31, 1998. 'Me disbursement schedule presented in Table 4.4 below has been
derived from the project implementation schedule provided in Anne 4.. The IDA Credit will finace 100%
of foreign expenditures for equipment, materis and vehicles. Consuting services, technical assistance and
training would be disbursed against 100% of foreign expenses and 90% of local expenditures. Civil worls
disbursements would be made against 100% of foreign expendiures and 90% of local expenditures.

contracts of less than US$25,000. All other disbursements would be filly documented. The Project
Administrion and Coordination Unit within MINiTRAPE would be responsible for record keeping and the
safeguard of documents, which would be made avalble for review by IDA supervision missions. The anna

4.30 The proposed project would require careful coordination and frequent IDA supervision, particularly
in the initia years of its implemenion. Progress reports will be submitted to IDA and cofinanciers every
three months. Ihe strucure of these reports was finalized during negotiations. An annual review of the
implementation of all aspects of the proposed project, including achievement of agreed financial objectives
would be undertaken by the SNP, the Government, IDA and cofianciers. The proposed supervision plan
is detailed in Annex 4.6 and IDA supervision input into key activities is given in Annex 4.7. Preparation
of a project completion report not later than six months after project completion as well as of a mid-term
review to be undertaken by the Government and IDA by June 30, 1995, taking into consideration, among
others, net production (GWh), power available for sales, billing (ecentage of power available for sale),
client-account expressed in days of sales (non governmental), purchase of electricity, number of clients per
employee, net operatng coefficient, self financing ratio, service quality including the quality of voltage and
number of interruptions and average interruption per client, and standards of drinkability of water, as fixed
by the World Health Organization.

4.31   Rationalization of the Urban Charal &uply. The agoreotr activity as well as wood use
management plans Included In this component are specifically designed to counter environmental problems
such as deforestation and soil degradation resuldng from over-cutting of trees. Improved carbonization
techniques and charcoal stoves would reduce the demand for woodfuel. Since charcoal is the major urban
fuel which will increase in importance with increasing urbanization, it must be ensured that its production
is done in a sustainable manner. These activities would provide a better grasp on existfng wood resources,
allow to monitor their evolution, so as to prevent ecological disasters from taking place.
4.32    Sttgy for Solar Home 3$=  l)welaM=. There are no environmental risks involved with this
activity. On the contrary, if solr home systems replace thermal electricity or kerosene for lightning, less
CO2 will be emitted and this would reduce the contribution to the greenhouse effect.
4.33 Lake Kivu Methane Gas Development. A study financed by the European Community (EC) in 1988
on the production and environmental impact of gas methane, as well as studies financed by the Belgians and
the Canadians concluded that () there is no relation between the gas extrcion and a possible volcanic
erupdtion, (fi) it is possible to extract between 50 and 150 million N m3 per year without risk of depleting the
gas deposit, (iii) this level of gas production would not result in a risk of a gas eruption like the one that
occurred at Lake Nyos in Cameroun in 1986 and (iv) dtht the staification of the waters in Lake Kivu, which
is stable, would still be protected widi a production not exceeding 500 million N m3 per year, providing the
production increase in a series of steps and detailed scientific measurements are taken step by step. In
addition, both methane gas and carbon dioxide are presendy naturally escaping to the atmosphere. Since they
both are * Green House" gases in that they capture the sun's heat, the ultimate end-effect of gas development
will be to trap some of the methane and burn it, thereby converting it to carbon dioxide and water. Since
methane is approximately 70 times more potent to capture heat than CO2, the reduction of methane emissions
will therefore lower the negative environmental impact. Finally, as it is possible that volcanicttectonic
activity in the region of Lake Xivu could contribute to gas eruptions in the future at the Lake, irrespective
of gas extraction, the proposed project would finance a set of measures to monitor the chemistry of dissolved
gases and the volcanic activity around the Lake. The EC study also recommended that a modular approach
be udlized for the production of methane gas from Lake Kivu. This approach will allow technical lnowledge
to be gained at each stage of development and result in a mininmm of environmental risk. All these are being
detailed in the environmenta issues paper and midgation plan which are available in the Project File.
4.34 Additional measures to be taken under the proposed project include (i) incorporation of an
examination by the Government of any potenti riparian issues in all the terms of reference for surveys and
studies on future development of Lake Kivu's methane gas, and (i) provison of a map indicating the
international waterway and location of the sites to be studied. The authorization of the Government of Zaire
to fly over its section of Lake Kivu has been received.

5.2 ELEC TROGAZ's revenues firom the sales of electricity, water and gas rose from RWF 1,409 mfillion
in 1988 to RWF 1,535, RWF 1,702 and RWF 2,277 million in 1989, 1990, and 1991 respectively,
representing 9% increase in 1989, 10.8% in 1990 and 33.8% in 1991. Except for 1991, these increases are
rather small when compared to those of operating expenses (excluding provisions for exchange losses), which
rose by 32% in 1989 and 19% in 1990. Other revenues, including subsidy (for about 40% of the total) and
revenues from connections remained almost constant over the period 1988-1990, but declined by about 50%
in 1991. The poor performance of revemnes is primarily due to nadequate tariff and improper connection
policies associated with insufficient supply and lack of materials to meet the fast-rowing demand, but poor
billing and collection practices have also been a major contrbuting factor.
5.3     Opeting expenses (excluding depreciation) rose from RWF 1,161 milion in 1988 to RWF 2,049
milion in 1991, which represent an increase of 77%. Purases of electcity from Ruzizi I (SNEL of Zair4)
and Ruzizi I (SINELAC) reprented 2.5%, 6.2%, 15% and 25% of opetg revenues in 1988, 1989, 1990
and 1991 respectively, thus confming the critical dependence of the country on extr    sources for its
power needs, as shown in the power and energy balance given in Amne 1.2. Depreciation increased from
RWF 863 million in 1988 to RWF 1,549 mIllion in 1991, which corresponds to an increase of 79%, while
exhange losses (calculated as required by accounting princples) have gone up from a zero value in 1988 to
RWF 173 million in 1989 and RWF 5,236 million in 1990. Interests were multiplied by a factor of about
6, increasing from RWF 120 million in 1988 to RWF 711 mIllion in 1991, as a resut of maurity of new

debt. Amex 5.5 provides deaails of ELECIROGAZ' debt situation. Increasing dependence on SINELAC
and SNEL to meet ithe fastgowing electricity needs of tie country, ELECrROGAZ' inability to Implement
a comprehensive cost reduction plan, excessive capital investments, inrdinate borrowing coupled withi the
recent devaluatioDs of the Rwandese franc have brought total expenses to levels Incompatible with revenues.
As a result, ELECTROGAZ' losses went up from RWF 56 million in 1988, to RWF 791 million in 1989,
RWF 6,310 million In 1990 and to RWF 1,700 In 1991. As Indicated In Table 5.1 above, depreciion plus
interest expenses and exchange losses represented about 45% of tot revenues in 1988, 77% in 1989 and 3
times the total revenues for 1990. During the same period, the respective operating ratios (excluding
exchange losses) were 99, 127, 140 and 165. Without concrete actions on all expense items, the utility's
overall performance cannot Improve.
5.4   The rates of return on net revalued fixed assets (excluding the exchange losses) fel1 from a positive
value of 0.13% in 1988 to -4% in 1989, -6% in 1990 and -9.6% in 1991, which are far below the 1.4%
established In the agreements of CRI 1495-RW. The debt service ratios fell from a positive value of 0.8 in
1988, to -0.5 in 1989, -0.6 in 1990, and to -1.2 in 1991, which indicates that the company is unable to
service its ineasingly heavy debts. The curret ratio declined, moving from 1.3 in 1988, to 1.16 in 1989,
1.06 in 1990 and to 0.63 in 1991, thus reflecting the excessive level of receivables fbr the sales of electricity
and water, with an average of 12 months of billing as of December 31, 1991, or 32 months for Central
Government receivables and 6 months for private consumers, as shown in Table 5.2.
fnancial Restructuring
5.5   ELECTROGAZ' balance sheets for 1988, 1989 and 1990 are summarzed in Table 5.2. The capital
stucture has been deteriorating. Its debtequity ratios were 0.92, 0.73 and 2.42 in 1988, in 1989 and 1990
respectively. Accunmlated earnings (pwrofits or losses), which were positive in 1988, totaing RWF 455
million, declined to -RWF 336 milion in 1989, to - RWF 6,646 million In 1990 and - RWF 8,346 million
in 1991. However, total equity remained positive during the same period, even though falling from RWF
12,196 million in 1989 to RWF 6,125 million in 1990 and RWF 4,095 mion In 1991. The sharp downfall
experienced In 1990 is primaily due to the devaluaton of the Rwandese franc. bisitatio will continue
to deteriorate as most of past debts contracted in foreign currencies arrived at maturity in 1991.
ELECTROGAZ therefiore needs to be recapitalized. A capital restructuring package for the SNP would be
prepared by the Government with assistance from a consultant. During negodations, the Government has
agreed to use the balance of co  on of cross-debts with ELECROGAZ as 1ts contribution to
recapitalize the SNP without any cash outlays as explained in para 5.13. Progress in the implementation of
this measure will be assessed before the private operator is in place.

ELECITROGAZ' Past and Present Debts
5.6    String in 1988, ELECTROGAZ failed to service its debt obligations vis-&-vis the Government. As
of December 31, 1991, the oustanding short-term and long-term debts amounted to RWF 3.7 billion and to
RWF 14.9 billion respectively. Ihis siion, as confirmed by consultants in the study on ELECTROGAZ
restructing, stems from inordinate borrowings and excessive capital investments in the past, coupled with
the devaluations of the Rwandese Franc as mentioned in para. 5.3. The study also highlighted among others,
the impact of two IDA-finced projectsl. As shown in Amex 5.7 onlending rates and repayment periods,
which follow the policy of each donor, ranged from 2% to 6%, and between 25 and 50 years respectively,
for all other cofinanciers imvolved in the electriity and water sectors, whers IDA rates were 10% for
electricity and 10.97% for water, with 20 years repayment periods. As a result, these IDA-financed projects
represented about 48% of the tota outstanding debts of the utility, and contributed in debt obligations
including exdcange losses for about 60%. The study however concluded that, with the restucturng measures
to be implemented under the proposed project, inluding a s faory investmet program (pm. 1.34), the
recapitalization of the SNP (para. 5.5), the finanal objectives (para. 5.7), the tariff action plan (para. 5.8),
the governent cotribution. to wat  tariff (paras. 5.11), and the olending terms and conditions of the
proposed project (at the prevailing IBRD rate plus 1% commission, with 25 year repayment period including
a grace period of 5 years and provided that the Government bear the foreign exchange risk), ELECTROGAZ
would become a financially-sound institution capable to service its past and future debt obligations.
Nevertheless, there is a need to consolidate and harmonize the onlending terms and conditions of past IDA-

Financial Objectives
5.7    To improve the financial situation of the sector and based on the proposed tariff increases, agreement
was reached with the Government at negotiations for the implementation of the following objectives:
(i) average electricity and water tariffs were raised by 15% in January 15, 1993, and would be
raised by another 15% in April 15, 1993, with both increases included in one decree that was
issued in January 11, 1993; the April 15 increase would be a condition of Credit effectiveness;
these levels would be sufficient to remunerate the SPE, purchase energy and fuel, and cover
about 46% of the SNP's depreciation;
(ii) average electricity tariffs would be raised, effective October 1, 1993, by at least 10% in real
terms with the objective of reaching the LRMC in a phased manner by the mid-term review in
June 30 1995'2. these levels would be sufficient to remunerate the SPE, purchase energy and
fuel, cover the SNP's opatig exenses, service its fAll debt obligations; the SNP is required
to ean an after tax rate of return on revalued net fixed assets of 2.47% in 1993, and 5.27% in
1994; average water trfs would be raised by 8%, effective also October 1, 1993 and by 7.5%
each year thereafter until December 31, 1998, so as to graduaUly transfer the financial burden
of sectoral debt service and development onto the consumers;
(lii) average tariffs would be raised, effective June 30, 1995; for electricity, by a percntage that has
to be determined as described above, so as to catch up with the LRMC, and for water by 7.5%
subject to change upon completion of ongoing studies on the investment program for the water
sector; the SNP is required to earn an after tax rate of return on revalued net fixed assets of 6%
and thereafter;
Civ) the SNP would maintain a debt service ratio of at least 1.5 and not incur any debt unless
forecasts show that the debt service coverage ratio in all succeeding years will be at least 1.5.
Tariff Acdn
5.8   The agreed tariff increases are given in Table 5.3 below. To achieve the objectives mentioned in the
previous paragraph, during negotations, agrement was obtained from the Government that, except for small
domesticconsumers using up to 40kWhlmonth:
(i) taiffs be maintined at such levels as would provide to the asset holding company revenues
necessary to meet the objecdves in para. 5.7;
Ci) the electdcity and water tariffs be automaticaUy adjusted to take into account changes in the rate
of exchage between the Rwandese franc and the US$, in price of purchasing electricity from
SINELAC and in salaries (using the formla as defined in Annes 5.); and
1I aInyc ae, th final nc_se would not b less than what is needed to meet th fifl ate for electricity
bwifs, as defined in puam 2.28.

(ilb) an annual report on the adequacy of tariffs to meet the objectives in para 5.7 be prepared and
be submitted by December 31 each year to the Government and to IDA for review and action.

This 49.5X increase consists of two 15% average fncreases in January 15 and April 15  1993, and of 8 13%
In October 1993. After that, the Government has agreed that each annual increase would be at least 10X,
so as to reach the LRNC in a phased nmaner by June 30, 1995, but has retained the flexibility to decide on
the actual size of the three annual Increases; in this report, a uniform 15% increase has, therefore, been
used from 1993 to 1995;

from SIVELAC or In salaries, would require appropriate tariff adjustments, so as to prevent adverse effects

rk£ES Billing and Revenues Collecton
5.9     The bale  on receivables for 1989, 1990 and 1991 is presented In Table 5.4. Receivables from the
private sector amounted in December 1990 to 52% of the total and rqed 7 months of sales with a
collection rate of 60%.  At the end of Decmber 1991, paymens received from  the private consumers
resulted in reducing its arrears to 6 months of sales, which is still high as compared to the agreed upon 60
days after the recepton of the bill. The Government's arrears as of December 31, 1990, were equivalent
to 29 months of billing, with a collection rate of 11% in 1990.        hsituation is ptimarily due to ihe budget
allocation process which allows MMINIRAPE to manage and pay for electricity and water bills of most of
the Public Offices and Government's agencies. As a resut, the amount allocated by hMNITRAPE to each
ministry, which is already insuffcient to pay for the actual electricity and water bills, is used by the ministries
to finance other expense items, leaving ELECTROGAZ with excessive arrears. For 1991, the allocated
budget fbr electricity and water consumption of this category of consumers totalled RWF 210 million which
is very low as compared to the actal consumption bills of RWF 345 million, with RWF 120 million
colected.

5.10 Tbe cross-debts between the Government and ELECTROGAZ (about RWF 1.7 billion in favor of
Government by the end of 1991) were compensated13 as of November 30, 1992. During negotiations,
agreement was obtained that: (i) stardng from January 1993, each government agency and ministry shall be
made responsible for the cost of its electricity and water consumption and shall implement an action plan to
reduce consumption; (ii) their annual budget allocations shall include sufficient provision to cover the cost
of their electricity and water consumption and would be determined by October 31 each year for the following
year; (iii) systematic power cut-off to government agencies in arreas would be implemented by March 31,
1993; and (iv) all their future bills shall be paid within 60 days of sales from presentation in accordance with
agreed administrative procedures. Such procedures were agreed upon at negotiations, and include the
establishment (tied upon the hiring of the private operator) by the Government of an escrow account in a local
commercial bank acceptable to IDA, where the budget allocation for electricity and water consumption of
government agencies and ministries would be deposited each year. In this connection, the Government has
agreed during negotiations to make, no later than November 30, 1993, an initial deposit of RWF 500 mi2lion,
to be used for the payment of the 1994 electricity and water bills of the Government's ministries and
agencies. For private customers, it was also agreed tiat: (i) reduction of the average age of receivables to
60 days of sales from presentation of biUs by March 31, 1993; and (ii) power cuts for customers with arrears
over these targets.

5.12 With the actions mentioned earlier (paras. S.S - 5.8 and S.10), net income of the SNP becomes
positive in 1994, and increase to RWF 1,148 million in 1997. All operating expenses, including inerest
payments are covered by revenues in 1994. Improvements in management and operational efficiency through
the Lease Contract, satisfactory Investment progms, adequa  electricity and water tariffs as well as the
fizncial restructuring package are expected to bring the successor of ELECTROGAZ, the SNP, back to full
financial viability. At negotiatons, agrement was reached that: before the end of November in each year,
the Government and the SNP will review with the Bank the financil projections of the latter, and agree on
measures to achieve the targeted indicators, including tariff adjustment. Key performance indicators for the
SNP are provided in Annex 4.1 1.
Project Im at on Go-vernment Finances
5.13 Given the country's precarious fisca situation, particular attention has been paid to the project impact
on Government finances. As shown in Table S.6 below, and further detailed in Annexes S.65.7, the
resulting impact of the proposed project on Government finances, in terms of financial inflows and oudlows,
Is about RWF 2.1 billion in favor of the Government. On one hand, the Government will receive about RWF
3.33 billion (RWF 24 billion) in tax payment on net income from the SNP and SPE over the period of 1993-
1998. On the other, its contbution to water tariff and its counterpart funding as cofinancier represent about
RWF 1,220.8 million (US$8,72 million) and correspond to 0.60% of the 1992 projected GDP. The financial
impact over six years is as follows: -RWF 224.3 million in 1993, +RWF 47.8 million in 1994, +RWF
2S4.5 million in 199S, +RWF 477.7 million in 1996, +RWF 455.4 million in 1997 and +RWF 1,104.4
million in 1998. For the remaining balance of the compeation of cross-debts between ELECTROGAZ and
Goverunent (about RWF 1.7 billion as of December 31, 1991), which mainly corresponds to outsanding
current liabilities owed by ELECTROGAZ to Goverment, it would be used to recapitalize ELECIROGAZ
or its succeor, and would involve no cash outlays from the Government. The Government equity
contribution to the capital of the private operating company (RWF 145 million, or 20% of the capital of the
SPE estimated by consultant at US$5 million) would take the form of assignments of some of the main
buildings presently used by ELECrROGAZ with no financial flow.

VI, PROT= XLEWrAl7ON BENEFITS AND RIM}
Justificaton
6.1   Following the 1992 UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Asment Report, the proposed project is
the first comprehensive atemt to address the spectum of problems In the sector as highlighte in this report.
Specifically, it is an important extension to and deepening of the Govnment's ongoing public enteprise
reform program as it includes fundamental changes to the strucure and management of the country's major
public utlity. The project will also extend electricity supply in Rwanda's five main urban centers in a lower-
cost manner than in the past, make it accessible to a larger proportion of the populatioz4 through a more
appropriate tariff structre and reduce the drain on the aional budget caused by ELECMROGAZ's poor
financial management in the past. IDA's involvement and assistance through this project will help the
Government and ELECTROGAZ to effectively carry out the required nsuional reforms and build up the
management capabilities that are needed to restore adequate and reliable supply of electricity.
6.2   The proposed project addresses important environmental concerns. An esimated 90% of wood
production in Rwanda is for domestic energy consumption in the form of woodfuel and charcoal. Charcoal,
which is resource-intensive in production as well as in use, is to a significant extent responsible for the
deforestation and wood depletion that have taken place in certain parts of the country. High population
density and dependence on woodfuels for energy needs are determig factors. Through the Improved
carbonization techniques, the design and implementation of a wooduse management plan at the village level,
the proposed project would contribute to substantially reduce the negative effects on the enAronment of the
necessary wood use and charcoal consumption.
6.3   For elecrcity, the proposed project includes the bulk of ELECTROGAZ's instments in generaon,
nsmission and distrbution over the period 1993-97. All components of the program have been reviewed
to ensure that they meet least-cost critera. Rehabiton of generaion and transmission facilities is justified
as it will prolong their operational life and no cheaper alternative exists. Concerning distribution facilities,
their design, which would lead to subsatial cost reduction as compared to the existg installations, has been
done along the lines of least-cost technical alternatives, proposed by the consultant, agreed by ELECrROGAZ
and found acceptable during appraW. Only new hydro plants to be developed with Rwanda's neighbors and
some rural electrification programs that are presently under consideration have not been considered as part
of ELECrROGAZ's program.
6.4 In the economic analysis of the electricity component of the proposed project (details are given in
Annex 6,1 , the main quanifiable benefits taken into account are the increased sales of electricity and the
reduction in losses obtained. The sales are based on a recent load forecast and are projected to rise by an
anmnal average of 8.4%. They have been valued at US$0.12ikWh, taken as an average of the social tariff
of RWF 10.00/kWh, and the esfimated long-run margina cost RWF 20/kWh, weighted by the respective
percentage of total co1SUmption to which they are applied. Such a tariff covers the SDRD.05 tariff of
SINELAC. Using this minimum value for the benefits from the project, the reslting internal economic rate

of return (ERR) on this component is 19%. In the event that investment costs were 10% higher than
projected, and sales growth was 6% p.a., the IERR would fall to 10%. If sales growth was to average only
6% p.a. as a result of 10% higher tariffs, the resulting [ERR is 15%. On the other hand, if load growth
remains at 8.4% despite average tariffs 10% higher than projected, the [ERR would go up to 24%. With
8.4% load growth and investment costs 10% higher than projected, the [ERR is 17%. In the event of a 2-
year delay, with investment costs 10% higher than projected, in spite of 8.4% load growth, the IERR would
fall to 10%.
6.5   The [ERR and net present value for the extension of distribution network in each of the five cities
are as follows: for Kigali, 36% and US$3.75 milion; for Butare, 23% and US$69,950; for Ruhengeri, 13 %
and US$570,700; for Gisenyi, 14% and US$351,910; and for Nyabisindu, 12% and US$156,710. 'Me
average consumption per comumer has been calculated as the average weighted demand for two categories
of consumers: those using up to 400 kWh per year, which form about 48% of the total number of consumers,
and those using up to 3,500 kWh per year, which constitute 40% of the total number of consumers. The
sales have been valued using an average tariff of US$0.12, as defined above. The detail of the cost/benefit
as well as the sensitivity analysis is provided in Annex 6.1.
6.6   The physical rlsks of the proposed project are minimal because rehabilitation work in tansmission
and distibution network is routine and would be carried out under well-known conditions. The other risks
are mainly of managerial and institutional nature and include: the difficulty of finding a private operator
willing to take over ELECIROGAZ' operations, possible government interference in day-to-day management
of the utility, its non-observance of the lease contract, its failure to promptly setde its bills, its reluctance to
set an approprite tariff policy for electricity and water, and the effective implemention of a long-term,
stable corporate culture. The Governmene's recent track record with imple     difficult decisions to
create an enabling environment for the path of reforms suggests that the risk of not taking necessary measures
to ensure appropriate energy pricing policy is low. Planning for the restructuring of ELECrROGAZ has
been the subject of a long-standing and intensive dialogue and preparation, and it is unlikely that it would
back track on it at this stage. ITe institutional component has been designed with maximum effort to prepare
the path for priovatzon of the utility and improvement of the regulatory framework. Furthermore, up-front
measures including a major staff reduction plan before the private operator is in place, and key commercially-
oriented principles to be embodied in the utility revised Law and stattes, as well as the program for
implementation of fnancial and capacity-building reforms, would substantially reduce these risks.
6.7    The risk of delays and cost increases caused by slowness in approving contacts and disbursements
would be mitigated by the retention of a private operator and competent consultans to assist ELTROGAZ
in successfully carrying out the implementation of the proposed project. The phasing of the project and the
requirment to achieve measurable progress on privatization before disbursement of most of project physical
components would also reduce this risl. For the charcoal component, implementation of wood use
management plans at the village levels and adoption of more efficient carbonization techniques, adverising
campaigns for rationale charcoal consumption and promotion of the use of pinewood, will be carefully
deigned and monitored with a view to achieving effective sensitization of targeted groups.

REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
1EERGY SEIR  REHIIJTATIN    P
Kigali, November 5, 1992
DRAFT LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR THE ENERGY SECTOR
I. Makdrond
EMomic nolicv of oene
The Rwandese Government has adopted the economic reform program detailed in the
Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for 1991-93 to resolve the serious economic and finacial problems
besettg the country. The basic macroeconomic objciare an early return to a viable external
and domestic financial positiontogether with accomplishment of sustinable economic growth strategy
with low inflation. Ihis new strategy represents a definite move away from the policy of the 1980s,
as it places the emphasis on recourse to market forces and private sector and is more export-oriented.
The key objectives of the program are to reestablish economic growth of some 4% between now and
1993 and to bring inflon down to 5% p.a. by the same year, while ensuring a certain stability as
regards the budget and balance of payments. To achieve these objectives, the program aims to:
(i) create a climate conducive to private sector activity and international competitiveness; (ii) improve
and rationalize public sector management; (iii) develop the human resource base; and (iv) improve
natural resource management. To promote participation of the private sector in the economy, the
Government has decided to abolish price control and to institute transparent, clear and simple
procedures for the establishment of enterprises.
In the energy sector, about 80% of the commercial energy used in Rwanda is
imported, reprsentg  on average 18% of goods imports during the period 1983-87. Domestic prices
of oil products during the 1980s were appreciably above international levels. On the other hand,
lectricity tariffs remained unchanged from 1981 to 1988, where they were reduced by 14%. At the
end of 1990, tar  for household consumption represented 33% of the long-term marginal cost. The
electricity system is not well maintained and is run by a public corporation, ELECTROGAZ, which
is charrized by excessive government intervention, poor management and a rapidly deteriorating
financial position. To address ELECTROGAZ's problems, a new law on legal and Institonal
frmwork for Public Enterprises - the draft of which and Is ona Reform of Public Enterprises
was adopted by the Council of Ministers during its sessions that took place between December 4 and
10, 1992. This draft was sent to the Parliament on December 15, 1992 and will be published and



- 47 -
ANNEX LI
Page 2 of 11
Implemented no later than the end of June 1993. Under this new law, ELECrROGAZ, now a public
establishment, will become a national corporation.
The prices of oil products were raised by 79% in November 1990. Ihis has brought
the current retai price of gasoline up to US$1 per liter in Kigali. This increase, a preliminary
measure taken in the context of the structural adjustment program, has provided a strong incentive
for energy savings and has helped to ease the Government's budgetary problems. As regards rate
setting for electricity, the objective is to align rates on the respective long-term marginal costs and
to restore the financial position of ELECrROGAZ, which has been the subject of a detailed analysis
as part of the Public Enterprises Reform Project finaced by IDA. New electricity tariffs were
brought into effect as of July 1, 1991, and consultants are currently finalizing a least-cost master plan
that will include revised estimates of long-term marginal cost and establishment of an appropriat
tariff structure. Once this master plan is completed in Jamuary 1993, a new tariff structure
(compatible with the long-term marginal cost) will be prepared and adopted within the context of
actions envisioned in the electricity subsector. To ensure that this public enterprise reform produces
the desired results, ELECrROGAZ will conclude a lease contract with a private operator under
which it wiUl retain ownership of Its assets but the specialized professional partner will be entitled to
use them and will be responsible for generation, transmission, distribution, maintenance, billing and
collection in a way that will ensure enhanced efficiency, while applying an effective and coherent
reform policy. Assistance in implementing this reform in the energy sector will be provided by the
Government, IDA, the Caisse Centrale de Cooperatlon Economique and the European Investment
Bank for about US$38.95 million through the Energy Sector Rehabilitation Project (ESRP).
EL BUM  balance/Overall gm=  consutlon
In 1991, Rwanda consumed 1.4 million tons of oil equivalent (toe), takdng all energy
sources together. Biomasa (wood and wood products, agricultural residues) accounts for 93 % of all
en        consumption, oil products 5%, and electricity 1%.  In terms of commercial energy
consumption (oil products, all imported; electricity, half of which is imported; charcoal, produced
locally; wood, used in the institutional sector and in industries), it is apparent that per capita net
anmnal consumptn, of the order of 0.011 toe, is among the lowest in the world. To place the
energy flows in a fully controlled conext, the Government has undertaken priority studies focusing
on:
-     consolidation of the energy database
-     devising of an oil product supply strategy
-     the master plan for electrification of Rwanda by the year 2010
-     the peat development master plan.
M. Sector oblectves
The Government's key objectives are to: better utilize the energy resources, enlarging
the population's access to more energy and rationalize the nmagement of the sector as a whole, in
order to promote socioeconomic development while ensuring protection of the eaviroment. To



- 48 -
Page 3 of 11
accomplish these objectives, the Government, in close   peation with the donors, will spare no
effort to respond to the challenges of the energy secor and initate all actions needed to:
*     adopt least-cost solutions as rgads investment;
*     strengthen regional cooperation;
*     diversilfy accessible energy sources;
*     make rational use of energy sources;
*     create and maintain an environmet that fosters privat-sector involvement and is
better suited to euring good service quality wegeneraag the fiancia resources
esentil for rapid development of the sector;
*     identify basic energy needs in order todirect demand toward ener   sources tat are
more accessible and whose Impact on the environment is controllable;
*     reconstitte and conserve the forest cover whle Imving the efficiency of wood,
charcoal production and consmption;
*     improve the efficiency of power generation and water production;
e     strengthen the sector institutions, including ELECTROGAZ;
*     establish appropriate tariffs for electricity, water and gas; and
t     promote rational pricing for wood, charcoal and oil products while at the same time
lessening the imp3act of their use on the environment.
IV. Subsector Situadon
A. E1Wtecrct
(i)                       demand forecasts
Almost all dectricity consumed in Rwanda is hydroelectric in origin. Over the period
1980-90, electrical energy consumption rose from 57 GWh to 149 GWh, i.e. an average growth rate
of 10% per year. Low-voltage sales make up more than 50% of total sales. System losses in 1991
were about 14%. Kigali and its environs absorb nearly 60% of this energy.
In 1991, the system's peak demand was 37.3 MW whereas ELECTROGAZ's Instlled
capacity is only 26.5 MW. More than half of the country's electricity requirements are met by
purchasing from SINELAC (the regional power company) and from SNEL (Zaire).



- 49 -
ANEX 1.1
Page 4 of 11
The number of users (25,639 as of the end of 1991) grew steadily over the period
1980-90 by 16% per year. Nevertheless, 98% of the populadon is still without access to this energy
source. The major obstacles to an intsified electrdfication policy are the unit cost of connections,
which represents several months income for many potenta clients, and the fact that homes tend to
be scattered in Rwanda, while the low household incomes mean that people have difficulty paying
their bills.
For the period 1992-2000, demand for electricity is epected to rise at an average
annual rate of 8.4%. Between now and 1995, it will only be possible to satisfy the additional energy
needs, in part, by stepping up SINELAC's generating capacity, since Rwanda is entited to one third
of its output. Under these circumstances, a sizable shortfall, of the order of 30-40 GWh/year, is to
be feared in power supply in the system, even if for subsequent years Rwanda were to benefit from
a part of the Rusumo Falls plant's generation (60 MW and 400 GWh), an OBK regional project for
which detailed designs are already available. Financing for feasibility stdies would have to be raised
during a roundtable meeting of donors to be arranged during the first half of 1993. Higher demand
will require implementation of other plants (Nyabarongo and Ruzizi 3), the dates of entry into service
of which will be specified in the master plan now being finalized.
wmi)ent MS=
The energy sector investmet program for 1992-94 amounts to RWF 11.302 billion
(US$80.7 million) and includes the Energy Sector Railitation Project (ESRP) for which the
Rwandese Government has requested fimanci support from IDA and other donors. The share
earmarked for electricity represents about 67% of the global PIP for the energy sector. The energy
sector PPrepresents in turn 11% of the global PI for all sectors in Rwanda. The energy sector PIP
for the period 1993-95 conceranng which agreement was reached with IIDA during the ESRP
negotiations totals RWF 12.591 billion and comprises 17 projects, including the ESRP. The energy
sector PIP for 1993-95 is annexed to this letter. In order to ensure the sustainbility of the
investments in the energy sector, the Government has decided to adopt a much more rational method
than in the past for selecting investments for inclusion in the PIP. The selection criteria will
henceforward be based on: (i) economic viability and justification (rate of return of at least 10%);
(ii) least cost for social projects; (ili) consistency with sectoral and maroeconomic objectives; and
(iv) sustainability. To this end, the Goverment will prepare no later tn November 30 of each
year, an annual report on public investments in the energy sector, and no later than December 31 of
each year, it will agree with IDA on a rolling three-year investment program for the sector. In
addition, for each new project undeaken in the energy sector involving capital expenditure in excess
of US$1 million, a declaration of no objection will have to be sought from IDA.
To remove the main constaints (ow energy autonomy, hydroelectric resources that
are abundant but dsared with neighboring countries, low cover-age rate, high imvestment costs) that
impede the sound functioning of the sector, the electrification projects adopted (rural electrification
and rehailitation of ELECTROGAZ) will aim at promoting electricity use in the productive sectors
and by households. The Rwandese Elecation Master Plan wil adjust the timetable for entry into
service of new projects for exeding power lines in rual areas and for expansion of power plants.

Up to te preset, the electriciq subsector has been run by the Etablissement Public
de Production, de Transport et de Distiution d'Electrlcit6, dTEau et de Gaz  LCTROGAZ),
which is responsible for managing the generation, production, transmission and distibution faciuites
for elecricity and ware under te technial supervision of MINITRAPE. Its fumction is to foresee
the execution of distribution projects, while INMinAPE has responsibility for design and
implementation of large projects. This division of responsibilities has not always been conducive to
optmum coordiation of the planning and execution of projects in the sector.
Like other public enterprises, ELECROGAZ has a large number of problems, some
of which derive from the nature of its relations with the Goverent. After a series of diagnostic
studies and extensive discussion of their conclusions and recom ons involving all the parties
concerned, including the donors, the Government has decided to embark upon a fimdamental reform
Of the secr's institutional structre.
(iv)    Proo    reforms
The solution adopted by the Govemnent on October 13, 1992 to resolve
ELECTROGAZ's problems involves splitting the corporation into two. In its place there wil be
estblished a national company responsible for actng as contracting autority and project manager
and for asset management, and a private operating company tha will take care of thnical and
commerial management and maintnance of aU subsector facilites.
The Governent has already ivited power and water companies to seek qualification
to participate in international bidding to run ELECTROGAZ's facilites under a lease contract.
(v)   Measures to be taken in the context of the ESRP
The Government intends to issue the call for bids on the lease contract before the end
of March 1993. This would make it possible to institute negotiations with the company selected
before the end of November 1993.
The draft law abolishing Decree Law 1876 of April 20, 1976, that established
ELECIROGAZ, was eamined and adopted by the Council of Misters duing its sessions that took
place between Deember 4 and 10, 1992. Ihis draft law was submitted to the Parliament on
December 15, 1992.
Significant rehilitation measur  will be deployed to put an end to the financial
crisi besettng ELECIROGAZ. The average electricity and water tariffs were raised by 15% in
January 15, 1992 and wLl be raised by an addional 15%, effective April 15 1993. These two
ireases were included in a single decree issued in December 11, 1992. At the same time, the
Gove=rm   took step to mitigate te impact of these meases on low-income consumers by
intrducing social coqsumption bracks of less ta 40 kWh/mouth or S mW/month for which tarif
wil reain unchanged at ther present levels. ELECROOAZ wil eamin the conditions under
which and the extent to which it would assume the connecdon costs for all new residendt  clienu,
tD facilitate access to water and electricity. In addiion, in order to bring tariffs into line wih the



- 51 -
ANNX 1. 1
Page 6 of 11
long-term marginal cost of electricity (calculated at about RWF 20/kWh) by June 30, 1993, further
increases will be necessary in 1993, 1994 and 1995.
Regarding billing for electricity service, the State and the public institutions are
currendy about 32 months behind in paying their bills. The Government has decided tihat fom now
on it will settle its bills within 60 days of re;eipt and will take all necessary steps to ensure that the
ministries and government agencies do the same. In addition, settlement of the cross between the
State and debts Stte/ELECTROGAZ were compensated effective November 30, 1992. As of
December 31, 1991, the balance of the State/ELECrROGAZ cross-debts, which stood at RF 1.707
biXlion in favor of the Government, was used as Government contribution to recapitalize
ELECTROGAZ.
At the same time, specia attention will be given to the retrahiing of present
ELECROGAZ personnel who will not be employed in either of the two companies to be formed.
ELECrROGAZ's target in reducing its personnel is to bring the muber down to 1,253 between now
and the end of April 1993.
B. Oil pdumta
oi   Present siatuo
In 1991, Rwanda consumed 66,000 tons of oil products, all imported from the East
Coast of Africa, which was more than 1.5 times its 1980 consumption. This represented about 80%
of the commercial energy consumed in Rwanda; nevertheless, the corsponding rate of consumption
(10 kg per capita/year) remains particularly low. It can be expected to rise over the medium term
due to the increase in traffic, the more so since three quarters of the products consumed are used for
transportation purposes. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the country's oil product supply
is vunerable because the cost of transportation from the ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam,
entirely overland (1,700 km), Is very high, being equivalent to the f.o.b. cost of the products
concned. Given dtat these imports, at about RF 4.2 billion (US$34 million in 1991), absorb over
two thirds of the couutry's export earings, Rwanda is in a most uncomrtable position in the oil
product market and this posiion could deteriorate as a result of high purchase prices and the
uncranty of the supply channels. At the same tme, Rwanda's oil product prices are among the
highest in the region, which is a direct consequence of an extremely complex price structure coupled
with very high taxation which accounts for over 50% of the price at the pump. Ihe price structure
in fact comprises five different taxes collected by different institutions and does not allow importers
to seek out the lowest possible f.o.b. prices. Tbis situstion creates an incentive for fraud in Rwanda,
especilly for diesel fuel, the price of which in Rwanda is almost double that in Tanznia. In
September 1992, in Arusba, Tanzania notified the Rwandese authorities of its intention to harmonize
its oil product prices with those in effect in the region.
(ii)  Institutonl framework
MICOMART is responsible for setting the maximum prices to be charged at the
pump. Through the semipublic company Petrorwanda, which covers almost 25% of the national
nfet (imports and distribution) and in which it is the main stockholder, the State is able to gain a
clearer picure of the contours of the oil market and of its cost strucre. lbus, the country's primary



- 52 -
AMX 1.1
Page 7 of 11
policy options reside in control of maximum prices at the pump and, to a lesser extent, regulation
of transportation and establishment of strategic fuel stocks. Under these conditions, it is not
surprising ta the Goverment's petroleum policy, the constuent components of which are economic
and fiancial, does not necessarily mesh with national energy context.
Specific actions program aligned on the actual energy situation will have to be
instituted, focusing on control of consumption of energy products, their substitution by cheaper
energy sources that are available locally, and formulation of coheren strategies for holding the cost
of supply, management and reconstitution of buffer stocks down to a minimum in order to maintain
activity in the sensitive sectors of the economy that are dependent on these products.
To remedy this situation, the Government proposes to implement immediately
strentffiened administrative control measures at the border posts to combat fraud with oil products.
A stdy will be made right away with a view to simplifying the price structure for oil products and
decontrolling prices while mintaining the level of revenue derived from these products. These
measures will be discussed with IDA no later dtan September 1993 and implemented by January 1994
at the latest.
C. Wood and charcoal
1(1)  Present situatn
The share of wood and wood products in meeting basic energy needs is put at 93%.
Consumption leels, characteized by a telatively moderate growth rate (2% p.a.), mean that wood
is being used at a rate (3 million me/year) that exceeds the limits of rational exploitation while still
leaving a huge gap of the order of 4 million mslyear between supply and demand. It is accordingly
imperative to stabilize, and even reduce, consumption of ligno-cellulose biomass in order to conserve
the forest cover under acceptable conditions. However, the problem smacks of squaring of the circle:
on the one hand, the available resources are limited; on the other, Rwanda's population is growing
at a particularly high rate, leading to intense pressure to clear land for furming at the expense of the
forest.
Although the household sector is by far the largest consumer of fuelwood, this
consumption cannot easily be reduced because the contribution of the different supply channels is
markedly decentralized and, therefore, only pardy known. On the other hand, the consumption of
charcoal and of wood fuels In the itional and small-scale industry sector, while admittedly
representing less tha 5% of tol energy consumption, should be amenable to rationalization because
the supply channels Involved are highly commercialized.
(ii)   ihtuona fework and fute gt=c=
Some projects have been set up with a view to reducing the gap between supply of
and demand for fuels; thos aimed at fuelwood supply have been placed under MINAGRI
supervision, while those designed to promote fuel uvings are oveseen by MINITAPE. In this
connection, MINAGRI has drawn up the National Forest Pla, tie main objectves of which are the
following:

establishment and mainenanece, on a country-wide scale, of ecologically balanced
forest resources;
-     Increasing of forestry productio;
-     better utilization and upgrading of forestry production.
An ad-hoc Law was promulgated in December 1988. This law, which did not include
provi   for taxation of t portation of charcoal, needs to be amended. The Govenment
acorny proposes to amend certain articles to permit collection of a specific tax on dharcoal
tranortaton. This ax wiL be divided into two rates: (a) a special rate of RF 30/bag, and (b) a
regr  rat of RF 60/bag. The  rgement for collection of this tax will be set out In a minieral
decree expected to be promulgated at the end of December 1992. The tax would serve to modernize
the sector, thereby consting an important stage in the rationalizaon of wood and charcoal use
while instilling a conservation mentaity. Ihe tax would also enable better management of forest
resources at community level. The rationalization of charcoal supply in urban areas will ensure
protection of the enmironment. By exempting pinewood from the tax it will be made as competitive
an energy source as eucalyptus.
For its part, MINITRAPE has launched projects aimed at improving pefomance and
yields (improved, Rondereza and three-stone stoves, fuel-saving cooking methode, more efficient
carbonization teciques) and developing substitute fuels (papyrus briquettes, biogas, And peat, the
master plan for which is in course of preparation). Given the clear linkages between population
mnease, demand for household fuels and the pressures on natural resources, all measures in this
sector need to be preceded by detailed coordinaton. At the initative of YINITRAPE, a National
Wood-Energy Coordination Commission has been formed, which is made up of representatives of
the minstries concerned (MININER, miNnTRASO, MNAGRI, MINIPLAN, MICOMART,
MNTRAPE) and has bee operdonal since April 1990.
As will be apparent from the foregoing, the Governmnt has set up appropriate
mahinery for             a coherent strategy for resolving, in the medium term, the problem
sition arising from the heavy presure on the nations wood resources. Among the Implementation
meares, special note should be taken of the contribution expected from the Urban Charcoal Supply
Rationalization component in the ESRP, the primary aim of which is to ensure regular supply at
affirdable cost fr the inhabitants of the country's main towns, within the context of rational
managemt of the nation's forest resources so as to ensure better protection of the environment.
This will Involve:
(a)    establishment of a master plan for urban dcarcoal supply;
(b)    m    nization and strengtiening of the monitoring and control of wood use for
charcoal making and of the supply channels;
(c)   support for the preparation and implementtion of community forestry plans;
(d)   support for maretig pinewood from thinning of the planions on the Zaire-Nile
Divide.

As noted above, MINlTRAPE will be responsible for the technical and financial
execution of activities to do with charcoal demand and will entu  those concerning supply to
MINAGRI.
D. Methane ,e
The methane gas reserves of Lake Kivu, jointly owned by Zaire and Rwanda, are
considerable (60 billion Nm3, i.e. 27 million toe) and renewable (about 200 million Nm3/year). As
of April 1990, the two joint owners of the gas have given SOCIGAZ the rg  to produce and market
it, thus providing the essential institutional framework for supervising production operations. The
possibility of producing and marketing this gas has been demonstrated by the experience with a piot
project that has been mnning at Cap Rubona since 1963. Moreover, studies have shown that there
are large and very interested consumers (BRALIRWA in Gisenyi and CIMERWA in Mashyuza) in
the immediate vicinity. In addition, the environmental impact and risks connected with methane gas
production have been assessed and the preliminary conclusion Is that production on a reasonable
sae, of the order of 100 million NmIyear, would not represent any hazard to the environment.
Tis quantity, which is very small compared with the size of the proven reserves, would neverfteless
be equivalent to 45,000 toe. This resource is unqestionably an inestimable asset to the national
energy sector, its rational development is a matter of the highest priority.
in this conte,t the Rwandese Government, in close cooperatio with ts partners -
the Zairian State, SOCIGAZ - has requested IDA, in the context of the ESRP, to consider financing
the following actions:
*     preparation of regulations to govern production
*     promotion of the gas to private operators
e     bathymetric studies on Lake Kivu
*     laboratory for measuring the environmental impact.
Implementation of these actions would make it possible to open the way for future
development of the gas reserves and to make production as profitable as possible, in the interests of
both parties, of couse. Tis letter gives me the opportunity to reiterate the Rwandese Governmen's
solemn commitment to etntrust production and sale of the gas by priority to private operators in
accordance with te objectives set forth in its Declaration of Economic Policy, which are specifically
aimed at improving the competitiveness of the Rwandese economy and encouraging the pdvate sector.
E. Ne      rend wable foms    rgy
As already noted, the population's main energy needs are connected with food
preparation and, to a lesser ement, home heating and lighting. Iherefore, although the potentials of
new and renewable forms of energy may be considerable, for technical, socioeconomic and cost
reasons their acta contribution is minimal.
Purely by way of illustradon, despite the availability of solar energy - 4.5
kwhlm2lday - large-scale utilization of promising applications such as the solar water heater and
photovoltaic panels is blocked by the high specific costs involved, which are frther agavated by
the low national production and after-sales service capacities. However, photovoltaic systems are

met at afordable cost, the more so since the ELECTROGAZ system will not be in a position to cover
the entire country and private-sector initiatives (housing credit from Banques Populaires, etc.) will
be able to help finane installation of such systems.
As for the otier higbly decentralized energy sources, the Govement's role will
consist in supportng private initiatives with a view to consolidatng and etending progress already
made. To this end, witfin the framework of the ESRP a market study will be made and appropriate
financing arrangements will be developed In order to be able to formulae a strategy that wil make
it possible to speed introduction of larger-scale utilizaton of this energy source.
IV, Conelusion
As will be apparent from the points outined in the foregoing, the Government of the
Rwandese Republic is setting up appropria  mechanisms for rational management of the energy
sector that will position it to make a significant contribution to recovery of the natioDnal economy and
Improvement of living conditions for the country's people, especially those living In the rura areas.
Ihe main actions planned are designed to bring about, within the very short term,
restoration of ELECIROGAZ's finauial equilibria thanks to more efficient management of its
fciities, operation of which will be entrue tDo the private sector. The paralel application of the
cost prcing" principle for all energy sources (oil products, wood and wood products, electricity,
etc.), and the resulting energy rationalizations, will be central to all our strategies aimed at energy
rationalization in order to safeguard the meager resources avalable in a better balanced environment.

REPUBUC OF IIWANDA
OUTLINE OF THE CHARCOAL TAXATION SYSTM
Taxation of charcoal Is to be intoduced under the project to fitate a modernization
of the  caroal sector widi a view to use scarce wood resources as rationally as possible and to
ensure a susainable supply of chacoal until th populaton can afford a switch to modeen fiuls
such as keosene and LPG. As pinewood is cmredy not used for the poduction of charcoal,
and vast quantities are avaiable for many years tO come, a specific tax of approiWely   W
1 - PRW 2 per kg wi  be applied to eucalyptus to make pinewood c o  mpetiVe with
eucalypts chao  (See Figure below). As shown, at preset the poin of equilibrium (Qi)
between pinewood and eucalypts dhacoal is at atly   130 km from iga (constuting
80% of the total charcoal market). A spefic tax of PRW  1/kg wil cnge this point of
equilibrimto 180 km (Q2), and a tax of FRW 2/kg to 220 km (Q3). Ihe pinwood resources
are located at d es geater tan 200 km from Kigali.
Th specific tax on hrcoal will have a minor effect on end-users since the retail price
of dcarcoal in towns is likly to inrase diereby giving an inentive to use impwved stoves and
save chcoa. Improved stoves could more than off-set the charcoal price increase as average
rooal savings in practice amount to 35%.
There are two proposed tax regimes: a normal regime (PRW 60 per bag), and a special
regime (PRW 30 per bag). The specia regime is applied to efficient charcoal production in
villages that manage their wood reources properly; such vlges will have a wood use
managem    plan apprwoe by MINAGRI. In this case, some 83 percet of the tax (PRW
2SbA) remais in th village and 17 prcent (PRW 5/bag) flows into the NFF. The norma
regime is applied in All oter cases and rpreset the current inefficient sitation in Rwanda
In this case, some 80 percen (PRW 47.3/bag) of the tax flows ino the NFF and 20 percent
(PRW 12.5) remins wifth the vfllago authorites. Pinewood choal is empt from the tac so
as to mae it competivo with eucalyptus charcoal.
Trnsportes would pay te specific tax on charcol to the vibge authorites where the
wood originated. They wil receive a receipt staiDng the date, the type of wood used, the amount
of charcoal ansported, the amount of tax paid, and the names of the vlge and the tapoer.
This receipt wi replac   e current tansport permit. Tle tax diffrence provides an incentive
on the one hand to transporters for finding chrcoal in vlges that apply the speci regime, and
on the other hand to villages for prepaing a village wood use plan.
At the town entry (initially Kigali and later other towns also), control posts will collec
fmm tasporters the receipt given to them in the vilage. This allows MINAGRI to maintain
detaied data on the charcoal production s well as to prepare plans for optial use of wood
reources. Ihe revenues from the tax are sufficient tA cover the cost of the control posts (even
when *ey ae only 80%), and will also enable the fiaacing of a number of village wood use
pla  through the NFP.

ELEROGAZ is a government monopoly responsible for the production, transmission
and distribution of electric power, water and gas. A body corporate with financl autonomy, it was
created in its present form by Decree-Law No. 18-76 of April 20, 1976 and is governed by Decree-Law
No. 39-75 (Public Institutions). It is headed by a Board of Directors and a Director, the latter appoin
by the President of the Republic. In technical matters, it is under the supervision of the Ministy of Public
Works and Energy and in financial matters under that of the Ministry of Finance.
As noted above, ELECTROGAZ is active in three sectors: water, electric power, and gas.
Large-scale civil engineerng works, even in these sectors, are by custom evaluated separately, accountg
for a not insignificant proportion of the agency's turnover, as indicated further on. At the end of 1990,
the key indicators of the utility activity as of the audited financial statements were as follows:

Gas supply activities are marginal: sales are made to a single client, Brasserie et
Limonaderie du Rwanda, which consumes 131,000 m3, for a turnover figure of RE 2 million.
Turnover on large-scale civil engineering works at the end of 1990 was RF 655 milion,
including approximately R1 195 million for works and supplies on its own account.
At the end of 1991, ELECTROGAZ had a total staff complement of 4,108 indviduals,
in the following categories:
-     Regular or fixed-term                   1,253
-     Permanent part-time                       670

TOTAL                            4,108
2.           Present S
Ihe Rwandese State and ELECTROGAZ, with the support of various donors, have been
engaged for many years in a major investment program, as a result of which the agency's fixed assets
were valued at a total of RF 29 biSlion as of December 31, 1990 (RF 20 billion after depreciation).
Althoug this program has made it possible to double the number of customers in five years, growth in
turnover has not been on a par with the investment rate, chiefly because of inadequate tariffs and
commercial policy. These weaknesses have been exacerbated by:
-     major system losses;
-     defective collection, with billings to customer accounts at close of 1990 being 11 months
behind on average;
-     ineffective and inadequate- mnagement procedures for an enterprise of this size (one
consequence: ignorance of cost prices);
-     lack of an efficient Planning Unit;
-     an unsuitable institutional framework, exacerbated by the agency's status as a public
enterprise.
These handicaps antae produced cash-flow difficulties that have prevented the agecuty since
1988 from meedng its debt-service obligations, which have thus fallen to the Govemment. However,

A4NNEX 2.1
Pap 3 of 7
the Govenment, ficed with its own serious financial difficultes, has not paid its utility bills. lbe end
result is ta major cross-indetedness eai.
Given the agency's precarious finac  status (V. attached Financial Statemets), the
devaluation of the Rwandese franc by 67% in November 1990 saddled ELECrROGAZ with a loss of RF
1.7 billion in 1991, on top of losses amounting to RF 6.3 billion in 1990 (about three tmes its turver).
3.           Prsed
While conductng various studies to identify means of rehabilitating the agency
permanently, the Government rapidly came to realize that the most eficient and appropriate of the
possible options would be to transfer ELECROGAZ opeations to a privae-sector opeator.   teefore
proposes to split the agency into two separate entities - a Socifte nationale de parimoine (SNP) to serve
as principal and administer the agency's assets, and a Socite privEe d'exploitation (SPE) to be
responsible for production and the operation of agency facilities. The relationship between the two
entities would be governed by a lease contract . Ithe SPE would also be responsible for biUling and
collection operations, retning a portion of the proceeds in lieu of lease onactor and ener  costs, and
remitting the balance to the SNP to cover its own operating costs, as well as debt-service obligations and
energy and water sector development invlasents.
Notfication of prequalification proceedings was published in Development Business No.
347 of July 31, 1992, the response cut-off date being given as September 30, 1992.
In order to ensure the success of the reform process, the Government wishes to recrit
consultants to help draw up the various conuaD docmnents necesary and to asist it as necessary In
negotiations witi potentia partners.
The consultants will be required to perform the following tasks:
-     determine the responsibilities of the various intervening parties (SNP, SPE, Govement);
-     draft Stattes for the SNP, decide its optmm staff size, and make recommendaions for
reorganization of its capital structure;
-     draft a lease contract between the SNP and the SPE;
-     prepare all bidding Jocuments for selection of the fuure private operator.
Moreover, in order to attrct the largest possible numer of qualified pivate operatrs,
certain incentives are to be offered. The Energy Sector Rehabilitation Project would first finance the
following activities:
-     inventory of all water supply and power supply points;
-     updating of the customer database (power and water);
-     upgrading and finalization of plans and maps of all water and power disrbuon
facilties;
-     overal of water and power service drops and meters;
-     constiution of a strategic inemoy of spare parts.

Papg 4 of 7
Simultaneously, the Project would also provide fmancing for the rehabilitation and
extension of the distribution network seving the cies of Yigali, Butare, Nyabisindu, Ruhengeri and
Gisenyi, rehabilitation of the Mukungwa I and Gisenyi hydro-plants and rehabilitaion of the Mururu I
substation.
Goverment Contdributian to Water Tariff
Water tariffs, would need to be raised by additional 40% and 20% to reach full rates of
RWF142.55 and RWF171.06 respectively, even after the two increases of 15%  each tdt ae
contemplated under the project. The immed.A' priority in implementing a full rate for water is to restore
the customers' willingness to pay for water, and to enforce sound and secure biling and collection
procedures, including cut-off as needed. As this priority would be progressively achieved in parallel with
improvements of the quality and availaility of water service following the rehabilitation and upgrading
of connection instllations, the increase needed for water tarff (which is too high to implement at once),
would need to be phased. The Government would finance every year until 1998, the differenti between
the curent water tariff and the full rate. This pragmatic subsidization scheme, is deemed effective and
appropriate since: (a) te process is entirely transparent as subsidies would be conveyed trough
budgetary channels; and (b) the arrangements would last only a limited period of time and would be done
on a declining basis. In this connection, the Government's contributions to waier tariff that is necessary
to maintain the full rate for water over the project implementation would be detemined by October 31
in each year for the succeeding year, taking into account the yearly water tariff increases.
Private _ rar Access to Foreign Exchange
Past experience in the sector with ELECIROGAZ as well as experience elsewhere demonstrated
both the importance and the problems in having ready access to foreign exchanges to cover operations
needs. Continued difficulties in this area could result in delays in timely implemeon of contractual
obligations by the private operation under the proposed arragements. This risk is now significandy
reduced in Rwanda which under the SAC-supported reform program, has established on July 1, 1992 a
non-discriminatory foreign exchange allocation regime through an Open General License (OGL) system
adminisred by commercial banks. Ihis system is funded by foreign exchange earnings, as well as by
the proceeds of the IWP's SAF and the first SAC operation. Other donors will also utilize this system
in their balance of payments assistance to Rwanda. It is therefore expected that the OOL system would
provide the fimre private operator ihat will operate ELECTROGAZ access to foreign exchange at the
prevailing exchange rate to finance essential spare parts and service in the normal course of business.
4. -sultans Tasb
4.1          R2=bnaiteailit  fintvening parti
Since there are now to be three intervening parties (the SPE, the SNP and the
Government) iostead of two, the consultants are asked to provide clear statements of the responsibilities
of each of them, particularly as their respective interests do not necessarily coincide.  These
responsibilities consist not only of the investment program and the frequency and extent of tariff
adjusment, but also the intrface between administration of assets on the one hand and operating
activities, incuding maintenance, on the other. As far as the latter arena is concemed, the consultants
shoud pay particulr attetion to the practical side of the subdivision of ELECTROGAZ into SNP and
SPE.



- 75 -
ANNEX 2-l
Page 5 of 7
Their first step should be to identify the functions belonging specifically to the SNP, the
SPE and the Government as far as design, financing, execution and operation of facilities are concerned.
lhe separate fields of responsibility of each party should be clearly marked out so as to prevent situations
of avoidance of responsibility or encroachment on the terrain of others. Provisions should be made for
arbitration mechanisms or structures for dealing with disputes.
The consultants should also examine the following particular points with care.
Mechanisms for setting tariffs: The single tariff collected from the consumer will be
distributed as follows: one part will cover SPE fees, another will be used to purchase
energy (Ruzizi I and II) and the remainder will be remitted to the SNP to cover its
running costs, meet debt-service obligations and finance necessary investments in sector
development. The structure of the tariffs and the mechanisms for adjusting them should
be studied with the three partners in mind. An externally regulated structure to arbitrate
potential conflicts should be envisaged.
1fest mnLprgm:  The interest of the three partners could in some cases be split
between the determination to maximize water and power delivery services throughout the
country and the possibility of making these investments profitable. The consultants
should therefore put forward proposals regarding decision-making mechanisms and means
of appeal.
ter asnects of the functioning of these three entities should also be studied so thas
overlapping and duplication are prevented.
4.2          Drafting of SNP statutes
The Ministry of Finmce has recently prepared a new draft of the Public Enterprises Bil
(Loi-Cadre), which introduces two categories of public entity, namely etablissements publics (public
instidons) and socidtds nationales (State-owned corporations). The latter are defined as corporations
subject to private law but wholly owned by the State and/or by bodies corporate subject to public law;
they are governed by the legislation on commercial corporations, except as specified in the Public
Enterprises Act.
This Bill nullifies all earlier instruments, particularly the 1976 Decree-Law creating
ELECMROGAZ, although they will remain in force temporarily until new Statutes can be adopted,
preferably via presidential decree.
After carefil analysis of earlier instruments, particularly any specific technical provisions,
some of which should be retained, the consultants will draw up the new Statutes of the SociMe national
de Patrimoine (the SNP). In addition to the general features common to all soci6t4s nationales (State-
owned corporations), the Statutes should incorporate the distribution of responsibilities referred to in
Section 4.1 above and specific prescriptions for administration of the water and power subsectors.
The consultants should be aware of any amendments the legilure may make in the text
of the Bill and should review judicial practice as far as decisions affecting monopolies are concerned.

uMORdrggnIgtjCha. lhe consultants should provide a suggested organization
hat, and sbould indicate both the fumctons of the various units comprising It and their sffing need.
These needs should be dictated essentily by the SNPs new responsibilities and designated spheres of
action; they should also be consistent with the requwements of strict, optimal management on the prnciple
of mimum rumling costs.
CZital ,Stucoe.At the present time, ELECTROGAZ needs to be recapitalized. The
consultantsshould therefore propose means of reorganizing its capital structure, incorporating menisms
for capitalizing short-tem debt, and clearing cumulative losses.
4.3   SIME lease contract
Against the bacgound of the legislation in force and the provisns referred to in Section
4.2 above, the lease contract between the SNP and the SPE, in addition to the clauses usualy contained
in such contrats, should incorporate provisions on the following points:
-     steps to be followed in putting the conta  intD effect (e.g. transfer of ELECTROGAZ
oeating assets to the SNP and the SPE, handling of client accounts receivable and
supplier accouns payable, etc.);
responsibilities, obligations, rights and spheres of action of the three parters
(Government, SNP, SPE);
duration of the contract and procedures for its amendment and renewal;
-      ithe principle on which contracta  remuneration is to be computed; pmlcular attention
should be given to Government arreas - for instace, the SPE woud be authorized to
deduct regular goverment consumption stil due from amounts collected after 60 days
upon receipt of bills;
-     content and frequency of operang reports (to include volumes/ quan"ties of water and
elericity consumption billed and paid for by month and by quart), and content of the
end-of-contract report;
-     technical  dtds for works to be executed by the SPE;
-     genera operafng reations and rdes for the arbiration of SNPISPE disue;
-     capial of the SPE (the equivalent of about US$5 n'illion).
4.4    Dfting of new casnomer contcts
The consulan  should draw up model contracts (power and water) for the SPE to use
with its alsomer and update  e teisting ELECTROGAZ conacts. The customer ontract shoud
specify criteia for judging quality of service and prcedur  for setement of SPE/customer disputes.

Of the main components and to correct the efects of the accuuated wear. In the smaller hydro
power sion of Gihira (two uni of 0.92 MW each), situated nearby, there is a need to ovehaul
the hydraulic strucures, heavtly damaged by erosion due to the great amount of sand carried by the
water.
2.           Under the Eney  Sector Rehabilitation Project, IDA will finance the above
metioned works. ELECTROGAZ wishes to retain consulting services to cary out a detaied
inspection of the installation and to prepare detailed specifications for the equipment, spare part and
materias to be purchased, as well as for the works to be executed, and the necessary biddi
documents.

AN EINSMON TO 3M MURURU I SUBSTATION
1.           Rwanda, together with Burundi and the Kivt provii Inhe eastern prt of Zaire are
served by a regional intrconnected electrical netork  lhae exis, flthennore, a multntona
power company -Socit nterationaled'Eectricit des Pays des Grands La  (SiNELAC)- owned
by the three goverm, which owns and operates a hydro power statio (Ruziz II) and a substation
(Muu   U), the ltter built on Rwandese teUitory, In the Cygug  region.  Befbr th
commissioning of SINELAC's installations in 1989, the main Rwandeso substaion in the Cyagup
region, the substation of Mururn I, was connected to the (Rwandese) Kaongl sbt i rough a
110 kV line, and from there on, with the rest of the high voltage Rwandese netwok. When
SNEAC's instalations were incorporated to the network, though, the Muruu I - Karongi line was
opend, and the Mumr 1 substation was connected in between. This mean dlat the Murru I
ubstaion is now sepated from the rest of the Rwandes high voltge network, which creates some
operations problems, the most important of which Is the restriction of dire  energ imports from
Zaire.
2.           Under the Ener  Sector Rehabilitation Project for Rwaxda, IDA will finae an
extensionofthe Muru  Ilsubstation consisftingtheadditionoftwo 1101kVbays, to whchthelles
to Mururu U and to Krongi wi be conncted. The spae available for tis extesion is very
restricted, therefore a solution that minim  space reiemen  while keeping the cost as low as
possible is necessary. ELECMROGAZ, the state owned entepwrise eonsible for dectriciy in
Rwanda wishes to retain consulting servicos for the detailed desigp of this extesion, and for the
preparation of the bidding documents for the supply of the equipment and the execution of the work.
Single line diagrams of the Mururu I substation before and after the    orpoation of SINELAC's
installations, as well as showing the proposed modiflcation are attached.

3.           The objecdve of the assignment is to defie an adequa, least cost
solution to the problem of reconstitting the continuity of the Rwadese high voltg transmissin
network, by modifyin the Mururm I substation within the existng space restrictions, miny with te
purpose of making possible the direct importation of electrical energy from Zaire, witout the need
for that energy to pa  through the SINELAC lnstations. The exected outp from the conultant
is a dtiled design of the new Instlations, as wel as the necessay biddig docume  for the

The overall deficit has been assessed by adding up all regionra deficits, the as8urptfhn being
that little or no interrgional trade takes place. This Is not entirely true as Bikongoro, for
Instance, suppties Kigalt with charcoal. If the staVatics are correct Sikongoro prefecture
experiences a deficit notably larger then the one presently identified, the difference being
eoodfuels sippiled to Kigali.

-               Logging of natural forests produces 150 if/ha.
-               Sustainable productivities remain as in 1987.
I,              The overall deficit has been assessed by adding up all regional deficits, the assuiption being
that little or no interregional trade takes place. This Is not entirely true as Gikongoro, for
instance, supplies Kigali with charcoal. If the statistics are correct Gikongoro prefecture
experiences a deffcit notably larger than th  one presently identified, the difference being
woodfuels supplied to Kigali.

Oual du Semdg2lectricitd
1.    Les indicaurs de la gualkt du service dlectrique comproment trows composantes: la qualit6do h frdquenco,
la qualkd de la tension, at la coDtinult du sevice. Cependant, etant donnd quo la fdquence est d otermine par des
methodes de rdgage rstant d'accords n6gocids par les quatre partenaires do l'intorconnexlon rOglonale, c'est
seulement les deux derniers paramutres qui vont servir I faire un suivi de la performace de l'oprateur privo.
2.    Les decarts maximaux admissibls de la temsion livre max clients par rapport I sa valeur nomiiale seront
spEcifids dans le cabier des charges. Ces valeurs seront definies en prenant comme point de ddpart des norume
intonatlonaes (celles de la Commission Elecotechnique Internationale (CEI), par exemple), que lon pourra adapter
pour tenir compte des conditions particulikres au Rwanda: (a) condition actuelie du rdsea; (b) sensibilite des
tfronts types d abonnes aux ecarts de tension (un consommateur rural, par exemple, n!utilisant l'electricte que pour
leclairage. aura une toldrance plus grande qu'un consommateur en milieu urbain); (c) justification Economique des
investissements supplementaires qu'il faudrait faire pour amdlioror la qualite de la tesion (il fiadra, peut Wre,
accepter une moins bonno qualitE de la tension pour certains groupes d'usagers en des rEgions Eloigades qu'il est trbs
oneroux de desservir). Le cahier dos charges devra specifier des indices qui reflbtent la coutinuite du service, et qui
devront Wre produits par 1exploitant prive comme partie de ses statistiques d'exploltation, par exemple: (a) energie
coupde par niveau de tension et par region; (b) nombre d'ntruptions par abonne par an; (c) durEe moyenne des
interruptions par abonnd et par region.
Ouitd du Service Eau
3.    Les normes de potablite de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Sante seront utilisdes pour mesurer la qualite du
service de l'eau.
Au=e Indicateurs
4.    Lexploitant prive devra apporter et mettre en place des systkmes modernes de gestion pour les diferentes
acdvitds de la societe, tant ceux I caractere purement technique que celles I caractere administratf. 11 et souhaitable
que ces systkmes solent informatises. Par exemple, les systbmes administratifs inormatE devront comprendre: (a)
gestion commerciale; O) approvisionmnt et gestion des stocks; (c) comptabilitd; (d) gostion de la paie du
personnel. Pour les systbmos techniques inormatises i s'agit de: (a) gesdon optimale de la production et les
importations d'energie electrique; (b) coordinadon des protecdots; (c) planification, conception et calcut, construction
des extensions en distribution; (d) gestion de la maintenance des installations.
5.    L'exploitant prive devra laisser tous ces systhmes en place I Ia fin de la periode de validitd du contrAtG, au cas
oU celui-ci ne serait pas renouvele, et transfrer I la Societe Nadonale de Patimoine la propridte de zoute la
doumentation et des logiciels necessaires a leur fonctonnement. Le contrat etablira des specifications minimum pour
chacnm de ces systnes (voir en annexe, I ttre Miustratif des spEcifications mininm  pour le ,'ttme de gestion de
la maintenance des Installations).
6. Le cahier des charges etablira los specifications suxquelles devrant rdpondre les produits livrEs par l'exploitant
prive am  consommateurs. La SNP fera le suivi des performances de la SPE dans ce domaine au moyen de contrOles
appropries, par exemple, analyse d'echantillons d'eau, analyse d'enrogistrements de tension pris en des points
judicieusement cholsis, suivi des statistiques sur la condnuite du service.
7.    Pour mdmoire, la reue I mi-parcours devra dgalement se concentrer sur la passation at l'atbutlon de
marches pour toutes les composantes du projet, sur le programme de formation et son execution en ce qui concerns
la cetlule du projet et la SNP, les tarift deau et d'electricite, les prix du charbon de bois et des produis pEtroliers,

REUBLIC OF RWA4NA
ENERGY SETOR REHABIIJTTI'ON ROCT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROlECTIONS
A.    Rvenues from Sales and Connections
1. Pric Financial projections are in constant Rwandese francs. The eiLcange rate of the
FRW to the dollar used in the projection is US$1 = FRW140.
2.    Sales and Revenues. Electricity consumption is based on the forecasts of the medium
scenario in the electrification Master Plan prepared by HYDRO QUEBEC INTENATIONAL and
found acceptable by IDA, with an average demand growth of 8.4%. Water consumption is
estimated on the basis of growth in consumption for the last five years, averaging about 2.5 per
year. Gas demand has been taken as constant, given the structure of sales (single client) and an
Investment program which is yet to be defined. Average tariffs for water and electicity have been
projected to meet ELECMROGAZ' financial restructuring objectives over the period of 1993 - 1998
as per paras. 5.7 and 5.8.
3.    System losses (technical and non-technical) for electricity are estimated to decrease from
14% in 1991 to 10% in 1995, many due to efficiency measures to be taken by the private
operator. Unaccounted for water has been assumed to decrease from 35% in 1990 to 30% in 1992
as the result of measures currently undertaken by ELECMTOGAZ. From 1993, it has been
assumed that comprehensive programs to be implemented by the private operator would bring the
unaccounted for water to 20% by year 2000.
4.    Revenues from Connections. A margin of 30% was applied to all actual connection
charges. The actual conmections charges have been computed to substantially decrease (between
40 and 50%), as the result of more use of monophase than triphase to connect the increasing
number of small private consumers.
B.    Ooerating Costs
5.    Other materials and supplies. Ihe acual consumption for these cost items totalled FRW
568 million in 1990 and FRW 699 million in 1991. They have been computed to remain constant
from 1993 to 1998 assuming a 15% increase in 1992 as compared to 1991, based on the
assumption that any increase in these costs item would be offset by the efficiency gain of the
private operator. This approach is realistic as the private operator will be driven by the implicit
objective to keep the costs at the very minimum. The higher these cost items, the lower its
remuertin.

6.    Reagents. Reageans ihat are consumed have been computed using the forecas for water
consuon  and volumes of water treated that arise out of th forecs den. The qades
of reagents have been valued usig the price applied by ELECTROGAZ' suppliers.
7.    Purchases of electricity. In the absence of the Implementation of the agreed upon LRMC
for Ruzizi U, the purchases of electricity have been valued using the new tariffs applied by
SINELAC (SDR 0,05 or RWF 9.86/kWh) and SNEL (RWF7.36 kWh repectvely).
S.    La    cos. ITese cost items are esimated for the 1992-1998 period taking into account
the manpower reducton progrm a described in para 2.7 and average inases in salaries and
wages of about 8% per year.
9.    Deprcaon. Depreciation is calculated on the basis of the 1990 audited balance sheet.
Fixed ass  are aumed to incase, taking into account Invetments to be made as part of the
proposed project and of the agreed upon investment program. On average over the projected
peid, gross fixed asets would rise by 8% yearly.
C.  oQ t bomtSInt mItnm
10.   Excha l       .  Exchage losses that are shown in the projecdons relate to repayment
of principal and interest charges on long and medium term debts, and are the result of the
devaluations of the Rwandese firc. Ihe projections aumed the constitution of provision for
Inerest expenses to offset exchange losses against the past positive diference resultig from
conversion into locd currency of debts denomna   in foreign curren.
11.                . Interest charges are computed asuming the maiena    of the cmrent
on-lending terms of the debts conted before 1992 by ELECTROGAZ'.
12.   Depreciation of the susiies for equipment and works has been calculated on the basis of
te average periad of depreciation for subsidized iostallations.
D.    Bab= &et Im
13.   Wo  i             Work in progress are esdmated on the basis of ELECTROGAZ's
investment program and taking into account investments under the proposed project. It has been
aumed also that the bnvtment program for water would be finalized once a decision is reached
on the size of the investment progrm for the water sector, upon completion of ongoing studies in
Kigali and secondary centers.
14.   Ac. These have been computed with the objective to bring back
rcvable from privat cnumes and from Central Governt to the equivalent of three months
billigs by December 1994 after t  intwduction of a vigorous billing and collection policy by the
private  operaor under the proposed  project, and  after compeation  of Central
Government-ELEMOGAZ' crossed-debts.

1S.   LnnmWW debtsh Ibs item has been calcuated on the basis of the net worth as shown in
the 1990 audited finana sttem, and simulations caried out on the basis of eitig and
futre loas that constite the Investment program. nDA's and cofincs' credits (EIB, CCCE)
tha fom the proposed credit have also been taken Into account.
16.   Short term norton of current debt to Central Governm    In 1991 and 1992, this item
was incresed by the amount of debt servicing obligations tat ELECROGAZ  ould not meet.
It is expected that the Government will use these current liabilities as a contribution to the capial
of the SNP, as part of the recwapitalzation packge to be submitted by the Govement under the
proposed project. As of November 1992, compensation of cross-debts between ELECTROGAZ
and Govenment would take place. It is epected that th balnce In favor of Govrmet would
be used to recapitalize ELECIROGAZ or the SNP so as to bring its equity ratio close to the
standards of financialy-viable utilities by 1993.
E     Fund Flow I
17. Debt servie. ELECIROGAZ's debt service is calculated using an exchange ra of
US$1 = FRW140. For loans denominated in other currenLcies, the exchange rates as of June 30,
1992 have been used. Debt seviciWng has been calclated takdng into account the _ of
the current onlending tems to ELECrROGAZ. ELECMROGAZ' borrowings for the proposed
project, the schedule of which is provided in Annex 5.5, include IDA credi and related
cQfinancing.

TALIE AD1USTMENT POM1
A.    lheFormula
The formula to be used for an automatic adJustment, which Is based on tbree variables, namely
exchange rate between the US$ and the Rwandeso Franc, price of electricity purased from SINELAC and
salaries, Is as follows:
T#f 1) = T1x(A + BxEER,     ER,% + CxEPe+ I  / EP(O + DxSo.,) / So)
where T staids for tarffi ER for exchange rate, EP for price of electricity purdhased from SINELAC, S for
salaries, I refers to a given year of the financial projection and 1+ 1 to a subsequent mome of that year when
tarifl are to be reviewed. Such a review shall be necessary when there has been a dcange in any of the three
independent variables. The values of the variables for a given year I shall correspond to the base line values used
in the projections for the particular year. The i + 1 values shall change each time that the variable change. The
tariff-increase under the above conditions shall only be applied when the resulting increase is above 6% of the
tariff at the time of review. The cost ratios, A, B, C and D would be caculated exate from the financial
projections prepared by or for the utility. For example, for a given year of the financial projections, B would
be obtained by dividing the total of those expenditures that are foreign exchange dependent for that year (such
as foreign debt service, imported spare parts and equipment purchased with internally generated funds and part
of the contribution to the investment program financed also with internally generated funds) oy the total projected
revenues for that year. C would likewise be obtained by dividing the projected expenditures from the purchase
of electricity for a given year by the projected revenues for that year. D would result from dividing the salay
exendiure projected for a given year by the projected revenues for that year. The remaining factor, A, is given
by the formula
A = 1-(B+C+D)
and represents the other uses of ftnds that are not a function of any of the three variables used in the formua.
k should be noted that the portion of the investment program that Is financed by other instittions does not appear
in the formula as it does not demand funds from the utility.
Ihe values of A, B, C and D should be calculated from the financial projections for each of the
years of project execution. The value of these factors wil most likely change from year to year, but if the change
is minor It might be simpler to hold them constan during project supervision. Furthermore, the financial
projections typically wil require frequent updating and this will lead to a recalculation of the cost ratios. When
the fomula is used to adjust the tariff, it should be applied to every customer and to every consumer block. This
in effect distributes the additional costs (savings) equally to all consumers; however, assuming that the base tariff
has been properly designed, this should result in an equitable shar  of the burden or benefit. Finally, it should
be clear that the formula should be revenue neutral, that is to say, the utility's revenues should increase (decrease)
in precisely the amount needed to compensate for the additional expenditure (saving) caused by the change in an
independent variable.
B.    The refinement of the formula
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section A above, in a dry year, the utlity will be forced to
increase s drm  generation, while in a wet year, it might be able to curtail it This situation sball be managed
by including in the variable EP the additional thermal generation prce, which shall take into account the projected
prico of runnng more thermal than hydro.

1.    Rates of rtrn as well as neu present values were al culated for dhe  of the disti n
networls of Kigali, Bute, Ruhenei, Giseayi and Nyablindu. A peid of 30 years begnning In 1994
was chosen for the anatysis. ITe calculatios were done using Lotws, and the worksheets conding
to the base caso for each one of the ciies are attached.
2.    Investmenit costs were assumed to be distributed eqly alog the four years, 1994-1997, of the
implementionperiod. Yearly operation and            costs were takn  as 2% of nvsmen costs.

3.    Ihe benefits of the project wil be the reveus generated by the incmental sales of electricity
and the consumer surplus due to substitution of alternive sources of energy maiy for liging and
cooking. Only the first of these elements was considered in the calculation of the rates of retrn  The
incremental sales were valued as the product of the total energy supplied tbrough the  _etnon and the
average tariff.
4.    The energy supplied was calcuatd from the number of consums to be connected, as estmated
by ELECTROGAZ and verified by Hydro Quebec Intelona (HQID, nd a yery c_umption per
consumer. It was assumed that 60% of the consumers that would evetaly be served by any given
extension, would be connected immeaty, and that the remaing 40% would be added at a unifom
rate during the next four years. The yearly consumption per consumer was tak  as the weighted average
of the fist two blocks of consumption in low voltage as detmined by HQI wihin the framework of the
Electricity Master Plan Study. Ihe tariff applied -US$0.12/kWh- was also determined as an aveage
of the social tariff of RWFPO.001kWh, and the esdmated LRMC of RWF20.0/kWh, weigted by the
respective percetage of total consumption to which they are applied.

5.    The estimated inal rate of return varies between 12% for Nyabisindu, and 36% for Kigall
A sensitivity analysis was carzied out for a plus or minus 20 percen variation In each of two parameter:
the mumber of consumers served from the extnsions and the average cons n per consumer in kWh
per year. Both these factors are reflected in the tot onsupio d  through the extesions, which
varies, therefe, between minus 36% and plus 44%, as shown in the table below.
