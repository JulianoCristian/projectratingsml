Among the lessons learned, the adequacy\n            of the project's lending instrument, highlights the\n            high degree of flexibility allowed in adjusting existing\n            projects, to a post-conflict environment, key to achieving\n            the project's objectives. However, lessons also outline\n            the need for strong Bank supervision, and pro-active\n            monitoring of the implementation progress, to include as\n            well a project design with a precise selection, and\n            coordination of components. Under the circumstances,\n            although the project did include legal, and regulatory\n            reforms, these were not implemented due to the limited\n            Government capacity. It is important to take into account\n            that post-conflict countries' ability to sustain\n            commitments, and ownership will hinder a reform agenda, and\n            thus the full success of project objectives. Therefore,\n            special attention should be paid to implementation\n            arrangements, particularly upon project re-design, by\n            providing support to the implementing agency, and ensuring\n            proper financial management, procurement, and overall\n            project management."}, "docdt": "2002-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
