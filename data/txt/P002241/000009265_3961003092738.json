The project comprises two main components: (a)\n            strengthening of the institutional regulatory and policy\n            environment; and (b) rehabilitation of key infrastructure in\n            the power subsector. The first component will include: (i)\n            restructuring the Rwandese Utility Company to permit\n            contracting out its operations to a private operator; (ii)\n            consulting services to prepare new statutes and organization\n            chart for the utility and bidding documents for the\n            selection of the private operator, and to assist in\n            implementing its contracting under a lease type contract and\n            in establishing two companies; (iii) implementation of a\n            series of make-ready measures in order to attract qualified\n            private operators; (iv) introduction of incentives to\n            rationalize and improve the efficiency of the charcoal\n            subsector; (v) implementation of environmental and technical\n            guidelines for future development of Lake Kivu's\n            methane gas by private investors; (vi) studies to design and\n            implement a strategy for development of solar home systems\n            as a cost-efficient alternative for electricity in rural\n            areas; and (vii) technical assistance and training to\n            strengthen the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and\n            Handicrafts's capacity to deal with petroleum products\n            issues. The power subsector component includes: (i)\n            rehabilitation and improvements of key power infrastructure\n            for five cities; (ii) improvement in the medium voltage\n            sections; (iii) overhauls of power station and hydraulic\n            structures; (iv) feasibility studies for hydroplants; (v)\n            constitution of a strategic stock of spare parts for plants\n            and substations; and (vi) capacity building and training\n            through scholarships and strengthening of the investment\n            planning and monitoring capacity of the utility staff."}, "docdt": "1993-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
