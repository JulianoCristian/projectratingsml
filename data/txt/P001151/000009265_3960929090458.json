The project achieved most of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            substantial, sustainability is uncertain, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, the\n            effectiveness of a sectoral adjustment program is better\n            warranted whenever policy changes take place sufficiently in\n            advance of loan approval. Second, the association of a SECAL\n            and an ongoing investment loan is a practical alternative to\n            an hybrid loan. Third, the Ivorian experience of\n            privatization of urban water services confirms that the\n            private sector is not interested in purchasing existing\n            water facilities or financing investments from its own\n            resources. Fourth, centralized maintenance of scattered\n            rural facilities is not sustainable, even if it is carried\n            out by a private company. Fifth, the fragmentation of\n            investment-related responsibilities led to an overall lack\n            of accountability. Finally, sectoral investment funds backed\n            by earmarked resources are vulnerable."}, "docdt": "1993-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
