water supply and\n            sanitation sector.  The main objectives of this program are\n            : a) to restore the availability of basic rural services; b)\n            to improve planning and sustainability of investments; c) to\n            improve control of costs and efficiency of pricing; d) to\n            strengthen the protection of water resources and of the\n            environment; and e) to restore the financial autonomy of the\n            sector. To this effect, the program comprises the following\n            : 1) a new institutional framework based on Government\n            retrenchment through increased privatization and community\n            management of rural facilities; 2) introduction of efficient\n            pricing of urban water services and of full recovery of\n            maintenance costs in rural areas; 3) establishment of\n            regulations and controls on private extraction of\n            groundwater and on disposal of domestic and industrial\n            wastewater; and 4) implementation of a new financing\n            strategy and restructuring of sector finances."}, "docdt": "1990-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
