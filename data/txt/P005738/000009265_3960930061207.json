The project\n            comprises two components, one of which is development of\n            management capabilities and policy adjustments. The project\n            will finance technical assistance, training and office\n            technology to develop and implement: (a) financial\n            management and performance evaluation procedures; (b) a\n            management information system; (c) the reorganization of the\n            administration and patient registration units; and (d)\n            sectoral strategies and reform program management. The\n            second component consists of improvement of service quality.\n            The project will support: (a) the replacement of priority\n            medical equipment; (b) the strengthening of hospital\n            maintenance units; and (c) improvements in patient\n            accommodations, hospital hygiene, and handling of medical wastes."}, "docdt": "1991-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
