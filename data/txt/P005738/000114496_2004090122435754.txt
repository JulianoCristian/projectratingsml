          Re:  Loan 3308 TUN
               (Hospital Restructuring Support Project)
               Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Excellency:
    We refer to the Loan Agreement (Hospital Restructuring Support
Project) between the Republic of Tunisia (the Borrower) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank)
dated May 22, 1991.  We have noticed that Category (4) has not been
included among the Eligible Categories to be financed out of the
Special Account established for the Project.  We propose therefore
that paragraph l (a) of Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement be amended
as follows to permit payments out of the Special Account under
Category (4):
    In Schedule 5, paragraph 1 (a) is amended to read as follows:
"(a) The term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1)  (2)  (3)
and (4) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this
Agreement;".
    All the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, as amended
hereby, shall remain in full force and effect.
    Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by
signing and dating the confirmation on the enclosed copy of this
letter and returning it to us .
                                   Sincerely,
                              Mahmood A. Ayub
                              Acting Director
