Your Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Hospital Restructuring Support Project) dated 
May 22, 1991, as amended, between the Republic of Tunisia (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).  We also refer to 
the request on your behalf contained in a letter dated November 18, 1997 from Mr. H. 
Hamdi to amend the Loan Agreement in order to reallocate the proceeds of the Loan and 
increase the disbursement percentages of certain Categories.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank, after due consideration, has agreed 
to the above.  Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
1.
In Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Loan), the table set forth in 
paragraph 1 is modified to read as set forth in the Attachment to this Letter.
All the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, as amended hereby, shall 
remain in full force and effect, it being understood, however, that the amended 
disbursement percentages shall only apply from the date of this Letter and upon 
receipt by the Bank of the duly countersigned copy thereof. \0c
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendments by signing and 
dating the confirmation on the enclosed copy of this Amendment Letter and returning it 
to us.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
