In\n            1991, the World Bank approved a 30 million dollars loan to\n            help the government streamline the way hospitals were run by\n            keeping costs down while improving service quality. In\n            addition, the Hospital Restructuring Reform Support Project\n            aimed to make sure that those organizations enjoying\n            hospital services actually paid for them as well. The\n            project decentralized decision-making and responsibilities\n            in 23 of the largest hospitals, introducing modern\n            management processes and setting up boards for oversight.\n            Case load and services had risen, but hospitals still\n            managed to reduce operating expenses by 27 percent. In\n            short, more efficient hospitals now respond better to\n            Tunisians' health needs."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
