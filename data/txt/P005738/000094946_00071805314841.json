All activities\n            were implemented as anticipated with minor modifications\n            described in the report. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are rated satisfactory overall. Several lessons\n            were culled from this project, notably, the Bank should\n            ensure consistency between government goals and project\n            objectives and between project objectives and project\n            components; ensure development ad adoption of specific\n            project monitoring indicators and obtain consensus on them\n            by the stakeholders; and analyze the legal and regulatory\n            environment as well as the institutional capacity related to\n            reform in order to identify needed changes; identify and\n            resolve key reform prerequisites during negotiation stage;\n            and ensure that supervision visits are frequent and that\n            there is continuity in choosing consultants. On the other\n            hand, major lessons for the Borrower are to involve all the\n            pertinent stakeholders to ensure ownership and project\n            implementation; design a communications strategy targeted to\n            different audience groups; devise in advance alternative\n            scenarios for implementing reform to make reform adapt to\n            any changes; ensure that institutional reform include\n            organizational change; select the appropriate personnel to\n            manage the project; develop comprehensive training; and\n            develop feedback channels."}, "docdt": "2000-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
