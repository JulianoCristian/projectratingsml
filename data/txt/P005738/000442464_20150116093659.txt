Tunisia: Reforming the Hospital System                                                                     July 1, 2002
                      In the early 1990s, the rise of chronic diseases linked to aging and urbanization threatened to set back
                      decades of improving health conditions in Tunisia. Providing for 90 percent of hospital services,
                      inefficient public hospitals troubled by unaccountable managers, poorly-trained staff, and weak cost
                      control struggled to keep up with the demand. On top of this, health insurance funds reimbursed only
                      10 percent of the public hospital system's costs while their members accounted for 40 percent of its
                      activities.

                      In 1991, the World Bank approved a $30 million loan to help the government streamline the way
hospitals were run by keeping costs down while improving service quality. In addition, the  Hospital Restructuring Reform
Support Project  aimed to make sure that those organizations enjoying hospital services actually paid for them as well. To
these ends, the project decentralized decision-making and responsibilities in 23 of the largest hospitals, introducing modern
management processes and setting up boards for oversight. It also financed equipment maintenance and renovation.

When the project closed in late 1999, the government’s share of hospital financing had been cut in half from 69 percent in
1991 to 35 percent. Case load and services had risen, but hospitals still managed to reduce operating expenses by 27
percent. In short, more efficient hospitals now respond better to Tunisians’ health needs.
