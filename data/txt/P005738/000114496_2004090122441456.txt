Re:
Loan No. 3308 TUN
(Hospital Restructuring Support Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement      
Your Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Hospital Restructuring Support Project) dated 
May 22, 1991, as amended, between the Republic of Tunisia (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).  We also refer to 
your request contained in a letter dated November 18, 1998 to extend the Closing Date 
of the Loan and to amend the Loan Agreement in order to reallocate the proceeds of the 
Loan and increase the disbursement percentages of certain Categories.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank, after due consideration, has agreed 
to the above.  Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
1.
Section 2.03 is modified to read as follows:
“The Closing Date shall be September 30, 1999, or such later date as the Bank 
shall establish.  The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date.”
2.
In Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Loan), the table set forth in 
paragraph 1 is modified to read as set forth in the Attachment to this Letter.
All the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, as amended hereby, shall 
remain in full force and effect, it being understood, however, that the amended 
disbursement percentages shall only apply from the date of this Letter and upon 
receipt by the Bank of the duly countersigned copy thereof.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendments by signing and 
dating the confirmation on the enclosed copy of this Amendment Letter and returning it 
to us.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR  
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
