Proiect
Description:       The objectives of the project are to support the Government
policy in its effort to (i) address major hospital internal
efficiency issues to contain costs while improving quality of
services; and, <ii) provide the information that would permit
adjustments in financial burden-sharingi by better linking
actual utilization of hospital services to financial
contributions.  To this end, the project would include the
following components:
(a)   Devolooment  o:  management  canabilities  and  oglicv
adiustmeutu. The project would finance technical assistance,
training and office technology (hardware and software) to
develop  and  implement:    (i)  financial  management  and
performance  evaluation  procedures;       (ii)  a  Management
Information  System;   (iii)  the  reorganization  of  the
administration and patient registration units;  and,   (iv)
sectoral strategies and reform program management: a framework
and action plan for new burden-sharing arrangements, a medium-
term strategic plan for hospital development, hospital
architectural masterplans and reform program management.
(b)   Improvement of service aualitv.   The project would
support: (i) the replacement of priority medical equipment;
(ii) the strenghtening of hospital maintenance units; and,
(iii) improvements in patient accomodations, hospital hygiene,
and handling of medical wastes.
Denefits           The proposed project would address several critical issues
confronting the Tunisian health sector.  Major progres. i.
expected in: (i) hospital cost containxnent through enhanced
internal efficiency; and, (ii) better equity in the financing
of health care service. by providing the information that
allow the implementation of nethode to link utilization of



ii
services with burden-sharing responsibilities. Under favorable
conditions, while remaining stable in nominal terme, the
Government budget share in MOH resources could drop from 83%
to 56% by the end of the project, the social insurance programns
share increasing from 10% to 36%. Les. favorable conditions
would  limit  or delay  this  progreas.   This  would  peririt
austained improvementu in quality of servicea in the entire
public health sector that would benefit directly the vast
majo-ity of the population needing hospital and non-hospital
care. In addition, the project involve maternity hospitals
and maternity departments that provide for 43% of all attended
deliveries nationally. Hence, the qualitative improvements
for safe deliveries, obstetrical interventions and post-partum
care would be significant.
Riaka:             The main riuk relates to the technical ability of managers to
nuccessfully introduce and implement the hospital reforms and
overcome the system's rigiditiee and natural resistance to
change. To lower the risk due to limited experience and skills
of  local managers  in exercising authority,   training and
technical assistance are included in the project.   Another
possible risk is related to the lack of incentives among civil
service phyqicians to be cost-conscious in utilizing existing
resources.   This risk,  however,  wil. be mitigated by the
develoç -rt of a financial management model that would provide
co5t ana performance indicators and, in the new hospital legal
context would allow hospital managers to establish performance-
based incentives.  Finally, the benefits expected in terme of
adjustments in burden sharing arrangements will depend on the
degree of euccess that the Government will achieve in
negiotiating with its social partners. For that purpose, the
project aime at generating the cost and utilization information
that would help the Government conduct these rnagotiations in
the most favorable conditions.

HOSPITAL RESTRUC.,URINO SUPPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL RZPORT
I. OVERVZEW OF Tac HEALTE SCTOR
INTRODUCTION
1.01        After a decade of *conomic growth, the Tunisian *conomy began te
falter in the early 1980'. Oil expcrt *arnings *tarted declining as a resuit
of the depletion Df the Tunisian reserves and a fall in world oil prices. In
1985, to thwart a balance of payment crlais, the governmnt instituted policies
that encouraged exporte, cut back on inv*itmenta, limited wage increases, and
devalued the Tunisian Dinar.   Deopite theoe m-asure-, the *conomy neared a
critical state in 1986 because of a drought and the *till-declining world oil
prices.   More drastic measures wore implemented,  including the curbing of
imports, further jeduction of Government Lnvestmente and expenditures, and the
devaluation of the Tunisian Dinar again, to a leval 17.5% below the real
effective exch,ange rate of 1984.
1.02        Since 1987, the balance of paymento han recovered, ard the budget
deficit has been reduced. The Government of Tunisia ha. initiated the process
of shifting from a state-controlled to a market-driven, export-oriented economy
more capable of providing jobs and competing effectively abroad. These efforts,
combined with support from the Bank in the form of five adjustment operations -
two Agricultural Adjustment Loans (ASAL) in FY87 and FY89 (Lns no.2754 and
3078), the FY87 Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (ITPAL, Ln no. 2781),
the FY88 Structural Adjustment Lcan (SAL, Ln no. 2962) and the FY90 Public
Enterprise Restructuring Loan (PERL, Ln no. 3109)- are targeted in part to reduce
the current 15% rate rf unemployment among the working population.
1.u3        The pressures on the omployment market are compounded by a 2.3%
average annual population growth rate (although steadily declining, and lower
than all other Arab countries and at a level comparable to other middle-income
economies), stagnant net emigration, and rising female participation in the work
force.  The Government has initiated programs, supported by Bank lending, to
enhance family planning services thereby reducing population growth. However,
evidence of the positive impact of population policieo on the labor market will
not be seen immediately.
1.04        The growing population will continue to otrain the Tunisian economy,
as the financial needs of social sectors, namely education and health, grow.
This will ha'    a two-fold effect on the health sector.  Firot, the demand for
health serv .es will continue to increase both quantitatively and qualitatively,
as the morbidity patterns are slowlv moving from communicable diseases to chronic
and degenerative diseases more costly to address (para 1.07).   Second, the
resources of the sector will be constrained by a number of  factors.   If
unemp]oynent remains at relatively high levels, the growth of employment-related
insurance contributions will be limited and priority efforts to increase the
enrollment rate of segments of the population currently employed will be

necessary. It iE likely that Government policiez to control or reduce public
spendiLg will cotitinue to prevail and that,  as a -eault,  the cur:ent high
Gcvernment share in financing health services will have to decrease (the sharc
of the Government's budget allocated to MOH has decreased trom 7.9% in 1980 to
6.2% in 1989). Finally, the population's capacity to pay for health oervices
will be constrained by the slowly growing or even stagnant purchasing power of
a large portion of the population (real wages decreased by 2.8% irn  he firat half
of the 801s,, rec...itating better targeting of existing assistance programs
for the neeuy. These constraintu have reaulted in a decreabe of the percentage
of GDP allocated to the public health sector over the last five years, from 2.5%
in 1984 to 2.3% in 19E9.
1.05        The Tunisian health uoctor, and in particular the public sector,
which provides an eetimated 50% of ambulatory car- and 90% of hospital services,
faces a eerious challenges  to provide more health care services and ones of
better quality, with limited increase in the renourcee available. As in the
other sectors of the nation's economy, this translates into attempting to improve
the efficiency of the health sector operations,. while reexamining the current
financial burden-sharin7 arrangements to alleviate Governments  already
overstretched responbibi:-ities.
HEALTH AND DEMOGRAPHIC STATUS
1.06        Ir. the  last three decades, the health  statue of the Tunisian
population has improved significantly as a result of better living conditions,
greater accesa to education,  improved  nutrition,  the development  of  both
preventive and curative health care services, and lower birth rates.   Life
expectancy has increased from 41 to 67 yeare (females), and the crude death rate
has decreased from 16 per 1000 population in 1965 to 7 in 1988, as a result of
determined Government acticn and a GNP average annual growth rate per capita of
3.4% in real terme (1965-88). The infant mortality rate (IMR), which decreased
from 175 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1956 to '2 per 1,000 in 1989, is
currently the lowest in the Maghreb, while it remains on the high aide of upper-
middle income countries. However, this progreas has not occurred uniformally
over the countzy, and disparities between urban and rural areas are stili
significant.  IMR remains twice as high in rural areas, where the per'-entage of
womnen receiving prenatal care is still 35% lower than chat in urban areas.
1.07        The population of Tunisia, waich was 7.9 million in 1989, continues
to grow at a rate of 2.3% per vear, desDite a declire ia the total fertility rate
from an average 7 children per woman in 1956 to 3.5 children per woman in 1989.
Factors contributing to these improvements include an increased ma,riage age and
family planning efforts.   The morbidity patterns  in Tunisia parallel  the
evolution of its population structure.   The patterns reflect a mixture of
communicable diseases usually found in developing countries and a rapid increase
in the prevalence of degenerative diseases and chronic conditions, such as cancer
and cardio-vascular diseaaes.  The latter are more common in industrialized
countries which experience longer life expectancies and older populations.



.3-
HEALTH SECTOR RESOURCES
1.08        H1uman and Physical Resources.   In the post-colonial era, emphasis
has been placed on increasing access to health care services.   The ratio of
population per physician has decreased from one physician per 8,000 population
in 1965 to one physician per 1,750 population in 1989, with urban areas having
benefited most from this expansion of services (Annex 1, table 1). Attention
has also been focussed on the training of specialiets. Almost 50% of physicians,
of whom 72% have teaching responsibilities are *pecialized. This specialization
reinforces the urban hospital-based orientation of the Tunisian health care
system since specialist services are primarily available in the University
hospitals or specialized institutes.
1.09         In 1989, Tunisia had nome 17,400 hoepital beda, of which 94% were
part of the public sector (Annex 1, table 2). The ratio of 2.2 hospital beds
per 1000 population compares well to other middle-income economies.  However,
this figure may be misleading, as a number of beds may not qualify as hospital
beds considering the low level of associated medical equipment and etaffing.
This cautionary remark applies to a large portion of private sector hospital
beds, as well as to those in public district hospitals.
1.10        Financial resources.  In 1989, total health expenditures in Tunisia
equalled approximately  4.5% of GDP,  or US$62 per capita.   This  level of
expenditures situates Tunisia between its Maghreb neighbors, Algeria and Morocco,
which allot 5.4% of GDP (US$ 125 per capita) and 3.2% of GDP (US$ 30 per capita)h
respectively. However, it remains low compared to most OECD countries, which
allocate between 5.3% and 11.2% of their GDP (excluding Turkey at 3.5%), and te
most other middle-income nations. For example, Jordan, Chile and Columbia devote
respectively 8%, 5.3% and 7.8% of their GDP to health expenditures.
1.11        In 1987,  :he Government budget contributed 48% of the total sector
resources while social injurance programs and aouseholds contributed 19% and 33%,
respectively. Figures for 1989, which are partly estimated, indicate that th.
Government contribution has decreased to 44%, the insurance contribution and the
household share have grown to 20% and 36%,  respectively  (table 2.1).   By
comparison, in 1987 their respective distribution was 20%, 60% and 20% in
Algeria, and 23%, 21% and 56% in Morocco.  Public spending, which is defined as
including expenditures from Governments and social insurance programs, covers
between 41% and 97% in OECD countries, compared to 67% in Tunisia (table 1.1).

HEALTH SERVICES DELIVERY SYSTEN
1.12        The Tunisian health care eystem has alom improved significantly in
terms of physical infrastructures. Designed as a coherent network, Public Health
Facilities are etrategically located and classified according to the level of
care provided. At the firet level, the 1505 basic health centers, 95 district
hospitals and 6 free-standing maternities (maternites autonomes) are intended
to provide basic ambulatory health care and tiret level hospital services. At
the second level, there are 22 regional hospitalo, located primarily in rural
areas and designed to provide the population with mome *pecialized :are and
hospital services. Finally, the third level of care, encompassing teaching and
general hospitale, as well as specialized carQ institutes, in localed in the four
largest urban poleos (Tunis, Monastir, Sousoe and Sfax), and offers high-level
services. The national role of these third-tier facilities should be emphasized.
In 1989 they accounted, nationwide, for 43% of assioted deliveries, 45% of
hospital admissione, 60% of hospital days and 70% of surgical interventions.
Au a result of this three-level system, 90% of the population is within one-
hour walking distance from a public health care facility.
1.13         The ParaDublic Health Network belonge to the CNSS <Caisse Nationale
de sécurité Sociale) and consiste in 6 polyclinios located in the major cities.
The clinics provide ambulatory general practice, specialized care and
investigation services to private sector workers (and their dependents)
affiliated with the CNSS. The parapublic network was developed in the mid-80's
as a response to the perceived low quality of public health services and a still
insufficient provision of services from the private sector.
1.14         Finally, the Private Health Sector is concentrated in urban centers
and consists of 1567 medical offices, 602 dental offices, 968 pharmacies, 338
nursing health centers and 101 laboratories.  There are 35 private hospitals
which offer 1062 beds. However, more than 60% of these beds (mainly maternities)
do not qualify as hospital beds, considering the low level of medical technology
available.
II.   SECTOR ISSUES AND GOVERNKZNT STRATEOY
2.01         In 1988, the MOH initiated a broad review of the health sector and
in particular of the public sector, which highlighted two critical sets of
issues:   the inadequate financing of health services,  and the low internal
efficiency of public sector health facilities, particularly hospitals.
HEALTH FINANCING
2.02         The financing of the health sector  in Tunisia faces two major
constraints. First, overall sector financial resources are low as a result of
the marked underfunding of the public eector as compared to the scope of eervices
it is providing; second, financial burden-oharing arrangements enforced in the
public sector are inadequate to mobilize the needed resources.



2.03        Public sector underfundina.   In 1989, the public h-alth *ector
provided, nation-wide, 50% of ambulatory car* and over 90% of hospitalization
services; it delivered more than 80% of total curative care, and in addition
fulfilled its duties of public health and diease prevention, administration
and sector regulation.  At the *ame time, the public hoalth sector recoived
54.4% of the total health sector resources, while it in e*timated that the para-
public and the private *ectors utilited respectively 3.5% and 38.6% of overall

2.04        Following a period of growth between 1980 and 1984, the rebources
of the public health sector have decreased, au their share of GDP declined from
2.5% in 1985 to 2.3% in 1990. This in noteworthy as health sector expenditures
in most countries absorb a growing share of resources as GDP incroases.  In
other words, the Tunisian public health sector in getting leas of the national
wealth, while it continues to be by far the largest health care provider (of
the mont expensive services). It is difficult to compare directly how resourcee
of the public, para-public and private sectors have *volved, as the para-public
sector han existed only mince 1986 and as information on the private sector in
lacking. It is ectimated, however, that the share of theu- two sub-sectors in
GDP has been growing nteadily (to 2.1% in 1989) and will reach 2.2% in 1990. It



- 6 -
appears that, while total health expenditures have remained quite stable ijr
terms of GDP ehare, resources have shifted from the public to the growing para-
public and private sectors.   This transfer of resourcee,  however,  was not
accompanied by a comnmensurable transfer of responsibility in terme of activities
performed, and this imbalance is a major cause of the growing difficulties facing
the public health sector.
2.05        The relative decline in public health sector resources can be
attributed to several factors. First, the Government contribution, in regard
to the share of its budget (operating and investment) allocated to the MOH, has
declined between 1985 and 1989 from 7.9% to 6.2%. Nevertholess, the Government
budget'a contribution accounts for a growing share in MOH rec.urrent budget, from
82.6% in 1985 to 83.7% in 1989 and an estimated 84.8% in 1990.  Second, the
social insurance prograrne" contribu.Wion han actually d-creased in roel terme and
accounts in 1990 for 9.1% of the public health sector remources against 12.7%
in 1985. Finally, the households' contribution through direct payments and co-
payments has increased significantly, but has remained stable in terms of its
share, around 6% of MOH resources.
2.06        When associated with a low level of management capabilities, this
severe underfunding of the public health eector translates into chronic shortages
in equipment and supplies, insufficient maintenance, low staff morale and,
ultimately, poor and decreasing quality of services in the entire public sector
network (paras 2.19-2.20).  The first and second levels of care are the most
affected by this underfunding, leading the population to seek care in the high-
level hospitals where, despite the large share of allocated resources, conditions
are also uncertain and quickly deteriorating.
2.07        Public sector financial burden-sharino arrangements. It is estimated
that patients affiliated with the two major social insurance programs, CNSS and
CNRPS, constitute about 38% of admissions and 42% of outpatient visits in public
health facilities (table 2.2). Considering these figures, and assuming that the
case-mix for these patients correlates to the rest of the population, social
insurance programs should have contributed close te DT 80 million in 1989,
instead of the actual contribution of DT 21 million. This shortfall is a measure
of the potential improvement of health services if the burden werp shared more
equitably: an additional TD59 million would increase .he public health system
operating budget by 25% and the critically underfunded non-salary budget by 80%.
2.08        Actual health expenditures of the social insurance proc,:ams in 1989
are estimated at DT 86 million, of which about DT 65 million (75%) are spent on
services provided by the para-public and private sectors and on health care
outside the country.  By underfunding health services provided by the public
sector, the social insurance programs are, in relative terme, subsidizing para-
public and private providers. Government resources have not adequately covered

provides social benefits (pensions, health, sick pay, ..) to workers (and their dependents), eaployed in
private and para-public sectors; the CNRPS (Caisse Nationate de Retraite et de Prévoyance Sociale) provides
similar social benefits to Goverrwent's epçtoyees; the CREGT (Caisse de Retraite et de Prévoyance des
Personnels des Services PubLics de L'Electricité, du Gaz et des Transports) for the personneL (and

2.09        It .s not easy to determine the capacity of the social inourance
programs to bear a larger share of the MOH budget.  Information on the level of
resources generated by the Social Insurance programs through employers' and
employees' contributions to health service coverage ie difficult to estimate,
since the contributions to health insurance and retirement plans are not formally
dissociated. However, it is estimated that in 1987, CNSS and CNRPS -- the two
major insurance programe --   collected TD63 million through their health
insurance scheme, while their expenditures for health services totalled TD48.8
million.  This situation was not specific to 1987.  Social insurance programs
have repeatedly used extra resources generated through their health insurance
schemes to compensate for deficits incurred through other benefit schemes
(pensions) or to invest in activities outside the health sector.   Increasing
their contribution to the budget should therefore be possible as long as some
conditions are met (para 2.22), although a reduction in other forms of member
benefits, or improvementa in social security collection rates may be necessary.
in addition, because until now Governrment resources were matching the most
visible MOH financial gap, social insurance programe never developed pro-active
policies to expand their coverage of the employed population. Only 50.5% of the
active population is affiliated to the social insurance programs, ranging from
22.4% in the agricultural sector to 65.3% in the non-agricultural sector.
2.10        Better rates of enrollment in the social insurance programs can be
achLeved if attractive schemes are developed, and if the Government policy of
delivering free or highly subsidized vouchers for care in the public facilities
is drastically  reexamined.   According  to prevailing Government guidelines
defining the poverty threshold (which need to be reviewed to cover recent losses
in purchasing power), the Government should provide free or highly subsidized
care to only 8% of the population.   Currently about 40% of admissions and
outpatient visits in the public health sector are attributed to patients
registered as indigent (table 2.3).

2.11        The unwillingnese of the social insurance programs to contribute
more to the public health sector resources ie based on (i) the inability of the
public health sector to provide adequate information on the utilization of
services and more importantly, on the actual costs of services; and, (ii) the
low quality of services provided by public facilities.   The lack of proven
managing and accounting systeme to monitor the utilization of resources and the
cost of services, the lack of critical equipment and the deteriorating physical
conditions of hospitals are major instrumental factors contributing to this
situation. The Government's strategy for the sector and the proposed project
address these specific issues.
INTERNAL EFFICIENCY 1N HOSPITALS
2.12         In general, efficiency in the whole sector is low.  Although the
health care network was conceived and developed as a coherent system with a
pyramidal referral flow, it does not function efficiently. The different levels
of care do not adequately complement each other, and their potential is not
maximized. In parCicular, the district and, above all, the regional hospital
networks are underused. Distortions in service utilization are illustrated in
Annex 1, Fig. 1-4.
2.13        Low internal efficiency characterizes the Tunisian public hospital
network and results from a myriad of interrelated issues. Inefficiencies can
be identified under two main clusters, general and technical inef.iciencies.
2.14        General inefficiencies.  Administrative and budgetary policies are
rigid and hamper substitution of input factors. This inflexibility obstructs
the search for cheaper combinations of inputs for service provision.  Personnel
and civil service regulations impede the efficient management of staff and the
provision of incentives. Information failure is a major management handicap.
Managerial diagnosis and sensible choices of options cannot be made because
related information is not available and skilled managerial staff is lacking.
Operationally, two dimensions of these issues should be addressed:
(i)   these constraints are beyond the control of the few, generally
untrained hospital administrators, hence adjustments in the
organizational and policy environmenta are necessary;
(ii)  a cadre of high and mid-level hospital managers should be recruited
and managerial skills developed over a broad base so as to include
the key mid-level administrators. selective functional training of
a few top administrators would not be sufficient to significantly
improve the system.
2.15        The lack of clear definition of responsibility among the different
levels of management, the lack of trained managers and the absence of management
systems typify the current inefficiency in the operation of the public health
sector. Hospital personnel lack management skills and standardized methods and
procedures to follow in monitoring performance in the provision of services,
patient flow, therapeutic procedures, as well as inputs such as inventory and
utilization of resources. True coste of care are unknown.



-9
2. 16       The registraticn of patients for inpatient services or outpatient
visits is strictly an administrative task, providing MOH with only very general
activity information.   Geographic origin of the patients in generally not
recorded. Deficiencies in the recording of admission diagnosis and treatment
hinder any analysis of the justification for the visit or admission at that level
of care.  Social statue is usually recorded in order to collect payment for
services rendered to patients entitled to foe-for services, or co-payment in the
case of indigent and insured patients. However, the hompital management does
not systematically compile that information which would support its budget
request to MOH and to the central authorities to negotiate financing levels and
hospital resources with the various financiers.
2.17        In some cases, a patient can walk into a facility from one of several
entrances, receive care, and leave the facility without ever having been
registered as a patient, thereby avoiding paying for services.  Reinforcing
registration capabilities, through the improvement of patient registration and
information areas and the provision of adequate technology, will in turn
facilitate the monitoring of patients and of care rendered. Adequate patient
information is fundamental to effective management of health care systems
management.    Also,  the  availability  of  infcrmation  minimizes  service
duplications, reduces coste, and contributes to patients' comfort, welfare and
quality of care by checking a whole apectruà of diagnostic tests and exploratory
and invasive procedures.
2.18        Obvious flow activities, such as arrivals and releases in various
hospital departments, are generally recorded, so that aggregate indicators such
as occupancyrates and average length of stay are available (Annex 3, table 2).
However, managers lack information to monitor the utilization of resources, and
there is no analysis of whether the treatment rendered is consistent with the
primary diagnosis.  Occupancy rates and average length of stay vary greatly
within and among facilitieu.  The high range of variation in the average length
of stay in some similar departments within facilities of identical level of care
(Annex 3, table 3) suggeste that the variation is not due to case-mix
differences. Rather, the level of utilization and the combination of different
inputs are almost unregulated, following no procedural standards, or are
£ndirectly determined by variations in beds, equipment, materiale and personnel
supply.
2.19        Technical inefficiencies.  The sources of inefficiency involving
tecnnical waste of resources are numerous.   A pervasive problem negatively
affecting hospital performance is the mediocre level of maintenance at three
levels: buildings and electro-mechanical equipment, medical equipment and support
services.   In addition to bio-medical equipment,  significant probleme are
encountered in the maintenance of heating systeme, ventilation, electric supply,
sterilization,  kitchen and laundry facilities.   In general, maintenance is
postponed because capabilities are scarce or resources are limited. About 30
percent of the medical equipment in hospitals is obsolete and about 60 percent
of the physical amenities require refurbishing. To address these issues, MOH's
strategy through the reform program is to allow and encourage hospital managers
to buy curative maintenance services directly from the private market rather than
to build up such capabi.ities within an already inefficient system.   This



- 10 -
strategy is justified by the large variety of items, apecifications and spare
parts available due to the diverse sources of supply. However, development of
institutional capabilities would be actively promoted for diagnostic and
preventive maintenance as well as for enmergency needs.
2.eO       IInefficient use of resources or the lack of such resources exacerbate
the vicious cycle of general  inefficiency.   The lack of simple diagnostic
equipment  or  its  poor  quality  leads  to more  expensive  procedures  being
undertaken. Examples abound in ultrasound, obstetrics and radiology. The lack
of specific drugs may lead to unnecessary surgical treatment instead, for example
in the treatment of peptic ulcers. The lack of standards monitorinq exacerbates
over-prescribing, incorrect prescribing, or paradoxically, under-prescribing of
medication. Patients are kept on the wards unnecessarily, waiting their turn
for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Continuing training on uniquely ad
hoc basis reduces staff quality and efficiency. Inventory and supplies management
are rudimentary resulting in mismanagement and losses. Blood banks are short
of refrigeration and processing equipment frequently leading to wastes and
shortages when needs are moet acute.
OOVERNMENT STRATEOY
2.21        For decades, the Government health policy has put emphasis on
improving access to health services by investing heavily at all levels of care.
As a result, and despite some regional imbalances which are being addressed,
access to health care is now satisfactory. The Government's main concern has
therefore shifted towards consolidating these achievements by improving the
effectiveness, quality and efficiency of services rendered and, more generally,
the economic sustdinability of health services.
2.22        The Government has outlined a comprehensive reform plan for its
public health sector. Major reforms have been undertaken regarding:
(i)     the institutional framework: the largest health facilities are being
granted financial and administrative autonomy and efforts are
underway to progressively decentralize the management of health
activities and resource allocation at the regional level.
(ii)    the health orofession, by promoting deconcentration of personnel
towards primary and secondary facilities by selective incentives;
improving equipment in the peripheral units; promoting exchanges of
health professionals among the different levels; assessing
performance and adjusting training curricula; and,
<iii)   the financial burden-sharing arrancements by updating existing fee-
sch.dules for medical and non-medical services on the basis of unit
costs provided by the generalization of cost-accounting systems;
reassessing the benefits criteria for free and reduced-cost vouchers,
known  as  "indigence  programs";  consolidating  and  harmonizing
benefits under current insurance schemes, with extension to non-
insured segments of the population; and, generalizing cost-sharing
mechanisms (Annex 2).



- il -
2.23        Major concrete actions have already been taken.  First, regarding
the health profession, the heade of clinical departments in teaching hospitals
have been limited to five-year appointments and the extension of their terms
subject to performance aseeBsment.   Also, newly recruited physicians are now
required to serve a minimum of two yeare in rural areas.  Second, regarding the
financial burden-sharing arrangements, the following meaBures have been taken
(Annex 2): (i) the fees applicable to non-insured and non-indigent patiente are
being doubled in a two-step process (November 1, 1950 and November 1, 1991); (ii)
the co-payments applicable to insured and some category of indigent patients will
increase by 50% by January 1991; (iii) MOH, CNSS and CNRPS reached an agreement
on a program to enhance medical technology in public hospitals. CNSS and CNRPS
would finance up to TD 50 million (US$59 million) over the next five years. A
firet TD20 millLon two-year tranche (90-91), which includes the provision of
equipment as well as of finances to cover incremental operating expenditures
associated with these investments, has been agreed.
2.24        The objective pursued by the n.^vernrment is clear:  develop more
equitable burden arrangements among the health sector institutional financiers,
and consequently, among the different segments of the population. To reach this
objective, the Government strategy is to rationalize and update existing
mechanisms, rather than to develop and experiment a new approach. Specifically,
these mechanisme include public mandatory health insurance as the main mechanism,
co-payments to control unjustified demand (both quantitatively amd qualitatively)
and, finally the Government intervention to regulate the implementation of these
mechanisme and financial equilibrium. This regulatory role is critical, since,
as mentionned earlier, the inadequate operation of the social ineurance programe
and the populatior. professional and economic patterns combined, call for a
massive financial contribution from the Government.
2.25        Therefore, achieving the stated objectives in terms of burden sharing
arrangements, depende not only of the Government will and commitment, but also
of his capacity to successfully negotiate the needed changes, with his social
partners. These negotiated changes would take place when the information on the
hospital cost and utilization patterns is available, and the magnitude of the
transfer of financial responsibility from the Government to other sector
financiers will largely depend on the economic situation at that time.
2.26        Large hospitals are likely to remain key actors in the overall
performance of the health sector. The Government has therefore identified the
orpanization, manaaement and financino of public hosoitals as a priority area
of action. As a major step, the 22 largest facilities (teachinr hospitals and
specialized institutions) have been selected as the sites for the proposed
reforms (Annex 3, table 1). Subsequent phases which are -.ot covered under the
proposed project would include generalizing these rr.orms to reach regional
hospitals and, further, the whole health care netw,rk.
2.27        Two  main  factors  justify  the  reform's  focus  on  third-level
facilities.  Firet, the 22 third-tier hospitals and institutes concerned absorb
an estimated 50% of the public health sector's resources. Attempting to control
escalation of costs is a priority at a time when epiderniological changes may
inflate them, and efforts directed at strengthening lower levels of care require
additional operating resources. Second, because the social insurance programs



- 12 -
either operate their own ambulatory health care network (CNSS) or rely on the
private sector for ambulatory care, moat of the services provided to their
beneficiaries in the public health sector occur in urban hospitals and
specialized institutes. The reform of burden-sharing arrangements, whose aim
is to charge actual coste to usera through their social insurance programe and
which would permit reallocation of resources within the sector, conetitutes a
major objective of the Government.  To that end, efforts to improve efficiency
and quality of services and to gain knowledge of utilization and coat patterns
are to be directed in priority towarde the third-tier facilities.
2.28        The  emphasis  on  the  reform  of  high-level  facilities  could
legitimately raise the concern that by improving the efficiency and quality of
services, the demand for high-level hospital services may increase. This would,
in turn, further reinforce the relative over-utilization of thea- facilities
compared to lower-level care (para 2.12) and require additional resources to
match the increased demand. In fact, this possibility ehould not be of concern
for the following reasons: (i) the current utilization of hospital services can
be considered as "maximal", since it is constrained neither by purchasing power
nor by limited bed capacity. Acceou to high-level public hospitale ie currently
subject to minimal or no charge, for most of the population. Expected future
demand increases due to epidemiological changes would be matched by Government
efforts to strengthen lower-level care, thereby reducing unjustified utilization
of higher level facilities.  The adjuetments considered by the Government in
terms of fee-for-services and co-paymente ehould ease that prospect; and, (ii)
as already mentioned, the public sector provides over 90% of hospital services.
The potential increase would therefore be marginal and due mainly to patients
either insured or entitled to pay for services (those who may currently access
the private sector).   This increase would be easily matched by additional
resources, as the Government is reconeidering the burden-sharing arrangements,
namely the social insurance programe contribution,  co-payments and fee-for-
service schedules (para 2.22, 2.23 and Annex 2).
BANK EXPERIENCE WITH LENDIN0 IN THE SECTOR
2.29         In 1971, the Tunisian Government received a US$4.8 million IDA credit
to address population sector issues, including improving accese to family
planning (FP) and maternal and child health services (MCH). The credit provided
for the construction and equipment of four maternity hospitale, 29 MCH centers,
and an extension of the Avicenne Paramedical Training School in Tunis.   In
addition, management consultante and technical assistance for paramedical
training and evaluation of the MCH/FP program were provided. The project was
completed in 1981 at a cost of US$35 million, a figure well above the initial
appraisal estimate of US$7 million. The additional cout, attributed to delays
in implementation and price eecalation, was met by additional financing provided
by the Norwegian aid (NORAD) and the Government of Tunisia. The main impact of
the project was an expansion of services.
2.30        A US$12.5 million Bank loan for a second health and population
project became effective in 1982. The overall project objective was to integrate
FP services with preventative and curative services, nutrition, health education
and sanitation in 8 governorates. Similarly to the firet project, emphasis in



- 13 -
the second one was on the expansion of services. The project was completed in
1989 and involved the construction and/or remodelling of 140 health poste, 325
dispensaries, 90 staff houses, 2 regional health education centers, 6 paramedical
achools, and 8 maintenance workshops. In addition, the project supported the
initial introduction of a Management Information System to enhance management
capabilities of the MOH, the inaugu-ation of a national health education program
and the implementation of a training system for health personnel.
2.31        A third health and population project was ider.tified in 1984 to
extend the basic health center concept, yet it was not pursued due to concerna
about the recurrent coste and the overall relevance of such a project, if taken
in isolation from systemic reforme.
2.32         Important lessons can be drawn from past Baak group involvement in
Tunisia's health sector. Firat, Government action has zonstantly been oriented
towards fostering growth of the sector to ensure better access to services.
However, operating resources (recurrent expenditures) have never adequately
matched needs, resulting in low quality and underutilization of services,
especially at the first and second levels of care. Second, efforts to improve
this situation have been plagued by the chronic inefficiency of the public
hospital sub-sector, which puts a major atrain on eector resources. Third,
significant improvemento can only be achieved through a major development of
management capabilities, the enhancement of managerial reaponsibilities through
a higher degree of autonomy, the renewal of equipment and priority renovation
to restore the quality of care to an acceptable level, while simultaneously
addressing the current imbalances in burden-aharing arrangements between the
Government budget and the social insurance programe, principally the CNSS and
CNRP5.
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
2.33        The comprehensive restructuring of the tertiary hospital sub-sector
is prerequisite to a review of the financial burden-sharing arrangements that
would help contain public expenditure on higher-level curative services and
release resources for primary health care. This restructuring encompasses major
enhancements of management capabilities and autonomy of decisions, coupled with
improvements in medical technology and priority facility renovation. The Bank's
experience with public enterprise restructuring in most sectors of the Tunisian
economy, and its sustained advisory role in the design of health finance reforms
in particular, put it in a privileged position to assist MOH in this criticai
phase.
2.34        The proposed project would build on the overall framework of public
finance discipline and enterprise reform pursued under the Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL, Ln.2962-TUN) and the Public Enterprises Rationalization Loan (PERL,
Ln.  3109-TUN).   Parallel efforts are being undertaken in the entire human
resources sector with on-going operations and new ones under preparation in the
education sector.
2.35        The project constitutes one aide of a two-fold comprehensive approach
to the health sector that the Government has developed with the Bank support.
It also includes the proposed FY91 Population and Family Health Project, whose



- 14 -
main thrust  is to reatore credibility to primary and first-leve. refria'
services, thereby alleviating pressure on the hospital system. The tW .   i I,t t9
are closely linked, as their respective objectives and proposed dCt   t    are
complementary and support each other.   Their different  scOpS' a;id I *M  A

their implementation remain independently undertaken.
II.   THE PROJECT
THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
3.01        The  proposed  project  would  act  as  a  major  vehicle  in  the
implementation of the policy orientations of the Government reform prcograur. as
described in paras 2.21 and 2.22.   These policies emphasize the neel f:r:
(i) adjusting the  Ieaal and orcanizational framework  in order to increase
administrative and financial autonomy and the accountability of the Iargest
health facilities; and (ii) reconsidering the financial burden-sharino mec amsqs
to ensure regular, efficient and equitable mobilization of resources t. tre
health sector.
3.02        The project's  successful  implementation  is contingent  up^n the
Government's commitment to introduce and pursue the adjustments outlined
policy framework. The hospitals considered under the project would Le,s!'e
"Etablissements Publics de Santé" (EPS).  EPS's legl statutes would enabie tie
development of the proposed organizational structure, institute a Board of
Directors, concentrate the executive authority at the hospital level (General
Manager and Directors), and allow for financial and administrative ancr'
(Annex 4).  Therefore, the enactment by the parliament of the law creating the
EPS, whose approval by the Government has been confirmed during negotiations,
and the formal conversion into EPS of the four hospitals listed under part A of
Annex 3, Table 1, and nomination of their General Managers, are conditiorns of
effectiveness  (para 7.02  (b).   The remaining eighteen hospitals  w-ll be
transformed into EPS as follows: eight hospitals by December 31, 1992 (part B,
Annex 3, table 1), five hospitals by December 31,  1993  (part C, Annex 3,
table 1), and the remaining five hospitr'a by December 31, 1994 (part D, Annex 3,
table 1) (para.7.01 (a) and (b). For these hospitals, the disbursement of loan
proceeds for equipment (excluding computer equipment) will be conditioned to
the prior transformation into EPS of hospitals referred to in Part B and C, and,
for civil works to the prior transformation of hospitals in Part B (para. 7.03)
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.03        The overall objective of the proposed project is to improve the sub-
sector's efficiency and quality of service, and to help alleviate the heavy
burden imposed on Government resources by the largest hospitals.  Specificaily,
the project would support the Tunisian Government's reform program designed to
attain two main objectives:



- 15 -
to Lmprove the internai efficiency of major general, specialized and
maternity  hospitals,  while  simultaneouely  containing  costu  and
Lmproving the quality of services; and,
t,)    to allow future adjustmentB in financial burden-sharing through the
formulation of data to better link actual utilization of hospital
services with financial contributions by insured and non-poor
uninsured patiente
3.0a        The  institutions  targeted  by  the  project  include  10  general
aos, tals, 3 free-standing maternity hospitals and 9 specialized hospitals and
institutes including the National Inatitute of Nutrition.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.05        Within the inBtitutional framework described above (para 3.02), the
project would be implemented over a six-year period and consist of the following
components:
A.    Develoament of Management Capabilities and Policy Adiustments
- Financial Management and Performance Evaluation Proceduree;
- Computerized Management Information Systeme Development;
- Reorganiza.tion of Admi-nistrative and Patient Registration Sections;
- Sectoral Strategy Development and Project Management.
B.    Service-Ouality Improvements:
- Replacement of Priority Medical Equipment;
- Strengthening of Hospital Maintenance Units;
- Improvement of Patient Accommodations and Hospital Hygiene.
A.    Development of Management Capabilities and Policy Adiustmonts
(US519.9 million)
a)     The Financial Management and Performance Evalvation Procedures
(US$3.0 million)
3.06        Financial Management model. The project would provide 8 man-months
of technical assistance (6 nationals and 2 foreign) to the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU), for the development of a financial management model which includes
three integrated components: (i) the financial management manual; (ii) an annual
financial report to serve as an the evaluation tool; and (iii) a Collection of
Directives and/or Memorandums issued by MOH as guidelines for effective financial
management. The manual would be prepar-d by September 30, 1991 for joint review
by MOH and the Bank, to thoreafter be used au part of the tra-niag of managerial
staff and distributed to senior and mid-level administrators within the hospitals
transformed into EPS starting January 1, 1992 (para 7.01 (f)).
i 07        Human  Resources  Develodment.    To  implement  the  new  hospital
organizational structure (Annex 4), the Government is planning to progressively
cre te about 250 positions in administration, finance, hospital operations,



- 16 -
maintenance and security, and hygiere in the 22 hospitals involved. An analysis
of the existing personnel resources revealo that, in view of the staff profile
required to fill the new positions, most of the staff (at least 50%) will have
to be recruited or seconded to the MOH.  Placing qualified managers in their
respective positions, with clearly defined responsibilities, will be instrumental
to improving both resource and personnel management. The proposed organizational
plan would be applied in the Specialized Instituteo and Teaching Hospitalo with
enough flexibility to take into account the cpecific needs of each facility.
3.08        The project would support the following training programe which would
involve more than 1000 staff in the concerned hospitals:
Trginina for General Managers.  Directors and Division Chiefs in
Hogsital Oroanizatilon and Managements local training would be
undertaken in Tunis by MOH'o "Centre de Recherche et de Formation
Pédagogique"  <CFRP), jointly with the Tunis "Ecole Supérieure de
Commerce" (LSC) (140 man/months); overseas training would be
organized by CRFP in collaboration with foreign hospitals (400
man/monthe excluding meintenance staff);
Trainina for Staff in charae of developina the Manaaement Information
Syste:m overneas training for 35 people in charge of technical
support, systemi development and program management, would be
coordinated by the CFRP and the "Centre d'Informatique Sanitaire"
(CIS) (para 3.12), and would amount to 60 man/months. In addition
to proper techniquee and practices for developing and operating the
system, staff would be trained to analyze the data generated ae a
tool for management purposes and policy development;
Trainina in Hospital Maintenance for Division and Section Chiefs:
Division chiefo  would be trained overseas (220 man-montha); Section
Chiefs (electro-mechanic maintenance and biomedical maintenance)
would be trained locally (28 man-montho) with external TA for
preventive maintenance achedule development (6 man-months) and
training of trainers overseas (30 man-montho);
Support to the Hoapitai Manacement MA Dearee proaram: this program
is launched by the Tunis ESC; the prLoject would provide 6 man-months
TA (visiting foreign lecturers);
Trainina Fellowshios:  3 one-year fellowzlips in health economice,
hospital planning and hospital management.
Information and orientation seminars:  CRFP would organize seminars
in the 22 hospitalu to facilitate the integration of the proposed
reforme into the existing structure. Within the Medical Departmento,
the heade of department, intendants and nurse supervisors would be
informed of their duties and reeponsibilities within the proposed
new organizational structure. A total of about 1000 persons would
be involved.

b)    Compgterized. Ma,nagement Information Sytemu Develooment
(US $7. 1 Mi l l lon)
3.09        In order to generate and treat the information needed to provide
effective managemrent tools, a Management Information System would be developed
and introdu-ed as detailed in Annex 5. It would include the provision of hardware
and software for equipping 500 work stations in the 22 hospitals, 5 of MOH's
regionai directorates and the central MOH as well as maintenance services. '0
man monthe technical assistance would be provided to support, set-up and test
the systems. Staff training would be provided to 35 persons over a 5-year period
(para 3.09).
3.10        Computerization of hospital data would *ignificantly er.nance the
hospitals' ability to coordinate and monitor the system's inputs, outputs,
consumption and utilization. Specifically, management information systems would
improve: (i) personnel management, (ii) management of supplies and equipment,
(iii) management of patient files, (iv) monitoring of treatments rendered, (v)
generation of bills for the services delivered and the resourcea used, and (vi)
general accounting and financial control of the hospitall. activities.
3.11        It is essential that management policies, norms and procedures be
applied homogeneously by all hospitals in the implementation of their
computerized systeme, and that MOH be in a position to closely monitor,
coordinate and apply corrective measures when necessary. To that end, a Center
for Health Information (CIS) would be created as an 'Etablissement Public à
caractère Industriel et Commercial" (EPIC), a legal statua identical to the
existing "Centre National d'Informatiaue" (CNI) or the "Centrei Informatique du
Ministère des Finances".  The draft law creating the CIS es an EPIC has been
approved by the Government and the CIS shall have been eltablished and its
director appointed by Feptember 30,  1991  (para 7.01(d)>.   This financially
autonomous body would have responqibility for the managemenI'Lt standardization
and coordination of the hospital computer network developmen--. and would offer
the services of its staff to hospitals for the developrent,  distribution,
installation, and maintenance of comput.er systems.   Contracral arrangements
between MOH, the EPS and the CIS will be formalized and commun, :ated to the Bank
prior to the implementation ci the MIS in the first hospital.
3.12        In addition, a commission would be appointed with;i three months
after the creation of CIS to ensure that the needs of the userc  '; the MIS are
being met by the services provided by (CS.   The commissiot wiuld include
representatives from the CNIS and the PCU au well as from the ins9i-utions that
use the service (hospitale, regional directorates of health, MOI!)
c)    Reoroantzation of Administrative and Patient Registration Sections
(US$8.8 million)
3.13        This component involves the administration and patient registration
units and would provide the facilities -- space,  furniture, equipment,  and
supplies -- necessary to carry out the new administrative services which are
vital to the implementation of the reform. As the administrative and management
functions are currently very limited, existing facilities have not been developed
and are inadequate to permit autonomous management bv the facility, according



- 18 -
ta the generic organizational chart developed (Annex 4).  The implications of
thLs new operational model have been reflected in preliminary architectural
re4u reCents for the 22 hospitals, based on several parameters including the size
cf each, hospital, the condition of existing facilities, and the projection of
future needs.  About 14,500 m  of space would be redeeigned according to the
proposed specifications, which were found to be eatisfactLcy at appraisal, and
about 8,600 m of opace would be added to the existing sites.
d)    Sectoral Strateav Develooment and Proiect Management (US$1. 1 million)
3.14         Medium-term Plan for Hoseital Network Develoiment.  A strategic plan
for the restructuring and development of the hospital sector over the next 10
years would be formulated. The project would support technical assistance (9
man/months) and logistice for a multidisciplinary team constituted of members
from  PCU  and  MOH's  Directorate  of  Planning  and  Studies  (DEP).    The
recommendations of the plan would be discussed in a national seminar involving
senior representatives from MOH, the Ministries of Planning and Regional
Development, Finance, and the Interior, social insurance programs, and the
private sector.
3.15         The  plan  would  build  upon  the  Government's  national  health
objectives; estimates of future hospital needs of the population; financial
projections at the macro-economic and sectoral levels; and the rules and
regulations shaping the institutional structure of the sub-sector.   The plan
would include monitoring indicators.   A draft plan would be circulated for
comments to all institutions involved in its implementation. Review of the plan
and its implementation would be conducted on a yearly basis. The medium-term
plan for hospital notwork development will be formulated and submitted to the
Bank for review by September 30, 1992 (para 7.01(o)).
3.16         Development of Hospital Architectural Masterplans.  The development
of architectural masterplans is critical for 9 hospitals among the largest and
oldest (Annex 3, table 1).  It constitutes a prerequisite for the implementation
of several project components in those facilities (reorganization of
administrative sections, introduction of the MIS). For that purpose, the project
would finance USSS20,000 for contracting consulting firme. These masterplans
would be formulated and reviewed with the Bank by December 31, 1992. No activity
related to the rehabilitation of administrative and patient rogistration areas
(para.3.13) will be implemented in the hospitala concornod before the approval
of these masterplana by the Bank (para 7.01(g)).
3.17         Framework for Financial Burden-Sharing Arrangements.  To assist the
Government in developing new burden-aharing arrangements in line with the main
objectives and orientation which have been defined previously (para 2.22 and
Annex 2), the project would include the following three studies to be realized
by the PCU with an external support estimated at 9 man/monthe (6 nationale and
3 foreign):
the evaluation of existing free or reduced cost voucher programs
known as "Assistance Médicale Gratuite" systems, and specification
of options and time frame for reforms;



- 19 -
-     the evaluation of the Health Insurance components of existing Social
Insurance programa, with special emphasis on complementary systems
('assurances-groupe", "mutuelles,), and specification of options
and tim- frame for reforme;
-     the  formulation    of  a methodology  to  charge  actual  hospital
expenditures to the different in-titutional financiers and of a
timeframe for its implementation.
3.18        During negotiations,  the Government reaffirmed itc intention to
pursue its financial etrategy for the health sector, as outlined in paragraph
2.22 and Annex 2 (letter from the Minister of Public Health provided at the
beginning of negotiations). The above-mentioned studios will be compl-ted by
december 31, 1993 and their recommendations present.d to the Governu-nt by
December 31, 1994 (para 7.01(c).
3.19        Reform  Proaram  Imiolementation and Manaaement.   To  support  the
creation and operations of the Hospital Restructuring Management Board (CGRH)
(para 5.01), in charge of coordinating and superviuing the implementation of the
reform program, the project would finance technical assistance, office technology
and logistics for the PCU (para 5.03).
B.    ImDrovements in Ouality of Service (USS22.6 million)
a)    Replacement of Priority Medical Eauipment. (USS10.0 million)
3.20        The project would provide medical equipment to improve diagnostic
and therapeutic capabilities as well as the quality of medical services where
deficiencies have been highlighted (para 2.19). The technical specifications
and quantities of equipment have been assessed during the project preparation
and appraisal based on visita conducted in the field. Equipment to be provided
is exclusively replacement medical equipment whose current shortage is severely
detrimental to adequate hospital operations.
b)    Strenqthenino of Hospital Maintenance Units. (USS1.4 million)
3.21        A lack of maintenance of physical facilities and medical equipment
was identified as a major drawback of Tunisian hospitals (para 2.18) The new
organizational structure would address this problem through the creation of a
maintenance section whose managerial staff would be trained (para 3.09) and
provided with required management software (para 3.10). In addition, the project
would provide equipment and tools for the maintenance units.   To ensure its
proper allocation and use, this equipment would be made available to the
maintenance units only after their managerial staff have been trained.
c)    Improvement of Patient Accommodations, Hospital Hvaiene, Environment
Protection and Hazard Prevention. (USS11.2 million)
3 .22       Unsuitable physical conditions in a number of hospital wards are
detrimental to patients and staff morale and to the medical care rendered. In
order to improve mediocre accommodations and hygiene, the project would provide
for (i) the replacement of 2/3 of existing beds and bed sets, mobile partitions



- 20 -
for patient wards, improvementa in meal distribution, and priority replacement
of kktchen and laundry equipment; and, (ii) priority renovation of electric,
sanitation, heating and air-conditioning networks.
3.23         Environment Protection.   As part of the project,  the needs and
options of the concerned hospitals for the handling of medical wastes and hazard
protection would be assessed (2 man-mon.hs)by December 31, 1993, and specific
recommendations proposed for implementation.   Pending the conclusion of this
study,  installation  costs  for each of the  17 hospitals  not equipped  with
incinerators or fire protection systems have been estimated at US$60,000 per
facility.
IV.  PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCINO
PROJECT COSTS
4.01         Project  coste including taxes and duties are estimated at 42.1
million Tunisian Dinars (TD), or USS49.5 million equivalent. This calculation
includes the cost of rehabilitating and/or expanding administrative and patient
registration areas in the 22 hospitals covered under the project, as well as
professional services to develop these plans, expert services for the elaboration
of architectural masterplans for 9 of these hospitals, provision of hardware and
software for the computerized management information system and related technical
assistance for ita implementation, provision of furniture and medical equipment
to upgrade hotel and medical services, local and foreign specialist services to
develop training modules and realize three studies, educational information
materials for training, and computer and office equipment for the project
managinq unit (see Table 4.1).

4.03         Basis of Cost Estimates.  Costs of rehabilitating and/or expanding
the hospitals' administrative and patient registration areas are based on joint
aank/MOH preliminary estimates of the areas needed in each hospital and on recent
contracta  awarded by the MOH.   Areas  needed  for each  hospital  have been
determined by inventorying existing facilities and evaluating neede in relation
to the proposed organizational structure.  The costs of these works average
US$352 per m2 (300DT per m2) for the extension of current facilities, and US$118
per m2 10ODT per m2) for the rehabilitation of existing structures. Furniture
and equipment costs have been estimated on the basis of recent contracte. Needs
and costs of computer equipment and installation for each of the facilities are
based on the capacity (number of beds, admissions and consultations) and the
particularities (infrastructure, administrative staff, activity, proximity of
other institutions) of each facility; the unit cost per station has been
estimated between US$8,000 and US$10,000.   Office equipment coste have been
calculated  on  the  basis  of  quotations  and mission  estimates.   T-chnical
assistance costs - US$12,OO0 per man-month of foreign specialiat *ervices and
US55,000 per man-month of local specialist services - have been estimat.d on the
basis of recent prices for comparable technical assistance in the Education and



- 22 -
TraLning Sector Loan (Loan 3054TUN). The man-month coste of foreign speciallsts
include housing, relocation coste, salaries, subsistence, office services, fees,
overheads and recruitment costs.  Baee cost estimates reflect prices as projezted
for the time of negotiations (January 1991).
4.04        Custome Duties and Taxes.  Project costa include taxes and customs
duties for the project items estimated at USS9.7 million (TD8.2 million).
4.05        Continaencv  Allowances.    Project  colts  include  a  contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions (US$2.4 million), equal to 6% of
the estimated base coat of the project.  Price contingencies between negotiations
(January 1991) and the end of project implementation are estimated at US$4.6
million equivalent, or 10% of base cost plus physical contingencies.   Total
contingencies represent 14% of the base cost. Price increases have been applied
to both local and foreign coete and for all categories at a 3.4% annual rate.
It is expected that differentialB between foreign and local inflation during
project implementation would be reflected in an adjustment to the exchange rate.
4.06        Foreign Exchanae ComDonent.  The foreign exchange component has been
determined by: (a) estimating the indirect foreign exchange of construction;
(b) assuming that all equipment would be imported; and (c) estimating the foreign
and local specialists who will need to be recruited. These estimates resulted
in the following percentages: (a) construction and refurbishment of existing
facilities - 40%; (b) medical equipment - 72%; (c) accommodations furniture and
equipment - 60%; (d) computer equipment - 85%; (e) expert services - 26%; and
(f) training - 90%. As these percentages including contingencies, the resulting
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$30 million, or about 61% of total
project costs.
4.07        Recurrent Costa.  Incremental recurrent costs result primarily frorr
the recruitment of managerial staff, the maintenance of new medical and computer
equipment, and the CIS (table 4.3).  It is estimated that, by the end of the
project implementation, they would amount, by the end of project implementation,
to 5.1% of the 1990 consolidated operating budget of the 22 hospitals involved.
This estimate is based on the very conservative assumption that all management
and administrative staff would be recruited from outside the public health
system.   This would represent  1.6% of the 1996 MOH resources,  assuming a
continued small share of MOH resources in the GDP of 2.3%. Assuming that MOH
resources grow to reach 2.7% of GDP in 1996 (para. 6.02), as a result of progress
achieved through the project, incremental expenditures would represent 1.3% of
MOH budget, or 3.6% of the growth of the MOH resources between 1990 and 1996.
4.08        SavingB induced by the better management of personnel and supplies,
performance monitoring  and cost  accounting would  offset  these  incremental
financial needs.  Better management of supplies would result, for a similar level
of services, in 5 to 10% savings in the non-salary budget, or TD1.5 to 3 million
annually, based on 1990 figures.  Better case handling due to the availability
of diagnostic equipment and monitoring of activities would reduce the average
length of stay (ALOS) by a minimum of 20%. Thie would result in an additional
7 to 10% saving in the non-salary budget, totalling TD2 to 3 million annually.
Combined, these two sources of savinge alone would offset the project-related
incremental cost. Furthermore, improvements in the quality of services and cost

PROJECT FINANCING
4.09         The proposed Bank loan of US$30 million would finance 100% of the
foreign exchange component of the project, equivalent to 75% of the total project
costs net of taxes. The Goverrine.it would finance the balance of the project
costs, cr US$19.S million (which includes US$9.7 million in taxes and duties).
Project financing would be in accordance with Table 4.4.  ifn order to permit the
MOH to complete final equipment lists, to facilitate the completion of
appropriate  technical assistance agreements,  and to facilitate the further
development of project preparation activities, retroactive financing of up to
US$3 milion would be included to cover the cost of office equipment and
specialist services necessary for timely project start-up. Retroactive financing
would be limited to expenditures incurred prior to loan signing but after
appraisal (January 1, 1991).

PROCUREMENT
4.10        Invitations to bid on medical and hotel/hygiene equipment will be
grouped into 63 major packages of goode, whose contente could typically be
supplied by one supplier. Tinese items are suitable for International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) and would be procured in accordance with the Bank'e "Guidelines
for Procurement Under IBRD Loanc and IDA Credits" (May 1985). ICB items would
account for about 70% of the total value of equipment. For the remaining 30%,
there would be about 20 minor packages, suitable for procurement other than ICB.
Contracte would be awarded as per Table 4.5.

a/ Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Bank loan.
Total may not add up due to rounding.
4.11        The exceptions to ICB procurement would be as follows:
(a)   Civil works contracte,  estimated at a total of US$16.5 million
equivalent would be relatively emall and scattered (the size of each
contract varies from US$175,000 to US$380,000) and as cuch are not
suitable for ICB. Contracte of an estimated amount above US$200,000
(estimated in the aggregate amount of US$15.5 million) would be
advertised under local competitive bidding procedures, with public
bid opening, which are generally consistent with the need for economy
and efficiency in the execution of the works. Contracte of an amount
les6 than US$200,000 which in the aggregate would not excecd US$1
million may be acquired through local shopping based on price
quotations obtained from at least three contractors;
(b)   To ensure the compatibility of the software and programe developed
by  MOH,  computer  hardware  would be  procured  through  Limited
International Competitive Bidding (LIB). This equipment would be



- 25 -
grouped in about 10 packages averaging US$600,000 each for an
aggregate amount equivalent to US$6 million.
(c)   Contracts for furniture and equipment estimated to cost less than
USS300,000 equivalent each, which in the aggregate would not exceed
US$4.0 million and which would not be expected to interest foreign
suppliers  because  of  the  variety  of  each  contract,  would  be
advertised under local competitive bidding procedures (LCB);
(d)   Sundry items not exceeding US550,000 in each contract and aggregating
a maximum of USS1.0 million equivalent could be purchased through
local shopping on the basis of a minimum of three quotations;
(e)   Computer software and *pecialized programn developed as part of the
setting-up of the hospitals' MIS estimated at USS 0.9 million would
be procured thrcugh direct contracting in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank, to ensure time - and cost -efficiency (by
adapting existing programs) and continuity in the development of
these programe in line with the overall objectives of the reforms;
(f)   Fellowships,  stipends,  transportation  costs  and  preparation  of
educational materials (estimated to cost about US$3.6 million) for
the training programs would be procured trough direct contracting
in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.12        In comparison to bids for equipment to be procured through ICB,
domestic manufacturera would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%, or the
existing customs duty, whichever is lower over the c.i.f. prices of competing
imports. Under ICB, LIB and LCB procedures, invitations to bid and the proposed
contract awards would be reviewed by the Bank prior to final award decisions
for all contracts over US$350,000.  It is estimated that this review would cover
about   80% of the total value of equipment  contracte of US$25.1 million
equivalent. The remaining 20% would be subject to selective post-award reviews.
4.13        Technical  Assistance.       To  simplify  management  of  technical
assistance, the MOH would obtain specialist services as comprehensive TA packages
in accordance with principles and procedures acceptable to the Bank on the basis
of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultante by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency" (March 1981).
4.14        ResDonsibilitv for Procurement.  To maximize efficiency and ensure
lowest prices, and to take advantage of MOH experience in procurement, the PCU
would be responsible for the preparation of equipment liste and specifications,
in collaboration with the MOH's Buildings and Equipment Department (DBE) and
Central Maintenance Unit (Centre National de Maintenance). The PCU would also
coordinate the preparation of the architectural masterplans and construction
plans (para 3.14 & 3.17) and would monitor progresa in implementation.
STATUS OF PREPARATION AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.15        The funds for the proposed project would be disbursed over a period
of six and a half years, which is shorter than the average disbureement profile



- 26 -
for all sectors in Tun.sia (8 yeare).   This is realistic in view of the high
software/ecquipment content of the project and of the fact that: (a) civil worke
to be realized do not require site acquisition and are relatively minor for each
site; (b) timely implementation of the training and medical equipment components
iS not linlkcd to the implementation of civil works;  (c; equipment liste have
already been prepared and the elaboration of technical specifications will be
facilitated by the MOH computerized Bystem; (d) implementation of the project
would be decentralized at the hospital level, thus providing greater flexibility
to each of the components.   Project completion in net for March 31, 1997 and
the Closing Date would be September 30,  1997.   Diebursemente would be made
against:
(a)   40% of the total expenditures on civil works;
(b)   100% of the foreign expenditures  for directly imported computer
equipment materials and of the ex-factory expendituree for locally
manufactured computer equipment; and 85% of local expenditures for
other computer-related items procured locally;
(c)   100% of the foreign expenditures  for directly imported hospital
equipment, furniture and educational materials and of the ex-factory
expenditures for locally manufactured equiptment and furniture; and
70% of local expenditures for other items procured locally;
(d)   100% of the total expenditures for foreign consultant services ard
fellowships.
4.16         Disbursemente against contracte for goods and services exceeding
US$200,000 equivalent would be made againet normal documentation. Disbursements
against contracts equal or below that level as well as all items related to
training, including contracts for training services, liste of recipients in the
case of stipends, allowances and fellowships with the amounts provided and
invoices for materials and consumables would be made on the basis of Statements
of Expenditures (SOEs), available for examination by Bank missions.
4.17         Soecial Account.  To facilitate timely project implementation, the
Government would establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Acccunt in US dollars at the Central Bank
of Tunisia to which the World Bank would make an initial deposit, equivalent to
about US$2.0 million and representing about four months of projected Bank
expenditures.   The Special Account would be replenished at least every three
months or whenever one-third of the amount of the initial deposit has been
withdrawn, whichever comes first. Documentation for replenishment of the Special
Account would follow the same procedure as in paragraph 4.14.   In addition,
monthly bank statements would accompany replenishment requeste. Tne minimum-
size withdrawal applications acceptable by the Bank will be US$200,000
equivalent. Modalities concerning the use of SOEs and the Special Account were
agreed upon at negotiations.
4.18         Accounts and Audits.   Separate accounts for the project would be
maintained. Each semester a detailed etatement reflecting project expenditures
during that period and proje ted expenditures for the forthcoming semester would
be prepared. Within 45 days after the end of each semester, copies of these



- 27 -
statements would be submitted to the Bank to tacilitate superviBion. Project
accounts includLng the Special Account (para.4. 17) would be audited in accordance
w.th the March 1982 Bank "GuidelineB for Financial Reporting and Auditing of
Projects Financed by the World Bank".  Within nine months of the end of each
fiscal year, the Bank would be provided with an audit report of such scope and
detail as it may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor
cf disbursements against a certified statement of expenditures.  The Government
prov.ded assurances to this effect during negotiations (para 7.02 (9g>
V. IMPLEMENTATION, MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION
5.01        Implementation of the Government reform program would be coordinated
and supervised by a Hostoital Restructurina Manacement Board (CGRH) which would
be instituted to coincide with the start of the project. It would be composed
of:
-     the Minister of Public Health (or hie representative), Chairman;
-     the General Managers of the hospitals transformed into EPS;
-     the MOH directors involved in the reform and the Director of CNIS;
and,
-     the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) (para 5.03).
5.02        The CGRH would meet at least twice a year at the initiative of the
Minister of Public Health or upon request from one of its members as needed to
ensure the coherence of all reforms and project activities and in particular (i)
te  discuss  the  proposed  annual  implementation  program;  (ii)  to  propose
adjustments and rescheduling as needed; and (iii) to monitor and analyze progress
achieved.
IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.03        Through its management and implementation structure, the project
would contribute to a greater capacity to plan, monitor and formulate policy at
the central level (MOH), while at the same time increasing the hospitals'
responsibilities, as they progressively reinforce their management capacity
through the project activities (new organizational structure, training, MIS..).
To this end, a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would be created and maintained
for the duration of the project.  It would be headed by a full time Coordinator,
staffed with 4 technical staff,  i architect,  3 administrativo staff and an
accountant, and complemented by staff from the relevant MOH rlirectorates. Its
main responsibilities would be:
<a)   to act on behalf of CGRH as the man;ging entity of all project
activities and to propose (to its approval) annual implementation
programs. The PCU would be responsible for preparing the CGRH meeting
agendas and related documentation;
(b)   on behalf of the MOH, to ensure the formulation of the sectoral
strategies (meaium-term strategic hospital plan, studies on burden-



- 28 -
sharing  arrangements.. )(paras  3. 15-20),  to  inform  CGRH  of the
conclusione of these atudies and to monitor their implementation;
(c)   to coordinate the implementation of the project  components,  to
monitor and evaluate progrees in performance indicators and identify
and design corrective measures when needed, to carry out ccntralized
activities, such as procurement and diabursements (para 4.13), and
to keep project accounte. In particular, PCU will provide support
and advice to hospital.' General Managers responsible for the
implementation of the project items in their establishment (para
5.04); and,
(d)   to liaise with the Bank (para 5.06).
5.04        As part of the efforts to decentralize responsibilities supported
by the project, the PCU would delegate responsibility for implementation at the
hospitals' General Manager level. The project, as described in Chapter III, has
been broken down hospital by hospital, so that hospital-apecific activities are
identified and programmed over the implementation period. When nominated (para
3.02 and 7.03 (b)), the General Manager would receive, from the PCU, a hospital-
specific "project file" describing the scope and objectives of the project, the
activities to take place, their proposed implementation schedule and their cost.
Each hospital's General Manager would be responsible for implementing the
incremental project-related activities:
(a)   identify and select managerial staff in accordance with job profiles,
and propose their nomination to MOH;
(b)   program managerial staff training in accordance with component'
implementation schedule;
(c)   introduce financial management and evaluation procedures as defined
in the new financial management manual and directives from MOH (para
3.06);
(d)   ccordinate with CNIS,  the development  and  introduction  of the
Management Information Systems;
<e)   coordinate and supervise all activities related to improvements of
service quality, civil work and architectural masterplanning, and
in particular assist the PCU in the elaboration of equipment liste
to be procured; and,
(f)   provide the PCU with quarterly progres. reports.
5.05        The establishment of CORN and PCU constitute conditions of loan
effectiveness (para. 7.02 (a).  Both CGRE and PCU will be maintained, with
staffing and terus of roference acceptable to the Bank, for the duration of tue
project (para 7.01 (h).



- 29 -
SUPERVISION, MONITORINO AND EVALUATION
CD , (Fr.   SUD_evision.  The project would be supervised and monitored by the
23a&lk *tÀrh the normal supervision mechanism. However, as the project concept
L. t,.*th cs)îplex and innovative, and there is no prior experience in lendzng for
such naraement operations in social sectors, this would require about 25 staff-
weeks over the first two yearB of implementation and 50 staff-weeks over the
fcllowinq five years.  Financial management/MIS skills are likely to be essential
for Bank staff missions. Supervision would rely on a bi-annual progress report
prepared by the PCU and on Bank miesions to elaborate remedial measures, when
needed, together with the PCU;   finally, an annual progreus report would be
prepared to review achievements towards tho project i-ple-entation targets, and
towards project objectives based on the agreed monitoring indicators (para 5.07)
and implementation review meetings h-ld at least anually with the Bank.   A
project completion report would be *ubaitted to the Bank within six months of
the loan closing date (para.7.02 (i>).
5.07        Monitorina and Evaluation.   The monitoring and evaluation of the
project  would  include  two  eets of  indicators:  (i) project  implementation
indicators that would help monitor the smooth and timely implementation of the
project activities, and (ii) performance indicators related to the project
objectives.   These two sets of indicators would be specified by the PCU in
collaboration with the hoBpital managers and agreed upon with the Bank within
six months of project effectivenese. The definition of monitoring indicators
would include the specification of reference bench-mark data for each of them.
5.08         Implementation indicators would be specific for each component of
the project and related to a specified period of time (e.g.six monthe), and
would consist of ratios between the actual achievements and the targets (e.g.
number of people trained versus number of people programmed to be trained; number
of equipment procured ver3us plans for procurement; progrese in civil works..).
For non-measurable activities (like the studies), the indicator would be whether
the deadlines have been met and the reports finalized, presented and discussed
as agreed in the implementation programe.
5.09        Performance indicators related to the proiect obiectives would be
developed to monitor progress towards the project objectives as stated in para
3.04.  Specifically, indicators should be developed in the following areas,
Improvemrents in Internal Efficiencv.
Managerial efficiency:
-     Staffing: evolution of staffing according to plans (oraanizational
chart) and availability of progrees reports;
-     Implementation  of  project  activities  according  to  plan3  and
schedules;
-     Availability  of  financial  information  according  to  Financial
Management Model;
-     Availability of utilization indicators: admissions, visits, Average
Length Of Stay (ALOS); Occupancy Rate (OR), and reporting on their
evolution;
Availability of patients' administrative information, and analysis
of ita linkage with utilization of service;
Adherence to hospital maintenance standards; etc..



- 30 -
Technical efficiency:
-     Changes in utilization patterns; reduction of ALOS; reduction in A',OS
differences among hospitais;
Increase  in equipment utilization;  e.g:  number of examina.lnus/
day/equipment;   number  of  surgical  intervent.ons/day/operatinr.
thsLter; etc..
-     Reduction in waiting time for appointments and prccedures: electivp
surgery, X-ray examinations, laboratory tests, etc..
Cost Containment
-     Availability of cost information by hospital, hospital department,
group of diseases, and by unit of measurement (hospital day, visit,
treatment..) and catagory of colt (personnel, druge, etc..)
-     Availability of annual financial reports and documentation for the
hospitals corncerned;
-     Reduction in cost differences among the different hospitals for
Bimilar clinical departments and groupa of diseases;
-     Identif.cation of factors contributing to cost increases and cost
control: reports analyzing coet evolution and measures being taken;
Imorovement of Oualitv of Services.
-     Quality assurance procedures; peer review;
-     Monitoring and control of hospital related infection rates;
-     Adherence to professionally defined standards by specialty wards;
-     Pharmaceutical prescription reviews;
-     Patient satisfaction and social acceptability:  waiting time for
appointments and procedures, surveys of client satisfaction, etc..
Definition of Adiustments in Burden-Sharina Arrangements.
-     Adherence to the Government strategy and orientations (para 2.22 ani
Annex 2);
-     Updating of fee schedules;
-     Updating of co-payments;
-     Reorganization of indigence programs;
-     Contribution of the social insurance programs to MOH resources, in
line with cost and utilization patterns of services provided to their
beneficiaries.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
BENEFITS
6.01        The proposed project would address several of the critical issues
confronting the Tunisian health sector.   Major progress is expected in: (i)
hospital cost containment and quality of services through enhanced internal
efficiency; and, (ii) better equity in the financing of health care services
through the definition of methods to link utilization of services with burden-
sharing responsibilities.



- 31 -
The  implementation  of the  Government strategy  and  orientations  for
!*r   hlr;ancLal   burden-sharing   arrangements   (para   2.22   and   Annex   2),  whose
hhr . t -n  and  adjustment  would  be  supported  by  the  project,  would  lead  to
in_reasei?  resources  for MOH and  more equitable  burden-sharing.  Table  6.1 below
assurres that MOH resources would increase from 2.3% to 2.7% of GDP and presents
ts2o  scenarios:  scenario   1  assumes  that  the   Social  Insurance  programe  will
zDntrzbute a share of total health care expenditures, growing from 20% in 1990
to 30% in 1996, and tha these incremental resources would be mainly directed
towards the public health sector. As a result, the social insurance programs'
share in MOH resources would increase from 9% to 36%, the Governmcnt budget
contribution would remain stable in nominal real terme, while its share would
drop fromn from 86% to 56%, and patients direct contribution would increase only
slightly,  but  be  more  tightly  linked  to  .'bility  to  pay.    In  acensrio  2,  the
social insurance programs are assumed to cor.tribute a stable 20% share of total
health expenditures. In that case, the Government budget contribution would have
to increase yearly by about 6% in real terms, or more than 15% in nominal terms,
which  seems unlikely  to  happen  i the  current resources  constranints  context.

6.03        These projections are based on assumptions that include additional
iricreases in the fee-for-services after 1994 (25% on average), increases in the
cost of vouchers for the indigence programa (TD15) following the completion of
the  related study,  and  increases  in co-payments  (25% on average).   These
adjustments would permit to maintain the contribution of fee-for- eervices and
<o-payments stable at around 8% of MOH resources.
6.(v4       To match their incremental role in financing health services, the
social insurance programe would have to: (i) increase their enrollment rates;
and, (ii) reconsider the level of contribution of both employers and employees
in regard with the benefits provided. Increasing the currently low enrollment
rate should constitute a major objective of the social insurance programs and
efforts chould focus on groupe of the population who are currently under-
covered, mainly îndependent workers (non salaried) from both the agricultural
and non-agricultural sectors.
6.05        The adjustments in burden-sharing arrangements described above would
permit to reallocate resources towards basic health care and to improve the
quality of services in the entire public health sector which would benefit
directly the vast majority of the population needing hospital and non-hospital
care.
6.06        In addition, the project inputs involve three maternity hospitals
in Sfax, Sousse and Tunis, and the maternity departmenta of all other general
hospitals included in the project.   These facilities provide for 43% of ail
attended deliveries nationally.  Hence, the qualitative improvementa for safe
deliveries, obstetrical interventions and post-partum care would be significant.
Greater effectivenesa and efficiency in the provision of services will have a
positive impact on the health statue of the Tunisian population.
6.07        Finally,  the project would contribute to the protection of the
environment through improving the handling of medical wastes and supporting
activities  that  would  improve  hospital  hygiene  and maintenance.  Training
fellowships for managerial hospital staff in charge of environmental hazards
would also be financed.
RISKS
6.08        The main rick of the project relates to the ability of new hoepital
managers to successfully introduce and implement the hospital reforma and
overcome the system's rigidities and natural resistance to change. To compensate
for the limited experience and skille of local managers, an extensive training
program and technical aseistance are included in the project and the
restructuring program hae been phaned to allow evaluation and adjustment based
on experience with the first institutions.
6.09        Another possible risk is the lack of incentivec among civil service
to be cost-conscious in utilizing existing resources. This zisk, however, will
be mitigated by the introduction of new budgeting procedures that would allow
hospital departmente to retain most of the savinga generated through their



- 33 -
efforts, and the development of financial management standards that would allow
senior hospital managers to monitor performance.
6.10        Finally, sustained benefits in terme of a permanently reduced burden
on Gcvernment resourceB (para 6.02), ultimately depend on the outcome of the
negotiations with its social partners (the medical profession, unions and
employerb for health insurance and local communities for indigent coverage) that
will be contingent upon the broader economic developments.  The project aims at
reestablishing the image of public houpitals as quality care providers and
supplying the Government with evidence on truo health sector cost and utilization
patterns that would underpin these negotiatione.
VI!. AGREEMNTS REACHED AND RECOKENUDATIONS
7.01        During negotiations,  it waa confirmed that  the Government  had
approved the draft laws creating the "Etablissements Publics de Santé" (EPS)
(para 3.02) and the "Centre d'Informatique Sanitaire" (CIS) (para. 3.11). The
Government also provided assurances that:
(a)   the draft law creating EPSB ehall be preaented to Parliament for
approval (para. 3.02);
(b)   it will transform into EPS: the eight hospitals referred to in Part
B, Annex 3, table 1 by December 31, 1992; the five hospitals referred
to in Part B, Annex 3, table 1 by December 31, 1993 , and the
remaining five hospitals (part D, Annex 3, table 1) by December 31,
1994; and ensure that the new legal statutes of these hospitals is
maintained for the duration of the project (para. 3.02);
(c)   The studies mentioned at paragraph 3. 17 and Annex 2 will be completed
by december 31, 1993 and their recommendations presented to the
Government by December 31, 1994 (para 3.18);
(d)   The CIS shall have been established and its director appointed by
September 30, 1991 (para. 3.11);
(e)   A  medium-term  plan  for  hospital  network  development  will  be
formulated and submitted for joint review with the Bank by September
30, 1992 (para 3.15), and thereafter carried out;
(f)   A financial management manual acceptable to the Bank will be prepared
by September 30, 1991 to be thereafter used as part of the training
of managerial staff and distributed to senior and mid-level
administrators within the hospitals transformed into EPS starting
January 1, 1992 (para. 3.06);
(g)   Architectural masterplans would be formulated for 9 pre-selected
hospitals and reviewed with the Bank by December 31, 1992, and
thereafter carried out. No activity related to the rehabilitation



- 34 -
of administrative and patient registration areas (paj.a.3. 13) w.11
be implemented in the hospitals concerned before the dpprJval of
these masterplans by the Bank (para 3.16);
(h)   Both CGRH and PCU will be maintained, with staffLng and terms cf
reference acceptable to the Bank, for tte duration cf the prciezt
(para. 5.05);
(i)   Joint implementation review meetings would be held at least annually,
to discues progresu and review and agree on the following scx-rncth
program (para. 5.03 (d)); and, within six months of the Loar; ClDsi..g
date, a completion report would be prepared by the PCU and submittei
to the Bank (para. 5.06); and,
(j)   Project accounts, including Special Accounts, would be audited by
auditors acceptable to the Bank and in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles; and that the Bank will be provided within nine
monthe of the end of the Government's fiscal year with (i) certified
copies of the project accounts; and (ii) an audit report of such
scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a
separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified
statement of expenses (para 4.17).
7.02        The Government  has agreed that  the  following  shall constitute
conditions of effectiveness:
<a)   the Government will establish the Hospital Restructuring Management
Board (CGRH) and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) (para 5.05);
and
(b)   the law creating the EPS will be enacted by the Parliament; and the
four hospitals listed under part A of Annex 3, Table l will be
transformed into EPS, and their General Managers appointed (para.
3.02).
7.03          The Government also agreed that for the last 18 hospitals,  the
disbursement of loan proceeds for equipment (excluding computer equipmert) >W11l
be conditioned to the prior transformation into EPS of hospitals referred to in
Part B and C of Annex 3, and, for civil works to the prior transformation of
hospitals in Part B of Annex 3 (para 3.02).
7.04        Subject to the above conditions, the project constitutes a suitale
basis for a Bank loan of USS30 million to the Republic of Tunisia.

GOVERNMENT HEALTH FINANCING ORIENTATIONS AND STRATEGY
Avoendix 1: Letter from Minister of Public Health
Translation of French
Oroinal
Mr. Kemal Dervis                                   Tunis, February 1, 1991
Director - North Africa Regional Office
World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Dear Sir:
Followinq the aide-mémoiru from the Bank and the exchanges of
correspondence between the Ministry of Public Health (MOH) and the Bank, I write
to inform you of the principal orientations of the Tunisian Government for future
health financing arrangements.
1.          The strategy adopted by the Government in implementing its health
policy has long been based on the overriding need to expand health services to
ensure adequate health coverage for the whole country. This has involved the
construction and equipping of a number of different facilities, training and
recruitment of personnel with qualifications in different areas and at different
levels, and the allocation, mainly from the Government budget, of operating
funds.
2.          With shifting morbidity trende, changes in socioeconomic and cultural
patterns, and the availability of health professionals qualified in different
areas and at different levels, it became necessary to develop that strategy in
such a way as to ensure greater effectiveness, increased efficiency, and
improvements in terms of impact and quality of the present health system.
3.          To achieve those objectives, the public sector had to be assured of
adequate operating resources to enable it to respond to the increasingly pressing
needs of a more and more demanding population and of a growing number of
qualified professionals.  The problem of health financing, the subject of several
different studies over recent years, should therefore be addressed in this
context.
4.          The  different  sources  of  financing  were  identified  and  their
proportions evaluated and analyzed with a view to possible re-examination of
burden-sharing arrangements and resource allocation.

ANNEX 2                                                                  ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 8                                                          Page 2 of 8
4.1   The Government budget remains the principal source of funding to
meet the etrategic needu of the health sector, as well as disease
prevention, and total or partial financing of curative care.
4.2   The social insurance programu contribute to financing the public
health sector through contractual lump-sum payments to the National
Treasury and to certain hospitals, against which their members
receive free care in the public health facilities.
4.3   Household contributions to public h.alth financing come from two
sources:  patients who pay their own fees or have them paid by a
third party, and co-payments (tickets modérateurs)  from persons
entitled to partially free health care (indigents and members of
social insurance programe).
5.          Any health financing reform first requires a re-examination of the
different sources' contributions as well as resource management along more
rational and more rigorous lines. Accordingly, it was necessary to review:
-     the nomenclature of medical acta and the respective fee echedules,
applicable in the public, parapublic and private sectors;
-     fee schedules for consultations and hospitalization in public health
facilities, applicable to paying patients;
-     the Assistance Médicale Gratuite  (AMG)  system,  with a view ta
rationalizing its administration in such areas as beneficiary
identification, allocation procedures, membership fees;
-     the percentage of co-payment required for each consultation and each
hospitalization from persons entitled to highly subsidized health
care;
-     operation of the public health facilities, providing them with the
means of assessing their production costs and leading to possible
operating-cost sharing arrangements among the different sources of
financing.
6.          The Government adopted the hospital restructuring support project
that is to be jointly financed with the World Bank.
This reform essentially targets improvements in service quality
while  containing  costs:    evaluation  of quality of care,  health  facility
management audits, and consensus committees. It will also help establish the
general crientations for public health financing.
This reform is one of the prerequisites for a sector financing
review, and especially for any new burden-sharing arrangements, since it will
provide a basis for calculating the cost of the health services provided in the

Based on the results obtained n the Etablissements Publics de Santé
(EPS), the Government will review the various financial burden-sharing
alternatives for the public health sector.
7.           Without waiting for thoas  remultu, the Government has adopted a
number of statutory and regulatory measures designed to increase household
contributions to public health financing.
7.1   The nomenclature of medical acte was reviced and publi.hed by joint
order of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Minister of
Public Health on September 25, 1990.
An interdepartmental commission, based at MOH, is currently
establishing the values of the key letters used in the nomenclature to identify
medical acte for purposes of the fee achedule.
This fee schedule will be reviewed periodically to adapt it to the
changing production costs of health care by comparison with those recorded in
the hospital facilities covered by the reform.
7.2   Revised fee schedules for consultations and hospitalization in MOH
hospitals and health facilities were issued by joint order of the
Minister of Economy and Finance and the Minister of Public Health
on December 13, 1990.
Under the revised fee schedules, the 1990 rates are to be doubled
as of November 1, 1991 in a two-step process, the firet step starting
January 1, 1991, and the second November 1, 1991.   Beyond those
fees, the costs of supplementary examinations auch as X-rays, lab
tests, and functional and endoscopic explorations, as well as the
costs of surgery, represent additional charges, the rates for which
are set in the nomenclature and current fee schedulei.
7.3   Under the finance law for fiscal 1991, the annual AMG membership
fee has gone up by 66% from TD 6 to TD 10.   This annual fee is
payable by holders of AMG Type II carde, preeently numbering 663,000.
7.4   Under the same law, contributions to health care and hospitalization
cos-s in the form of co-payments from beneficiaries of highly
subsidized care who are required to make co-payments were increased
by 33-50% over 1990 rates.
Persons entitled to highly subsidized care and required to make
co-payments are holders of the AMG Type II card and members of the
social insurance programs.
7.5   Thanks to the revised fee schedules for paying patients and the
increase in co-payments and annua] AMG membership fees, the 1991

Pa-e 4 of 8                                                             Page 4 of 8
operating budget shows an increase of TD 6 million in self-generated
hospital revenues.
Moreover, thoae measures will help reduce health care consumption
in the univeruity hospitals and eneure better distribution of demand
throughout the entire health and hospital network.
8.           With a view to reforming the AMG system, the Government has already
asked the National AMG Commission to conduct an analytical and critical study
of the present *yst.m,  in place mince 1987.   The commission will provide a
preliminary appraisal, which will serve as a baais for the indigence programs
study included in the hospital restructuring project.
In addition, as part of the draft law submittad to the Government
on organization of the health sector, MOH includes free medical assistance for
every indigent Tunisian citizen, hie spouse, and hie legally dependent children.
The list of beneficiaries will be drawn up periodically by mutual agreement
between MOH and the Ministry of Social Affaira.
The same draft law provides for reduced fee echedules for health
care and hospitalization for certain categorias of Tunisians, which will be
established,  as will the financing arrangements, by decree.   The reduced fee
schedules will subsequently be established in the same decree by reference to
costs calculated in accordance with the new management methods.
The establishment of eligibility criteria and procedures for issuing
AMG cards will allow for more rational management of the health assistance
programs for low-income families.
The Government will base the reform of the AMG system on the findings
of the study included  in the hospital restructuring project.   Measures to
rationalize this system will subsequently be implemented,  in such areas as
eligibility criteria, membership procedures and services provided.
9.           The  social  insurance  systeme  are  going  to  have  to  play  an
increasingly important role in public health financing for various reasons, of
which the main ones are their expanding memberships and the riaing coste of
care.
Thus the contributions from the social inp-.rance systems and the
way these are paid to the hospitals will be revi½ed by reference to cost
calculations based on the methode introduced in the hospitals through the
hospitals management reform.
To that end, the draft law on health organization provides that
contracts defining modalities for health coverage of social insurance programs
beneficiairies, will link those programs to MOH, acting on behalf of the EPS.

A commisoion based at the Ministry of Social Affaire is etudying the
different social insurance systema currently in effect, with a view to surveyinq
bernefits and member contributions.
This study will serve as a preliminary appraisal for a possible
overhaul of the social security systeme, particularly with respect to their
health insurance component, as set out in the hospital restructuring support
project.
Laetly, the social insurance programe, besides the annual lump-sum
contribution to the MOH op.rating budget, are linksd to certain hospitale under
opecial contracte allowing for reimbursement for epecific procodures on a f.e-
for-service basie: cardiovaecular interventions and kidney transplante mince
1987 (cost increase in 1991), and CAT scans aince 1990.
Other pathologies or therapeutic or diagnostic techniques may be
covered by similar contracte in the near future. Negotiationa to this end are
already in progresa oetween the Minietry of Social Affaire and MOH.
In addition, the social insurance programe will finance the purchase
of hospital equipment as defined by MOH.  This program to strengthen public
health facilities will apan over a 5-year period etarting in 1990, for a minimum
annual outlay of TD 10 million.  The subprogram for the years 1990-1991 is in
execution, while that for the two-year period 1992-1993 will be prepared during
the third quarter of 1991.
The above demonstrates the significance of the efforts already made.
Very truly yours,
The hinister of Public Health

GOVERNMENT HEALTH FINANCING ORIENTATIONS AND STRATEGY
Aoopendix 2
Terms of Reference and Schedule
of Proiect Supoorted Studies
A.    Reassessaent of the benefits criteria for fr-- and r-duced-cost
vouchers, ("indigence program-s).
1.          The project would support the Government's effort to review the
current programs to better target the benefits provided to the real needy,
through the realization of a study that would:
review the current ayateme, "AMG Type I and Type II", giving
specific attention to analyzing the population concerned,
their economic conditions and geographical locations;
specify options for reforms of the system to (i) better
target free care to the needy; the study would review the
selection criteria to be applied and estimate the cost of
maintaining this category of benefits; and (ii) reduce the
number of subsidized vouchers (AMG Type II) to the minimum
level by exploring two main options: a marked increase in
the cost of the annual voucher and improvements in
collection of co-payment; or the compulsory integration of
the largest segment of this population into the Social
insurance schemes through a lump sum contribution based on
estimated revenue (minimal salary for example).
2.          This study would be carried out by December 1993, its conclusions
reviewed with the Bank, and its final recommendations included into the
proposal for a framework for new financial burden-arrangements to be presented
to the Government by December 31, 1994.
B.    Role and contribution of social insurance progra-s.
3.          Most of the services provided by the public sector to the social
insurance programs' beneficiaries are hoepital-based, since out-patient care
is provided both by the CNSS own facilities and by the private sector. One of
the options currently under consideration to move away from the lump sum
approach, would be to projressively shift towards a contribution directly
linked to actual cost incurred. Once a given hospital gains knowledge of its
cost and utilization patterns, ite proportional share in the lump sum would be



ANNEX 2                                                                      ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 8                                                             Page 7 of 8
cost and utilization patterns, its proportional share in the lump sum would te
deducted and replaced in the following year's allocation, with the actual ccs'
amount. Since the knowledge of actual costs is linked to the actual
implementation of the MIS in hospitals, the social programs' expected increabe
in financial commitment would be progressive.
4.           On the basis of the preliminary results provided through the
project, the MOH would develop by December 1993, a methodology to serve as a
basis for new contractual arrangements with the social insurance programs.
This methodology would be integrated to the proposal for a framework for new
financial burden-arrangements to be presented to the Government by December
31, 1994.
5.           It is difficult to assess the level of contribution from employers
and employees to the social insurance programs for health benefits as long as:
(i) the contributions for the various benefit programs (health, pensions) are
not formally separated; and, (ii) in addition to contributing to the main
social programs (CNSS and CNRPS), households as well as employers contribute
on a voluntary basis to a myriad of complementary inhurance systems
(assurances-groupe, mutuelles). Initially conceived to provide additional
benefits to ensures, these schemes have developed greatly, resulting in
duplicated benefits and waste of resources.
6.           The project would help reconsider the current provision of health
benefits under the different compulsory and voluntary schemes, by supporting a
study that would:
evaluate health benefits under existing social insurance
programs, namely reviewing, the CNSS and CNRPS as well as
other schemes providi   job related health care and coverage
of professional risks. The study would assess the current
enrollment rates, and amount and utilization of resources
collected;
collect information and evaluate the various complementary
schemes, "assurances-groupe, mutuelles"; assess the sources
and amount of financing, and the utilization of resources;
specify options for reforme to (i) increase the enrollment
rates in the social insurance schemes; and, (ii) limit
duplication of coverage. Special consideration would be
given to the conditions of enforcement of the law 86-86 of
09/01/1986 organizing the provision of social benefits for
the public and private sec..ors, and to the role that the
complementary schemes would play.

THE FUTURE LEGAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRtUCTURE
oF TUNISIAN PUBLIC HOSPITALS
A.    OBJECTIVES
1.    The objectives sought by the envisagei change in the hoapitals'  legal
statue muet form the basis for any decision.  There are five essential aime:
(i)   Firet, the hospitals need to know their conte by act or by any other
reference unit, and be able to control thes coste. The structure
muet therefore include all the neceusary management tools, especially
as regards personnel.  These elementa muet not be scattered over
several levels (ministry, region, local). The hoaspital muet be self-
managing in order that its managers may have available to them all
the data they need and be able to control th-m.
(ii)   It  is  accordingly  essential  that  the  hospital  have  a strong
management that is assigned precise powers and ie capable of
formulating a etrategy for the establishment, obtaining the support
of the medical staff for this strategy, then putting it into effect.
It must be able to dialogue with the doctors on an equal footing and
to obtain from the different hospital departmente all the data
required for monitoring costa.  In the present state of hospital
organization, it is vital that their management be etrengthened.
In practice, this etrengthening will have to be followed by
appointment of appropriate individuale to the positions defined.
(iii)   Greater flexibility in personnel management, essentially as regards
non-medical personnel, in order to give hospital management more
freedom of action and to motivate the personnel and increase their
involvement in the efficient operation of the hospitals.
(iv)   The  fourth  objective  relates  to procurement  procedures.    The
purchasing of minor items is a long-drawn-out process because of
the centralization of this purchasing through the ministry. It is
apparent that the real needs of the end users are not well
understood; while maintenance, which is in part handled on a
centralized basis, suffers from a lack of efficiency.  Increased
flexibility in procurement procedures and decentralization of
equipment management therefore form the fourth objective, to be
pursued with a view to heightened efficiency.
(v)   Finally,  the  "situation"  of  the  hospital  accountant  must  be
considered.  Hie position is neither fully "in" the hospital nor
fully "outeide" it. He is not therefore sufficiently motivated to
ensure efficient collection of receipte. This situation definitely
needs to be changed Bo that a more active role can be assigned to
this officer whose function is crucial for the prompt payment of
suppliers, collection of claims and a balanced cash position for the
hospital.

2.          The profile of the structure to be establiehed should have the
foilowing shape: an autonomous establishment, with a strong management and more
flexible and attractive terme o' employment, acting on the basis of simplified
administrative procedurea designed to promote sound, efficient and responsible
management.
B.       FACTORS CONSIDERED IN TUE SELECTION OF A LEGAL STATUTE
3.          The legal and organizational structure adopted muet be considered
with the management objectives enumerated above. Existing structure .nodels were
examined and a comparison made focusing on the functions or organe essential for
hospital activity, viz.:
-   a deliberative decision-making organ as chief authority;
-   the director or director general;
-   supervisory authority;
-   the consultative bodies;
-   the personnel;
-   procurement and contracte;
-   accounting;
-   control of expenditures.
4.          No form of existing organization that has been considered iB entirely
in alignment wi-,! the above objectives. Thus:
5.          The present status (EPA = Public Establishment with Administrative
Purpose) of the hospitals is the least appropriate in light of the aima pursued:
insufficient management authority assigned to the manager, administrative
committee with all its members drawn exclusively from the hospital concerned,
division of powers among different levels as regards personnel management and
procurement procedures, centralized ministerial management of certain functions,
and very wide-ranging supervision over the establishment.
6.          The Regional Agricultural Development Commissariats (with adapted
EPA status) are in a better position in that the regional commissioners are
assigned full powers in personnel matters (Article 2 of the Decree of June 29,
1989) and with regard to conclusion of contracte (Article 14`.   Similarly,
Articles 12 and 13 of the decree dispense with the requirement if prior approval
by the controller for commitments of less than TD 20,000. However, it muet be
noted that the committee assisting the regional cc,.nmissioner han only a
consultative role, which could result in intensifi'..  supervision or inadequate
management audit.
7.          The experience of Habib Thameur (Etablissement Public à Caractère
Industriel et Commercial -- EPIC), considered in light of the decree establishing
the hospital, presents some most interesting innovations regarding administrative
organization, the first of which is unauestionably the fact that this is the
first time EPIC status has been accorded to a hospital. Tne President and CEO
has authority over all staff (Article 10 zf the Decree of November 17, 1986).
By reason of its being classed as an EPIC          dccounting is not performed by

Page 3 of 7                                                             Page 3 of 7
an authorizing officer and then by an accountant, theae two functions being
combined in one individual.
8.           On the other hand, Lt ha. to be admitted that this status is not
fully in line with what in currently *ought.  Apart from the President, the
Board cf Directors is made up exclusively of representatives of the ministries,
who are external to the hospital (Article 3 of the same decree).  This Board can
delegate its powers to the head of the establishment (Article 8). The rulea on
financial and technical controle are not developed in detail and are very
flexible (Articles 5, 7, 14, 15 and 16), and appear inadequate in the context
of an organization operating very largely with public funda.
9.           The general legislation on EPICs would not be fully appropriate
either, since it is insufficiently adapted to hospital activity and the
objectives pursued.   For instance,  the Director is appointed by the Board
(Commercial Code); the accounts are governed by private law while there is a
State controller whose powers (Articles 'I5 and 16 of the Law of February 1,
1989) remain vague.
C.       THE FUTURE LEGAL STRUCTURE
10.          Since  none of  the  existing  forma  of  organization  is entirely
compatible with hospital activity, the solution in therefore to create a new
public establishment which, because of its purposes and special features, would
be specifically designated a Public Health Establishment ("Etablissement Public
de Santé" - EPS)1/. The essential legal characteristic of public establishments
is the fact that they can be modeled, by means of the legialation instituting
them, according to the activities pursued.
11.          The essential difference between EPA statua, even in the adapted
form,  and that of an EPIC,  lies  in the accounting rules.    he personnel
regulations can be adjusted, even if the choice is a delicate one. The powers
of the head of the establishment are balanced by a decision-making Board and
ministerial supervision that is lighe but covers the main pointa. When it comes
to accounting, however, the traditional rule in public accounting requiring
separation of the roles of authorizing officer and accountant in ignored in an
EPIC. The accounts are governed by private law, and are kept and managed in the
organization concerned by employeea *ubject to the authority of the head of the
establishment.
12.          In view of the objectives pursued,  the EPS structure nhould be
developed from the existing legal structures (adapted EPA or EPIC), taking the
following points into consideration:
1/       A draft law creating the EPS has been presented to the Goverrnent and
its final version will be *ubmitted to Parliament for approval, as a
condition of loan effectiveness.

Page 4 of 7                                                          Page 4 of 7
(i)   An  EPIC  can  handle  a public  health  service  function  without
difficulty. The care activity, which is the establishment's purpose,
is not contrary to the industrial and commercial capacity, especially
mince in actual tact it is primarily a question of promoting
knowledge of coste and equilibrium between receipto and expenditures.
(ii)   Tunisian  law  includes  legiolation  on  EPICo.    The  personnel
regulations, institutions and method of operation of EPICs, and the
relevant procurement rules are laid down in broad outline. Tunisia
also has experience with a hospital establishment set up as an EPIC
(Habib Thameur).
(iii)   However, the principle of separation as applied in the "adapted
EPAs" represents an additional guarantee for public funds that
generally takes the form of a three-phaoe set-up: the authorizing
officer, the head of the establishment, who makes the decisions;
the controller, who approves expenditures in advance; the accountant,
who is answerable to the Ministry of Finance and personally
responsible for hie actions, who ef fects the paymento. The principle
of separation is also a source of complications, because it dilutes
responsibilities and can slow procedures. Moreover, it presumes,
to enable the authorizing officer to have full control of matters,
that expenditures are committed at the right moment, that the cash
position is known and that there is a good information system
functioning between the office of the accountant and that of the
authorizing officer.
13.         Taking all the above objectives and constraints into account, the
public establishment would be based on the following:
-   a Board of Directors and a General Manager that are strong and whose
respective powers dre balanced;
-   supervisory authority that is light but covers the essentials;
-   management support organe that permit both efficiency and control.
D.       THE FUTURE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
14.         The organizational structure is *ummarized in the attached chart
(figure 1).  The adaptation effort has been focuoing essentially on:
-   the Board of Directors;
-   the General Manager;
-   the supervisory authority;
-   the health council;
-   the control organs;
-   the personnel regulations.

(a)   The Board of Directors
15.         It ie firet of all necessary to institute a mechanism through which
the establishment can be provided with a  tronq Board of Directors that ie
capable of enhuring a aood balance between the Director General's oowers and its
own. To this end the Board has to be made up partly of membere f rom outside the
establishment and partly of memberu from within it. The Board musc also be the
place where the financing sources for the hospital (State and Social Security
Fund) are informed about the running of the hospital, are associated with this
management and verify what is done.
16.         This Board can be composed pursuant to the legislation creating the
Public Health Establishment as follows: the Director General; one representative
of the Ministry of Planning and Finance; two representatives of the Ministry of
Health with the possibility that one of them can be the Regional Director of
Health; one representative of the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and
Scientific research; one representative of the Ministry of Social Affaire; one
representative of the local authority concerned; the chairman of the Health
Council; one representative of the clinical staff; one representative of the
nonclinical  personnel   (laborers,  administrative  personnel,   etc.);   one
representative of the staff union; and the State Controller.
17.         The responsibility of the Board of Directors must be enumerated on
a limitative basis, without possibilitv of deleoation to the General Manager.
The Board muBt deliberate on the hospital's five-year plan, its annual program,
the operating and capital budgets for the year, the apecial regulations governing
the establishment's personnel, if such regulations exist, the hospital's bylaws,
procurement, sale and exchange of real estate, the .eases of more than 18 yaers,
borrowing, and acceptance or rejection of donations and legacies entailing
charges.
18.         The Board appoints the members of the control bodies: bid opening
and evaluation committee, internal contract committee (this area is not part of
the General Manager's role). It muet mandatorily draw up inventories, balance
sheets, and the administrative and profit and lose accounts within a short period
to be specified. It is required to approve the largest contracte, within the
framework of a detailed liet.  It is to meet at frequent and regular intervals.
(b)   The General Manager
19.         Aioointed by decree (and not designated by the Board of Directors
from among its members), the General Manager muet be assigned strong power,
balanced by the powers held by the Board of Directors. He muet primarily have
all powers and exercise all authority over the personnel (recruitment,
assignment, promotions, careers, discipline, reassignment within the hospital,
pay, etc.) and allocate funding among the departments with the agreement of the
Board of Directors.
20.         It muet be possible  for him to be supported by directorB and
administrative services that will enable him to handla, in addition to the day-
to-day management of the establishment, the preparation of the five-year plan

of action, the hospital'e annual program and the budget. Depending on the size
of the establishment, there may also be a Deputy General Manager.
21.          He  will  execute  the  Board's  resolutions,  award  contracte  and
represent the establishment at law.   He will be charged with supervision of
accounting and will be responsible for the accounte being properly kept.   He
may not combine his position with any other.   Ti facilitate the hospital's
operation, he muet be empowered to handle all mattere not *pecifically reserved
for the Board of Directors. Finally, the General Manager be dismissed at any
time by the Government.
(c)   Suvervisorv authoritv
22.          The role of the oupervisory authorities,  i.e.,  the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Health, will be limited to certain specific matters.
They will be required to approve the five-year plan, the annual budget based on
an annual program, and staffing levels.
23.          The supervisory authorities muet authorize heavy equipment purchases,
including major data-processing systems, and also the creation or closing of
beds. The latter two functions are designed to permit observance of the National
Hospital Plan (that would result from the hospital medium-term ntrategic plan)
which is an integral part of the National Health Plan.
(d)   The Bealth Council
24.          This council will be made up of all the establishment's department
heads and will elect its chairman from among ite members.  It muet also include
representatives of other professional categories, medical and clinical, in the
huspital. Ite consultative responsibilities will relate to the five-year plan,
the  annual program  and the  budget.    It will  express  its opinion on the
organization of the services and the medical choices connected with execution
of the budget.   It is desirable that it should also be made responsible for
evaluation of the hospital'e structures and medical activities. The Director
General will be a member of the council.
(e)   Control Organe
25.          These will comprise the State controller, the technical controller,
the bid opening and evaluation committee, and the internal contracta committee.
TO these must be added the outside audits prescribed by the Basic Law on EPIC.
(Article  13).   The  composition  of  the bodies  involved muet  be precieely
specified.   The Board of Directors will name the members of these essential
bodies.   The roles of the different organs are already well defined by the
relevant legislation. It will probably be advisable to carefully *pell out the
role of the State Controller, which is as yet unclear in the absence of
implementing decrees.

(f)   Personnel Regulations
New personnel could be hired on the basie of regulations *pecific
j t  PrE'S, comprising general rules laid down in the pertinent legielation,
while the specific rules can be spelled out either by means of regulations for
the purpose or else by specific decisions of *ach establishment, in order to
ensure that the Regulations are compatible with the ipecial feature. of hospital
activity and to avoid rigid rules through the practice of variable working houre,
part-time work, different wage and salary matrixes, adapted advancement or
promotion schemes, and special overtime arrangements. Recruitment of staff for
highly specialized functions, who will definitely b. neded to raie the quality
and efficiency of management of the establishments, will then be possible without
difficulty:   financial experts,  computer specialiete,  biomedical engineere,
communications specialist, etc.
27.          Introduction of even greater flexibility would make it possible for
detached public service personnel to opt for integration into the EPS and to
benefit from its special status. This would provide motivation for staff most
interested in finding work of a different sort.
28.         A choice has to be made among these different options, while bearing
in mind that if the form of organization remains unchanged it will be difficult
if not impossible to change working methods. On this basis, a form allowing the
most adaptations  should be adopted.   Specific rules  for today's hospital
functions are needed. The second solution proposed, i.e., the possibility for
the EPS to recruit its new personnel directly in accordance with ite neede, would
be the most appropriate.  In particular, special emphasis muet be placed on the
special requirements to be met by the management teamn.   The high level of
expertise that its members muet possess means that specialties moat certainly
located outside the sphere of the Ministry of Health and possibly the entire
public service will have to be recruited.

HOSPITAL RESTRUCTURINO SUPPORT PROJECT
MIS COMPONENT
1.          "Information technology  i. a management  tool that can be used
operationally, tactically and strategically." Computerization therefore assumes
the prior existence of management procedures, rules and practices that are
recognized and implemented consistently throughout the entity.
A.    INSTITUTioNAL CONSEST
2.          Two basic approaches, one centralized and the other decentralized,
were considered in the selection of the computer 3ystem.   The scope of the
changes envisaged under Tunisia's overall hospital reform project is such that
oversight mechanisms muet be established at a very high decisionmaking level --
ministerial -- in order to ensure uniformity in the application of computer
procedures, as well as rigor in compliance with the rules governing the
implementation of information technology in the hospital network.
3.          Moreover, the historical lack of recognized management practices
and experience in management information techniques, the need to formulate and
implement sound policies, rules, standards and consistent procedures, and the
need to select/develop customized systems to contain the upward spiral of costs
have led to a decision to establish a strong computerized information structure
at the ministerial level.
4.          The National Center  for Computers and Health  (Centre National
d'Informatique Sanitaire -- CNIS) is therefore to be established.  Its role and
main activities would be (i) standardization of the information technology
function" in the health network and (ii) the provision of computer services to
hospitals. The main activities carried out by the CNIS would include but not
be limited to:
(a)   Administrative orcanization of the health computer svstem:
-     policies
-     rules
-     standards
-     communication and
(b)   Technical orcanization of the health computer sostem:
-     selection of technology
-     selection of equipment
-     preparation and management of invitations to bid
-     selection and introduction of development methodologies
-     structure of information systema and other types of system
engineering
-     high-level technical support

(c)  User traininQ:
-     in the use of equipment
-     in the une of computer procedures and systeme.
B.    NATIONAL DEPLOYKENT oF THE IXFORMATION TECENOLOGY FUNCTION
5.          The CNIS would provide uniformity in the computerization of the
hospitale and would foster *tructured and planned deployment adapted both to
the capacity for absorption and assimilation of the new function by the
hospitale, as well as to the Center's support capacity.
6.          The CNIS' role.  An objective, clear and permanent linkage muet be
established between the CNIS and usera at all levels, who are its beneficiaries.
An information technology commission consisting of representatives from the
Center and the user sectors involved in the computerization projecte would
therefore be established to ensure the best possible fit between user needs and
the services offered by the CNIS. It should also improve coordination of the
implementation and development of information systeme and contribute to the
development of medium- and long-term planning of the information technology
function in the health sector.
7.          Oraanization of the CNIS.  The Center's legal statua would be that
of an EPIC, which is the optimal way to give it the financial and management
autonomy needed to carry out its reform objectives and to offer the hospitals
the services best adapted to their needs.
8.          In order to respond to the needs of the hospitals, CNIS personnel
would consist of 5 bac+6,  24 bac+4 and 40 bac+2.   To the extent that the
employment market permits, recruitment will seek a good balance between academic
training and pertinent professional experience.
9.          Rate of return and the information technoloav comDonent.  In order
for the information technology tool to fully meet the needs and objectives of
the hospital reforme, a series of appropriate indicators for the various phases
and levels of computerization will be developed by the CNIS to show the impact
of the information technology component, in particular:
-     study of coste, benefits and rate of return of the applications
developed;
-     analysis of the development of information technology and its impact
on the management of health establishments.

C.    APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
10.         SuoDort  for  computer  avctemo  in  aimed  *orentially  at  all
administrative aspects, with the exception of the medical record. In point of
fact, a management information system for patient clinical records in now uued
by the medical community and *hould be extended to all hospitalo. This *ystem
could be used au a basis for the establishment of clinical data filea that could
be compiled electronically when computerized management of the clinical records
is further developed.
11.         The systems now available for personnel management and payroll, as
well as supplies and management of pharmacy inventories, will continue to be
used initially. The data that they contain in fact have a definite value that
could be capitalized on and which muat not be underestimated when a new
administrative management model is introduced.
12.         Needs.  The information technology function will be geared toward
support for the basic administrative functions.  The application archltecture
corresponding to those needs will involve:
(a)   Personnel manacement
(b)   Management of supplies and inventories
(replacement of the CNI's SAMAH system)
(c)   Management of the oatient'u adminiotrative record
Selection   of   an   information   system   with   the   fo!lowing
characteristics:
-     single administrative identification number for each patient
-     admission functions such as:
sociological data on the patient
hospitalization; pre-admission; admission
bed management
collection of charges
discharges and tranefers.
(d)   Inouttino of data on treatment received by the patient:
-     medication provided
-     laboratory and radiological tests for diagnostic purposes
-     medical and surgical records
-     diagnoses
(e)   Billino for services received
Link between the administrative data on the patient and data on the
treatment received
(f)   General accounting and financial control
(i)   selection of a computer  system meeting the needs of the

(ii)  establishment and development of pertinent interfaces between
the eystem and other management information systems.
13.         Acquisition  versus  development.    Given  the  magnitude  of  the
investments required and the planned timetable, it was decided to adapt existing
systems with a minimum of adjustments to Tunisia's needs.
14.         Teot  and  simulation  environment.    An  information  technology
laboratory, to be used for tests and simulations on the possible solutions
offered by the market, *hould be opened as soon as possible at the ministry
level, even before the CNIS is established. In addition to tests and simulations
of eysteme, the laboratory could acquire an initial base of expertise on the
technical environment recommended in the section on "technical architecture."
The selection of a physical site that could accommodate the equipment package
selected for a specialized institute, as well as its acquisition and
installation, should be taken care of in the very short run. Ministry systems
personnel would then be able to become familiar with the technical components
cf the system (hardware and software) and be exposed to the various problems and
technological obstacles that they will have to overcome when doing tests to
select the appropriate software. The devalopment of technical expertise is in
our view key to the success of the computerization project.
D.    TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
15.         Selection of a comouter manufacturer.  The Ministry should ensure
that a single technological environment is selected for all of the hospitals,
and used as well at the regional level and for the CNIS. The manufacturer should
be an internationally recognized company.
16.         Choice of eauioment.  Several equipment options for the hospitals,
regional centers and CNIS have been considered: central processing unit with
terminals; central processing unit with microcomputers linked to terminals; and
microcomputer network with a server.
17.         The option selected was that of a state-of-the-art microcomputer
network that can grow with neede.   The financial  investment  is directly
proportional to the level of computerization to be reached. The network permits
real-time interaction with the databases located in the server, which also
manages communications.   Processing is done at work stations that have the
application and other programe such as spreadsheets and word processors,
additional computerization benefits of the various departments of the hospital.
18.         Choice of software.  This involves:
(a)   Svstem software:  In view of the architecture of the network system,
each workstation will need to have its own operating system. So as
to contain costs and minimize training needs, a standard operating
software system already known by the system specialists and users
has been selected.

(b)   Network management software:  Software with a very good reputation
in industry that has become the leader in this type of product ehould
be selected.
(c)   Database manaaement software:   There are several pou.ibilities.
The evaluation of Ministry system *p.cialists on this matter should
certainly be taken into consideration. Selection will reflect in
particular the applications that will be used in the establihments,
costa associated with utilization and the large volume of information
to be processed.
(d)   Selection of development lanouace:s  This will be dictated by the
selection of the database  which ie generally ausociated with a
fourth-generation languacr.  Another language, language "C," will
have to be learned by ' NIS system upecialist., mince it is needed
for the development of more complex functions.  This training will
essentially involve the system specialistu.
(e)   Aiplication software:  CNIS officials will evaluate on a priority
basis the use of software already developed abroad.
E.    ACTIVITIES REQUIRED PRIOR TO TES INTRODUCTION OF TEE SYSTEM
19.         The objective for hospital information technology is the development
over the next five years of a system that can meet the basic needs of the 22
hospitals affected by the reforme.  Initially, the system to be implemented in
the hospitals will manage patient administrative records, which will over the
longer run permit computerization of patient medical records. The system will
enable the hospitals to pursue the following objectives.
20.         Meraing  of the vatient administrative and medical records: adoption
of a sinale medical record number for each patient. This single identification
number will be assigned for both out-patient consultations and hospitalizations.
The merging of the records does not exclude remote registration for hospitals
with a decentralized structure. The record will still be treated as a single
entity in the data bank.
This approach allows for a smoother transition and is more likely
to succeed since it does not throw established procedures into question.   It
would also be very difficult to devise a centralized registration system for
hospitals that treat more than 900 patients a day (difficulty of having one
waiting room and still protecting the well-being of patients and their families).
The patient's physical record (paper record) will have to bear the single
identification number. A centralized record would make it easier for managers
to identify their clientele and facilitate more rigorous follow-up for the
patients.   This system could reduce costs by eliminating duplicate testing
because the contents of the medical record are unknown (i.e. radiology,
exploratory procedures).

is dLscharged would allow for better tracking of accounts payable. In order tc>
re ai,Ie to respond to this need for streamlining, each hospital must:
(a)   Centralize the inputting of hospitalisation data:
-pecify information needed when a oatient is hospitalized;
-     specify standard input terminology, e.o. medical specialties,
names of physicians, diagnosi9;
-     establish a single  identification number  for beds at the
hospital center and information that needs to be recorded to
facilitate bed management, e.g. ward, apecialty, type of room,
etc.;
-     determine procedures  for inter-departmental communications
regarding changes occurringduring hospitalization, e.g. change
in bed, specialty, ph-sician, acute case to chronic case,
departure or death, etc.;
determine what medical procedures are billable when the patient
is di-charged and have to be checked on a routing slip while
the patient is being treated;
-     information control.  This involves verification that all in-
patients and their locations are correctly recorded.   Each
department must therefore on a daily basis at a given time
during the day verify that its patient list is up to date and
notify the hospital admission office of any corrections to be
made immediately.
(b)   Determine the data needed by managers regarding clinical or emergency
consultations.
A system responding to these needs will be introduced in the 22
hospitals over the next five years.
