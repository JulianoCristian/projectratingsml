      Extension Project will:  (i) strengthen the reorganized\n            agricultural extension system introduced in the States of\n            Gujarat, Haryana and Karnataka, under the Composite\n            Agricultural Extension Project; (Cr. 862-IN). It would\n            further; (ii) strengthen the linkages between extension and\n            research in these States, and broaden the scope of the\n            project to cover such other activities as water and soil\n            management, farm management, horticulture as well as some\n            aspects of farm forestry.  It would also; (iii) introduce\n            the T&V system of extension in the State of Jammu and\n            Kashmir.  Field extension staff tend to be subject to\n            outside pressures, particularly from local government\n            authorities to carry out non-extension work, thus detracting\n            from extension effectiveness.  This risk would be mitigated\n            under the proposed project by ensuring that all incremental\n            extension staff would work exclusively on agricultural\n            extension.  The provision of training for a large number of\n            professional staff in diverse technical subjects would\n            present a challenge.  It would be met through the state\n            training components under the proposed project, supported by\n            the Extension Training Unit of the Directorate of Extension."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
