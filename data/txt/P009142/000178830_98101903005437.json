The principal objective of the projects is to\n            rationalize production, reduce costs and improve product\n            quality. The projects were selected by the Yugoslav\n            Investment Bank as being of high economic priority in\n            various sectors of industry. Their total cost is estimated\n            at $37 million equivalent, including requirements for\n            working capital. The direct foreign exchange component is\n            estimated to be about $14 million, of which $10.5 million\n            will come from the proposed bank loan and most of the rest\n            from a loan of $2.8 million to one enterprise (OHIS) from\n            U.K. sources. The local cost equivalent to $23 million will\n            be provided by the enterprises themselves and through loans\n            from Yugoslav banks."}, "docdt": "1967-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
