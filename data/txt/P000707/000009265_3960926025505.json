program to build an efficient animal health service, the\n            Fourth Livestock Development Project is intended principally\n            to improve livestock production. This is to be achieved by\n            improving animal nutrition and supplying drugs needed to\n            control animal diseases. In addition, other activities to be\n            undertaken will include strengthening the capacities of the\n            Ministry of Agriculture and relevant support services.\n            Finally, foreign exchange earnings will be increased by\n            expanding exports of live animals, hides and skins."}, "docdt": "1987-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
