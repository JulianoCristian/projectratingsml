MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A
HOUSING FINANCE SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Korea for US$150 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for a term of 15 years including 3 years of
grace at che standard Bank variable interest rate and would help
finance a housing finance sector project. The proceeds would be relent
to developers as construction finance,  and those loans would be
subsequently assumed by home buyers as 20-year mortgages (at 10% p.a.
interest) and to developers of housing for rental at 5% p.a. for 20
years. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background: The housing finance system (HFS) in Korea is
dominated by one major institution, the Korea Housing Bank (KHB),
which has its own mortgage lending program and also administers the
social housing finance window, the National Housing Fund (NHE), on
behalf of the Ministry of Construction. KHB (inclu.aing NHE) provides
almost 90% of housing loans made, although this finanLcing covers only
about one fifth of the value of new construction. A World Bank sector
study, which was discussed with the Government about one year ago,
identified the small size and underdeveloped state of the HFS as a key
constraint in the housing sector and recommended changes. The sector
report also reviewed the Government's program of social housing and
made a number of recommendations to improve its efficiency,
particularly with respect to targeting the program more effectively on
low-income households.
3.        Project Objectives.  Consistent with the recommendations of
the sector report, the objectives of the proposed project would be to
support  measures designed to expand the HFS and increase its
effectiveness in improving housing conditions, especially for the low-
income population. This objective would be accomplished gradually, by
differentiating between the social and  economic goals for the housing
sector and the HFS. Measures introduced under the project would focus
NHF activities on lower-income households by restricting access to
C'           loans on the basis of income and by reducing the maximum size of
eligible unit.  The project also supports actions to strengthen KHB's
competitive position in savings markets and to tap new institutional
sources of funds. In addition, further means would be studied for
expanding the market-based housing finance system to better serve the
needs of middle-income households in line with the liberalization of
the financial sector.
4.       Project Description.  A two-year (mid-1987 through mid-1989)
time-slice of NHF's lending program would be supported under the
proposed project.  NHE plans to lend about US$1.4 billion equivalent
during the project period,  primarily for small housing units.
Disbursement would be against NHF's actual lending.



-2-
5.         The basis of the sector loan  is the commitment of the
Government to a Policy Statement (PS) and a Program of Actions and
Studies (PAS), which incorporates actions already under implementation
as well as actions contemplated for the future development of the HFS.
In particular, the Government has agreed to expand the HFS on the
basis of market principles, to target social housing programs to
lower-income groups, and to stimulate an increase in the construction
of low-income housing for rental. Staff of key sector institutions
would receive training to broaden and enhance skills. The project also
includes studies to define further actions. Total cost of the project
is estimated at about US$1.4 billion equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$375 million equivalent (26%). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement and
disbursement are presented in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6699-KO, is being distributed separately.
6.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project would
facilitate continuation of the already fruitful dialogue between the
Government and the Bank on housing finance policies. Ir. addition to
policy directions, the dialogue has helped in defining and
establishing the order of the specific actions required to implement
the policy changes, and in transferring to Korea the housing finance
experience of other countries. The proposed sector loan fits well with
a country lending strategy which places greater emphasis on sector and
policy-based lending consistent with the needs of a maturing economy.
The Bank's sector report was discussed with the Government in January
1986 and its recommendations form the basis for the Policy Statement
and Program of Actions and Studies which was adopted by the Government
on April 12, 1987.
7.        Agreed Actions. The Government has adopted:
A. a Policy Statement which outlines the basic policies to be
followed in developing both the market-based HFS and the NHF;
B. a Program of Actions and Studies for the NHF that includes:
- a significant reduction in the maximum size of unit financed,
- the introduction of income criteria for smaller units to
restrict access to low-income households,
- increased involvement of the private sector,
- increased financing for low-income rental housing, and
- identification of other mechanisms to improve the rental market
for lower-income households through a study which reviews
recent NHF rental programs as well as the impact of current
regulations and incentives on the rental market;



-3-
C. a Program of Actions and Studies for the market-based system that
includes:            -
- expansion of the HFS through amendment of the KHB Act to
include increased capitalization and expanded powers for KHB,
- gradual increases in the size of mortgages from KHB,
- increased use of nondeposit funds, and
- identification of improvements in resource mobilization and
lending instruments through a study which reviews the long-term
outlook for all present sources of funds, develops concrete
proposals for issuing longer-term bonds in capital markets,
assesses the demand for specific new types of loans, and
develops an implementation program consistent with ongoing
financial sector reform.
8.        Justification.  The principal justification of the project
is that it would assist the Government in reforming the HFS to make it
a more effective tool for achieving housing policy objectives and a
more efficient channel for resources flowing to the housing sector.
This would be achieved by supporting measures to target public
expenditures more effectively towards low-income households and,
eventually reduce the relative size of public sector programs. The
assistance rendered to those who qualify for NHF loans could thus be
more valuable than if a larger number were eligible. The project also
supports Government's complementary efforts to expand the market-based
supply of mortgages by assisting in establishing a program for KHB
that will permit it to better respond to the demand for housing loans
from all Koreans. Borrowers would benefit both from increased
availability of loans as well as from the efficiency gains of
mobilization through the formal finance system-
9.       Risks.  The main risks of the project involve noncompliance
or delayed compliance with agreed housing strategies. However, these
risks are small because the sector dialogue has resulted in close
coincidence of views on desirable policy directions and institutional
reforms. The Government has already taken action on many important
agreed measures.
10.      Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Schedule B
KOREA
HOUSING FINANCE SECTOR PROJECT
Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement. The proposed project involves a time-slice of a program
using procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank. The criteria to
be used for the selection of subprojects have been reviewed and are
acceptable to the Bank. In two previous housing projects undertaken by
the Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC) with Bank financing,
local competitive bidding (LCD) procedures were modified to include
international competitive bidding (IB) for contracts of more than
US$2 million. However, this modification has proved to be redundant
because foreign firms have shown no interest in bidding for housing
contracts in Korea. Nor have. any foreign firms applied for
prequalification in response to internationally placed advertisements.
Therefore, ICB is not proposed for the present project. Instead, all
KNHC and local government contracts eligible for Bank financing would
be let by prevailing LCB procedures that are consistent with Bank
guidelines. In the case of private developers who do their own
construction work, the Ministry of Construction applies selection
procedures that reasonably ensure competition and efficiency. All
contracts costing US$8        million or more would be reviewed in
advance by the Bank. Studies would be contracted to experienced local
research institutes under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
Disbursements. Disbursements would be against NHF subloans at the
rate of 40% of expenditures.
