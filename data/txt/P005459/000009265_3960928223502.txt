MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Kingdom of Morocco for US$114.0 million is submitted for approval.  The
proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, repayable
over a period of 20 years including a five-year grace period, and would assist
in the extension of electricity supply in rural areas.
2.          Macroeconomic Context.  Si-vre the mid 1980s, the Moroccan economy
has experienced reasonable export-led growth despite the burden of heavy debt
service payments. As a result, per capita incomes have grown by 11 since 1984,
and with this has come increased demand and higher expectations for the
availability of basic goods and services, in both urban and rural areas.
However, human resource and sdcial development have lagged behind, partly as a
result of expenditure constraints needed to reduce the Government's budget
deficit.   This lag is illustrated by the fact that only 25% of the rural
population, which represents about 60X of the total population, 1;as access to
electricity. Most of the energy needs of the rural population without access
to electricity are being met by fuelwood and charcoal, contributing to a severe
problem of deforestation, and by petroleum products such as kerosene, diesel oil
and butane gas derived from import-d oil. Frequently, these forms of energy
provide services of poorer quality and at a higher cost to the economy than the
same services based on electricity.   Therefore judicious substitution of
electricity for other energy forms would enhance the economically efficient use
of energy, by reducing per unit energy costs for rural customers. In addition,
it would provide rural customers with access to a range of new services that
would improve their living conditions.   It would contribute to increasing
productivity in the agriculture sector, and create decentralized economic
activities leading to increased employment opportunities and reduced migration
of families to urban areas. Towards these ends, rural electrification has become
a key part of the Government's policy for rural development.
3.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has to date financed eight
investment operations in the energy sector including a loan made in April 1980
to finance the first phase of the 15-year National Rural Electrification Program
(NREP1). Through its support to the power subsector the Bank has contributed
to the Government's strategy of : (i) encouraging a technically and economically
efficient expansion of the power system;   (ii) rationalizing energy pricing
policy, by simplifying the electricity tariff and assisting in carrying out an
electricity tariff study and an energy pricing study aimed at reducing economic
distortions;    (iii)  improving  the  financial  performance  and  managerial
capabilities and autonomy of the power sector entities; and (iv) introducing
better coordination and coherence between the different entities involved in the
energy sector.
4.          The proposed project would follow up on NREP1 and the Bank's
involvement would help ensure its efficient implementation. Experience from



- 2 -
NREPI identified a number of areas where implementation can be improved such as:
(a) the importance of clarifying, at the early stage of project design, the
responsibilities of the various entities involved in the project which are the
Ministries of Finance (MF), Interior (MI), Energy and Mines (MEN) and the
implementing agency, ONE; (b) the need to review the ownership of the project
facilities and to ensure better coordination between the connection of the
consumers and the electrification of the villages; and (c) finally the timely
availability of local funds in accordance with the project requirements. All
the necessary measures to introduce these improvements are reflected in the
design of the proposed project and in the supporting legal agreements. Moreover,
the proposed project would permit the Bank to follow up on the institution
building efforts initiated under previous operations, and aimed at strengthening
ONE's planning and marketing capabilities, and its financial performance.
5.          Project Objectives.  The proposed project is the second phase of
the NREP. Its main objectives would be to: (a) expand electricity supply to
the rural areas;  (b) improve the reliability and quality of service of the
existing rural distribution network; (c) strengthen the administrative, planning
and financial capabilities in the power subsector; (d) implement institutional
reforms aimed at delineating and streamlining the responsibility for planning,
implementing, operating and managing the rural distribution system; and (e)
encourage further reforms in the electricity tariff structure. The proposed
project would also contribute towards the Government's policy of improving the
efficiency with which energy is consumed.
6.          Proiect DescriRtion. The proposed project would provide electricity
to  about  170,000  new  consumers  in 462  villages.1'   It  would  include:
(a) construction of about 5,850 km of distribution lines and 70 MVA of
transformers capacity; (b) construction of operating buildings and supply of
vehicles and specialized equipment for enhancing ONE's operating facilities in
rural areas; and (c) consultants' services to assist in detailed engineering
design. The proposed project would also strengthen ONE's distribution department
through technical assistance, training and logistical support to plan, monitor
and implement the rural electrification program. The project, to be implemented
by ONE over a period of 6 years, provides funds for civil works, equipment,
installation and erection, training and technical assistance. The total cost
of the project including interest during construction is estimated at US$220.0
million with a foreign exchange component of US$122.4 million (56%). A breakdown
of the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbuisement schedule are sho .L in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
group operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two
maps are also attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report, No.  8426-NOR dated
August 30, 1990 is also attached.
7.          Agreed  Actions.    The  3overnment  and  ONE  have  agreed  on  a
comprehensive set of actions aiming at ensuring better coordination among the
various entities involved in the implementation of the national rural
electrification program and at improving ONE's financial viability and its
±      In parallel, the European Investment Bank is providing financing
for the electrification of 138 villages.

operational efficiency. The actions specifically include the following: (a)
decision by the Government on the basic elements of the new tariff structure by
December 31, 1990, and the Thased implementation of modification to this
structure in the subsequent 18 months so as to establish global and coherent
national electricity tariffs by June 30, 1992; (b) achievement by ONE of net
internal cash generation sufficient to cover 25X of investment in 1990, and 30X
in 1991 and thereafter; (c) annual review by ONE with the Bank of the adequacy
of its revenues to achieve the agreed cash generation ratio for the given year
and the following year and the implementation of any measures necessary to
achieve the agreed ratio; (d) maintenance by ONE of net revenues equal to at
v       least 1.5 times projected annual debt service requirements; (e) provision of
adequate budgetary allocations to cover local financing of the project;  (f)
provision of adequate funds to cover any cost overruns which might arise; (g)
assurance that all accounts due to ONE and the R6gies by the administrative
subdivisions of the Government for electricity and related works provided through
December 31, 1990 are paid in three equal installments during the years 1991,
1992 and 1993;  (h) adequate budgetary allocations to enable the Government's
administrative subdivisions to pay their electricity bills promptly and in
accordance with guidelines satisfactory to the Bank; (i) recovery of connection
charges from the customers benefiting from the project through monthly
installments rather than as a lump sum charge befo-e the connection is made; and
(j) completion of detailed engineering design for the first 200 villages by March
31, 1991 and for the remaining villages by December 31, 1992.
8.          Benefits. Economic benefits under the proposed project would derive
from the value attached by rural consumers to the incremental electricity sales,
which would either substitute for other less efficient fuels or satisfy their
as yet unmet energy needs. Although not easily quantifiable, secondary benefits
are expected from improving the well-being of the rural population, promoting
economic development of rural areas and stemming rural-urban migration. The
internal economic rate of return calculated without considering these secondary
benefits is estimated at about 18X.
9.          Risks.  Two major project related risks which could lead to delay
in project implementation stem from possible delays by the Government in
providing adequate counterpart funds, and inadequate oordination between the
various entities involved in the project.   These were importans.  problems
experienced during the implementation of NREP1. These risks will be alleviated
by: (a) the Government's decision in 1989 to increase the financial resources
of the local communes for their development programs by allocating to these
programs 30% of the funds collected from the value added tax (part of these funds
will be used to finance the local cost component of the proposed project); and
(b) a special agreement between HF, MI, HEM, and ONE, clearly setting out their
responsibilities in the financing, implementation, ownership and operation and
maintenance of the project facilities. A further risk is that households and
other potential customers would not start using electricity as soon as their
villages are connected to the national grid.  This risk will be reduced by
providing for the consumer connections to be made automatically at the same time
as the village networks are constructed and by providing for the connection costs
to be recovered from consumers through installments to be paid with each
electricity bill rather than in advance of the connection.

10.         Reconmendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
