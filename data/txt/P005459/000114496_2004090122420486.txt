             Amendments to Loan and Project Agreements
Excellency, dear sir:
    We refer to the Loan Agreement dated June 14, 1991 between the
Kingdom of Morocco (the Borrower) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and to the related Project
Agreement of same date between the Bank and the National Electricity
Authority (ONE), both for the above-captioned Project, and to the
recent correspondence and discussions between representatives of the
Borrower and the Bank in which the Borrower has requested the Bank's
agreement to restructure the Project.
    We wish to inform you that the Loan and Project Agreements are
hereby amended and restated in their entirety as set forth in the
documents attached hereto,  consisting of a Loan Agreement of even
date herewith between the Borrower and the Bank, as amended, and a
Project Agreement of even date herewith between the Bank and ONE, as
amended.  The Supplemental Letters to the Loan and Project
Agreements, dated June 14, 1991 remain in full force and effect.
    Please confirm your agreement to the Loan Agreement as amended
and the Project Agreement as amended by having a duly authorized
representative of the Borrower sign three copies of the Loan
Agreement on page 11 in the space indicated and by having a duly
authorized representative of ONE sign three copies of the Project
Agreement on page 11 in the space indicated and by returning one set
of originals to the Bank.
                   Very truly yours,
