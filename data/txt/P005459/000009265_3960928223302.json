Second Rural\n            Electrification Project are to: (a) expand electricity\n            supply to the rural areas; (b) improve the reliability and\n            quality of service of the existing rural distribution\n            network; (c) strengthen the administrative, planning and\n            financial capabilities in the power subsector; (d) implement\n            institutional reforms; and (e) encourage further reforms in\n            the electricity tariff structure.  The project will provide\n            electricity to about 170,000 new customers in 462 villages.\n            It includes: (a) construction of distribution lines and\n            transformers capacity; (b) construction of operating\n            buildings and supply of vehicles and specialized equipment;\n            (c) consultants' services to assist in detailed\n            engineering design.  The project also will strengthen Office\n            National de l'Electricite (ONE's) distribution\n            department through technical assistance, training and\n            logistical support to plan, monitor and implement the rural\n            electrification program.  The project provides funds for\n            civil works, equipment installation and erection, training\n            and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1990-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
