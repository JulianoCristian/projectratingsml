The overall outcome of the project was rated\n            marginally satisfactory; the performance of the Banks was\n            mixed; and the borrower performance is considered as\n            deficient for compliance with covenants, and as marginally\n            satisfactory for project implementation. The main objectives\n            of the project were to: (a) expand electricity supply to the\n            rural areas; (b) improve the reliability and quality of\n            service of the existing rural distribution network; and (c)\n            strengthen the administrative, planning, and financial\n            capabilities in the power sector. The project was also\n            expected to contribute to the Government's policy of\n            improving the efficiency of energy consumption. The main\n            lessons can be drawn from the project are as follows: (a) A\n            rigorous economic analysis of the benefits of rural\n            electrification can justify the relative high investment\n            costs of a rural electrification project. In particular, the\n            value of the consumer's surplus benefit needs to be\n            carefully evaluated because it plays a key role in the\n            economics of the project. In this case the value of the\n            consumer's surplus benefit is of the same order of\n            magnitude of benefit proxied by the revenue yielded by the\n            electricity tariffs. (b) Successful implementation of a\n            rural electrification project requires that the government\n            be fully committed to clear objectives and stable project\n            financing and institutional arrangements. In the Moroccan\n            project, the Government's hesitant commitment to two\n            financing and institutional setups hampered and delayed\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
