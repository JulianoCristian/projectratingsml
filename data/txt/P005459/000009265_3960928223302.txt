KINGDOM OF MOROCQCO
SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMY
IgSxFoer:               Kingdom of Morocco.
ieneziciz=:             The Office National de l'Electricit6 (ONE).
Igan Amayn£:         US $ 114.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                  Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Prolect Description:    The proposed project would be a continuation of the first
phase of the National Rural Electrification Program
(NREPM), initiated with Bank assistance in 1980. It
would ensure the connection to the main grid of about
462 new villages located in 34 provinces, and would cover
the cost of connecting about 170,000 new consumers, thus
increasing the rate of electrification of the rural areas
from 25X to about 452.   It would also involve the
expansion of ONE's operating facilities and regional
offices and would follow up on the institution building
efforts initiated under previous and ongoing operations,
and aimed at strengthening ONE's planning, distribution
and marketing capabilities, and its financial perfor-
mance.
Baenfit^:               The principal benefits of the project would derive from
the value attached by rural consumers to the incremental
electricity sales, which would either substitute for
other less efficient fuels or satisfy their as yet unmet
energy needs.    Although  not  easily  quantifiable,
secondary benefits are expected from improving the well-
being of the rural population, promoting economic
development of rural areas and stemming rural-urban
migration.   The internal economic rate of return,
excluding these secondary benefits is estimated at about
18X.
Risks:                  Two major project-related risks which might lead to delay
in project implementation stem from possible delays by
the Government in providing adequate counterpart funds,
and possible inadequate coordination between the various
entities involved in the project. These were important
problems experienced during the implementation of NREP1.
These risks will be alleviated by the Government' s recent
decision to increase the financial resources of the local
communities for their development programs by allocating
to these programs 302 of the funds collected from the
value added tax (VAT), and by the special agreement



entered into between the ministries involved in the
project and ONE, and which was executed as condition of

MOROCCO
SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ENERGY SECTgI
1.01        Energy Resources.  Morocco has a wide variety of energy resources
including: oil, natural gas, oil shale, coal, hydro, uranium, biomdss, wind
and solar energy. However, the currently known reserves are either small or
have high per unit costs of production, with the result that there has been
only limited domestic commercial energy development. Over the past ten years,
imports supplied more than 80X of Morocco's commercial energy demand.  Limited
reserves of oil and natural gas have been discovered and production is less
than 75 thousand tons oil equivalent (toe) per year. Morocco's oil shale
reserves are estimated to be over 100 billion tons, containing more than six
billion tons of oil. However, the prospects for early development have been
dampened by declining international oil prices as well as the discontinuation
of significant development of oil shale technology in other countries.
Morocco has proven recoverable coal reserves of about 12 million tons in the
Jerada Coal basin, 60 km South of Oujda. However, the difficult geological
conditions imply that the current production level of about 600,000 tons (used
by a mine-month power station) is unlikely to be exceeded during the mine's
remaining 15 years of life. The country's hydropower potential is estimated
at 4,600 GWh per year (1.1 million toe) under average hydrological conditions.
Of this potential, 1,800 GWh has already been tapped and new hydro projects
with an annual production of 750 GWh are under construction. Natural forests
in Morocco, covering about 5.3 million hectares, are an important source of
energy for a large proportion of the population. Fuelwood consumption,
estimated at about 3.4 million toe in 1984, is sufficiently high to cause
deforestation at a rate of about 20,000 hectares per year. Seven to 10
million tons (60-80 billion toe) of uranium are contained in Morocco's 50
billion tons of phosphate reserves. Extraction, however, is costly with
present technology. Solar and wind resources are abundant, but neither is
likely to contribute significantly to the country's energy supplies before the
21st century.
1.02        Past Energy Consumption and SUDDly. Commercial energy consumption
grew at an average of 7.41 per year from 1965 to 19801/, but the growth rate
declined between 1980 and 1988 to an average of 2.71 (Table 1.1). This
decline exceeded the reduction in economic growth. The ratio of energy growth
to GDP growth averaged 1.47 over the period 1965 to 1980, but was only 0.67
from 1980 to 1988. The reduction is due largely to the maintenance of high
domestic energy prices (para. 1.08) and implementation of other energy
conservation measures (para. 1.06).

9/    Excludes use and losses in refining and non-energy uses (about 11  of
petroleum consumption).
The jump in 1988 is largely explained by a 10.7X real increase in GDP.
1.03        Most of Morocco's commercial energy consumption consists of oil,
nearly all of which is imported. Oil consumption grew from 601 of commercial
energy consumption to 831 in 1985 before falling back to 771 in 1988 (4,449
thousand toe). The growth in the share of oil prior to 1985 was due mainly to
theldrought-induced decrease in hydroelectricity which fell by over two thirds
between 1980 and 1985. The fall in oil's share after 1985 was due to an
increase in the use of coal as a result of a partial switch motivated by
relative price considerations from fuel oil to imported coal for electricity
generation, cement production and sugar refining. Hydroelectricity supply
also picked up after 1985 as reservoir levels gradually rose following the end
of the drought. Donestic commercial energy production, mostly coal and
hydroelectricity, declined by 341 between 1980 and 1984 before recovering by
281 in the following four years. This variation is due largely to the changes
in hydroelectricity production.
1.04        Morocco's per capita consumption of commercial energy of 239
kilograms of oil equivalent in 1988 was the fourth lowest among EMENA coun-

tries'/. As noted in paragraph 1.01, traditional energy in the form of fuel
wood consumption continues to play a large role in Morocco. The energy
balance in Annex 1.1 shows that traditional energy accounted for about one-
third of total energy consumption in 1988. The energy balance also highlights
the importance of energy used for electricity generation, accounting for 56X
of heavy fuel oil consumption in 1988, 72X of coal, as well as all the
hydroelectricity.
1.05        Energy Sector Organization.  The Ministry of Energy and Mines
(MEM) is responsible for the overall plataning and development of the energy
sector.  It has tutelage over a number of energy-related public enterprises
including: (i) the "Office National de Recherches et d'Exploitation
P6trolierel (ONAREP); (ii) the "Societ6 Anonyme Marocaine de l'Industrie du
Raffinage" (SAMIR); (iii) the Societ6 Ch6rifienne des Petroles (SCP), which is
751 owned by ONAREP and the Treasury, with the rest being held by local and
foreign private shareholders; (iv) the "Societ6 Nationale des Produits
Petroliers" (SNPP), which is the holding company for the 501 of the shares the
Government has in the major petroleum distribution companies, the other 50X of
which are held by major international oil companies; (v) "Charbonnages du
Maroc", operator of the Jerada coal mine; and (vi) ONE. The Ministry of the
Interior (MI) has a role in the energy sector by virtue of having tutelage
over 15 publicly-owned distribution utilities (R6gies), of which 10 distribute
electricity ir. the main urban areas. The 15 Regies are also responsible for
water distribution, and the Regie of Casablanca (RAD) is responsible for
sewage disposal as well. Other ministries with involvement in the sector
include the Ministry of Public Works which constructs d&-us for
hydroelectricity, and the Ministry of Agriculture end Agrarian Reform (MARA)
through its responsibility for forest protection and management, the Ministry
of Finance (MF), the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of
Planning (MP).
1.06        Government Energv Policy.  The Government's long-term objective is
to reduce the current predominant reliance on oil imports while attempting to
meet energy needs in a cost-effective way. With respect to energy demand, the
Government's objectives include: (a) promotion of energy conservation through
price measures (para. 1.08) and non-price measures; and (b) encouragement of
economically profitable interfuel substitution. Non-price measures already
carried out include energy audits of large industries, a publicity campaign
and shortening the work week to five days. A new $5 million USAID financed
program is focussing on energy conservation in agro-industries, the
construction industry and hotels. For interfuel substitution, 2xlSO MW units
at ONE's power station at Mohammedia, some cement plants and sugar refineries
were converted to permit the use of coal.
1.07        On the supply side, the Government has sought to increase
production of domestic energy resources directly through public enterpr.ses
and in recent years by encouraging private initiatives through the use of more
attractive new petroleum exploration agreements. Efforts are continuing to
develop a wide range of energy resources by constructing additional

multipurpose hydro projacts, maintaining coal production, continuing
exploration for oil and gas, investigating the potential of wind, solar,
nuclear energy and oil shale, preparing for a reinforcement of the existing
power interconnection with Algeria and examining a possible power
interconnection with Spain. Studies are being planned to evaluate a proposal
to construct a natural gas pipeline from Algeria through Morocco to Spain.
Morocco would receive gas from this line and from a separate line from Algeria
to northeast Morocco. The Bank is assisting in this effort through the
preparation of a natural gas development plan for Morocco under the auspices
of ESMAP. To strengthen its centralized energy investment planning
capabilities, MEM has set up a micro-computer-based planning unit with USAID
assistance.
1.08        Ener_y Pricing1/ Morocco's domestic prices for petroleum products
are on average considerably above their economic costs (Table 1.2). This is
the result of a conscious decision in 1986 to maintain domestic petroleum
prices at their previous high levels, partly as an incentive for continued
energy conservation but mostly because of the need for additional tax revenues
for a national exchequer that was - and remains - very stretched. A recent
World Bank study examined the impact of these high prices on energy consumers,
suppliers, and on Government revenues. It concluded that the high oil prices
have a fairly small adverse impact on the competitive position of industry and
agriculture, but suggested that if and when it is possible to increase non-
energy taxes, taxes on oil should be reduced by a corresponding amount so as
to permit the domestic price of heavy fuel oil to be reduced to a level close
to the price in other oil importing countries in competition with Morocco2.
The report also recommended changing the structure of petroleum product and
coal prices in order to encourage Increased economic efficiency. This report
has been well received in Morocco, and the Government is currently studying
ways to implement its recommendations, with the assistance of consultants
financed by USAID.
1.09        Consumers of imported coal pay the international price plus an
import tax and an import duty totalling 15X plus a 192 value added tax (VAT).
The price for domestic coal of DH 664 per ton (excluding 19X VAT) paid by ONE
is estimated by the Bank to be approximately equal to the import cost for
anthracite of a quality which can be used in the Jerada power station. It
conforms to the agreement under the Jerada Coal Mine Modernization and
Expansion Project (Loan 2508 MOR) under which the domestic price should not
exceed the opportunity cost.

II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
2.01       Power Subsector Suppliers.  The power subsector is composed of:
(a) ONE, responsible for nearly all public power generation (about 86X of
Morocco's total generation) and transmission, and distribution to all high-
voltage customers and to medium and low-voltage customers in some cities and
rural areas; (b) ten communal distributica R6gies each responsible for
distribution at medium and low voltage in a city plus, in most cases, some
surrounding communities; (c) small isolated systems operated by MI; and (d)
captive plants operated by industries which occasionally sell electricity to
or buy it from ONE; the largest captive plants belong to the OCP group: Maroc
Phosphore, Phosboucraa and Maroc Chimie. In June 1988, the interconnection
with Algeria was reopened, permitting exchanges of electricity between Morocco
and Algeria. The entities' si-ares of the power market in 1988 are given in
Annexes 2.1 and 2.2 and summarized below:

b/   ONE also supplies electricity to the Regies, purchases electricity
from autoproducers, and trades electricity with Algeria. Net
imports from Algeria were 18.2 GWh in 1988.
2.02       On a national level, total generation increased by 7.5X per year
from 4361 GWh in 1978 to 8965 GWh in 1988. Data on the growth of the
subsector are given in Annex 2.1.
2.03       Electricity Tariffs.  Tariff rates are currently greater than long-
run marginal costs (LRMC) for all voltage levels and tariff categories (Annex
2.4). The 1988 weighted average revenue for sales to final customers in
Morocco of DH 0.82 per kWh was 621 higher than the estimated weighted average
LRMC of DH 0.51 per kWh. This discrepancy is due mainly to the difference
between the domestic price of heavy fuel oil, which largely determines the
level of selling prices, and the much lower economic cost of heavy fuel oil
used in the calculation of the LRMC. The recommendation of the Energy Pricing
Study to reduce the domestic price of heavy fuel oil would allow the gap
between average revenue and LRMC to be reduced (para. 1.08). Morocco's
electricity tariff structure has been gradually simplified and improved over



- 7 
the past decade (Annex 2.3). Regional variations in retail rates have been
reduced, and a progressive structure has been introduced for urban and rural
household customers.  However, differences between tariff rates for different
categories of consumption and during different periods of time do not reflect
the economic cost differences. The most serious defect is the absence of a
separate peak period rate, which would discourage electricity consumption
during peak periods, thereby reducing the need for new electricity supply
capacity.
2.04       The Government recognizes that these defects need to be rectified
and is carrying out a study, financed under the Public Enterprise
Rationalization Loan (PERL, Loan 2820-MOR), to develop specific proposals for
their resolution'/. The electricity tariff study, expected to be completed by
mid-1991, includes calculation of the LRMC, and will recommend a tariff level
and structure which would reflect the economic costs as far as possible,
subject to constraints imposed by the need to satisfy Government-specified
financial objectives.
2.05       The reports prepared by the consultants (some still in preliminary
draft form) envisage that introduction for high and medium-voltage consumers
of separate energy charges for three periods of the day and two seasons, and
demand charges which are partially variable over the same periods. Less
complex structures are proposed for low-voltage customers since the benefits
attributable to the more complex structures would likely be less for them than
the additional costs associated with the sophisticated meters required by
these structures. For purposes of the proposed rural electrification project,
the most relevant tariffs are those proposed for low-voltage residential
customers and medium and low-voltage agricultural customers. Residential
customers would pay a demand charge (differing according to subscribed demand)
and an energy charge. They could choose between a single energy charge and an
option having two different charges, one for day-time hours and the other for
night-time hours. For social reasons, there would also be a tariff offered to
small users consisting, for the first 50 kwh per month, of an energy charge
only, equal to the energy charge for residential users who select the single
energy rate option. Additional monthly consumption would be charged a higher
rate. Since average monthly consumption of residential customers in the
villages to be electrified is forecast to be less than 50 kWh (para 5.01) most
of those customers would be able to benefit from the small user option. The
proposed low-voltage agricultural tariff consists of a demand charge
(differing according to subscribed demand) and an energy charge, which would
be much lower in summer than in winter. Most electricity for water pumping,
however, is purchased at medium voltage. The structure for medium-voltage
agricultural consumers proposed by the consultants consists of a demand charge
which depends on the number of hours of use of the subscribed demand per year
and un the proportion of subscribed demand used during daytime periods, and an
energy charge, differentiated for two periods of the day and two seasons of
the year as well as for hours of use of subscribed demand (Annex 2.3).
11    Electricit6 de France International and the Moroccan group CID are
the consultants engaged for this study.



- 8 -
2.06       Although the tariff study is not yet finished, the Government
decided, effective May 1, 1989, to implement the new tariff structure proposed
by the consultants for medium-voltage agricultural customers. In this
structure, the energy rateii for the summer period, when most pumping for
agriculture occurs, are considerably lower than the winter rates (DH 0.55 per
kWh per daytime summer hours compared to DH 0.98 per kwh per daytime winter
hours). As a result average electricity costs for agricultural consumers were
expected to decrease. The Government simultaneously raised overall low-
voltage tariffs by approximately 2X to compensate ONE for lost revenue from
agricultural customers. These changes are satisfactory.
2.07       The other preliminary reform proposals of the consultants are also
acceptable, and the proposed project provides for technical assistance to the
Government to implement tariff reforms (para 3.15). During negotiations, the
Government agreed to decide on the basic elements of the new tariff structure
by December 31, 1990, and to continue to implement gradually the recommen-
dations of the study, on the occasion of each tariff adjustment, with the
objective of implementing a global national tariff policy acceptable to the
Bank, starting June 30, 1992 (para 6.02).
2.08       Connection Charges.  An important source of funds for ONE and the
Rdgies are revenues obtained from connection charges for new customers. These
cover the cost of connection plus 20X for overhead expenses, plus, for some
customer categories, a contribution for grid expansion. Connection charges
for the separable costs of connection are economically justifiable provided
they cover but do not greatly exceed the separable costs. However, these
charges are large, particularly when the customer is far from the grid and/or
a contribution for grid expansion is required. In the absence of a facility
offered by the electricity companies for spreading payments over time, the
high charges have probably discouraged new customers in urban and rural areas.
Nevertheless, the revenues received by the Regies from connection charges
finance more than half of their investment programs, and have enabled them to
remain afloat in the past when the Government failed to increase the margins
between their selling and buying prices by enough to cover increased costs.
Thus the establishment of a facility for spreading out payments of connection
charges would be unrealistic for the Regies at the present time and would
impose a financial burden on ONE. Hence it is not feasible to generalize a
deferred payment system for all ONE or Regies consumers at this time.
Nevertheless, to assess the impact of such a system on consumer access and
affordability, it has been agreed to introduce it on a test basis for
customers who would be served by the proposed project (para 3.07).
ONE . The Executing Agency for the Project
2.09       Organization and Management.  ONE was established in 1963 as a
Government-owned enterprise when the subsector was nationalized and the
generating facilities, together with a number of distribution networks, were
transferred to it. ONE's management reports to an eight-member Board under
the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, who is usually represented by the
Minister of Energy and Mines. The other Board members are representatives of
the Ministries of Finance (MF), Planning, Interior and Public Works, and of



- 9 -
management and labor.  The Board meets regularly two to three times per year.
ONE's management is competent, knowledgeable and strong. The General Manager
is ONE's chief executive, and he is assisted by a Deputy General Manager. Day
to day business is delegated to four directors who are responsible for five
departments: administrative services, finance, planning and equipment,
generation and transmission, and distribution. The Director of Finance is
also Director of Administrative Services. The existing organizational
structure (Annex 2.5) is satisfactory.
2.10       lanning.  ONE's planning staff are competent and well-informed.
However, there is a need for increasing the number of personnel and computer
resources to permit more detailed demand analysis and greater use of planning
models. ONE is only in the early stages of implementing systematic procedures
tor establishing priorities among distribution projects, expenditures on
rehabilitation, studies and miscellaneous projects. In general, more
attention needs to be paid to coordinating the expenditure programs submitted
by the various departments of ONE by ensuring that procedures for handling
details such as inflation, interest during construction and physical
contingencies are established properly and applied uniformly. Recommendations
for strengthening ONE's demand forecasting and planning capability are
expected to be made in the context of the electricity tariff study (para.
2.05). ONE has already received, from the consultants doing the study,
computer software for load forecasting, distribution system planning and
marginal cost calculation. Distribution planning analyses for ONE are to be
carried out under the Power Distribution Project (Loan 2910-MOR). Additional
computer hardware would be provided under the proposed project (para. 3.03).
2.11       Personnel.  Between 1981 and 1988 the number of ONE's permanent
staff increased from 5,767 to 8,462. In 1988 the number of thermal and hydro
production employees per MW of thermal and hydro capacity was rather high, 1.3
and 1.0, respectively, compared to "normal" levels of 0.6 and 0.4, respective-
ly. This is partly due to the fact that ONE has many small diesel stations
(18) and a large number of hydro plants in operation (21). The number of
connections per employee was modest at 80 (a normal figure would be two-
thirds higher) but this is not surprising in view of the fact that most urban
centers are served by the Regies.
2.12       ONE has some difficulties in recruiting and retaining suitably
qualified staff. The problem is in part general, due to a shortage of
technicians in the country, and in part because of the rather low salaries in
comparison with the private sector, particularly for new staff. However,
career development possibilities in ONE are reasonable, and there are
substantial fringe benefits after a minimum number of years of service.
2.13       Training.  ONE is fully aware of the importance of training and has
an efficient training center in Casablanca with a capacity to train about 400
technicians annually. Trainees are contractually obliged to remain a number
of years in the employment of ONE. Assignment to special training abroad,
particularly in France, is quite common for higher-level staff. In general,
ONE's training activities are satisfactory and efforts are being made to
improve them further. The proposed Project includes a component for training
in order to strengthen ONE's distribution department in the areas of



- 10 -
engineering design planning and data collection to plan, monitor and implement
subsequent plans of the rural electrification program.
2.14       Existing Facilities.  ONE's total installed generating capacity in
December 1989 was 1963 MW, of which 616 MW was hydroelectric and 1,347 MW
thermal (1,185 MW steam, 136 MW combustion turbine and 26 MW diesel - see
Annex 2.6). Total installed capacity increased at an average annual rate of
9.81 between 1978 and 1985, but has remained virtually constant since then.
During the former period the mix of hydro and thermal plant changed from 43:57
to 31:69. In winter 1988/1989, ONE's available thermal capacity of 1320 MW
plus guaranteed hydro capacity of 280 MW was barely sufficient to cover the
peak demand on the interconnected system of 1430 MW and to provide for planned
maintenance and unscheduled outages, but the interconnection with Algeria
provided a back-up source of supply. The major generating stations and load
centers are interconnected by a 225-kV grid extending 3143 km (see Annex 2.8
and map). There are also 864 km of 150-kV transmission lines, 6800 km of 60-
kV subtransmission lines, and 19,140 km of distribution lines. Maintenance of
facilities is generally satisfactory.
2.15       System Losses.  In the last 11 years, ONE's losses on its intercon-
nected system, as a percentage of total generation and purchases, averaged
15.1%, including station-own consumption of 7.1% (Annex 2.1). Transmission
losses were high at an average of 6.6%, but decreased after 1986 to 5.91 in
1988. The extremely low distribution losses (average 1.3% of total generation
plus purchases) reflect the fact that ONE's sales to low and medium-voltage
customers (at 22 kV and below) constitute only 21X of its total sales.
Distribution losses for medium and low-voltage networks represent about 6.31
of the related generation, a reasonable figure. In the peripheries,
nevertheless, where rapid urban expansion has taken place, lines may be too
long or overloaded. The Power Distribution Project is addressing this problem
through a rehabilitation program which is expected to lead to some loss
reduction. In addition, plans are being made to examine the transmission and
distribution losses of ONE and the Regies through the UNDP/World Bank Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). The ESMAP study, initiated in
early 1990, is expected to be completed in 1991.
2.16       Number of consumers.  The number of ONE's consumers increased by
7.41 per year from 331,000 in 1979 to 677,000 in 1988 of which 99%, in 1988,
were at low voltage (Annex 2.9). ONE served 4,400 customers in 1988 at medium
voltage and 90 at high voltage. The number of rural consumers included in the
totals for 1988 was 276,000 (41X).
2.17       Electricity Demand Forecast.  Each year from 1984 to 1990 ONE
forecast its sales to grow by an average of 7.01 per year. ONE's forecasts
are based partly on surveys of large customers and partly on estimates made
from a correlation between historical GDP growth and electricity consumption
growth. Since actual growth in sales averaged 6.71 per year from the end of
1984 to the end of 1989, and there are no significant changes in trend
expected to occur over the next four years, a demand forecast was chosen
assuming the continuation of 6.71 growth from 7133 GWh in 1989 to 12,800 GWh
in 1998 (Annex 2.10). ONE is in agreement with this forecast. ONE's
forecasts of peak demand made between 1984 and 1989 have been very accurate



- 11 -
for the same period. In December 1989 ONE forecast peak demand to grow by
6.7S per year to the year 2000. However, no account was taken of the possible
impact of the expected tariff reform on peak demand. The forecast of peak
demand shown in Annex 2.11 assumes that tariff reform will reduce the rate of
growth from an average 6.71 per year from 1989 to 1992 to 6X per year from
1992 to 1998.
ONE: Investment Program
2.18       Generation.  Planned new generating capacity to satisfy demand
through winter 1998/99 includes:
. 6 X 30 MW combustion turbines - end 1991/end 1992
. 45 MW guaranteed hydropower at Hassan 1st - 1991
. 224 MW guaranteed hydropower at Matmata - 1993
. 2 X 300 MW coal power station at Jorf Lasfar - end 1994/end 1995
. 205 MW guaranteed hydropower at M'Jara - 1997,
. 64 MW guaranteed hydropower at Dchar el Oued/Ait Messaoud - 1996.
. 35 MW guaranteed hydropower at M'Dez - 1998
Of these projects the combustion turbines are under construction, financing
has been found for Matmata and M'Jara and financial agreements for Jorf Lasfar
are being finalized. Projected capacity and energy balances are presented in
Annexes 2.11 and 2.12.
2.19       According to a least-cost analysis carried out in the Bank using
the Wien Automatic System Planning Package III (WASP III), the combustion
turbines and Jorf Lasfar enter the least-cost program. Jorf Lasfar would be
needed as early as 1995 even if the rate of demand growth falls to as low as
4.6% per year from 1988. Matmata, M'Jara and Dchar el Oued also enter the
least-cost solution, but only the investment costs of the power stations were
taken into consideration. Whether these projects would be retained when costs
of the dams and other civil works are included depends on whether the surplus
electricity benefits, in combination with the non-electricity benefits of
these projects, cover the overall civil works costs. A supplementary analysis
of this kind suggests that the Matmata project is only marginally economic,
unless world energy prices rise faster than currently forecast. A detailed
analysis of M'Jara carried out by the Bank in September 1989 found that the
overall project, including the hydro power station, is marginally economic.
The Bank plans to carry out a detailed study of Dchar el Oued before a final
decision is made on its construction. Similar studies will also be done for
the proposed hydro-power stations of Ait Messaoud and M'Dez, which on the
basis of current available data do not enter the least-cost solution when
benefits are evaluated in terms of energy savings valued at oil prices
projected by the Bank. These two projects will be re-examined with ONE in the
context of the establishment and updating of a coordinated least-cost
investment in the power subsector (para. 2.22). The Bank's analysis indicates
that the least-cost program would include additional total capacity in the
form of combustion turbines. However, the current program proposed by ONE is
justified in view of the uncertainty over the rate of growth of demand and of
the possibility to decide later to construct additional combustion turbines,
for which the construction period is only two years. The Bank's analysis also



-12 -
indicates a preference for 100 MW combustion turbine units, rather than 30 MW
units. Nevertheless, ONE chose the smaller units for locational and supply
security reasons. In any event, the difference in costs is small relative to
ONE's overall generation investment program. Because of delays in
construction of the new combustion turbines and Jorf Lasfar, the projections
in Annexes 2.11 and 2.12 show that in some years ONE may not be able to
satisfy demand completely from its own power stations. Because of this risk,
ONE is currently negotiating to import electricity from Algeria. The proposed
contract would provide for net imports by ONE over a period of several years,
whereas the existing exchanges with Algeria are designed to leave net trade
equal to zero at the end of each year. Total forecast investment expenditures
on generation are shown in Annex 2.13.
2.20       Transmission.  Forecast transmission expenditures are shown in
Annex 2.13. Approximately half of the expenditures are to connect new power
stations and to reinforce the 225-kV network. The largest
reinforcement/extension projects include: reinforcing the links between
Khenifra and Errachidia; a 225-kV line to Tan Tan; and a 225-KV line from
M'Jara to Tetouan. The other half of the transmission expenditures are for
reinforcing the 60-kV and 22-kV networks.
2.21       Distribution.  Forecast distribution system expenditures are shown
in Annex 2.13. The projected expenditures to 1995 are mainly to implement the
Power Distribution Project supported by World Bank loan 2910-MOR.
2.22       noordinated Instment Pro&rm in the Power Subsector.  The
electricity tariff study (para 2.05), includes the preparation of a least-
cost power investment program coordinating the programs of ONE and the Regies.
This program is to be updated each year by a technical committee with
representatives from ONE, the Regies and the Government and submitted to the
Bank for review before implementation, as agreed under the Power Distribution
Project.
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
2.23       Under its normal activities, ONE stands ready to provide
electricity to rural customers if requested by those potential customers, who
would have to pay for the connections. However, as in most countries, most
rural communities are far from existing distribution lines, so that
individuals or villages, acting independently, are not able to afford the
costs of the long distribution lines and transformers needed to obtain
electricity. In 1977, the Government, aware of the very limited extent of
rural electrification in Morocco, began plans for a National Rural
Electrification Program (NREP) under which it would pay the capital cost of
constructing medium and low voltage facilities to connect targeted villages to
ONE's integrated national grid. Individual customers would still be required
to pay in advance for connections to the v2llage networks as well as for
internal wiring. They would also purchase electricity at the prevailing
tariff rates, which are the same for rural and urban areas.



- 13 -
2.24       Phase I of the program was carried out between 1980 and 1986 with
financial assistance from the Bank (Loan 1695-MOR), and brought electricity to
286 villages containing approximately 60,000 consumers. A study of the socio-
economic impact of the first phase found that the benefits of electrification
have been substantial, particularly through transforming many of the
electrified villages into economically thriving rural centers which have
attracted migrants from non-electrified rural communities'/. Even before this
study was finished, the Comite du Suivi du Programme de l'Electrification
Rurale (COSPER), created in 1986, with representatives from MI, MEM, and ONE,
began work on the selection of villages for Phase II.
2.25       Selection of Villages for the Second Phase of the NREP.  Morocco is
divided into 42 provinces, (see Map IBRD No.22099) each containing a small
number of "cercles". Within each "cevele" are several "caidats" each of which
in turn extends over several "communes". A commune may include a number of
villages. The provincial governors are appointed by the King, while the heads
of "cercles" and caidats are officials appointed by the Government. The
commune head is elected by the commune's inhabitants.
2.26       The geographical center targeted for electrification in Morocco is
the village. Approximately 1,700 villages previously identified by ONE were
surveyed in order to determine priorities for electrification under the second
phase of the NREP. The choice of the villages to be included was made
following two approaches. First, the 1700 villages were ranked in accordance
with criteria approved by COSPER both globally and by province (Annex 2.14).
While these criteria give some weight to villages which are administrative
centers (chef lieux de commune or chef lieux de caidat), a much larger weight
in aggregate is given to the criteria relating to the economic costs and
benefits of electrification. This point is shown by the calculations
presented in Annex 2.14 for two hypothetical villages. Under the second
approach, the Governors of the provinces submitted their own lists of villages
ranked according to their own priorities. There was a large correspondence
between the rankings of the two lists. Where differences emerged, the
villages in question were examined and discussed in more detail by COSPER
until agreement was reached on a definitive list of 600 villages in 34
provinces. The Bank considers that the two-fold procedure used by the
Moroccan authorities incorporates a satisfactory blend of economic,
administrative and regional considerations.
2.27       The above-mentioned list of 600 villages was subsequently
approved,and included in the Government's 1988-1992 plan for economic and
social development (para 3.11). Because of the favorable impact of the first
phase and the fact that there has been some delay in starting the second
phase, the Government and the local communities assign a high priority to the
proposed project and have demonstrated their seriousness by preparing a
comprehensive plan for the second phase and by taking several important

decisions which will avoid some difficulties experieiaced during the
implementation of Phase I (para 3.16).
2.28       Rural Development Plan.  The Government recognizes that rural
electrification should be coordinated with investments in other rural
infrastructure projects such as for roads, schools, water and health. In the
past, limited resources have constrained both rural investment expenditures
and the capacity for rural development planning and coordination. From now on
there will be fewer constraints as a result of the Government's decision to
allocate 30% of revenues from value-added taxes to the local communities
(para. 3.06). Accordingly the Government has indicated its intention to
implement measures to achieve the necessary coordinated development.
PAST BANK LENDING TO THE ENERGY SECTOR
2.29       The Bank has supported the Government's efforts to expand domestic
energy production and exploit energy resources efficiently through a series of
loans to the energy sector. These include: the Petroleum Exploration Project
(Loan 518-MOR signed in 1980) which led to the discovery of the Neskala gas
field; the Petroleum Exploration and Appraisal Project (Loan 2271-MOR signed
in 1983) which financed development drilling of the Meskala gas field; the
Jerada Coal Mine Modernization and Expansion Project (Loan 2508-MOR, 1985)
intended to increase coal production; and the Oil Shale Engineering Project
(Loan 2114-MOR) which financed studies to assess the technical and economic
viability of commercial exploitation of the Timhadit oil shale deposit.
2.30       Four Bank loans have been made to help expand the power subsector
in Morocco. The first -- 936-MOR, made in October 1973 -- was for US$ 25
million and financed the foreign cost of 2x20 MW combustion turbines plus
transmission system investments. The Project Performance Audit Report (1982)
concluded that the physical facilities were successfully completed with only
minor delays ane within the SAR cost estimates. However, ONE met the main
financial covenant only in the final years, reaching self-financing levels of
241 of investment in 1978 and 22X in 1979, and the covenant requiring that
government bills be paid within 90 days was not met. A study of power
subsector organization was carried out, but the recommendations were not
implemented.  The second loan -- 1299-MOR, made in July 1976 -- was for US$ 49
million and financed part of the foreign cost of the multipurpose Sidi Cheho-
Al Massira Hydro Project including a 120-MW power station and 200 km of 225 kV
transmission line. The Project Completion Report prepared in 1984 noted that
the physical facilities were completed on time. ONE's financial and
accounting organizations were improved. However, from 1980 on, ONE 'sailed to
meet the covenant requiring self-financing of 201 of the investment program
because of the Government's failure to raise electricity rates to compensate
fully for fuel price increases in 1980, and the severe drought conditions in
1981 and 1982. Accounts receivable increased to four months of sales by
October 1982. The Government also failed to take action to improve the
organization of the power subsector.
2.31       The third loan -- 1695-MOR, made in April 1980 -- was for US$ 42
million to finance the first phase of the National Rural Electrification



- 15 -
Program. The Project Completion Report prepared in 1987 concluded that the
project was successfully executed, and at a substantial cost underrun because
of the appreciation of the dollar. However, completion was delayed by 2 1/2
years largely because of changes in the centers to be electrified and the
Government's slowness to ratify the agreement with the executing agency (ONE),
to make local funds available and to grant import licenses for equipment also
manufactured in Morocco. ONE met the 201 cash generation covenant only in
1986. The fourth loan -- 2910-MOR, signed in June 1989 -- is for US$ 90
million to finance rehabilita on and expansion of the distribution systems of
ONE and the Regies of Casablanca, Neknes, Kenitra, Fes and Tetouan.
Performas.ce relative to the financial covenants under this loan is discussed
in decail in Chapter IV which deals with the financial aspects of the project.
2.32       The Bank has contributed jointly with the UNDP to three studies of
the energy sector: 'Morocco: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector" (March
1984), "Morocco: Energy Assessment Status Report" (January 1986); and a
"Household Energy Strategy Study", now underway with assistance from USAID. A
"Power Subsector Study" was completed in 1984, and an Energy Pricing Study in
1989 (para. 1.08).
ABAN ASSISTANCE STAEGY FOtR THE POWER SUBSECTOR
2.33        The Bank supports the Government's objectives: (i) to encourage
the power subsector to satisfy growing electricity demand caused by economic
growth at least cost and without deterioration in quality of service; (ii) to
achieve financial and managerial autonomy for ONE and the Regies; and (iii) to
reduce Government contributions to ONE.
2.34       Three recent lending operations, PERL, the Power Distribution
Project (Loan 2910-MOR) and the National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project
(Loan 2825-MOR) provide a coordinated approach to assisting the Government to
realize these objectives. Under PERL general policy and operational measures
were taken affecting all public enterprises (e.g., accounting, liberalization
of controls). At the same time specific measures concerned ONE. ONE's
tariffs were raised to allow it to achieve a satisfactory cash generation and
to do without Government contributions except for special programs such as the
NREP carried out at the Government's request. Major progress was made towards
paying off Government arrears on electricity bills (para 4.05). A
comprehensive contract - program was signed by ONE and the Government, and the
electricity tariff study is being carried out. The Power Distribution Project
is the first Bank operation to assist some of the Regies' electricity
departments, and as such is designed to ensure their financial viability,
eliminate the.r financial arrears to ONE, strengthen their investment planning
and managerial performance, and improve coordination with ONE. This project
also follows up on agreements under PERL affecting ONE's financial position
and planning performance. The measures under the National Water Supply
Project to strengthen the financial performance of the Redgies' water
departments and improve their accounting and managerial performance will
benefit the Regies' electricity departments, especially by reducing the need
to use electricity revenues to finance water expenditures.



- 16 -
2.35       The proposed project would complement these three operations as
well as follow up on the First Rural Electrification Project. The Bank's
involvement would help ensure efficient implementation of the proposed
project. Experience from the first phase shows the importance of the following
measures which will be taken under the proposed project (Chapter VI): a
signed agreement defining clearly the responsibilities of the various entities
involved in the project and the definitive list of villages to be electrified
as a condition for Board presentation; procedures to facilitate the connection
of customers soon after each village is connected to the national grid;
release of the first set of bidding documents before Board presentation of the
loan; measures to avoid delays in granting import licenses for imported
equipment, to make available funds to cover local expenditures, and complete
procedures needed prior to making disbursements; assurance that the rural
electricity networks will be properly maintained and expanded after project
completion; the maintenance of detailed separate records on electricity sales
resulting from the project (at medium as well as low voltage), and regular
collection of data needed to evaluate the costs and benefits of the project
and to design subsequent phases of the NREP. The proposed project would also
permit follow-up on the institutional efforts initiated under the previous and
ongoing operations aimed at strengthening ONE's planning and marketing
capabilities, and its financial performance.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01        Prolect Setting.  Morocco's rural population represents about 601
of the total population, and only 25X of the agglomerated r'iral population has
access to electricity'/.  Most of the energy needs of the rural population
without access to electricity are being met by fuelwood and charcoal,
aggravating problems of deforestation, and by petroleum products such as
kerosene, diesel oil and butane gas. These forms of energy frequently provide
services of poorer quality and at a higher cost to the economy than the same
services based on electricity. Therefore judicious substitution of
electricity for other energy forms would enhance the economically efficient
use of energy, by reducing per unit energy costs for rural customers. In
addition, it would provide rural customers with access to a range of new
services that would improve their living conditions. It would contribute to
increasing productivity in the agriculture sector, and create decentralized
economic activities leading to increased employment opportunities and reduced
migration of families to urban areas. Towards these ends, rural
electrification has become a key part of the Government's policy for rural
development.
3.02        Proiect Objectives.        The proposed project is the second phase
of the NREP initiated in 1980 with Bank support (para. 2.31). The main
objectives of the proposed project are to: a) expand electricity supply to the
rural areas; (b) improve the reliability and quality of service of the
existing rural distribution network; (c) strengthen the administrative,
planning and financial capabilities in the power subsector; (d) implement
institutional reforms aimed at delineating and streamlining the responsibility
for planning, implementing, operating and managing the rural distribution
system; and (e) encourage further reforms in the electricity tariff structure.
The proposed project would also cortribute to the Government's policy of
improving the efficiency of energy consumption.
3.03        Project DescriRtion.    The proposed project would connect to the
main grid about 462 villages located in 34 provinces, and would cover the cost
of connecting about 170,000 consumers. The proposed project would involve in
particular:
a)    the construction of about 5850 km of medium-voltage (MNV) and low-
voltage (LV) lines, and distribution transformers with a total
installed capacity of about 7OMVA;
b)    the construction of about 170,000 consumer connections;
c)    the construction of operating buildings (regional offices)
containing about 10,000 en of floor space;
1/     Compared with 70X in Algeria and 601 in Tunisia.



18
d)    the supply of vehicles and specialized equipment for operating and
maintaining the distribution network in the newly electrified
villages; and
e)    a technical assistance component including:
i)    constAtancy services for a stock management study;
ii)    consultancy services for an integrated works management
study;
iii)    consultancy services for defining and implementing a
national tariff policy;
iv)    training of ONE's staff in distribution network engineering
design and marketing; and
v)    supply of computer software and hardware for implementing
the recommendations of the above-mentioned studies and the
training component.
By the completion date of this project, electrification of the
rural population living in concentrated areas will have increased from 25X to
4s%. Annex 3.1 gives a detailed description and the location of the proposed
project and Maps IBRD No. 22100 and No. 22099 indicate the main generation and
transmission system and the economic regions and provinces of Morocco,
respectively.
3.04        Project Costs.  The estimated cost of the proposed project
including physical and price contingencies is about DH 1.900.8 million (US$
211.6 million). The total financing required, inclusive of interest during
construction of (US$8.4 million), is about DH 1.972.2 million (US$ 220.0
million) of which DH 1096.2 million (US$ 122.4 million) would be in foreign
exchange. The cost estimates include custom duties and taxes estimated at
about DH 225.6 million (US$ 25.1 million). These estimates are based on May
1990 prices derived from quotations received recently by ONE for similar goods
and services. Given the advanced stage of project design and the repetitive
and routine nature of the work, physical contingencies are assumed at: (a) 7X
for the construction of the main network (LV and MV) including the consumer
connections; and (b) 5X for the operating facilities and the technical
assistance component. Price contingencies have been computed assuming an
implementation period consistent with the relevant Bank standard sectoral
profile, and specific annual increases for domestic and international prices
as follows:
1990 1991 1292 1993 1994 1225 1996 1227
Local (X'          6.2   5.6   5.4   4.4   4.9   5.5   4.2   5.6
International (X)  4.9   4.9   4.9   4.9   4.9   4.9   3.7   3.7
Total price contingencies amount to about 221 of the base cost and physical
contingencies.  Details of the cost estimates are given in Annexes 3.2, 3.3
and 3.4 summarized in Table 3.1 below.

3.05           Project Financing Plan.               According to the agreement between
the Government and ONE regarding the implementation of the NREP, ONE is
responsible for the execution of the program but need not use its own
financial resources to im-plement it. This agreement was applied during the
implementation of the first phase of the NREP (NREP 1), will be extended for
the proposed project, and ONE will not be involved in the financing plan of
the proposed project, with the exception of the foreign costs of consumers'
connections (para 3.07).
3.06           During the implementation of NREP 1, financed by the Bank,
Government financing was made from budgetary allocations channelled through
the MEM and the MI. During the preparation of the 1988-1992 Orientation Plan
for economic and social development, and in line with its policy of
decentralization, the Government decided to increase the financial resources
of the local authorities (provinces and communes) to enable them to implement



- 20 -
their social development programs. To this end 30X of the funds collected
from the value-added tax (VAT) are being made available to the local
authorities. In return, these communes will be responsible for the budgetary
allocations for implementing their development piograms, among which is the
proposed project. Therefore, and in order to ensure full financing for the
proposed project and its efficient implementation, the Government agreed
during negotiations to provide or cause to be provided funds necessary to
cover the entire financing of the proposed project and any cost overruns which
might arise in respect of foreign or local expenditures (para. 6.02).
3.07        The project cost estimate includes also the cost of consumer
connections for low-voltage users covering the supply and installation of the
service drop and entrance equipment. This cost is estimated at about US$ 23.7
million (excluding duties and taxes estimated at about US$ 4.6 million), of
which US$ 17.5 million would be in foreign currency and are included in the
proposed Bank loan. During implementation of NREP1, the financing of the
consumer connections was the responsibility of the customers through a
connection fee paid to ONE in advance covering the actual cost (para. 2.08).
Based on the experience gained during the implementation of NREP1, and in
order to accelerate the pace at which new consumers would be connected to the
grid in the villages to be electrified under the proposed project, ONE agreed,
during negotiations, to waive the requirement that each new consumer pay a
connection fee in advance, and to recover these costs through installments to
be paid by the consumers with each electricity bill, and for an amount equal
to at least 1.5% of the connection cost (para 6.04). The local part of the
consumer connection costs would therefore be prefinanced by the Government,
through the local authorities, and a portion of the proposed Bank loan,
estimated at about US$ 17.5 million, would be on-lent to ONE by the
Government, to finance the foreign exchange component of the consumer
connection costs. This onlending arrangement would be made on the same terms
as the Bank loan and ONE would assume the foreign exchange and interest rate
risks on its share.
3.08        In view of the scattered responsibilities of Government agencies
involved in the subsector at the time of the implementation of NREP1, a
Special Agreement was established between MF, MI, MEN and ONE, to define the
final list of the villages included in that project, and the provisions for
project financing, implementation, and ownership, operation and maintenance of
project facilities. Ratification of this agreement was the only special
condition of effectiveness.  The same procedure will be extended to the
proposed project with some differences regarding mainly project financing and
ownership (paras. 3.05 and 3.16). In addition, and in order to avoid
recurrence of the delays experienced in NREP1 implementation, due to the
compliance with the condition of effectiveness, the Special Agreement between
NF, HI, HEN and ONE for the proposed project was executed as condition of
Board presentation.                                               1
3.09        The proposed project would therefore be financed as follows:
a)    the proposed Bank loan of US$ 114.00 million would cover
about 521 of the total financing required for the proposed



- 21 -
project and 100l of foreign cost net of interest during
construction, and
b)    the remaining US$ 106.0 million would be covered by
the concerned local authorities which are under the
tutelage of MI, for an amount of US$ 104.7 million and
by ONE for an amount of US$ 1.3 million.
A summary of the project financing plan is given in Table 3.2
below:

3.10       Lending Arrangements.  The proposed Bank loan would be made to the
Government for a term of 20 years including a grace period of five years, at
the current variable Bank interest rate. Further to the Loan Agreement
between the Government and the Bank, which would specify that US$ 96.5 million
of the proposed Bank loan would be made available to ONE as an equity
contribution, the legal documents would also include a Project Agreement
between the Bank and ONE which would be the Project Executing Agency (para
3.12), and the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and ONE which
would specify the conditions on which US$ 17.5 million would be onlent to
ONE(para 3.07). Signing of the subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition
of loan effectiveness (para 6.05). The foreign exchange and interest rate
risks on the portion of the loan made available to ONE as an equity
contribution would be borne by the Borrower.
3.11       Project Pregaration. Engineering and Implementation.  After the
completion of NREP1, and in anticipation of the proposed project, the COSPER,
assisted by ONE's distribution department compiled information relating to the
rural areas in Morocco not yet electrified. By the end of 1987, about 1700
villages had been surveyed and information pertinent to their electrification
collected. On the basis of this information, and following the Government's
request, the COSPER prepared a detailed program for the electrification of 600
villages selected among the 1,700, on the basis of criteria which have been
reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory (para 2.26). Implementation of
this program is part of the Government's 1988-1992 Plan for econe'ic and



- 22 -
social development and the proposed project would assist the Government in
electrifying about 462 villages (electrification of the remaining 138 villages
has been initiated with the assistance of the European Investment Bank). The
physical quantities and the types of equipment and material required for the
proposed project were derived from the information collected by ONE and have
been found to be reasonable.
3.12       The proposed project would be implemented by ONE, in accordance
with the project implementazion schedule given in Annex 3.5. Detailed project
engineering design has been already initiated. However, given the volume of
work involved, the task is expected to continue to end 1992, and ONE would be
assisted by engineering firms to be selected in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines for use of consultants. The proposed project would
therefore include about 180 man-months of consulting services for project
engineering design at an estimated cost of about US$ 1.90 million. In order
to avoid delay in project implementation ONE agreed, during negotiations, to
complete the detailed engineering design for the first 200 villages by March
31, 1991, and for the remaining villages by December 31, 1992 (para. 6.04).
3.13       The distribution equipment and materials to be used by ONE as well
as typical construction designs for distribution facilit-.es are standardized,
but some adjustments to these standards were introduced in the proposed
project in order to reduce the costs of the rural distribution system as
compared to the costs of urban distribution systems, without lowering the
quality of service. Therefore detailed technical specifications of equipment
and materials to be used for the proposed project are already available. In
addition, ONE is using, under the ongoing Bank-financed Power Distribution
Project, a sample bidding document which has been approved by the Bank and
which will continue to be used for the proposed project. Therefore it is
expected that the first set of bidding documents for the proposed project
would be issued before October 1990.
3.14       Installation and erection of the facilities would start in early
1992, and the proposed project is expected to be completed by December 31,
1996. Contrary to the procedure used during NREP1, ONE will not require
technical assistance for supervising the erection works and providing overall
coordination vis-a-vis the Bank. These tasks will be ferformed by ONE's
distribution department. This department is well staffed and its performance
has proven satisfactory. In addition, and in order to further strengthen this
department's capabilities in project management, the proposed project would
include an Integrated Works Management stuey to assist ONE's distribution
department in defining and implementing an adequate system for monitoring and
controlling project costs, expenditures and implementation.
3.15       Consultine services.  Implementation of the technical assistance
component of the proposed project would require about:
(a) 45 man-months of consulting services to carry out the above-
mentioned Integrated Works Management System study (para. 3.14) at
an estimated total cost of about US$ 0.70 million of which US$ 0.55
million would be in foreign currency;



- 23 -
(b) 55 man-months of consulting services to assist ONE in the inventory
control and materials management system study (para. 4.35), at an
estimated total cost of about USS 0.80 million, of which US$ 0.60
million would be in foreign currency;and
(c) 20 man-months of consulting services to assist the Government in
implementing a national tariff policy in the power subsector, at an
estimated cost of US$ 0.20 million.
3.16       Ownership. Operation and Maintenance.  Under NREP1, all project
facilities were transferred to ONE's ownership with the exception of the low-
voltage network which is owned by the communes, and its operation and main-
tenance entrusted to ONE within the framework of a special agreement between
ONE and MI, and numerous contracts between the communes and ONE, for managing
the network. This led to a situation where: (i) ONE was not compensated for
the losses it incurred when maintaining the low-voltage network; and (ii) the
extension and development of the electrified centers were not implemented
adequately, and when requested by the customers. Recognizing the weaknesses
of this arrangement, and for a more efficient operation and development of the
rural areas, ONE and MI agreed that all facilities of the proposed project
including the low-voltage network, would be owned, operated and maintained by
ONE, and they also agreed to extend this new arrangement to the rural centers
electrified under NREP1.
3.17       After the commissioning of the project facilities, ONE's rural
distribution network would be largely extended and ONE's regional offices
would require additional facilities and equipment to operate and maintain this
network adequately. The construction of new operating buildings and the
acquisition of vehicles and specialized equipment included in the proposed
project would assist ONE in achieving this objective.
3.18       Proiect Monitoring.  ONE would submit to the Bank quarterly reports
covering the work of consultants, physical progress, project costs, financing,
disbursement and administrative aspects of the Project. ONE would also
undertake to prepare and furnish to the Bank, within six months after the loan
closing date, or such later date as might be agreed for this purpose, a
Project Completion Report of such scope and detail as the Bank shall reasonab-
ly request. Furthermore, and in order to establish a sound basis for planning
future stages, ONE confirmed during negotiations that it would collect
regularly and maintain data on the socioeconomic characteristics of the
villages electrified under the proposed project. These data include:
electricity consumers; electricity consumption at low and medium-voltage by
type of end user; revenue, investment and operating costs of electricity
supply to each village. Further details are given in Annex 3.6.
3.19       Procurement.  ONE has grouped the goods and services required for
the proposed project in 15 packages to be procured each in different
stages. Annex 3.7 gives the details of these packages and their estimated
procurement schedule. All items to be financed by the Bank would be procured
in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.



- 24 -
3.20       Items (a) through (k), and the bulk of item (m) (see para 3.22
below), related to goods, specialized equipment and vehicles, installation and
erection works, and construction of regional operating facilities, would be
procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank procurement guidelines. For procurement of goods through ICB, local
suppliers would be allowed a margin of preference equal to the existing rate
of custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers or 15X of the cost-
insurance-freight (CIF) price, whichever is lower. Furthermore, and in order
to ensure efficient implementation of the proposed project, the Government and
ONE confirmed during negotiations their intention to implement adequate
measures for prompt granting to ONE of import licenses for goods required for
the project as an alternative to goods also manufactured in Morocco, (para.
6.02).
3.21       The goods and works required for the consumers' connections would
also be procured through ICB, either as a separate package for the supply of
meter boxes and meters, or as a sub-item included in a single responsibility
main package for the supply of cables and installation and erection.
3.22       Procurement of item (m) related to installation and erection of the
main network, and construction of consumer connections, would also involve
numerous small sub-projects which are scattered throughout the country, labor-
intensive and with works spread over time, constraining their being packaged
to attract foreign bidders. Furthermore, the experience under NREP 1
demonstrated that foreign bidders had limited interest in participating in the
bidding procedure. Therefore, these small contracts, totalling about US$20.0
million, and not exceeding US$500,000 per contract, are expected to be won by
local contractors and they would be awarded following local competitive
bidding procedures (LCB) which are in any case open to interested foreign
bidders. These LCB procedures were agreed on during negotiations, and
outlined in a Supplemental Letter.
3.23       Items (n) and (o), which relate to the detailed engineering design
of the project and the technical assistance component, would be procured in
accordance with the provision of the Bank's guidelines for use of consul-
tants. Training manuals and other training aids would be procured through
international shopping; for such items ONE would obtain written price
quotations from at least three qualified suppliers.
3.24       All bidding and contract documents for works, equipment and
materials to be financed by the Bank, and costing over US$ 500,000 each, would
be subject to prior Bank review. Other Bank-financed contracts costing less
than this threshold value would be subject to post-award Bank review.

3.26        Disbursements.  The disbur£ements from the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan would be made for:
(a)   100l   of the foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment
and materials and 100X of local ex-factory prices of equipment and
materials manufactured in Morocco;and 78X of local expenditures
for previously imported equipment procured locally;
(b)   56X of total expenditures for civil works and installation and
erection;
(c)   1002 of total expenditures for services of consultants; and
(d)   1002 of foreign expenditures for training.
3.27        The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is
shown in Annex 3.8 and has been computed on the basis of the EMENA Region
standard profile for similar power projects. Annex 3.9 gives a comparison
with the actual disbursement of the First Rural Electrification Project (Loan
1695-MOR). The closing date of the proposed loan would be June 3G, 1997, six
months after the project completion date.
3.28        Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for claims
for expenditures under contracts whose value is less than US$ 200,000
equivalent. These claims would be subject to presentation of a Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs) for which the supporting documents would be retained by
ONE for audit purposes, and reviewed periodically by the Bank. This
documentation, in addition to being held for one year after the audit for the
year in which the last withdrawal from the loan proceeds is made, would be
examined by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and made available for review by
Bank representatives upon request. In order to facilitate project
implementation two special accounts, one to be administered by ONE in respect
of consumer connections and the other to be administered by MF in respect of
the balance of the proposed project, may be established on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The amounts of authorized allocations
would be US$ 0.90 million and US$ 5.0 million respectively. During
negotiations, the Government agreed to have these accounts and the SOEs
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (para 6.02).
3.29        Retroactive Financing and Advanced Contracting.  No retroactive
financing or advanced contracting is involved in the proposed project.
3.30        Environmental ImDact.  The proposed project would have a
beneficial impact by improving the well-being of the rural population,
promoting economic development and contributing to an improved standard of
living in rural areas. The project would have no significant negative impacts
on the environment. ONE would coordinate the routing of the lines with local
authorities to minimize their impact and provide compensation when land is
required for supporting facilities. Equipment provided under the project
would have limited noise level, adequate safety standards to minimize the risk
of electrocution and transformers used would not contain PCB's
(polychlorinated biphenyls). Proper occupational health safety practices



- 27
would be used in the installation and maintenance of project facilities. The
project would have limited aesthetic impacts on the landscape.
3.31        rxoject  Risks.  Two major project related risks, which could lead
to delay in project implementation stem from: (a) possible delays by the
Government in providing adequate counterpart funds; and (b) possible lack of
coordination between the various entities involved in the definition,
financing and implementation of the project. (This was an important problem
experienced during the implementation of NREP 1). These risks will be
alleviated by: (a) the Government's recent decision to increase the financial
resources of the local communes for their development programs by allocating
to these programs 301 of the funds collected from the (VAT) (para. 3.06); and
(b) by the special agreement which was executed between MF, MI, MEK and ONE,
as condition of Board Presentation (para. 3.08). A further risk is that
households and other potential customers would not start using electricity as
soon as their villages are connected to the national grid. This risk will be
reduced by providing for the consumer connections to be made automatically at
the same time as the village networks are constructed and by providing for the
connection costs to be recovered from consumers through installments to be
paid with each electricity bill rather than in advance of the connection
(para. 3.07).

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A.    ONE - Recent Financial Psrformance
4.01        Financial Results 1983-89.   Details concerning ONE's financial
results for the period 1983-89 are presented in Annex 4.1. The key financial
ir.icators for the period are presented in the Table 4.1 below.
Table 4.1:A

Current Ratio      1.A  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.1  1.3  1.1
As shown in this table, in recent years ONE's financial situation has
generally improved following a prolonged period of considerable distress due
to problems largely beyond its control. These included rapidly increasing oil
prices over the period 1979-84, major losses of hydropower generation due to
the drought conditions which prevailed from 1982-85 and exchange rate losses
related to ONE's foreign borrowings. It is also notable that because of
Morocco's domestic energy pricing policies(para 1.08), ONE has not benefited
from the low world oil prices prevailing since prices collapsed in 1986.
4.02       Thus, the period prior to 1985 was characterized by losses, low or
negative rates of internal cash generation as a percent of fixed capital
investment, inadequate debt service coverage and deteriorating debt to equity
ratios. In 1986, with a return to more normal rainfall and the start-up of
two coal-fired generating units, ONE benefited from increased hydro-power
production and lower fuel costs, thus permitting ONE to report a net profit.
Certain extraordinary charges in 1987, including deferred depreciation and
exchange losses on foreign debt, resulted in ONE reporting a loss in that
year. As the result of tariff increases of 5 in May 1987 and August 1988,
ONE was again profitable in 1988. In addition to the tariff increases, a
rescheduling of ONE's debt during 1988 resulted in a large reduction in its
debt service load. The combination of these events increased ONE's internal
cash generation ratio in 1988 to over 100%.
4.03       Comnliance with Financial Covenants under Previous and Ongoing
Projects.   For the reasons outlined above, prior to 1985, ONE was unable to
comply with its Agreements with the Bank under Loans 1299-MOR and 1695-MOR,
under which ONE was required to achieve a net internal cash generation ratio
of at least 201 in 1980 and thereafter. Taking into account the adverse
hydrological conditions and recognizing that ONE's financial situation might



- 29 -
take several yoars to redress, the Bank agreed in 1983 to waive the cash
generation covenant for three years up to and including 1986.
4.04       The Agreement under the ongoing Power Distribution Project (Loan
2910-MOR, signed in June 1989), increased ONE's required internal cash
generation ratio to 25X in 1989 and 1990 and 302 in 1991 and thereafter. The
Agreement also restricts ONE's future borrowings if its debt service coverage
ratio falls below 1.5. In 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988 and 1989, Morocco's foreign
debts, including ONE's, were rescheduled. Assisted, in part, by these
reschedulings, ONE was able to achieve, in 1989, adequate results in terms of
its debt service coverage ratio and internal cash generation ratio.
4.05       Public Sector Arrears.  ONE experiences significant delays in
receiving payments from many public sector customers and thus, in turn, is
slow in payizLg for its purchases of fuel oil. Of greatest concern are the
arrears of the R6gies, Government departments, and Local Authorities, which
account for around 50Z, 2.7% and 1.31, respectively, of ONE's total sales. At
the end of 1988, these public sector customers had accounts payable to ONE
amounting to DH 2.2 billion, of which DH 1.6 billion was overdue. These
amounts are very high relative to ONE's sales for the year which were DH 4.5
billion. A summary of the situation is given in Table 4.2 below.
4.06       As shown in Table 4.2, measures taken under PERL have substan-
tially reduced the arrears which had accumulated prior to the end of 1986.
Hiowever, for the R6gies, accounts receivable related to current year's sales,
after declining from 7.9 months at the end of 1986 to 3.1 months at the end of
1987, have been rising again in 1988 and 1989 and were back up to 8.2 months
of sales at the end of September 1989. The receivables from the Government
and local authorities, expressed in months of sales, though reduced from 12 to
9.4 months, also remain unacceptably high. For compliance with covenants
established under the Power Distribution Project, accounts receivable from the
Rdgies should not exceed 3 months of sales, while those from Government and
local authorities can be as high as 6 months of sales, but should not exceed 4
months at year end.
4.07       Under the Power Distribution Project, all accounts due to ONE by
the Regies, Government and local authorities, as of July 31, 1988 are required
to be paid off in five equal annual installments, with the first installment
being paid no later than September 30, 1988 and the last no later than
September 30, 1992. Even though the first two installments were not paid as
required, other arrangements, have been agreed to by ONE, the Regies and the
Government and are being implemented. These arrangements are considered
satisfactory since they require the Regies to pay off these arrears in 18
monthly installments for RAD and 24 for the other Regies starting June 1989,
and would therefore result in the settlement of the Regies' arrears earlier
than September 30, 1992. In addition, most of the Government arrears covering
this period would be paid off during 1990 except for a small disputed amount
of DH 66 million.

4.08          Under the Power Distribution Project, the Regies are required to
pay their electricity bills no later than 60 days after the date of the
bill which is equivalent to 3 months of electricity purchases. As indicated
in the table above, several Regies are having serious difficulties in
complying with this covenant, largely due to the fact that they were owed
around DH 700 million by Government and local authorities for billings prior
to the end of 1988. RAD, in particular, can only pay off its old arrears by
falling farther behind in paying its recent billings.
4.09          Also under the Power Distribution Project, Government departments
and local authorities are required to pay their bills promptly in accordance



- 31 -
with guidelines defined by a circular isaued by the Government in May 1984.
Pursuant to this circular, ONE is to receive, from each Government department
and local authority, by the end of February of each year, an advance payment
equal to 50X of the amount contained in the budget for electricity consumption
by the department or local authority for the year ending the following August
31. This payment should approximate the cost of the power consumed during the
previous 6 months ending February 28. A second payment is supposed to be made
in November of each year to cover actual consumption for the 12 month period
ending on the previous August 31, less the amount of the February advance.
However, this system has not functioned properly because not all of the
Government departments and local authorities have budget allocations
sufficient to make the necessary payments, even though under that project, the
Government is required to provide budgets to each of its administrative
subdivisions which are adequate to permit them to fulfil their obligations
defined by the circular.
4.10        To address the problem of discrepancies between amounts budgeted
and actual consumption, the Government carried out, in August 1989, an
analysis of actual electricity consumption versus budget allocation for each
Government department and local authority. As a result of this analysis, in
1990, the pro-rata share of each department or local authority of the total
amount budgeted for electricity will more closely reflect its pro-rata share
of actual consumption. Also to address the issue of the new arrears
accumulated in 1988 and 1989 the Government issued on December 20, 1989 a
decree requiring all its departments to examine the situation and present by
September 1, 1990 an accounting of such arrears.
4.11       Prior to 1987, as a result of the delays in settlement of billings
to its public sector customers, ONE had to limit its payments to its fuel oil
suppliers. The pre-1987 arrears are being paid off as ONE collects its
arrears from its public sector customers. However, ONE's current accounts
payable for fuel oil, at the end of September 1989, represented two months of
consumption, which means that ONE is still not able to pay its bills within 30
days of billing as required under the Power Distribution Project. ONE could
readily comply with this requirement if all the Regies could pay ONE within a
60-day period.
4.12       As it is important to the sector that Government departments and
local authorities pay their current electricity bills in a timely manner and
at the same time pay off their arrears, agreements were reached during
negotiations similar to those under Loan 2910-MOR. Thus, the Government
agreed to ensure that: (a) all accounts due to ONE and the Regies by the
administrative subdivisions of the Government for electricity consumed and
related works carried out through December 31, 1990 shall be paid in three
equal annual installments during 1991, 1992 and 1993 (para. 6.02); (b) any
amounts due to ONE and the Regies by its administrative subdivisions on
account of electricity and related works shall be paid promptly in accordance
with guidelines satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.02); and (c) starting with
fiscal year 1991 budgetary allocations shall be made for each fiscal year in
the relevant budget of its public agencies in amounts sufficient to ensure
these agencies meet their obligations in (a) and (b) above (para. 6.02).

B.         ONE's  Projected Financial Performance
4.13       ONE's future financial structure and performance will largely
depend on five revenue and cost flows. These are: (i) the revenue from
electricity sales; (ii) the cost of generating electricity; (iii) the cost of
future investments; (iv) the revenue from debt and equity financing; and (v)
the cost of debt service. Relevant information concerning the first three
items has already been provided in Chapters 1 and 2 of this report which
discussed future electricity demand (para 2.17), the price of fuels used for
power generation (para 1.08), and ONE's investment program (para 2.18). The
other key flows, debt and equity financing and debt service, will depend on
ONE's past and future financing strategies and the future constraints
governing the avai'ability of funds from various sources. The final important
variable, the average selling price of electricity, can be thought of as a
dependant variable whose value can be determined by taking into account the
demand forecast and the other financial variables and constraints as well as
the financial targets established for ONE as measured by certain financial
ratios.
4.14       Projected Results 1990-98.  Projected financial results for the
period 1990-98 are summarized in Annex 4.2 along with audited results for
1988 and preliminary results for 1989.   Proforma statements of net income,
cash flow and balance sheet position for the period 1990-1998 are shown in
Annexes 4.3-4.5. Highlights of ONE's projected financial performance, through
1998, are presented below in Table 4.3.
4.15       The forecasts are based on the following underlying assumptions:
(i) the electricity demand forecast presented in para 2.17; (ii) average
rainfall and hence normal hydro power generation; (iii) continuation of the
existing energy pricing system described in para 1.08 (i.e. constant nominal
domestic fuel oil prices at the December 1988 level through 1996 with small
increases thereafter); (iv) imported and domestic coal prices changing in line
with the Bank's forecast for the international prices of coal; (iv) a
financing strategy described in para 4.17; (v) maintenance of the financial
targets established for ONE under the power distribution project with respect
to internal cash generation and debt service coverage ratios (para 4.04); (vi)
the tariff increases discussed para 4.27 which sre necessary given ONE's
financing strategy and financial targets; and (vii) other miscellaneous
assumptions presented in Annex 4.9.
4.16       Because the price of fuel oil is already fixed at a high level, the
average cost of fuel per kWh is expected to decrease in real terms through
1996, thus contributing to an improvement in ONE's operating cost structure.
However, the dominant factor in ONE's future financial situation is the fact
that investment expenditures, net of consumer contributions, are expected to
average DH 4.4 billion per year over the period 1990 through 1998, compared
with DH 0.8 billion per year over the period 1983 through 1989. However,
given ONE's continued access to external financing, which seems reasonably
assured with the recent financing package obtained for Jorf Lasfar, and given
future tariff increases which are adequate to permit ONE to attain its
financial performance targets, ONE should be able to finance its investment
program as discussed below.

4.17       Financing Strategy,   In the vast, in order to finance its
investment program, ONE has relied on five sources of financing: (a) the
surplus cash generated by its operations, including the Special Fund (para
4.19); (b) external borrowing in the form of suppliers' and bilateral credits;
(c) external loans from multinational financial institutions such as the
World Bank and the African Development Bank (ADB); (d) local borrowing; and
(e) Government contributions. The financing plan, summarized below in Table
4.4, assumes that ONE's traditional sources of financing would be adequate,
withouit Government contributions, beyond those required for PNER and similar
projects, to finance ONE's general investment program.
4.18       Traditional Sources of Financing.  The amounts available from the
various lenders are assumed by ONE to be governed by the following
constraints:
(i)     suppliers' and bilateral credits, are assumed to be available in
amounts sufficient to cover up to 120X of the direct foreign
exchange cost of future power generation and transmission
investments and ONE has routinely used foreign loans to finance
interest during construction related to these loans as well as a
portion of the local costs.
(ii)     loans from multinational financial institutions generally cover the
entire foreign exchange cost, both direct and indirect, for power
transmission and distribution investments. In the past, ADB loans
have covered both foreign and part of local components of
expenditures

(iii)     local long-term financing has been available from the Caisse de
Depot et de Gestion (CDG) which has purchased ONE's 15 year notes.
However, the supply of such notes is limited, and for planning
purposes, ONE assumes that a maximum of DH 300 million per year is
available from this source.
4.19       In order to finance the rehabilitation and expansion of networks in
rural areas electrified before the NREP was established, ONE is permitted each
year to make a tax deductible contribution from its operating income to a
"Special Fund" an amount up to 4.5X of its gross revenues. During the first
half of the 1980's, ONE had no surplus from which to make such a contribution.
However, the special fund is now projected to grow rapidly, accumulating DH
4.2 billion over the period 1989-98. This would be far in excess of the
requirements for expenditures in the villages electrified before NREP. Thus
ONE is currently planning to use the Fund to finance major distribution and
transmission expenditures, and the extension and rehabilitation of existing
electrified rural areas including those electrified during NREP I (Annex
2.13). For the purpose of the financial projections, it has been assumed that
the Fund would be available to help finance any of ONE's other investments.
4.20       Through 1986, Government contributions financed 25X of ONE's
General investment program. i.e., investments excluding those financed by
customers' contributions or special projects carried out on behalf of and
funded by the Government. Under PERL, Government undertook to eliminate its
contributions to ONE's general investment program for the years 1987 and 1988,
and there was no contribution in 1989. However, Government contributions for
rural electrification and projects in certain regions have continued.
4.21       Other Sources of Financing.  If, due to unforseen circumstances,
ONE is unable to obtain from its traditional sources of debt financing the
amounts assumed in the above plan, its options, outside of increasing cash
generation through tariff increases or other measures, are extremely limited.
Beyond the traditional sources of debt financing as described above, the only
other potential source, in the absence of direct foreign investment, is the
local capital market, where, since there is no bond market, the only source of
long and medium term credits is the banking system. However, under the normal
credit ceilings set by the Government, the banking system provided no medium
and long term credits during 1989. All lending, under the ceiling, was short
term, usually lines of credit which normally revolve every 30 days. The only
long and medium term credits provided by the banks were those requiring prior
approval from the National Bank for Economic Development (BNDE) and targeted
for eligible investments by industry. Almost none of this lending is funded
from deposits and is mainly back to back lending from special resources
including Financial Intermediation Loans from the Bank. Furthermore, these
credits do not reduce the liquidity of the lending banks as they are eligible
for refinancing by the Central Bank. At the end of 1989, the total amount of
such credit was DH 8.9 billion, an increase of DH 2.6 billion from the end of
1988.
4.22       The only other potential source of capital, outside the ceiling on
bank credit, is the commercial paper market, where the "billets de tresorie",
with maturities ranging from 3 to 9 months, are issued by enterprises,



- 36 -
guaranteed by the banks and purchased by institutions such as insurance
companies. As this paper is often rolled over by the issuing enterprises, it,
in fact, constitutes a source of medium term credit. Currently the amount of
such paper outstanding is limited by Government to DH 6.0 billion.
4.23       Thus, the local supply of long and medium term credit is limited
and excessive recourse to this market by ONE could quickly crowd out other
borrowers. On the other hand, commercial paper issued by ONE would be very
attractive to certain financial institutions who could probably earn a higher
rate of interest buying such paper directly from ONE. It is our opinion that
ONE could probably issue a total of around DH 600 million in commercial paper
without adversely affecting the ability of other enterprises to satisfy their
financing needs.
4.24       Given the magnitude of the increase in ONE's future need for
financing and the problems that would be associated with any financing gap,
during negotiations, the Government and ONE agreed that before October 31 of
each fiscal year, ONE will review with the Bank the adequacy of ONE's proposed
pluri-annual investment program and on the basis of such review, ONE shall
take, if necessary, the measures required to ensure that the available
financing is sufficient to cover the cost of such investments (para 6.03).
4.25       Other Operating Costs  Based on past performance, it is assumed
that other operating costs, the most important of which are payroll costs,
will increase, in real terms, at the same rate as power sales. As these costs
should not be purely variable, there may be some scope for achievitig a lower
rate of increase. It is noted that exchange losses, related to ONE's foreign
debt, are expected to recur over the forecast period, as the DH slowly
depreciates against the US$ in order to correct for a local rate of inflation
which is expected by the Bank to be slightly higher than the Bank's forecast
for the international rate of inflation.
4.26       ONE's Financial Performance Targets   Given the importance that ONE
maintain adequate internal cash generation and debt service coverage ratios,
during negotiations, the Government and ONE agreed to maintain the ratios
required under the Power Distribution Project, so that:
(i)     ONE will take measures to produce funds from internal sources
related to its operations equivalent to not less than 25% for 1990
and 30% for each of its fiscal years thereafter, of the annual
average of ONE's capital expenditures related to electric power
operation incurred, or expected to be incurred for that year, the
previous fiscal year and the next following year (para. 6.03);
(ii)    before October 31 in each of its fiscal years, ONE will review the
adequacy of its revenues to achieve the agreed net internal cash
generation ratio for such year and the following year, and on the
basis of such review ONE shall take, if necessary, the measures
required to achieve the agreed ratio (para. 6.03); and
(iii)   ONE shall not incur any long-term debt without Bank approval unless
a reasonable forecast of its projected net revenues for each year



- 37 -
during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5
times the projected debt service requirement in such year on all
debt of ONE (para. 6.04);
4.27       Future Tariff Increases.   As shown at the bottom of Table 4.3, it
is projected that ONE will require a significant tariff increase in 1991 if it
is to meet the assumed targets for financial performance without any
Government contributions, other than those for rural electrification. Under
its  .ontract-program with the Government, ONE proposed increases of 5% in
1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. However, as the Government did not approve the
proposed increase for 1989, and for 1990 approved only an increase of 4.5%,
effective June 1, a tariff increase of 13% would be required on January 1,
1991 followed by an increase of only 3% on January 1, 1992, in order for ONE
to achieve the required cash generation and debt service ratios. Furthermore,
and given the uncertainties surrounding ONE's financial projections for 1990,
submission by ONE of satisfactory financial projections indicating that ONE
will comply with the cash-generation covenant in 1990, was executed as
condition of Board Presentation (para. 6.01).
C.    Impact of the ProRosed Proiect on ONE's Financial Performance
4.28       In order to determine the impact of the proposed project on ONE's
future financial performance, proforma financial statements, including profit
and loss, cash flow and balance sheet, have been prepared for the project
itself for the period 1991 to 2010 and are presented as Annexes 4.6, 4.7 and
4.8, respectively. The projections attempt to capture all financial flows
associated directly with the project which impact on ONE's accounts, with the
exception of any investment costs associated with providing additional
electricity generation or transmission capacity to support the load generated
by the project. As the project on the average, through 1998, consumes less
than 1% of ONE's total power generated, ONE's investment program through 1998
is unlikely to change, with or without the project. Beyond 1998, rather than
accounting specifically for generation and transmission investment costs
assignable to the project, whose timing and amounts are difficult to predict,
an attempt is made, instead, to determine whether or not the project generates
enough surplus cash to cover its share of any future investments in power
generation or transmission.
4.29       The proforma profit and loss statement in Annex 4.6 shows that
though the project would reduce ONE's recorded profits in each year until
2008, most of this loss is due to the depreciation of the project assets, all
of which are on ONE's books, even though these assets are to be paid for by
the Government and the local authorities as detailed in Chapter 3.
4.30     , From the proforma cash flow statement in Annex 4.7, it is noted
that when non-cash expenses, including depreciation, are added to the
projected operating losses, the project would contribute to ONE's net cash
flow in all years but 1992. From the proforma balance sheet in Annex 4.8, it
is projected that by 2010 the project would accumulate a cash surplus of DH
1,339 million, before accounting for any project related investments for power
generation and transmission. This amount would be roughly equivalent to US$
89 million in January 1990 US$. Thus, it may be concluded that the revenues



- 38 -
from the project more than cover the direct recurrent operating costs, and
there ts no intention to repeat, under the proposed project, the arrangements
between ONE and the local authorities regarding the operation of NREP 1
facilities whereby these authorities were to compensate ONE for any losses it
might incur. Furthermore, the contract program already provides for ONE to be
compensated by the Government if ONE incurs losses as a result of carrying out
projects which are decreed by the Government. Finally, the financial surplus
generated by the project would make a substantial contribution to the
additional investment in new generating capacity required as a result of the
project.
D.    Accounting. External Audits. Insurance and Stock Control
4.31       Accountin2.   ONE's financial staff is good.  The Finance Depart-
ment has highly competent and dedicated management who have considerably
improved the quality of ONE's accounts and financial analysis techniques,
including introduction of the use of micro-computers for financial
projections. Major accounts are computerized and monthly and quarterly state-
ments are prepared. ONE's recent introduction of microcomputers in several
departments has considerably speeded up the preparation and analysis of
accounts. Computerized financial forecasting models are now used on a routine
basis for the purposes of financial planning.
4.32       Under PERL, the current system of a rXiori control of commitments
and expenditures by the Financial Comptroller and Government Accountant (both
representatives of the Ministry of Finance) has been made more flexible with
che introduction of a Contract Program to govern ONE's financial operations.
4.33       External Auditing.   Under Loan 2910-MOR, ONE agreed to have its
financial statements audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
and send a copy of its financial statements and the audit reports to the Bank
no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year, December 31. These
arrangements have worked well and during negotiations ONE has agreed to
maintain them for the proposed project (para. 6.04).
4.34       Insurance.   ONE carries insurance for workman's compensation and
third party liability. However, since it terminated its coverage with
commercial insurers in the early 1970's, ONE, with the consent of the Govern-
ment, assumes the risks of fire, explosions and natural calamities. Under the
Power Distribution Project, ONE was required to undertake an analysis of the
appropriate measures to take concerning insurance of its assets, including
among others the option of setting up a reserve. The analysis, carried out by
ONE and accepted by the Bank, recommended that ONE continue to assume the
above mentioned risks.
4.35       Though this policy may have been acceptable in the past, it is now
not clear whether a major loss could readily be covered by external loans or
Government contributions since Morocco's ability to obtain new external debt
is now severely constrained as are Government's budgetary resources. Thus, ONE
and the Government agreed during negotiations that a new study be carried out
to help ONE to decide on a satisfactory arrangement which would consist either
on a continuation of the existing policy or obtaining local insurance backed



39 -
by external reinsurance, or building up and maintaining a reserve for losses
(para 6.04).
4.36        Stock Control.  In 1987 and 1988, ONEs stocks of materials, other
than fuel, represented about 9 months of annual consumption. 'hile this does
not seem excessive for Morocco, given the lead time required for the delivery
of imported materials, it nonetheless represents an annual carrying cost of
around DH24 million. In order to reduce this cost, the proposed loan will
cover the cost of designing a comprehensive stock control system as well as
the cost of computer hardware and software required to implement the system.

V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
5.01        Sales Forecast.  Projections of demand in kilowatt hours were made
separately for low voltage sales and medium voltage sales from 1992 to 2010,
on the basis of experience with the first rural electrification project and of
a survey carried out in late 1989 of a sample of 20 villages electrified
before implementation of the NREP. For purposes of the low-voltage demand
projection, cumulated connection rates for electrifiable households are
assumed to be 35% in the first year after the arrival of electricity in each
village included in the project, 50% in the second year and 70% in the third
year. This assumption takes into account the arrangements proposed in para.
3.07 for connecting households at the same time as the distribution networks
are constructed, but it allows for possible delays in internal wiring of
customer facilities. Consumption per household is assumed to be 250 kWh in
the first year, 325 kWh in the second and 500 kWh in the third year.
Electricity consumption at the low-voltage level for non-household use is
assumed to be 96% of household consumption In the first year, 82% in the
second and 61% in the third and subsequent ;ears.  Public lighting is assumed
to remain constant from the first year on, while industrial and commercial
consumption are assumed to remain equal t each other and grow at the same
rate.  After the third year of electricih; supply, total low-voltage
consumption for each village is assumed to grow at 15.7% per year until the
tenth year on the basis of the village survey. From the tenth year until 2010
consumption is projected to grow by 10% per year. These growth rates are made
up of an assumed 8% per year increase in connections with the rest of the
increase attributable to increased consumption per customer. Medium-voltage
sales were projected on the assumptions of 1.6 medium-voltage users per
village, gradually connected over a 10 year period, who consume an average of
191 MWh per year per customer. The number of customers per village and the
timing of their connections were determined from the 20 village survey
(excluding the data for one atypical village with 24 very large agricultural
customers). The annual consumption per customer is equal to the 1988 average
for ONE's rural medium-voltage customers in 1988. The medium-voltage sales
estimates are considered to be conservative since they are less than half the
projected low voltage sales, whereas ONE's total medium-voltage sales in rural
areas are nearly 2 1/2 times its low-voltage rural sales. Total low and
medium-voltage sales in the villages to be electrified under the project are
projected to grow from 5 GWh in 1992 to 169 GWh in 1998 and 614 GWh in 2010
(Annex 5.02, Attachment 1).
5.02        Least-Cost Analysis.  Assessment of the least-cost alternative for
rural electrification involves the comparison of the cost of connecting each
village to the national grid (centrally supplied) with the cost of installing
a local generator (isolated system). Analyses were carried out to determine
the distance from the existing grid at which the cost of the two alternatives
would be the same (Annex 5.01). This distance depends on the cost per
kilometer of the connecting facilities and on the electricity demand in the
village. Each village in the proposed project was examined using this
analysis. It was found that connections to the national grid would be the
least-cost alternative for all but eight of the 462 villages. Electrification
by diesel unit is the least-cost option for the eight villages. If ONE
confirms this finding by a more detailed analysis, the eight villages will be



- 41 -
electrified by means of diesel units. The project thus constitutes a least-
coat investment for electrifying the 462 villages.
5.03        Rate of Return Analvsis.  The return on the project is the
discount rate which equates the present value of the streams of measurable
costs and benefits associated with the project. The cost streams are: (a)
the capital cost of the project which includes physical contingencies but is
net of taxes, customs duties and price contingencies; and (b) the long-run
marginal cost of power delivered to the rural distribution network plus losses
in the distribution network; and (c) distribution operating costs. The
benefit streams are: (a) revenue from electricity sales at existing tariff
rates assumed to remain constant in real terms; (b) estimated consumers'
surplus for households who would use electricity as a replacement for butane,
kerosene', candles and batteries (for television sets) and for small industries
at low-voltage and all medium-voltage customers who would use electricity
produced by small diesel generating units. All costs and benefits are
expressed in May 1990 prices. Detailed assumptions are given in Annex 5.02.
5.04        Based on the benefits listed above, the estimated real return is
17.81. The economic profitability of the project is very robust with respect
to changes in the major variables concerned. Sensitivity tests yielded the
following results in terms of changes which would cause the economic rate to
decline from 17.81 to the opportunity cost of capital, estimated to be 10:
Project costs         + 751
Low-voltage sales     - 731
Medium-voltage sales - 951.

VI. AGREE&MTS REACHEI AND RECOMNENDATION
6.01        During negotiations agreement was reached that conditions for
Board Presentation will be that: (i) the Special Agreement between MF, MI, HME
and ONE (para. 3.08) will be executed; and (ii) satisfactory financial
projections shoving that ONE will be able to comply with the cash-generation
covenant in 1990 will be submitted to the Bank (para 4.27). These conditions
were subsequently met.
6.02        During negotiations, the Government agreed:
(a)   to decide , not later than December 31, 1990 on the basic elements
of the national tariff structure, and to continue to implement
gradually, and at the occasion of each tariff adjustment, the
recommendations of the tariff study as shall have been agreed
between the Borrower and the Bank, with the objective of
implementing a global national tariff policy starting June 30,
1992. (para. 2.07);
(b)   to provide or cause to be provided, all funds necessary to cover
the entire financing of the proposed project and any cost overruns
which might arise in respect of foreign or local expenditures
(para. 3.06);
(c)   to open and maintain two special accounts A and B of US$ 0.90
million and US$ 5.0 million respectively, to cover all categories
of expenditures for the consumer connections for the special
account A, and for the remaining of the proposed project for the
special account B, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, and to have these accounts and SOEs audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.28);
(d)   to ensure that all accounts due to ONE and the R6gies by the
administrative subdivisions of the Government for electricity
consumed and related works carried out through December 31, 1990
shall be paid in three equal installments during 1991, 1992 and
1993 (para. 4.12);
(e)   to ensure that amounts due to ONE and all Regies by its
administrative subdivisions shall be paid promptly in accordance
with guidelines satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.12); and
(f)  that the budgetary allocations shall be made for each fiscal year
in the relevant budget or budgets of its public agencies in
amounts sufficient to ensure that these agencies meet their
obligations (para. 4.12).
6.03        During negotiations, the Government and ONE agreed:
(a)   for ONE to review with the Bank, by October 31 of each of ONE's
fiscal years, the adequacy of ONE's proposed pluri-annual
investment program, and on the basis of such review ONE shall



- 43 -
take, if necessary, the measures required to ensure that the
available financing is sufficient to cover the cost of such
investments (para 4.23);
(b)   for ONE to produce funds from internal sources related to its
operations equivalent to not less than 25Z for its fiscal year
1990, and 301 for each of its fiscal years thereafter, of the
annual average of ONE's capital expenditures related to electric
power operatior. incurred, or expected to be incurred for that
year, the previous fiscal year and the following year (para.
4.26); and
(c)   that before October 31 in each of its fiscal year ONE shall review
with the Bank the adequacy of its revenues to achieve the agreed
net internal cash generation ratio for such year and the following
year, and on the basis of such review ONE shall take, if
necessary, the measures required to achieve the agreed ratio
(para. 4.26);
6.04        During negotiations, ONE agreed to:
(a)   waive the requirement that each new low-voltage consumer pays a
connection fee in advance, and to recover these costs through
installments to be paid by the consumers with each monthly
electricity bill and equal to at least 1.51 of the connection cost
(para. 3.07);
(b)   complete the detailed engineering design for the first 200
villages by March 31, 1991 and for the remaining villages by
December 31, 1992 (para. 3.12);
(c)   not incur any long-term debt without Bank approval unless a
reasonable forecast of its projected net revenues for each year
during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5
times of the projected debt service requirement in such year on
all debt of ONE (para. 4.26);
(d)   have its accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank and its financial statements and audit reports furnished
to the Bank within seven months after the end of each fiscal year
(para. 4.32); and
(e)   carry out a study in order to decide on a satisfactory arrangement
which would consist either on a continuation of the existent
policy or obtaining local insurance backed by external
reinsurance, or building up and maintaining a reserve for losses
(para 4.34).
6.05        With the above agreements, the prcposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$ 114.0 million, for a term of 20 years at the standard
variable interest rate, including a five-year grace period to the Kingdom of
Morocco. Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and
ONE would be a condition of effectiveness (para 3.10).

Economic Cost. 1995 Base: EDF International, CID, Royaume du Maroc, Etude de
Tarification de l'Energie Electrique, Mission IV, Passage des Coats aux Tarifs
Structure, Rapport Final, June 1989, pp. 48-49, and p. 25.
Economic Cost. 1988 Base: The consultants projected a fuel oil price in 1995
of DH 1195/ton and a coal price of DH 460/ton, both in constant 1988 prices:
EDF International, CID, ibid. Mission II A. Calcul des coiits Marginaux,
Rapport Final, June 1989, p. 12. Actual cif prices plus distribution costs at
the end of 1988 were DH 800,/ton for fuel oil and DH 432/ton for coal.  The
consultants' marginal cost estimates were adjusted downwards on the basis of
formulas provided in Mission II, p. 25, and estimates of losses at each stage
of transmission and distribution, p. 14.
Average Revenue (1988), EDF International, CID, ibid, Mission V, Aplication
des Cotts Mareinaux, 'ncidence Financiere, Rapport Provisoire, March 1989,
p.14. Estimates of average revenue of individual low voltage tariff
categories were supplied by ONE and concern ONE sales only. The average
revenue estimates include the 7X value added tax.

SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATIOH PRQlECT
Guldelines for Monitoring the Proiect
The following data should be collected for each village electrified
under NREP II and for all low-voltage customers connected to the power
facilities constructed under WREP II:
(i)    for each year, from the first year of service, the number of
customers classified according to their end uses of
electricity, e.g., at low-voltage level, residential, public
lighting, administrative lighting, etc. and at the medium-
voltage level, agricultural and other;
(ii)   total annual consumption in kWh of each consumer class;
(iii) the average annual load factor of each village;
(iv)   annual revenue from electricity sales, and separately
revenue from meter rentals and connection charges for each
class of consumer;
(v)    data on transformers, feeder lengths, capacities, etc. for
each village electrified;
(vi)   costs of these facilities for each village;
(vii) average connection costs for the various consumer classes;
(viii) estimates of internal wiring costs for each consumer class
based on a sample survey;
(ix)   annual operating and maintenance costs for the consumers
served in the project area;
(x)    number of households, and details on infrastructural
services and industrial and agricultural activities; e.g.
existing and proposed roads, water supply systems, canals,
rivers, wells, schools, health centers, grain mills, etc.
This information should be collected at the time of
electrification and in the final year of the project;
(xi)   the amount of gas oil used by each agricultural, industrial
or other motive power customer in the year before the
customer's connection to the electricity network. The
nature of the business activity of the customer should be
identified. This information should be obtained at the time
the customer is connected; and

(xii) the amount of butane and kerosene, and the number of candles
used by a random sample of 1,000 households (at least two
from each vlllage electrified) during the year preceding
electrification. The number of television sets should also
be determined from this sample.

2.    Income statement
Sales of energy are based on ONE's forecast which is presented in
Table 1.2. Tariffs and Sales revenues are net of the 7X Value Added Tax.
Other operating revenues include ONE's mark-up on works performed
by customers for themselves, sales of scrap, meters, and investment income.
Fuel-oil grices include all taxes and assume that in real terms
the price will remain constant at the December 1988 price. Local coal prices
(Casablanca and Jerada, separately) include all taxes and are based on
Decenber 1988 prices indexed by the cost of imported coal.  Imp2rgd coal,
prices are based on the price per ton FOB in constant US$ as forecast by the
Bank and converted to current DH. ONE receives VAT tax rebates on all
purchases of fuel used for power generation.
Fuel Consmntion and Costs are based on hydro power potential and
a merit order dispatching of each thermal power plant during each of eight
periods of the year, including the needle, peak,intermediate, and base periods
for the Jan-Sept season and the Oct-Dec season. Hydro power potential is
projected as per the table below:

5.    Financial Impact of Project on ONE
In determining the cost of fuel used to generate power to supply the demand
created by the project, it is assumed that all power supplied during peak
periods will be generated by gas turbines and that off-peak power, at the
margin, would come from one of the less-efficient fuel-fired generating
stations such as that in Casablanca. Load curves were used to determine the
split between peak and off-peak consumption for low and medium-voltage
consumers. Operating and maintenance costs for the distribution network were
taken from the economic analysis but converted to current DH through 1998 and
constant 1998 DH. thereafter.

SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Least-Cost Analysis
A least-cost analysis was carried out in order to show whether
electrification by means of the national grid is less costly than
electrification by isolated diesel units for each village included in the
project.
Cogt of Electricity from a Diesel Unit
The economic cost of electricity produced from isolated diesel units was
calculated as follows:
In order to deliver a kWh under the same quality of service, we assume
two diesel units each with 100 kW installed capacity, 90 kW net, and power
factor of 0.85. The second unit serves as reserve for the first.
Investment cost: (June 1990 prices)
Equipment (excluding taxes)                             DR 500,000
Civil works                                                175,000
Accessories and installation                               190.000
DH 865,000
Assuming a 10 year lifetime, and a discount rate of 10%, the equivalent
annual cost is DH 140,700.
Personnel:
1 specialized worker                                   DH  4,200/month
1 ordinary worker                                           3,600
General expenses (401)                                      3.120
Total                                   10,920/month
Including a thirteenth month of pay for vacation, the total is:
10,92a x 1 - DH 141,960 per year.
Stock of Gas Oil:
Deliveries would be made in loads of 15,000 liters. Therefore the
average stock on hand would be 7,500 liters. With the economic cost (import
price plus distribution margin excluding taxes) of gas oil equal to DH
1.53/liter, the cost of the stock is 7,500 x 1.53 - DH 11,500. Assuming a 10X
discount rate and a ten year life for the project, the annual cost is DH
1,870.
Total fixed annual cost - DH 140,700 + DH 141,960 + DH 1,870 - DH 284,530.

Variable Cost:
Fuel cost: 0.51 liter/kWh x DH 1.53/liter - DH 0.78/kWh
Oil and spare parts (101)        DH LQfQ/kWh
Total variable cost       DH 0.86/kWh
The cost of one kWh produced by a diesel unit is
C1 - 0.86 + 284.530
q
where q is the annual consumption of the village in kilowatt hours.
Cost of Grid-suplied Electricity
Investment cost: the cost of 1 kilometer of 22 kV distribution line to
connect the village to the existing network in Almelec of 34 mm2 se3ction on
flat land is DH 98,978 x 0.10608 - DH 10,500/km/year assuming a 101 discount
rate and a 30 years life.
The cost of a transformer is DH 45,300 x 0.106 - DH 4,805/year.
The total annual investment cost for the village to be considered is DH
10,500L + 4,805 where L is the length of connecting line in kilometers.
other costs: The LRMC of electricity supplied to the entrance of the village
is DH 0.465/kWh (Annex 5.02 and excluding low voltage losses of 91).
The total cost of one kWh supplied to the village through the national
grid is:
C2 - 0.465 + 1Q.l500L + 4805
q
Break-even Distance from the Existing Networks
When C, - C2, a value for L can be determined which measures the break-
even distance of the voltage from the existing network. For distances less
than L, elecLriijcation by the grid would be the least-cost solution. For
distances greater than L, electrification by diesel units would be the least-
cost solution.
The break-even distance is given by:
L - 26.6 + 0.395g kilometers.
