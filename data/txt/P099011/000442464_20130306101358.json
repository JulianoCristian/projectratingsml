{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth,\n            Tenth, and Eleventh Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC)\n            Project for Burkina Faso were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: budget support\n            can be an effective instrument for governments to finance\n            their development programs and to weather economic shocks. A\n            second lesson is linked to understanding the political\n            economy. Cotton reform was successful because of a positive\n            consensus between the cotton ginning companies, the farmers\n            associations, and the government ministries. A third lesson\n            from the PRSC is the need to be selective and strategic in\n            scope - narrowing the choice and number of policy reforms to\n            support - but ambitious in depth of reforms and their\n            significance for economic growth, employment, and poverty\n            reduction. However, a lesson from policy in Burkina Faso in\n            recent years has been that in the absence of broad-based\n            economic growth and job creation, macro stability and social\n            programs will not on their own have sufficient impact on\n            poverty indicators. A fourth lesson is that more focus needs\n            to be put into statistical capacity-building in order to\n            strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems. A fifth lesson\n            from past lending is the importance of trying to provide\n            finance linked to the government's own budget cycle. A\n            sixth lesson relates to the importance of donor\n            coordination. The experience of Burkina suggests that a\n            well-institutionalized system of donor coordination can\n            facilitate the aid management for the country and ensure\n            better development outcomes."}, "docdt": "2012-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
