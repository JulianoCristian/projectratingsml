   sustainability and a modest institutional development\n            impact.  Both the Bank and the Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily.  The project generally accomplished more\n            than what had been planned in terms of physical quantities\n            with the exception of the water supply component.. Lessons\n            learned included the following: (a) The risk analysis and\n            allocation of private operator contracts in the water supply\n            and sanitation sector must be improved. (b) Projects must be\n            affordable - this project was too big, leading to financial\n            difficulties, and it would have been better implemented in\n            stages. (c) Projects should have limited objectives -  the\n            five objectives made implementation difficult.  (d)\n            Selection criteria in private sector participation must be\n            carefully analyzed. (e) Local utilities may be unable to\n            bear the exchange rate risk where there is a high risk of\n            devaluation and where the revenue is in local currency but\n            debt service is in foreign exchange."}, "docdt": "2004-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
