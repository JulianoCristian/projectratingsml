the Antalya Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project are to: a) meet at least cost\n            the demand for water supply, sewerage and stormwater\n            drainage; b) develop new institutional arrangements for\n            management of municipal water supply, sewerage and\n            stormwater drainage, and to introduce private sector\n            participation in the operation of the services; c) implement\n            appropriate cost recovery policies; d) postpone the need to\n            develop costly new water resources by improving the\n            efficiency of utilization of existing sources and of water\n            usage by reducing the volume of non-revenue water which is\n            presently too high; and e) improve and sustain environmental\n            conditions and reduce health hazards that threaten the local\n            population and the tourism industry. The project represents\n            the first phase, to be implemented from 1995 throug 2002, of\n            a program designed to continue to the year 2020. The project\n            will: a) renovate, rehabilitate and extend the existing\n            water supply network; b) provide a new sewerage network and\n            a preliminary wastewater treatment plant on the western part\n            of the municipality; c) improve operation of septic tanks in\n            the eastern part of the city; d) upgrade the stormwater\n            drainage system in flood areas and elaborate a comprehensive\n            master plan; and e) provide technical assistance for project\n            implementation and institutional development."}, "docdt": "1995-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
