MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION 0F THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR A CONSTRUCT1ON CAPACITY AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamie Republie of Mauitana for SDR 8.7 million, the equivalent of
US$12 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for
construction capacity and employment, which fits into the country assistance strategy discussed on
November 19, 1991.
COUITRY ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
2.           Faced with a deepening economic and ftinancial crisis, the Mauritanian Government
adopted, in 1985, a comprehensive Economic and Financial Recovery Program (PREF) for 1985-88
which was followed in 1989 by a Consolidation Progeam (PER) for 1989-91. An IDA structural
adjustment credkt (SAL 1) supported the second phase of the PREF (1987-88), emphasizing policy
reforms in seven key areas: public administration, banldng, public enterprise, energy, food policy,
fisheries and private sector promotion. Ibese adjustment efforts have been pursued and deepened
tbrough two Sectoral Adjustment operations for the agriculture and public entexprise sectors approved
by the Board in FY89. Mauritania's adjustment efforts and indebtedness made it eligible for the
Special Program of Assistance.
3.    After the initiation of the adjustment program, macroeconomic performance improved
considerably tbrough 1989. Real GDP growth rose to 3.4% per year during 1985-89. In parlel
with macroeconomic measures, several key structural reforms were put in place with the result that
the Mauritanian economy has become more market-oriented.
4.    However, in 1990-91, the Mauritanian economy suffered a series of externad shocks, the
economic and financial impact of which have been severe. Unfavorable weather conditions affected
output in the agricultural sector, anu the iron-ore and fishing sectors both suffered as a result of
external conditions. In addition, a sharp cut-back in external financing occurred as a consequence
of the Persian Gulf crisis. lbhe shocks were compounded by intea  factors, including inadequate
responsiveness of macroeconomic policies and institutional deficiencies in the agricultural and flishing
sectors.
5.    Recognizing the need to restore competitiveness and encourage diversification of Mauritania's
export base in order to move toward a viable medium-term extanal position, the Govermment
depreciated the exchange rate of the Ouguiya by 27% in terms of US dollars on October 4, 1992.
TIe adjustment of the exchange rate is being supported by restrictive fiscal and monetary policies
which are expected to strengthen the competitiveness of the export sector.
6.    The adjustment program undertaken by the Government has succeeded in liberalizing much
of the Mauritanian economy, and encouraging the private sector to expand its activities in all sectors.
However, the economy remains fragile and its medium-term prospects are difficult. The Govermment
is therefore determined to intensify its adjustment efforts so as to ensure that the economy attains its
fuil growth potential. The Government's main macroeconomic objectives for the period 1992-1995
are as follows: a) to achieve an average real GDP growth rate of 3.5% a year; b) to reduce the



amnuai inflation rate to 3.5% by 1995; and c) to reduce the external current account deficit (excluding
official transfers) from 14.4% of GDP in 1991 to 7.5%.
7.    'Ie Governmegt is comwitted to pursuing its adjustment program, lncluding the liberatization
of the .conomy. For the next few years, tihe focus will be on continued strengthening of public
resource management, furiuer enhancement of the enabling environment for private sector investment
and growth, and an acceleration in its program to develop the country's human resources. Future
economic reforms would include completion of the ongoing reforms of the banking system, a major
reform of the fisheries sector and a series of actions to strengthen the incentives framework, the
abolition of ail remaining monopolies, the elimination of all price controls and the restructuring of
the banking and fisheries sectors. la the area of public resource management, policies would be
designed to ensur maximum eMciency in the use of scarce public resources, including, inter alla,
(») iproved articulation of macroeconomic and sectoral development priorities enabling better project
secection on economic criterla and strengthened and streuamlined procedures for planning and
monitoring public expenditures; (ii) greater emphasis on human resource development; and (iii) the
provision of adequate basic infastructre required for economie development.
SECTORAL BACKGROUND
8.           Urban Labor Market and Employmen. Serious imbalances exist between labor
demand and supply in urban areas: i) th. public sector, which used to provide guarantd employment
for graduates, is being downsized in the context of adjustment programs; il) the formal private sector
continues to rely on capital intensive production techniques, even for tasks which could be carried
out manualiy at a lower cost; and lWi) many of the newoomers entering the urban labor market are
unsklled laborers lacklng the training and education that would make them attractive to employers.
'Me labor force was estlmated, in 1989, at 630,000 people (270,020 in urban areas, 360,000 In rwal
reas); of which 180,000, or 29%, were unemployed. 'Ie modem sector employed 60,000 persons.
'ie infrmal sector was estimated to provide employment .a about 180,000 persons; a recent estimate
increased this number to 250,00W. 'Ie current average monthly wage is ItM 7,000 (formal and
informai sectors).
9.          lIe Highwa Sector. Prom independence to the late 1980s, Government policy was
oriented towards allocating resources to tie constuction of new roads and neglectlng periodic and
routine road mântenance. Ibis policy resulted in a general deterioration of the road network, which
conista of 1750 km of paved roads, 700 km of modem gravel roads and 5,000 km of earth roads.
In addition to progressive wear and tear on the road network, mobile sand dunes have become a
growing threat to roads and important resources (about UM 200 million or US$2.5 million in 1991,
almost half of the current expenditures for roads) mumt be used merely to keep roads open to traffle.
By late 1989, a sectoral roform program started but quickly stopped due to lack of resources. In the
last two yeara, foreign aid has been very limited (only the EC and France have continued their
support), most of which has been used for removing sand from roads. Consequently, MET has
stopped its efforts at setting up a comprehensive road management policy.
10.          lhe Urban Sector. hie urban sector could be ciaracterized by four main issues: 1)
the extremely rapid urbanization trend which resulted in high unemployment; il) the growing scarcity
of public resources during tihe last decade which reaulted lu a steady decline in per capita urban
investment, mosdy in the Nouakchott area; iii) the poor performance of tihe main goverament bodies
responsible for urban development and housing, in part becauase especially advantageous flinanclag



conditions were no longer available; and iv) the poor implementation of the decentralization process,
which transferred the bulk of the responsibility for maintaining infrastructure and services to the local
communities, without increasing their resources and autiority. Acting against this backgrcund, the
current Government's strategy emphasizes the need for the promotion of a new urban management
system. As a result, GRIM is eager to withdraw, a Ieast partially, from direct support to urban
services, urban infrastructure development and provision of shelter. These functions should be taken
over, to the extent possible, by the local governments and the private sector. Within the overall
objective of laying the foundation for sustained growth through development of private initiatives,
the Government strategy for the urban sector aims to improve the support that efficient cities can give
to the creation of economic activities and to the generation of employment opportunities.
11.          Mhe Construction Induwy. The domesc constuction industry, which had developed
since independence, has been deeply hurt by both the sharp drop in funding of the investment
program and the 1990 conflict with Senegal. In addition, all but a few of the foreign construction
firms (French and Brazilian) which carried out most of the major works have left the country. The
hiring and employing of nationals is hampered by the fact that few training schemes are offered in
the construction sector. But, under the current harsh economic conditions, there is no reluctance on
the part of national workers to accept hard labor-intensive works, and businessmen are available to
contract these works. Whgle recently normalized relations between Senegal and Mauritania may result
in a progressive and partial returm of Senegalese specialists, the process is likely to be slow. Tie
need and potential for educating/training Mauritanians in construction trades remains considerable.
THE CONSTRUCII_ i CAPACITY AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECr
12.          Projea Objectaes. Tie Project has the following objectives: a) project objectives
which are: (i) to create, at least temporarily, new employment opportunities in urban areas; and (ii)
to undertake subprojects that are economically and socially useful; b) development objectives which
are: (i) to demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects; (il) to test the procedures that will
enable th. public sector to commission such projects, and in particular the délégadon de marse
d'ourage (delegated contract management); and (iii) to improve, through the execution of the works
flnanced by the project, the individual skills of the workers who wil be employed, and the corporate
competitiveness of the firms that will carry out works so as to develop their capacity to respond to
increased opportunities for sustained activity after project completion; and c) associated objectives
which include. (i) avoiding the need to increase the civil service; (Hi) combining the benefits of
implementation methodologies that feature low cost, high visibiity and impact; (iii) supporting other
development programs by efficiently executing (but not financing) their subprojects related to
infrastructure; (iv) using transparent but expeditious and flexible procedures for subproject proposals,
appraisals, procurement and disbursements; and (v) providing sustainable technical and managerial
assistance to contractors.
13.          Projea Description. The Project has three components: (a) a program of labor-
intensive subprojects consisting of: (i) a public works program of public facility and infrastructure
rehabilitation and maintenance, in urban areas as well as on the highway setwork, to be carried out
under labor-intensive schemes by local contractors; (ii) a public services program to be carried out
under labor-intensive schemes by local private frms; (b) a oackage of technical and managerial
assistance and training including: (i) a package of training services related to work organization,



-4-
management, and technical skills training, to be offered on a voluntary basis to loca contractors who
will be awarded contracts under component (a); and a training program for local engineering ffrms
and individual consultants on the preparation of feasibility studies and technical project proposads for
component (a); (1i) a training program for poteitial beneficiaries of subprojects of component (a), for
helping them pre-evaluate the feasibllity and soundness of such subprojects; (iii) a program aimed at
increasing grassroots participation ln urban infrastructure maintenance; and (iv) a package of services
aimed at project monitoring; and (c) a pakg of sector   udies and related technical assistance
including: (1) studies in the highway sector and assistance to the Ministry of Public Works and
Transporte (ME) which wlll help setup ;ppropriate programming and funding procedures for road
maintenance and enhance MET's management structure and procedures; (il) studies in the urban
sector and assistance to the Municipality of Nouakchott (MON), the Ministry ef Finance (MOF) and
the Ministy of Interior (MOI) aiming at enhancing city management through improved collection of
local taxes, adequate matching procedures with funds allocated by the central govement, and
throrgh more cost-effective use of available resources; and (iîi) preparation of an action plan for
developing the domestic construction industry.
14.          Project Implementation. The Project will be implemented through: (a) the recently
created non-governmental agency (AMEXTIPE) designed to function as a mattre d 'ouvrage ddlguE
(owner's agent); arA (b) extensive use of local consultants and contractors. It would include a
_triing program for civil servants, consultants and contractors. All AMEXTIPE's legal documents
(statutes, by-laws, articles of agreement, manual of procedures) have been approved by Government
and by IDA. Between now and the date of effectiveness, siX pilot subprojects will be carried out to
test procedures, consultants and contractors. The selection of AMEXTIPE's Generai Manager has
been made. AMEIPE's statutes are designed to provide broad operational autonomy, but a
quarterly tehnical and financial audit will monitor strict compliance with agreed procedures, as well
as thorough annual reviews and annual agreements on the portfolio of subprojects. The project
implementation period is estimated at four years, with an annual volume of works and services of
about US$5 million equivalent The Agency's operating costs will be held under 10% of total project
costs.
15.          Financing of Subprojects. In order to promote local ownership, a local contribution
will be made for each subproject-10% in the first year and 20% thereafter. These contributions will
be flnanced out of Government budgetary resources, municipal budgets and contributions from NGOs
or community groups. To ensure that AMEXTIPE does not get involved in projects for which
funding is not complete, no sub-project would be started until the beneficiary has deposited irs
contribution in AMEXTIPE's bank account. 'Me Government contribution is already included in the
1993 budget. 'Me first deposit by Government into the AMEXTIPE account is a condition of
effectiveness. As an additional safeguard, should the local counterpart funds fail to materialize, IDA
would have the right to delay the approval of the next year's batch of subprojects. Given the high
degrse of political visibiity of AGETIP-type projects, the above procedures should effectively
minimize the risk of slow project implementation due to the unavailability of counterpart funds.
16.          Project Sustainability. The Project is ilkely to have a sustainable effect because: (a)
it will help strengthen and promote small-sized and medium-sized construction firms, the labor force,
and the local consulting industry, thus enabling them to respond to future demand for their services;
(b) it will demonstrate the feasibility of efficient public works execution and encourage the
development of private contract management services, thus helping increase the efficiency of public
sector expenditure;. The project management profession promoted in the private sector will be
sustainable if the search for efficiency, not political pressures, becomes preponderant in sllocating



-5-
projeat management responsibilites; and (c) it will show tihe possibulity of using labor-intensive
technologies in the context of puhlic works execut;on, thus contributing to a red3ctlon in the level
of unemployment.
17.          Lessons Learnedfrom PrevWous IDA Invlvemen. Five projet similar to the one
proposed here are cuntly bein8 implementd in Senegal, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Benin.
lbo Public Works and Employment Project in Senegal (Cr. 2075-SE) has been under implementation
for over three years. and the experience derived from it has facilitated the preparation of more recent
projects. 'Ie sucs of the Senegal project is evidenced in, among other things, the fact that: (a)
contc unt prices quoted by contractors are 15% lower than anticipated as contractors take into
account the fact that they recelve payments ten days after submitting their invoicec; and (b) about
37% of total amounts paid to contractors are in turn paid out by them to workers in ternis of salaries
and wages. Tne lessons leed from the implementation of the Senegal project which are being
addressed in this projeat include: (a) in the procurement area, post-qualification was introduced to
talce into account the residual capacity of the contractors in contract. award as well as to provide
explanations for bids that are 15% lower than the reference price; (b) as experience has shown that
government has been slow in dlsbursing counterpart funding, a dated covenant has been inserted
relating the review of subproject batches to the disbursement of Government and Beneficiary
counterpart funding; (c) the training oomponent for contractors has been prepared eatly enough for
t to be available right from effectiveness so that contractors have immediate acces to training; (d)
a grasroots parcipation progran has been iLcorporated; (e) that proposed subprojects must not
have a negative environmental Impact has been lntroduced as a criterion of subproject eligibility and
selection.
18.          Raonae forBankInvolvem . This public works and employment project fits the
Country Strateg as it would help address the current high level of unemployment and would have
a developmental effect on the private sector Ln tihe medium term. It will maintain infrastructure assets
wiiich might disappear for lack of maintenatne, due to current sever', financl constrais. By
reopening the dialogue on infrastructre management policies, k will facilitate correcting the
inappropriate resource allocation policies of Goverment in both the road and urban sectors. MDA
is also expected to have a catalytic role in the mobilization of other donors' resources.

vii)  the auditors have been appointed for a period of three years.
(c)    Assurances Reflected in the Legal Documents:
'Me following assurances are reflected in the legal documents:



- 7-
i)    at all times during project imp ementation, the Statutes of Agreement of the
Agency and the Procedures Manual will be acceptable to the Bank;
il)   at all times during project implementation, the Generai Manager, the
Technical Manager, and the Administrative Manager of the Agency will be

execution;
lv)   the Agency will submit to the Bank the second, third, and fourth annual work
programs inciuding that f}nanced by IDA, the municipalities and 'o-
financiers, totalling at least US$3 million (UM 339 million) no later than
September 30, 1993, US$4 million (UM 451 million) no later than

roster of consultants and contractors; and
vi)    Government and Beneficiaries will have actualiy paid for their financial
contribution as stipulated in the Manual of procedures.
20.          Envlronmental Aspects. As this is a category B project, a review of its potential
impact on the environment was carried out during appraisal. The results of the study are available
hi the project file. The Project is expected to have a positive impact by repairing and cleaning
drainage systems, repairing bridges, collecting waste, and controlling sand dunes. Two studies are
currently under way under the Norwegian-funded Sahelian Operation Review program, to provide
guidance on environmental protection In road maintenance works. A third study financed by the
United Nations Sudo-Sahelian Office has developed a manual of good practices for sand encroachment
control which can be used also in other Sahelian countries. This project will provide for
implementation experience on the mneasures to be proposed by these three studies.
21.          Program  Objective Cauegories.  The Project's employment creation aspects,
emphasizing labor-intensive technologies, will contribute to immediate as well as longer term poverty
alleviation. This positive effect will be amplified by the involvement of "informal sector" firms using
unskilled workers and by cooperating with food security programs mainly oriented towards women.
22.          Project Benefits. TIe Project will have several direct benefits: (a) employment
creation; (b) high economic rates of return of rehabilitation operations; (c) a positive environmentat
impact; (d) the long-term benefit of enhancing the efficiency of the public sector, which would have
a spill-over effect on other IDA projects (such as edue tion) by improving the efficiency of Uie
construction sector; and (e) enhanced sustainability of future infrastructure and urban projects through
better use of municipal resourus.

23.          RIs. Tn.e risk of slow implementadon will be reduced by the sotting up of an
AGQEF-type agency and by promoting the delegation of contract management.  Ihe risk of
supporting unsuitable operatioris will be reduced by closely monitoring the implementation of the
Manual of Procedures with strict selection critria. TMe rlsk of the works being poorly executed will
be reducea by the development of the training program and through the quarterly technical and
financ!al audits.
24.         Recommendowos. I am satisfled that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

ISLAMI REPUBLIC 0E MAURITANIA
CONSTRUCTION CAA£ AD EPLOY - NT Q
STATUS 0F DISBURSEMENIS
1.           Background:  Mauritania cont}nues to face difficult economic and financial
rcmtncs. Economic performance continues to be poor. (IMe difficulties of the fisheries and
banking sectors, in particular, are a major concern). Until 1989 Maurita's adjustmentperformance
was stong. It met macroeconormic objectives and took all strucural measures agreed in the frst,
second and third PFPs. A first SAL was closed in December 1989. Two IDA-supported hybrid
operations are currendy underway. One covers the public enterprise sector and the other agriculture.
In 1990-91, tihe Mauritanian economy suffered a series of externat shocls, the economic and finacial
impact of which was not appropriately offset through macroeconomic adjustment measures. Tiere
was a slowdown li growth. The factors contributing to tds decline were unfavorable weather
conditions, institutionat deficiencies in the agricultural sector, and the weak performance of the iron-
ore and flshing sectors. 'Ie Mauritanian economy is fragile, and its medium-term prospects remain
gloomy given the limited natural and human resource base, a high degree of vulnerabDiity to
exogenous factors (climatic conditions and commodity prices), an inelastic revenue base, and an
extremely heavy debt service burden (34.8 percent of GDP in 1991). The experience of the past
years ihas made it clear that without macroeconomic stability and access to sufficient externat
fiancing, sustainable growth will be difficult to attain. The operations chmracterized by slow
disbursement are noted below:
2.           AGSECAL. This credit of US$25 million become effective on April 27, 1990 and
the account is scheduled to be closed on December 31, 1995. Disbursement lag is due to the facttiat
the second tranche release has been withbeld as a result of delays in implementing the agreed
measures on land tenure reform, agricultural credit debt recovery, and reorganization of the Minstry
of Rural Development and Sonader. lbe second tranche is expected to be released in the first half
of 1993.
3.           PESCAL. Tbis credit of US$40 million became effective on August 29, 1990 and
the account was scheduled to be closed on December 31, 1992. Despite the fact that all the
conditions of the second tranche release were met, the tranche release bas been delayed because of
