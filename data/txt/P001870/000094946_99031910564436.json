The\n            project showed that an autonomous, privately managed, local\n            agency is capable of executing works efficiently and\n            effectively on behalf of public institutions, without the\n            help of external technical assistance. Some key lessons\n            learned are the following: 1) Quality of construction needs\n            to be a priority: the Public Works Executing Agency needs to\n            be more careful in its selection process, give more\n            attention to sub-project supervision, hold\n            design/engineering firms accountable for quality, and\n            emphasize training 2) The project was able to break the\n            oligopoly in the construction industry by opening up\n            opportunities for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). By\n            anticipating the strengthening and development of SMEs,\n            future projects might be able to address both the\n            sustainability concern and quality concerns, and produce\n            larger efficiency gains. 3) Any future project should\n            consider the need to strengthen municipal capacity,\n            especially for operations and maintenance. This includes\n            both technical and managerial capacity, as well as improving\n            revenue generation and tax collection. 4) The Agency needs\n            to visualize its future as an independent entity performing\n            a service for a fee. 5) Once the concept of delegated\n            contract management municipalities is accepted and supported\n            in a country, municipalities should have a choice in which\n            agency they employ for the delegation of contract management."}, "docdt": "1999-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
