 Research Project for Senegal were as follows: outcomes were\n            marginally satisfactory, project sustainability was\n            uncertain, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the Bank should ensure that the Borrower's\n            capacity to review technical and engineering plans is\n            adequate and that such plans have been carefully evaluated\n            prior to giving it's no objection. Research stations\n            demand a high level of management skills and careful\n            planning of use of resources, activities, and staff.\n            Research project preparation must therefore give adequate\n            attention to station management and ensure that support\n            services are properly budgeted. The International\n            Development Association (IDA) project underlined, rightly\n            so, the importance of adapting already existing technologies\n            to the specific circumstances of various production systems\n            (agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions), rather than\n            focusing solely on technology generation. International\n            scientific collaboration should also be promoted to maintain\n            a research institute's access to advanced technology.\n            Such a strategy of adaptive research should be pursued as a\n            joint venture with extension services and producer\n            organizations, wherever they are strong enough to be\n            research partners. The continuing failure of its supervisory\n            bodies to enforce a strict accountability for Institut\n            Senegalais de Recherches Agricoles (ISRA) financial\n            management and the lack of suitably qualified accounting\n            personnel are the root cause of ISRA's inefficient and\n            unreliable financial management. Effective financial\n            management of research institutes is a prerequisite for the\n            success of research objectives. Qualified financial Bank\n            staff should be directly involved at all stages of project\n            preparation and implementation. However, it is primarily,\n            the government's responsibility to ensure cost\n            effectiveness and financial discipline in research institutions."}, "docdt": "1997-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
