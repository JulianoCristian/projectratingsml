      will support a five year research program developed by\n            Institut Senegalaise de Recherches Agricoles ( ISRA ) which\n            will reflect a rigorous analysis of geographical and\n            thematic priorities.  The research program will, through the\n            establishment of a natural resources management program and\n            integration of research on crops, livestock and agro -\n            forestry, contribute to the protection of the environment\n            and improvement of soil fertility.  The project will focus\n            on the following : 1) adaptive research in farming; 2)\n            applied research targeted at technical problems in priority\n            agricultural zones; 3) applied research program of natural\n            resources management; 4) strengthening the links between\n            research, extension, development agencies and the farming\n            community; 5) strengthening of ISRA;  6) financial support\n            for ISRA's research services; and 7) establishing an\n            unallocated research Reserve Fund to enable urgent research\n            work to be financed without delay."}, "docdt": "1990-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
