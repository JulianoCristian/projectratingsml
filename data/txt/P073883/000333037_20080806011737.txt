              1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The 2001 Human Development Report ranked Sierra Leone last, reporting statistics well below
the average for the least developed countries. Life expectancy at birth was reported at 38.4 years
and GDP per capita (PPP) at $448, compared to averages of 48.8 years and $1,640 for Sub-
Saharan Africa. Existing information from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS)
indicated that during the previous ten years the health status of the population deteriorated
dramatically due to malaria, diarrhea, communicable diseases, respiratory infections and
malnutrition.

Major factors that contributed to rapidly increasing HIV/AIDS rates in other African countries
were present and intensified by the civil strife, dislocations, poverty, and high incidence of
violence against women in Sierra Leone. At project design, there were still large areas of the
country that were inaccessible and where coverage of any services was significantly limited. In
addition, as a post-conflict country large numbers of the population were displaced internally and
within refugee camps. Given these circumstances and the absence of reliable statistics, the
HIV/AIDS prevalence could not be assessed with certainty beyond the 1997 UNAIDS estimate of
3.2% among Sierra Leonean adults (aged 15-49). However, HIV tests among women visiting
antenatal centers in the Western Area in 1997 showed an HIV prevalence of 7% which suggested
a more diffused epidemic. With the integration of ex-combatants who had not had much exposure
to HIV/AIDS education or avoidance behavior, and likely to engage in risky sexual behavior
patterns started during the conflict, the trend was likely to rise. Therefore, it was widely accepted
that the HIV prevalence rate in Sierra Leone was rising, and that the critical threshold of 5%
when the infection becomes generalized, was either past or near at hand.

A multi-sector, multi-partner HIV/AIDS retreat in April 2001 produced a "Preliminary
HIV/AIDS Situation Analysis" and a proposed framework for the formulation of an HIV/AIDS
National Policy. These efforts were encouraged by the Bank's existing health project. Sierra
Leone had the basic ingredients of a strategic approach on which to build, with a national
HIV/AIDS policy formulated with partner assistance and adopted by the Cabinet, along with the
creation of the National HIV/AIDS Council and National HIV/AIDS Secretariat. Government
officials began voicing concern over the dangers stemming from an HIV/AIDS epidemic,
recognizing the risks to Sierra Leone's development if a coordinated effort was not launched to
stem its spread. This vocal support coincided with the Bank's intensified attention to HIV/AIDS
through the MAP as well as the uncertain HIV prevalence level with potential high risks and
readiness factors provided an entry point for Bank engagement.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support the Borrower's efforts to organize a
multi-sectoral response to the HIV/AIDS crisis, including containing or reducing the spread of
HIV/AIDS and mitigating its effects.1



1This is the PDO per the DCA and different to the PDO indicated in the PAD, which states: (a) contribute to
reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence and (b) mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on persons infected or affected
by HIV/AIDS. For the purposes of this ICR, the PDO is taken as stated in the DCA.


                                                     1

Key Indicators (as per DCA- Schedule 5)

a) Output Indicators

1.    By Closing, at least 12 HIV/AIDS sentinel populations are regularly surveyed both with
      regard to behavioral and biological aspects;

2.    By Closing, 100% of functioning referral and regional hospitals, 80% of functioning
      district hospitals, and 30% of all functioning health centers provide: a) opportunistic
      infection treatment and care, b) improved safety injection programs, and c) effective
      medical waste management programs;

3.    By Closing, at least 1 site providing HIV/AIDS infected pregnant women and newborns
      with mother-to-child-transmission prevention services will be operating in every District;

4.    By Closing, at least 20 organizations are providing counseling, care, and support services to
      PLWHA families as well as orphans and vulnerable children;

5.    By Closing, at least 500 Participating Public Sector Agency and Participating Private
      Sector Agency staff have been trained in HIV care and prevention and are active peer
      educators.

b) Process Indicators

6.    By December 31, 2004 the Borrower's HIV/AIDS national policy is being systematically
      implemented by the NAC and the NAS, reviewed on an annual basis, consistent with the
      strategic planning process;
7.    By Closing, at least 75% of all Participating Public Sector Agencies have incorporated
      HIV/AIDS prevention activities in their annual work plans and budgets, and have core
      teams in place;
8.    By Closing, at least 50 Large CCSI Subprojects and 900 Small CCSI Subprojects are being
      carried out.

c) Outcome Indicators

9.    By Closing, 70% of youth, women, commercial sex workers, uniformed services, and ex-
      combatants can cite at least two major modes of HIV/AIDS transmission and at least two
      methods of protection;
10.   By Closing, 30% of youth use condoms at sexual debut, 35% of adults use condoms in their
      last casual sex act, and 50% of adults use condoms in their last commercial sex act.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised during the project. The PDO could have been restructured under the
MAP Umbrella Restructuring initiated in 2006 and completed in early 2007. Since the SHARP
Closing date was December 31, 2006, it was deemed there was insufficient time to include it
under the MAP Umbrella restructuring as restructuring would not have had a large impact on the
overall project achievements.. However, once the project was extended until December 31, 2007,
the project did not take advantage of the opportunity to be included under the MAP Umbrella
restructuring when it went to the Board (see Section 3.2). Instead two (2) key indicators were




                                                  2

amended2. Indicator 1 was revised to read "at least 6 HIV/AIDS sentinel population surveys with
regard to behavioral and biological aspects are undertaken" and monitor behavior change among
sentinel populations, while indicator 8 was revised to read "at least 15 large CCSI subprojects and
700 small CCSI subprojects are being carried out." These indicators were revised to reflect the
increased focus on high risk and vulnerable groups and realistic targets in light of the higher costs
associated with revised decentralized implementation arrangements (via local councils) for
community activities and time remaining to project closing. .

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Emphasis would be on prevention among youth, women of child-bearing age, orphans and other
vulnerable children, and groups that are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, including sex
workers, the military and ex-combatants, internally displaced people, and refugees.

1.5 Original Components

The project would finance the full spectrum of HIV/AIDS activities including prevention, care,
support, and impact mitigation through four components defined below. Activities would reflect
existing capacity at each administrative structure (national, regional, district, and chiefdoms).

Component 1. Capacity Building, Policy and Program Coordination (US$2.70 million)
aimed to strengthen Sierra Leone's capacity to cope with the spread of HIV/AIDS by supporting:
(i) the work of the National HIV/AIDS Council (NAC) and National HIV/AIDS Secretariat
(NAS); (ii) development of the national HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan and its
underpinnings; (iii) strengthening public and private institutions in prevention and care, and (iv)
Sierra Leone's participation in refugee-related activities within the Mano River Union context.
Sub-components included: Advocacy, Training, and Technical Support, and M&E including
biological and behavioral surveillance, epidemiological and operational research. The SHARP
would rely on the rapid establishment of an effective M&E system as a management tool to guide
continuous project adjustments, a key element in ensuring success.

Component 2. Multi-sector Response for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care (US$2.00 million)
sought to improve the capacity of non-health sector ministries and other public sector entities to
respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, emphasizing prevention and care. This included
development of ministerial policies integrated into their operations and a two-phased approach
with annual action plans approved by NAS. Phase 1 would provide HIV/AIDS and STI education
and other prevention support to line ministry staff and their dependents to encourage preventive
behavior, destigmatize HIV/AIDS, and care for those infected/affected. Phase 2 would assist line
ministries target their external clients with effective HIV/AIDS and STIs prevention information,
and access to health care facilities, treatment and care. Ministries included agriculture, defense,
development and economic planning, youth, education and sports, information and broadcasting,
NaCSA, social welfare, gender and children's affairs, transport and communications.

Component 3. The Health Sector Response to STI/HIV Management (US$2.80 million) was
designed to provide resources to the health sector. The MOHS would conduct the "core"
prevention and care activities for the other line ministries, in addition to enhancing its
reproductive health, TB and opportunistic infection (OI) efforts. The MOHS would prioritize
which aspects, where, when and how quickly it can implement and scale up its HIV/AIDS, STI,

and TB services, in the context of the revised National Health Action Plan. This component
would also support improvement of diagnosis and treatment of STIs and opportunistic infections
(OIs), care at health facilities, laboratory services including safety of blood transfusion, condom
availability and scaling up PMTCT.

Component 4. The Community and Civil Society Initiative (CCSI) (US$7.80 million) would
provide grants to support a broad range of community, civil society and private sector initiatives.
These included chiefdoms, religious groups, women's groups, ex-combatants, refugees or
internally displaced groups and their families, youth, orphans, organizations supporting street and
vulnerable children, CSWs, prisoners, unions, businesses, trade and worker associations, and
sports clubs. It would focus on raising awareness with emphasis on behavioral change,
destigmatization of HIV/AIDS, increasing access to prevention and care, and provide support to
those infected or affected via training and/or income generating activities.

1.6 Revised Components

After the MTR in February 2005, the CCSI Component was revised to allow sub-grants directly
from Local Councils (LCs) to community-based HIV organizations or direct funding by the NAS
for larger sub-projects.3 NAS and LCs developed specific guidelines for implementing these local
CCSI sub-projects, which defined the roles and responsibilities of NAS, the LCs and other
implementers/beneficiaries. LC-approved sub-projects had a $3,000 ceiling. There were no other
component revisions.

1.7 Other significant changes

There were several reallocations4 of the grant proceeds during implementation, which resulted in
DCA amendments. The reallocations reflected an underestimation at project design in the
amounts needed for program coordination, administration and M&E. The introduction of ARTs
at a later stage also necessitated a reallocation. Following the reallocations, the grant included
higher amounts for the Goods and Operating Costs category, and a reduced amount for the CCSI
grants category.

Changes in the implementation arrangements were formalized through DCA amendments (see
section 1.6). The project scope was revised through an amendment5 to allow the inclusion of
funding for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for up to 2,000 patients within Component 3 by the
Closing date. The final amendment to the DCA was the Closing date extension from Dec. 31,
2006 to Dec. 31, 20076.

2006, and Oct. 29, 2007.

the project files.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

SHARP project design included a strong focus on M&E and capacity building. In addition,
SHARP indicators focused on measuring outputs, processes and outcomes, particularly in the
health sector, to demonstrate success. This focus was appropriate given the post-conflict status of
the country and the need to build institutions and systems to carry out the response. SHARP was
one of the first MAPs to include a separate MOH component which allowed for a strong focus on
strengthening the health sector response7. The consultation process undertaken at preparation
with donor and stakeholders allowed for country specific issues to be addressed in the design.
The project design also incorporated lessons of experience from IDA-financed HIV/AIDS
projects in Africa as well as projects in Sierra Leone on capacity building, role of the Ministry of
Health and multi-sectoral approach. ..

In view of the capacity constraints in Sierra Leone, SHARP design tapped into existing in-
country capacities to utilize NACSA as an initial implementation partner for the CCSI component.
However, the design also provided flexibility such that as the capacity of partners and institutions
was built through Component 1, the project would adapt to gradually devolve responsibility to
LCs for reviewing community sub-projects after 2 years of implementation. This allowed the
project to mitigate the risk of limited capacity whilst adopting a phased approach as part of a
sustainable national response.

As the first post-conflict HIV/AIDS project in Africa, the SHARP design recognized the
uncertainty of implementing HIV/AIDS programs in a post-conflict environment.. These risks
were partially mitigated by ensuring high-level political support expressed at the Presidential and
Cabinet level for a sustained HIV program. In addition, SHARP design included an external,
independent financial procurement management agent (FPMA) responsible for all financial and
procurement arrangements of the project.

Finally, end-program targets were kept more modest than other HIV/AIDS programs focusing
more on the process-oriented and institutional strengthening targets rather than outcome and
impact targets. The lack of reliable baseline data to some extent was addressed through the use of
the USCDC survey results.

The project design with multiple implementers at various levels may have been too complex
however necessary to mitigate against weak implementation capacity. It may have been more
appropriate to simplify the design for the community response further through the use of existing
NGOs with known capacity to implement activities initially (especially for high risk groups) and
build the capacity of smaller organizations during implementation. Finally, beyond the lack of
reliable baseline data, although end program targets were kept modest, focused on processes and
institutional strengthening, program PDO and outcome indicators (especially indicator 9) were
too broad and ambitious for the country context. Indicator 9 (as per DCA) might have been
improved by focusing on 1 or 2 groups for monitoring to ensure a clearer definition of what
success would look like rather than multiple groups which might not reach the target.

2.2 Implementation

Several factors affected implementation such as weaknesses and changes in project and personnel
management, changes in implementation arrangements, compliance with fiduciary and legal
obligations, and inadequate monitoring of project activities which resulted in (i) delays, (ii)
adjustment of program targets, and (iii) incomplete data to support project achievement. The
project implementation is characterized by two distinct phases of implementation with two sets of
project management.
.
Phase I of implementation. Problems with NAS project management led to a three month delay
in effectiveness from July to October 2002 and continued to affect implementation as noted by
several World Bank supervision missions8 Delays in recruitment of core staff and high staff
turnover for M&E, capacity building and CCSI units led to a sluggish start, subsequent delays
and difficulties in program monitoring and data capture. Furthermore, the unavailability of
counterpart funds in the initial two years created problems with timely payments to local
suppliers and a reputational risk for NAS.

"Territorial behavior" demonstrated by the first Executive Director (ED) and Deputy Director
resulted in implementation delays in the first 3 years as the work environment did not permit
progress towards project goals. Similarly, this behavior led to misunderstandings, disagreements
between the NAS management, NACSA management and management teams of the IMA, and
the FPMA (KPMG) contributing to delayed implementation, inadequate fiduciary compliance,
and delayed funding of particular activities and contracts. Missions noted instances of
interference in procurement with attempts made by the ED to bypass the procurement office and
2 procurement staff recruited at project launch were dismissed mid-way without good reason.

Tensions between KPMG and NAS management escalated and resulted in a temporary hold on
implementation in December 2005 when KPMG cancelled their contract and exposed the SHARP
to possible FM risks. The Global Fund and World Bank team intervened and discussed with the
respective teams and partners how to resolve the dispute. The NAS and KPMG contract was
reinstated in January 2006 with specific conditions to redress tensions. As a result of this FM
crisis, the GOSL decided to change the NAS management in February 2006.

Phase II of implementation. The February 2006 change in project management had a significant
impact on the pace of implementation. The activities completed, levels of disbursement,
withdrawal requests submitted to the World Bank, the timeliness of audit reports, personnel
turnover rates, and the relationship with KPMG and the LCs improved significantly in the last
two years of implementation.

MTR and Project Extension. Following the MTR (February 2005), there were a number of
changes introduced to improve the effectiveness of implementation in particular for the CCSI
component and to allow financing of ARVs (see section 1.6 and 1.7). Finally, to make for some
of the time lost due to management problems, the implementation period was extended by one
year from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The M&E design of the project was technically thorough to allow the NAS and partners
to develop a sustainable and realistic system within the Sierra Leonean context. The main
objective of the M&E design was to rapidly establish systems to identify successes and failures
and monitor effective interventions to address HIV. It was expected that SHARP would support
two main categories of project M&E, namely (a) program performance as well as project activity
implementation progress (including financial management), and (b) benefits to project
beneficiaries (target groups) through surveillance, epidemiological research and surveys. This
design may have been too complex and funds not adequate for the post-conflict Sierra Leone,
however, in light of the existing data inadequacies; it was assessed as an appropriate vehicle to
build institutional capacity for regular monitoring.

Implementation. Implementation was difficult because: NAS was not able to effectively
coordinate different M&E responsbilities among various units.. Responsibility for health facility
monitoring, biological and behavioral surveillance, and epidemiological research was left to the
ARG with the support of other relevant partners such as the Central Statistical Office and WHO.
However, some epidemiological research would also be executed under the CCSI or Multi-
sectoral Components when targeting specific high risk groups in terms of behavior change
activities not directly linked to health facilities. Project implementation progress with respect to
financial and procurement aspects would be left to the FPMA and impact on beneficiaries would
be collated based on information received from sub-project progress and financial reports as
collected by the IMA and NACSA. Each of these units/institutions developed a separate reporting
format that would be used by recipient institutions or groups to provide relevant data to the NAS.
The ARG M&E system was effectively implemented and monitored health-specific information
from facilities, as did the FPMA on financial and procurement tracking. However, the M&E data
on the CCSI component was not adequately captured and satisfactory. Data on specific
prevention activities implemented, the total number of beneficiaries reached in certain categories
such as OVCs or PWLHAs through community level sub-projects or number of people referred
for testing through community activities was limited to paper-based review of sub-project reports.
It would have been possible for the M&E implementation challenges to be surmounted if these
challenges were appropriately addressed, through the use of a consolidated M&E operational plan
that was developed and funded accordingly under Component 1. The PAD recognized that the
project should outsource all project monitoring activities to a specialized agency that was
equipped to collect, verify, enter and analyze data from all sources although this approach was
not adopted.

Despite shortcomings, substantial data was collected from line ministries, including the ministry
of health on program activities as well as research, surveillance and health-specific data such as
people tested, and CCSI sub-projects. The project was able to provide financial support for
various behavioral surveillance (2005, 2007) and sentinel surveys (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007)
during implementation (see Annex 2 for details) nationally and for high risk groups, including
ANC sentinel surveys. A national population based survey was carried out in 2005, with support
from NAS, MOHS and Statistics Sierra Leone. A follow-up to this survey was also carried out in
2007. Sample M&E data is available in Annex 2.

Utilization. Available data seems to have been underutilized to better target resources due to
weak M&E capacity and unavailability of a comprehensive MIS to be utilized by all
implementing partners.



                                                     7

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment. Project was identified as a Category B project, similar to other HIV/AIDS projects,
which required a medical waste management plan acceptable to IDA in place prior to
implementation with clearly defined activities to be implemented. The health care waste
management plan (HCWMP) was finalized in April 2004 and no activities were implemented at
MTR. HCWM improved significantly by the Closing date since medical waste management was
strengthened through provision of appropriate waste disposal facilities (15), supervision of
medical waste activities, and training of medical personnel (1,381). In addition, substantial (19
blood screening sties established; 100% of blood products screened for HIV and STIs) activities
on blood safety were carried out. Details are available in Annex 2.

Financial Management and Procurement. Due to a recognized lack of capacity in Sierra Leone
and the NAS, the project outsourced the financial management and procurement responsibilities
to KPMG as the FPMA. A procurement and financial management unit was established with
KPMG staff and integrated into the NAS. A procurement management system consistent with
World Bank's policies, guidelines, procedures and processes was used and carried out according
to procurement plans. Record keeping and management improved continuously over the project
life and a Fixed Assets Register was established. SUN System software system was installed and
facilitated the work of staff, eased generation of procurement reports, though paper files were
kept for audit purposes. As noted before, there were two management teams during SHARP
implementation which also affected the fiduciary compliance procedures. Capacity developed
was lost while a new Procurement Assistant and Procurement Clerk were recruited and trained
but the second management team achieved better compliance with procedures and quicker
processing of requirements.

Disbursement and Audits. Independent FPMA was contracted, but fiduciary compliance was still
problematic over the project period, as evidenced by: (i) lagging disbursements overall (only 16%
disbursed in the first 18 months compared to an expected (and ambitious) disbursement of 42%)
and for Component 2 (disbursed 14% of allocation at MTR); (ii) delays in audit reports provided
to the World Bank, with only 1 audit report provided on time while other audit reports provided
beyond the 6-month timeframe; and (iii) the unavailability of counterpart funding in a reliable and
timely fashion, a systemic problem for Sierra Leone. The GOSL was expected to provide
$300,000 in counterpart funds over the life of the project for financing of local expenses out of
which US$ 220,7529 (74%) was disbursed to the NAS over the project lifetime. Four (4)
unqualified audit reports were prepared by an independent auditor and submitted to the World
Bank. Identified issues within the first two reports were addressed and written responses
submitted to the auditors. No management letters were issued for other audit reports

Compliance with Legal Covenants. The project was required to comply with 8 legal covenants
under the DCA. The project complied with 3 covenants, namely committing to project
implementation on the basis of the agreed objectives and utilizing the project implementation
plan and operations manuals (DCA 3.01 (a) (b)), following procurement procedures laid out in
DCA Schedule 3 (DCA 3.02), and (DCA 6.01) additional DCA conditions on staffing of the NAS,
financial accounting systems and development and training on the medical waste management
plan. The SHARP partially complied with the legal covenants on provision of counterpart funding
for project activities (DCA 3.03) and maintenance of an effective financial management system



9GOSL disbursed Le 657,000,000 (US$ 220,752) out of an allocated Le 984,279,000 (US$ 330,718)
between 2002 and 2007, using exchange rate applicable Dec. 31, 2007 of Le 2976.19 = US$ 1.00


                                                  8

that provides financial monitoring reports every 6 months as well as claiming withdrawals from
the Special Account on the basis of statements of expenditures and annual audits of
implementation (DCA 4.01 (a) (b) (c)). The project has also complied with the DCA section 3.04
covenant on "furnish to the Association not later than six (6) months after the Closing Date ..., a
plan designed to ensure the continued achievement of the Projects objectives; and (b) afford the
Association a reasonable opportunity to exchange views with the Borrower on said plan". A NAS
Transition Strategy was discussed and shared with the Bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The SHARP contributed to the strengthening of the NAC and NAS which were established in
2001 as the primary coordinating agency to respond to HIV/AIDS.10 All donors and stakeholders
similarly acknowledge the key role of the NAS in coordinating HIV activities in Sierra Leone.
To this end, a National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2006­2010) was launched in December 2006.

Prior to Closing, NAS developed a Transitional Strategy outlining its financial needs to carry out
its mandate vis-à-vis the Strategic Plan effectively and shared with the President, Ministry of
Finance and National Development, and partners such as the World Bank, Global Fund and UN
agencies. Whilst it is confirmed that there is no IDA available for a follow-up operation, some
HIV/AIDS activities will be implemented with resources secured under the Global Fund Round 6.
The GFATM Round 6 agreement provides US$9.62 million to the NAS (US$2.4 million has been
disbursed since July 2007) to scale up the existing national response in prevention, treatment, care
and support for those affected. In particular, the grant is to scale up access to services, especially
for vulnerable groups, and improve the quality of the services with new identified partners to
extend the coverage of HIV awareness programs through community outreach, mass media and
developing HIV prevention competence. There is a likelihood that Sierra Leone will benefit from
Round 7 as well.

Although these GFATM grants address many of the aspects covered under the SHARP, there are
still some aspects of the national HIV/AIDS response that are not funded. Whilst GOSL has
increased its direct support for HIV/AIDS activities within the MOHS during project
implementation and after Closing, full funding for the coordination efforts of the NAS remains
uncertain given GOSL's limited resource envelope as well as the inability to provide 100% of the
counterpart funds during implementation. Specifically, GOSL has provided a cumulative total of
Le 5.34 billion (US$1.7 million) from 2002 until 2007. As of February 2008, the GOSL had
already disbursed an additional Le 1.05 billion (US$354,298) for MOHS HIV-related activities.

Subsequent to Closing, the ICR team was informed that the GOSL/NAS received 1.8 million
from the German Development Agency (KfW)11 to support impact mitigation, prevention of
female genital mutilation and gender-based violence activities that will be implemented
nationwide by identified NGOs over a period of 4 years. An additional 0.4 million has been
granted to the NAS for coordination of the national HIV program over the same period. This
support will significantly contribute towards closing the gap in financing of HIV activities in the
national program but still leaves a US$2.0 million financing gap for NAS coordination activities.

Funding is also available from partners such as UNICEF and USAID but this is generally tied to
specific technical aspects, managed by the agency, and does not include support for the NAS
mandate for coordination of HIV/AIDS activities.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance is rated as substantial because of the following:
(i)     Objectives of the program contributed towards the development priorities of the CAS
        (FY06-09) and PRSP to improve health outcomes, improve access to utilization of social
        infrastructure and services and to empower local councils in decision-making. The
        project established 82 VCCT centers, provided support to 162 ANCs to provide PMTCT
        services, to over 1400 health providers to provide STI services, established 19 blood
        screening sites to ensure 100 percent blood safety, and improved the central laboratory at
        Connaught Hospital.

(ii)    The design clearly reflected lessons from the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) with
        respect to implementation capacity within public sector, utilization of decentralized
        structures, direct community financing and outsourcing financial management. The
        project relied on implementation partners such as NACSA, civil society organizations,
        ministries and local councils. The project put a strong emphasis on building up public
        sector capacity to respond to the epidemic in particular with respect to prevention and
        mitigation. In an effort to improve their capacity to respond to the epidemic 15 ministries
        Ministry of Health and other key ministries developed action plans to implement the
        national AIDS policy.

(iii)   Implementation strengthened local implementation capacity by training and giving a
        voice to communities and civil society organizations, empowered local councils and
        contributed towards improving Sierra Leone's ranking on the UN Human Development
        Index with respect to child mortality and life expectancy. 525 CBOs/NGOs received
        funding to implement over 700 community sub-projects targeting high-risk groups. Over
        5,500 people were trained as peer educators in public and private sector.

Perhaps one shortcoming of the project initially was to focus the IEC too much on the general
population as opposed to the high-risk groups which did not yield specific information or results
with respect to these.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The overall efficacy of the project is rated modest.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support the Borrower's efforts to organize a
multisectoral response to the HIV/AIDS crisis, including containing or reducing the spread of




                                                10

HIV/AIDS and mitigating its effects.12 It is necessary to analyze achievement on three aspects of
the PDO separately.

(i)      With respect to the SHARP contribution towards the organization of a multisectoral
         response to the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sierra Leone, this goal has been satisfactorily
         achieved. The NAS has continued to expand its efforts in engaging persons and
         institutions from various persons, including local councils (LCs), traditional chiefs,
         parliamentarians, the private sector, donor partners, local NGOs, and those most affected
         by the epidemic ­ PLWHAs. 15 ministries are implementing their action plans, over 500
         civil society organizations and 19 local councils nationwide as well as the private sector
         are part of the response. The Government is working towards mainstreaming HIV
         activities in all sectors by encouraging the inclusion of an HIV/AIDS budget line for each
         ministry for which they will be accountable annually.

(ii)     With respect to containing or reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, there is mixed evidence
         that SHARP has contributed towards slowing down the spread of HIV/AIDS within
         Sierra Leone. The combination of data from ANC sites and prevalence data for women
         aged 15-19, indicates a trend toward slowing down of the new infections and perhaps a
         slight decrease in prevalence.

         HIV prevalence data available at project preparation was the 1997 UNAIDS estimate of
         3.2% among adults aged 15-49, with recognition that prevalence for women receiving
         antenatal care (especially in the Western Area) was recorded as 7% in 1997. Data13
         suggested prevalence rates of at least 36% for female commercial sex workers; similar
         rates were assumed for other high-risk groups like uniformed services personnel, ex-
         combatants and truck drivers. The data available at project design was considerably
         uncertain and this uncertainty was not aided by the results of the CDC baseline survey
         undertaken in 2002 which provided conflicting prevalence rates. The CDC baseline
         survey identified a preliminary prevalence rate of 4.9% which was later revised to a
         weighted seroprevalence rate of 0.9%. Additional baseline data from 2 VCT sites at Bo
         and Kenema provided rates of 3.0% and 4.4% respectively. The uncertainty related to the
         baseline data renders the interpretation of data and results achieved during the project
         period difficult because various interpretations are possible depending on which baseline
         prevalence rate is chosen for tracking.

         The 2002 national population-based HIV seroprevalence survey indicates HIV
         prevalence (among women aged 15-19) at 1.8%. In 2005, this had decreased to 1.7%.
         Available data at project closing shows current HIV prevalence estimate at 1.5%.14.
         Although the results indicate containment and a slight reduction, this is not a very
         appropriate indicator to assess the success of the program. As noted in an internal IDA
         memorandum in 2006 and various other documents, prevalence cannot be easily
         monitored over the span of a 5-year project; and several MAP projects were re-structured
         to reflect this. On the other hand, this indicator can be used as a proxy for incidence for
         women aged 15-19, to track the number of new infections which would then indicate a



12 This is different than the PDO indicated in the PAD, which states: (a) contribute to reducing HIV/AIDS
prevalence and (b) mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on persons infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. For the
purposes of this ICR, the PDO is taken as stated in the DCA.

          slight decrease in the number of new infections hence a slow down of the epidemic
          spread. ANC trend data, however, suggests that HIV prevalence (which includes new and
          old cases) has been rising since 2002, with 3.0% in 2003, 4.1% in 2006, and 4.4% in
          200715. This would fit with design projections since it was estimated that the prevalence
          rate was either close to or at 5% and that the incidence peak was close or just past. The
          NAS also monitored the prevalence trends for STIs (syphilis) which increased from 3.9%
          in 2003, 4.5% in 2004, 5.3% in 2005, 6.0% in 2006 and 6.2% in 2007. The data on
          prevalence trends (ANC and STI) are particularly reliable in the last 2 years of
          implementation when more health facilities were included and providing regular data to
          the NAS.

          Survey data on high risk groups available from 2005 and 200716 suggests that HIV
          prevalence rates are lower than expected, range close to the ANC data prevalence trends,
          and support the PDO on reduction in the spread of HIV. For instance, HIV prevalence
          among TB patients surveyed in 2005 was 11.6%, while that among CSWs in Freetown
          was observed as 8.5% in 2005. Surveys done in 2007 on military personnel and police
          personnel indicated HIV prevalence rates of 3.29% and 5.8% respectively. This data is
          significantly lower than the 7% HIV prevalence among ANC patients, 36% for CSWs in
          Western area, and 3% among respondents at 34 military hospitals in 2002 (see Annex 2
          for details).

(iii)     With respect to mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS, modest results were achieved. For
          persons infected with HIV and AIDS, the SHARP was initially not able to provide
          treatment and management of OIs, or provide nutritional support and basic diagnostic
          monitoring through CD4 count testing. Beginning in 2005, the SHARP provided CD4
          testing at 5 hospitals, trained over 1,400 health workers on OI management, and provided
          ARVs to 2,088 PLWHA. The SHARP also contributed to the formation of PLWHA
          associations in Sierra Leone which increased from none to at least 15, such as HACSA
          (HIV/AIDS Care and Support Association) and NETHIPS (network of HIV Positives)
          and membership has continued to increase. A 2007 PLWHA Impact Mitigation Survey
          commissioned by the NAS found good results, including PLWHA satisfaction with
          access to health services (68%) and drug availability (86%), as well as high ratings for
          counseling support with 75% benefitting from the full counseling package. Good
          nutrition is a significant factor for PLWHAs under treatment to ensure the efficacy of
          ART, but the project was only able to support 275 PLWHAs with nutrition compared to
          the target number of 2000. PLWHAs recognized that the nutrition support received led to
          significant improvements in patient health. However not all not all PLWHAs benefited
          equally as the nutrition packages varied among groups. Similarly, support for income
          generating activities was limited. Hence, the coverage and impact of these activities was
          weak most likely because they were supported on a pilot basis with limited funding.

          SHARP also helped to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on children and pregnant
          women by scaling up PMTCT services. PMTCT services were scaled up from only 4
          health facilities in the Western region in 2003 to 162 sites by Closing. Over 83,400

Syphilis Sentinel Surveillance report (2006); and Antenatal HIV and Syphilis Sentinel Surveillance report

16 There is no trend data available where the same groups are surveyed twice for different years and it is
difficult to attribute these results to SHARP.


                                                    12

         pregnant women were reached with PMTCT services, providing single-dose Nevirapine
         to 879 HIV-positive pregnant women, and 322 babies born to HIV-positive mothers
         between 2004 and November 2007. Although specific data on the number of babies of
         positive mothers who were born positive is not available, the number of babies requiring
         NVP after birth could be considered a proxy for this to show the rate of transmission of
         infection from mothers to newborns. In 2004, 100% of babies born to positive mothers
         received NVP, compared to 37% in 2006, and 27% in 2007, while NVP was increasingly
         available over the period.

         PLWHAs met by the ICR team noted that although stigma persisted this was now on the
         decline. The 2007 PLWHA Impact Mitigation Survey indicates people being more
         willing to speak to PLWHAs and discuss their status. The 2004 and 2007 national
         behavioral surveys show that stigma as identified in behavior towards HIV-infected
         persons had decreased. 55.9% of respondents in 2007 were willing to care for sick family
         members compared to 44% in 2004. In the 2007 survey, more respondents were willing
         to interact with HIV-positive persons based on relationships, with more people willing
         for HIV-positive teachers to continue teaching (31.4%) and buying food from a positive
         shopkeeper (22%).

         The SHARP was successful in terms of mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS by protecting
         the general population through proper blood screening, which was not available at all
         prior to the SHARP and had reached 100% at Closing. In the post-conflict, limited
         capacity setting of Sierra Leone, these outcomes are considerable.

         The SHARP was able to exceed the targets identified for 8 out of the 10 key performance
         indicators (as per DCA), which would contribute in the long run towards reduction in
         HIV prevalence and mitigation of the impact on infected and affected people. There is
         partial data available on condom use and knowledge of two prevention and transmission
         methods. (See Annex 2 for detailed information on outputs and outcomes achieved)

On balance, SHARP was able to achieve some of its development objectives, with respect to (i)
and (iii), with some shortcomings particularly with respect to (ii) but still resulting in the many of
the anticipated behavior change outcomes.

3.3 Efficiency

The SHARP was modestly efficient in providing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment
services. About half of the SHARP resources were utilized under the CCSI component to finance
718 small and 29 large scale community sub-projects17 which are estimated to have reached about
50 percent of the population over the life of the project. 13 percent of the funds were spent on
high-risk groups and PLWHAs. The average cost per beneficiary under this component is about
US$3.0 which supported primarily distribution of condoms, IEC, income and nutritional support
and training.




17The total number of sub-projects does not include 4,075 radio programmes aired nationwide.




                                                  13

The project was able to keep operating costs to SDR 2.46 million18 (US$3.05 million equivalent),
which constitutes 20.3% of the total project cost. These operating costs are higher than the
average for MAP projects (averaging up to 10%) and post-conflict CDD operations financed by
the Bank (averaging up to 15%). In view of the added financial and procurement risk identified at
project design, resources were invested in ensuring adequate governance and accountability
mechanisms were in place by contracting an external agent which has increased the total
administrative costs. This investment paid off as it allowed the NAS to establish a reputation as
an agency with sound financial and procurement practices and mobilize significant additional
resources from the national budget and other partners such as the Global Fund and KfW.

Sierra Leone also compares favorably with other African countries on the cost of ARVs as
indicated by the declining monthly costs for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs paid per patient during
the project period. Annual first-line ARV drug costs19 per patient have declined from US$ 204
(US$ 17 monthly) in 2004 to US$ 108.24 (US$ 9.02 monthly) in 2007, which is a direct result of
the effectiveness of the NAS negotiations with ARV manufacturers and economies of scale
derived from scaling up ART to larger numbers of patients.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Whilst incidence of HIV amongst women between the ages of 15 to19 has decreased from 1.8
percent to 1.5 percent during the life of the project, prevalence amongst pregnant women has
risen from 2.9 percent to 4.4 percent although at a slower rate. Out of the two outcome indicators
that could influence incidence, condom use and knowledge of transmission and prevention
methods, the one relating to condom use at last casual sex among adults has been achieved (data
on usage among youth and usage during commercial sex are unavailable). Knowledge of
transmission and methods of prevention has been partially achieved with high levels of
knowledge on individual transmission and prevention methods, although the data is unclear on
aggregate figures of persons citing at least 2 methods. (see Project Data Sheet and Annex 4 which
provides a comparison of the PAD, DCA, and revised indicators and results)

These modest results were achieved despite the type of epidemic, limited funding and short
implementation period. This is evidenced by increased knowledge of transmission and
prevention methods among armed forces, police, informal sector workers, and CSW groups
which are the primary beneficiaries for a concentrated epidemic like in Sierra Leone. Although at
this time, due to unavailability of trend data for high-risk groups, one is not able to establish a
positive trajectory with certainty. Nevertheless, the project could have put more effort in its IEC
to reach out to larger portion of the population to improve basic knowledge, prevention and
transmission mechanisms and to make testing more available.

Thus, the overall outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory, based on substantial relevance,
modest efficiency and modest efficacy.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Given the concentrated epidemic present in Sierra Leone, the SHARP was obliged to focus on
high risk and vulnerable groups during implementation (particularly CSWs, MSMs, youth, and
women). Female genital mutilation and gender-based violence issues were addressed as part of
the IEC strategy. SHARP's efforts allowed these cultural practices/taboos to be more openly
discussed.

CSWs who benefitted from skills training (880) acknowledged during discussions with the ICR
team that SHARP gave them self-respect, helped change attitudes within their communities
which are more accepting, and provided them with an opportunity to contribute to their
communities' livelihoods.

Awareness activities carried out by involving the traditional chiefs and parliamentarians increased
acceptance of PLWHAs allowing them to share their experiences in public fora and demonstrate
to communities that they can still actively contribute to society. These stigma reduction activities
have allowed many PLWHAs to feel comfortable about revealing their HIV status and stimulated
the creation of PLWHA support groups. The use of civil society institutions and organizations to
implement CCSI HIV activities (525) has also contributed to the re-energizing and capacity
building of the Sierra Leonean civil society.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Previous HIV/AIDS activities in Sierra Leone were ad hoc and uncoordinated. SHARP
supported improvements to the institutional framework (the NAC, the NAS, the National
Strategic Plan and M&E Framework 2006-2010, HIV and AIDS Act) and contributed to the
operationalization of the Three Ones principles (one national coordinating authority, one National
Strategic Plan and one M&E Plan). The Project has improved public and private sector capacity
to mainstream HIV/AIDS in their usual operations, through the engagement of LCs in the
delivery of the community response and mainstreaming of sectoral HIV activities through sector
focal points. The MOHS has been strengthened to deliver improved health services through VCT,
PMTCT, ART and STI management training. The norms and guidelines developed for HIV care
and training provided will also assist the health workers to deliver other medical services.

The community response component has given voice and visibility to a large number of civil
society organizations. It has specifically built capacity for advocacy and activism amongst
PLWHA as they were able to expand their national network by organizing local chapters and
reaching out to larger numbers of people.

SHARP has also contributed to closer collaboration between the Bank, Global Fund and bilateral
donors and better resource mobilization and deployment of resources although it remains a weak
point.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

During the implementation of the SHARP, institutional and technical conditions have been
created which will minimize the risks to development outcome. Government, through its support
to NAS20, has taken ownership of the HIV/AIDS agenda whilst NAS has proved to be an
effective agency in the coordination of the HIV/AIDS response. This year, the NAS will be
required to sign a performance contract with the Office of the President, outlining the results and
targets they intend to achieve. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (2006-2010) will continue to
provide an effective framework for the response. Several donor partners (Global Fund, KfW)
have already committed funds to support NAS efforts over the next two-three years which will
continue to support the integration of HIV/AIDS services (such as VCCT, ART, and PMTCT)
into the national healthcare delivery system. Others such as USAID, UNICEF, DFID, and EU are
currently supporting critical activities within the framework of the national strategy and may
reach an agreement to channel support through NAS. Government, through MOHS budget, has
also been providing funds since project closing. Services for care, prevention and treatment of
HIV/AIDS have been expanded and Sierra Leone now has capacity to monitor prevalence,
behavior and OI trends. Within various sectors HIV/AIDS activities are expected to be
mainstreamed into annual plans and budgets21 under the leadership of existing Management
Teams and Focal Point Persons. Each ministry will be held accountable via performance
agreements to deliver on their commitments. Capacity for advocacy and response has been
developed within different public sector agencies including local governments as well as civil
society and communities, which has helped break the silence on HIV/AIDS and will continue to
have effects on the population of Sierra Leone.

Despite these positive steps, some risks to the development outcome remain with the closing of
the SHARP:

Financial risk. Sustained financial support for the coordination of the national response remains a
gap for the future, but is likely to impact more on the coverage of activities rather than
discontinuation of activities. The health sector response will be sustainable provided that support
from other donors such as the Global Fund, UNICEF, USAID, and UNAIDS (to name a few)
helps to maintain the momentum developed by the SHARP.

Technical risk. Prevention activities for sensitization of those parts of the population that have not
been reached by HIV messages and/or require further sensitization on HIV as well as
encouragement of testing remain a critical gap. Given that a significant portion of the Sierra


20GOSL has continued to increase its direct support for HIV/AIDS activities within the Ministry of Health
and Sanitation (MOHS) over the period of project implementation and continuing after project Closing.
GOSL has provided a cumulative total of Le 5.34 billion (US$1.79 million) from 2002 until 2007 and as of
February 2008, had disbursed an additional Le 1.05 billion (US$354,298) for MOHS HIV activities
21 For example, Life Skills activities and the HIV curriculum that has been developed within the Ministry
of Education will also be mainstreamed within the education sector activities. Sources of funding for
teachers to be trained in these skills are not fully identified but UNICEF is expected to support some of the
training.


                                                        16

Leonean population has not received sufficient HIV awareness information or been tested, this
connotes a significant risk to sustainability.

Operational risk. Although LCs have now developed the mechanisms and initiated the approving
and monitoring process for funding and implementing local sub-projects, this capacity needs to be
maintained and communities need to continue to have direct financing from LCs to implement
development activities. If this initial momentum created by the SHARP is not taken further, then
the HIV/AIDS response may need to be addressed through an emergency operation in the future.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The SHARP project was developed over a short period of time given the urgency of responding
to the HIV epidemic after the cessation of hostilities. A large preparation team was deployed to
cover various critical aspects, including social scientists, anthropologists, financial management,
procurement and post conflict specialists, as well as medical specialists. Project design and
preparation was supported with additional financing through a PPF. The ACTafrica team led the
preparation and design of the project which allowed incorporation of the lessons learned and
experiences from previous MAP projects.

However, the project design had minor shortcomings with respect to the M&E framework
(section 2.3) which was perhaps too complex for the Sierra Leone context and the initial
implementation arrangements which used several different implementing partners which resulted
in conflicts and substantial implementation delays.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Unsatisfactory

The Bank team was fairly proactive in supervision in the last two years of implementation,
responding and adapting to the changing country context by shifting to a decentralized
implementation approach and adopting a stronger focus on high risk groups and improved
monitoring. However, there were a number of shortcomings in the overall supervision and in
particular in the first four years of implementation:

Project management. The project was managed by four TTLs, translating into an average tenure
of 1.4 years for each TTL, which had implications on institutional memory and follow-up on
critical areas. Supervision improved considerably in the last 2 years of implementation with a
TTL familiar with the country context and CDD and social development projects in Sierra Leone,
who was able to gain mutual trust and respect with the government management team and
supervise the project over an extended period.

Management response. Bank management did not always provide feedback on issues highlighted
by TTLs in ISRs. Management feedback may potentially have avoided the conflict in KPMG and
NAS relations, or assisted the task team in addressing identified concerns with the project
development objectives such as in monitoring prevalence rates given the challenges with
indicators. Bank management was informed repeatedly in aide memoires and ISRs since April



                                                  17

2004 of significant challenges in the project management which were impeding implementation.
However, proactive action was only taken at the end of 2005 when the project was exposed to
financial risk and the TTL took a risk to request support for initiating a project suspension letter.
Similar to the change observed in the borrower performance with the second management team,
there was significant improvement in the Bank supervision performance in the last two years of
implementation.

M&E support. Although M&E was continuously identified as a weak area and with limited in-
country capacity, the project received minimal M&E support from the Bank, with only two
technical support missions from GAMET for the duration of implementation. NAS and SHARP
could have benefited from additional support and guidance in determining the most relevant
indicators using realistic data collection mechanisms in the Sierra Leonean context rather than
depending on population surveys that would not be carried out regularly over the project life.

Operational support. Given that Sierra Leone was coming out of a post-conflict situation, better
support should have been provided for capacity building and simplification of the implementation
mechanisms.

Financial management and procurement. Fiduciary support was also provided on a regular basis,
particularly since the financial management and procurement specialists based in Ghana were
able to monitor the project more closely due to their proximity. However, given the high risks
identified in the project design, the Bank could have provided better guidance to avert the
financial crisis/conflict.

Restructuring. The project was not restructured when the opportunity to do so arose under the
MAP umbrella and no clear reason is available to explain this. The expansion of the project scope
to include ARVs was also not recorded officially with an amendment to the DCA.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Quality at entry was sound with a technically sound and participatory preparation process. M&E
shortcomings identified in the design were surmountable if M&E activities were monitored
adequately during supervision. Bank performance during supervision with several changes in task
management and delayed resolution of the project management problems negatively impacted
project outcomes. Bank failure to restructure the project when the opportunity arose for the
remaining year of the project may have contributed to the limitations observed in outcome results.

In light of the above satisfactory quality at entry and unsatisfactory supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory




                                                  18

Counterpart Funding: Per the PAD, US$300,000 equivalent was the required GOSL contribution.
As of December 2007, Le 657,000,00022 (US$ 220,752) had been disbursed. Although the final
outcome with respect to Government contribution to the project compares very favorably (74% of
requirement) to other projects in the portfolio, the funds were not received in a consistent and
continuous manner which impacted planning. The initial deposit of US$100,000 was not
received until 2 years into the project. The project received increased funding after 2005. The
GOSL counterpart funding trend also attests to the problems faced with the first NAS
management team and the diligence of the second NAS management team in following up on
counterpart funding. Given the constraints applicable to Sierra Leone as a post-conflict country,
the compliance with over 70% disbursed and, particularly the attempt to incrementally increase
this amount from 2005 to 2007 should be acknowledged. Finally, the GOSL has provided a
cumulative allocation of more than US$ 1.79 million in the national budget for HIV/AIDS under
the Ministry of Health between 2002 and 2007.

Government Engagement: Lack of a speedy response by GOSL to identified challenges in the
NAS management from the early stages of the project does not reflect strong government
ownership and commitment to the success of the HIV/AIDS response. This attitude changed
considerably in the last 2 years of implementation with the government showing dedication to
committing their own resources to support the national HIV/AIDS response, as well as taking
aggressive actions to mainstream HIV activities in the public sector. The President has instructed
all sector ministries to include an HIV/AIDS line item within their national budgets, for which
they will be held accountable via performance contracts.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project exhibited serious managerial problems that impacted on implementation in the period
between effectiveness and February 2006, and also tarnished the public perception of the NAS as
an institution. The management change that occurred in February 2006 contributed significantly
towards results achieved by closing and positively changed public perception of NAS.

Given the context in which the project was implemented, and the management challenges within
the implementing agency, the project still met the majority of its objectives and indicators. The
uncertainty surrounding the data and prevalence levels that were anticipated at project design are
now addressed by the institutionalization of consistent tracking of the HIV epidemic. Increased
information has allowed the NAS to have a better understanding of the HIV epidemic in Sierra
Leone. The HIV prevalence and incidence trends have shown a remarked stability over the last
two years of implementation which indicate that the epidemic is now being monitored sufficiently
and may also be stabilizing at the true prevalence rate in Sierra Leone.. NAS is now recognized as
a competent and transparent lead agency by partners who are continuing to fund it.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

In light of the performance of the implementing agency, NAS, and Government of Sierra Leone
support for project implementation throughout the life of the project, overall borrower



22 ICR team was informed in April 2008 that GOSL disbursed an additional Le 25,000,000 in December
2007 that was not included in the Government's Evaluation report but is included in final CPF figures.


                                                  19

performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Implementing agency performance drastically
improved with the change in management yielding better project results in the later years of
implementation. GOSL also progressively provided more support to the program both financially
and with policy support, particularly by ensuring mechanisms are in place to contribute to a
sustainable, multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS.


6. Lessons Learned

Simple project design matters more in post-conflict settings. Design of an HIV/AIDS
intervention in a post-conflict setting should be greatly simplified to accommodate capacity and
institutional constraints that often exist in such settings. For instance, constraints in terms of
geographic coverage or transportation links in a post-conflict setting are common and can
significantly impede implementation and scope of activities. Consideration should be given to
phasing of community response and engagement in settings with limited in-country capacity.

Insufficient data at project design can significantly hamper targeting of high-risk groups and the
need to improve sentinel surveillance among most at risk populations cannot be overstated.

Transparent fiduciary arrangements contribute significantly towards program success.
Contracting a financial and procurement management agent helps to mitigate the financial risk
exposure of HIV/AIDS projects not only at the national but also decentralized and community
levels, where governance and accountability mechanisms are not well developed and understood.

Bank responsiveness(or lack thereof) to implementation challenges has direct consequences on
development outcomes. The responsiveness of Bank management and Government to project
management challenges can have deleterious effects on project outcomes if not dealt with
appropriately and in a timely fashion.

Successful decentralized service delivery requires strong involvement of traditional structures.
The CCSI component dedicated considerable resources to sensitize traditional leaders but also to
utilize them as peer educators and carriers of key messages on HIV/AIDS. This strategy helped
to reduce stigmatization and foster discussion on the topic.

Sufficient funding, capacity and autonomy for M&E are key for an effective HIV/AIDS response.
About half of the project funding supported decentralized activities via civil society and local
councils; however the project did not allocate adequate funds to monitor these activities and
adjust NAS response to high risk groups to achieve better outcomes.

High level political commitment provides a good platform for ensuring public attention. The
active and vocal support from the President, parliamentarians, and other political officers helped
to raise the visibility and attention given to HIV/AIDS issues in the public domain.

Financial Management

In terms of the project Components, the funding reallocations resulted in a substantially higher
amount of funding for Component 1 (US$5.48 million compared to the original amount of
US$2.70 million), lower funding for Component 2 (US$1.15 million compared to original of
US$2.00 million), increased funding for Component 3 (US$3.60 million compared to original of
US$2.80 million), and reduced funding for Component 4 (US$6.49 million compared to original
of US$7.80 million).

Component 1


Improved Policy and Legal Environment for Responding to HIV/AIDS

Through the SHARP, the following were achieved:

National HIV/AIDS Council (NAC) and the National HIV/AIDS Secretariat (NAS) established
within the Office of the Presidency and charged with the responsibility of overseeing the national
response to HIV/AIDS. The Council created a coordination structure to assure the execution of a
National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Plan of Action.

Dynamic and transformed leadership of government, private sector and civil society was
exhibited in 2007 World AIDS Day activities when the President and entire Cabinet participated
in the mass rally and other state functions were to be relegated. The Mayor of Freetown even
opted to be publicly tested.

A sound financial and procurement system has been utilized by the NAS to monitor the use of
resources for HIV/AIDS from donors such as the World Bank, Global Fund, and UN Agencies.
NAS management revised the 2002 National Policy on HIV/AIDS to incorporate emerging issues
and new thinking of the global community to address HIV/AIDS such as stigma reduction,
treatment, coordination, partnership etc. where the old policy was silent.

The NAS, through the collaboration of the Parliamentary Committee on HIV/AIDS, transformed
the National HIV/AIDS Policy into "The Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS Act of 2007,"
which has contributed to ensuring the active involvement of PLWHAs and other vulnerable
groups in prioritising, planning and implementing policies that go beyond social inclusion. This
is evident in the emergence of national and regional networks of PLWHAs. These groups have
engaged themselves in educating Sierra Leoneans on the dangers of discrimination and social
inclusion and the content of the Act.

    (i)      The National Strategic Plan 2006 ­ 2010, developed and officially launched in
             December 2006 and outlines the major policy and programme intervention areas and
             guides the efforts of the NAS in the coordination of the national response to
             HIV/AIDS. One success attributed to the plan is its success in mobilizing additional
             funding from the Global Fund's Round Six submission;

    (ii)     National Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 2006 -2010, produced in
             collaboration with partners to monitor and track progress of the national response and

             the changing patterns of the epidemic. To make the framework implementable, the
             Country Response Information System (CRIS) for tracking HIV/AIDS
             interventions in the country has been developed and integrated into the health care
             delivery system in all the districts. Twenty-eight (28) indicators covering prevention,
             treatment, care and support and impact mitigation are reported on. This has
             contributed to achieving a harmonized reporting both for national and international
             reporting. The system has also resulted to effective collaboration between the
             National HIV/AIDS Secretariat and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in
             HIV/AIDS data collection. The M&E working group comprising of research
             institutions and relevant stakeholders like the UN Agencies, NGOs and other
             development partners has also been instituted;

    (iii)    National Communication Strategy on HIV/AIDS, which incorporates prevention
             strategy predicated on promoting ABCs of HIV Prevention, decreasing HIV
             transmission from HIV positive mothers to their babies and adoption safe blood
             transfusion practices. The communication strategy was developed to assist partners
             identify appropriate audiences, and select suitable communication channels for
             promoting sustainable behaviour change by harmonization of the HIV/AIDS
             messages put out to the public; and

    (iv)     NAS is in consultation with the BBC World Trust to explore the possibility of
             engaging the organization in strengthening the dissemination of HIV/AIDS
             prevention, care and support messages.

Strengthened Partnership and Collaboration. During SHARP project design, many
consultations were made with various government and development partners and civil
stakeholders on the HIV epidemic. As a result the project benefited and continued to benefit
from the close collaboration of UN agencies, NGOs, CBOs, the private sector, and numerous
people doing research. This level of cooperation has continued throughout project
implementation, albeit with some challenges observed in the initial management phase.
Significant efforts were made to include various recognized national structures such as local
chiefdoms, parliamentary forum, business forums, and district and local councils. This wide
engagement in implementation was expected to balance the rights of individuals affected by HIV
with the needs of the greater population. As recognition of this participation of multiple
stakeholders, the NAS officially established the Sierra Leone Partnership Forum on HIV/AIDS
in December 2006 to provide formal representation and coordination of all stakeholders and
facilitate the coordinating task of the Secretariat, by providing a forum to build consensus, plan
jointly, and share information.

The SHARP also contributed significantly towards formation of National and regional networks
of HIV Faith-Based Organizations to mainstream HIV/AIDS activities into the activities of the
FBOs, and enhance the coordination of HIV/AIDS-related activities among inter-religious
institutions. Similarly, the NAS and SHARP were active in promoting and developing the
network of HIV positive persons (NETHIPS) to empower and protect PLWHAs, help reduce
stigma and discrimination, and allow PLWHAs to participate in decision-making on the national
HIV/AIDS response. NETHIPS was officially formed in December 2006 and continues to be
expanded to include regional representation.

Component 2 - Multi-sectoral Responses to HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care

Improved Workplace Programmes in Key non-health Public Sector Institutions:
Establishment of fifteen (15) HIV/AIDS Focal Point Officers and Management Teams within the
non-health public sector, who prepare and implement the sectoral HIV work plan; mainstream
HIV/AIDS into the Ministry's activities; review monthly and quarterly activities and mobilize
resources for the Ministries' responses      stronger commitment and active support of decision-
makers.

630 public sector employees have been trained as peer educators and engaged in outreach
activities. 8 Ministries were required to meet the SHARP performance indicator, but the project
reached 15 ministries and public agencies. SHARP was able to raise HIV awareness within the
various sectors, such as the development of HIV-relevant curricula to be taught in the primary
and secondary schools, and the formation of a PLWHA support group within the military which
includes soldiers and their dependants.

Accelerating the Education Sector Response to HIV/AIDS

         · Established a `centre of excellence' for training of teachers and those wishing to be
              counselors for HIV/AIDS

         · Developed training manuals for the teaching of HIV/AIDS in the schools.

         · Trained 16 members of the sector HIV management team as TOTs to mainstream
              HIV activities in the sector, who then sensitized 388 employees and 51 Teachers'
              Union Executive Members

         · Management Team trained 127 Peer Educators in schools including Physical and
              Health Education (PHE) teachers who are very active in providing information to
              students on HIV/AIDS and instrumental in establishing school Health Clubs - there
              are 90 schools with well-established health clubs.

         · In Life Skill education on HIV/AIDS and teaching of the revised curricula including
              HIV/AIDS, 127 ToTs have been trained as Facilitators for the training of teachers (at
              least 10 per District) and 30 District Education Officers will monitor the District
              facilitators in cascading the HIV/AIDS training at the district level ­ these facilitators
              trained 1,432 teachers.

         · 120 MOE stakeholders such as PTA members, School Board Governors and
              Management Committees, 30 per region, were given orientation on the HIV/AIDS
              materials developed by the Ministry to appraise them on the learning materials
              developed for the fight against HIV/AIDS in the education sector. The materials
              were funded by the SHARP and other partners such as UNICEF, UNFPA and CARE
              SL and included:
              -   Education Sector Policy on HIV/AIDS
              -   `Sisi Aminata' (Life Skills Manual for Schools)
              -   Teachers' Manual on HIV/AIDS for Basic and Senior Schools to be used as
                  reference material for HIV lesions in primary and secondary schools
              -   My Life! My Choice! My Future! Teachers' Lesson Book for Classes 3, 4, 5, 6

         · In collaboration with MOE and UNFPA, established a 1-year Certificate and a 2-year
              Diploma Programme on Reproductive Health and VCCT.




                                                   24

        · 852 TOTs empowered to cascade HIV/AIDS training to all teachers with UNICEF
            funding

Through collaboration with the United Mine Workers' Union and ILO/AIDS, a national
Workplace Policy on HIV/AIDS for the mining sector and specifically for the Sierra Rutile Mines
were formulated. Miners were identified as a high risk vulnerable group, and with the support of
the SHARP for various HIV interventions, HIV awareness was raised sufficiently to ensure that
the mining unions demanded the inclusion of an HIV/AIDS clause in their collective bargaining
agreements with mining companies (10 mining companies have incorporated this clause).
Technical support was also provided to the Sierra Leone Labour Congress in the training of the
leadership of trade unions in the country on Trade Union Strategies and Action in Combating
HIV/AIDS at the Workplace. The main objective of the training was to sensitize them on the
impact of HIV/AIDS in the workplace, and at the end to help them come up with strategies on
how to deal with HIV/AIDS in their workplaces.

Youths (aged 15-35 years old as classified in the Youth Policy) account for over 60% of all new
HIV infections. Recent VCT uptake statistics indicate that three out of every four young people
infected are young people

Sensitized 180 of the ministry of Youth's personnel and trained 64 young adults (aged 18-28)
peer educators who reached over 6,000 youths with HIV/AIDS education in Freetown and
sensitized more than 10,000 youths during the National Youth Trade Fair and 37,440 condoms
were distributed.

Uniform Services
The Uniform Services referred to are the military and the police, for which there has been
effective collaboration with the US Department of Defense for the military, and UNFPA and
UNAIDS for uniformed personnel.

Component 3. Health Sector Reponse to HIV/AIDS, STI/TB

The Health Sector Component provided leadership in the development of national guidelines and
surveillance systems to describe the evolving epidemic in order to direct and evaluate appropriate
intervention efforts. In the first year of implementation, some priority activities (VCCT and
PMTCT) were initiated on a small scale to evaluate quality, feasibility and sustainability before
large scale-up interventions are considered. Various activities such as antenatal clinic sentinel
surveillance, development of guidelines and manuals, training of health personnel were also
prioritized in the integration of VCCT and PMTCT into the public sector.
The key achievements include:

Establishment of key working groups to develop, validate and disseminate guidelines
         -   Expert HIV Laboratory Working Group
         -   Counseling Working Group
         -   Blood Safety Working Group
         -   Antenatal HIV Surveillance Group
         -   STIs Manual Review Committee
         -   Social Marketing of Condoms Committee
         -   Antiretroviral Therapy Action Group

Collaborative development, validation and dissemination of National Guidelines
         -   National Guidelines for the use of Rapid HIV Tests
         -   Protocol for Evaluating Rapid HIV Tests and Algorithms
         -   Protocol and Training Manual for Antenatal HIV Surveillance
         -   Protocol for HIV Surveillance among the Military, Police, Tuberculosis patients, and
             Commercial Sex Workers
         -   Guidelines, Training Manual, Supervision and Quality Assurance Tools, and
             Brochure for Voluntary Confidential Counseling and Testing
         -   National Guidelines, Training Manual and Implementation Plan for the Prevention of
             Mother to Child Transmission
         -   Manual on the Syndromic Management of STIs
         -   Guidelines and Training Module for Medical Waste Management
         -   Hand Book on HIV/AIDS for Health Workers




                                                     26

The Health Sector Response ensured the availability of HIV rapid test kits to all public hospitals
and some mission Hospitals, with testing now done in all government, private, and faith-based
hospitals. Improvement in the quality of testing has been realized over the past two years.

        · 26 Lab Technicians from all district hospitals trained in HIV rapid tests and syphilis
            testing
        · Trained 30 Laboratory staff in Quality assurance and surveillance methods

Surveillance

The purpose of sentinel surveillance is to track HIV infection levels in the population accessed
through "watch post" institutions. These institutions are generally selected because they provide
access to populations that are either of particular interest, or representative of a larger population.
Antenatal clinics were selected because they are accessible to a cross section of healthy, sexually
active women in the general population.

High percentages of women engage in high risk sex without the use of condom. Early marriage,
polygamy and high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections may also contribute to the high
prevalence among pregnant women.

Voluntary Confidential Counselling and Testing (VCCT)

·    25 Stakeholders, 20 TOTs, and 97 Counselors trained for health facilities.
·    Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) in 2004 led to upsurge in both VCCT and PMTCT uptake

Safe Blood Transfusion

The Health Sector Response continues to strengthen the National Blood Transfusion Services.
SHARP strengthened supervision of blood services by blood banks through provision of
screening test kits, assessment of transfusion services in South and Northern regions and
identified gaps addresses.

· 26 Laboratory Technicians trained in blood screening for HIV and related pathogens
· 40 Community Volunteers trained in Blood Donor Promotion in 3 districts
· 19 Blood Screening Sites established in private and public hospitals in the 3 districts.
· All (100%) of blood and blood products are now adequately screened for HIV, Syphilis, Hep
    B and C before transfusion, with 36,776 safe blood units collected between October 2002 and
    November 2007 (2966 in 2003, 4,876 in 2004, 9,866 in 2005, 11,010 in 2006, and 8,058 by
    11/07)

Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections(STIs)

As laboratory diagnosis of STIs is unavailable in most of the health facilities, there is need for the
use of a clinical algorithm for diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the syndromic approach has been
proposed as a cost efficient method for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections using
WHO recommended algorithms. This means that the MOHS has moved away from the diagnosis
of specific causative agents for STIs to clinical syndromes (group of signs and symptoms).
Treatments of the various STIs are done in the general outpatient and not in specific STI clinics.

·    TOTs conducted for 45 staff in the management of STIs
·    1,471 peripheral health care staff in 9 districts trained and providing STI management
·    Prevalence rates of STIs determined each year rose from 3.9% in 2003, 4.5% in 2004, 5.3%
in 2005, 6.0% in 2006, and 6.2% in 2007

Care and Treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs)

The initial focus was on effective opportunistic management (including prevention, diagnosis,
prophylaxis and treatment), nutritional support and establishment of basic diagnostic monitoring
capacity with CD4 counts.
·     Creation of the Sierra Leone Treatment Action Group (SILTAG) which comprises
      Physicians, Nurses, Counselors, Pharmacists, PLWHA, Socials workers which received
      financial support from CCSI/SHARP
·     Technical workshop to update doctors & nurses on HIV/AIDS treatment & care
·     Provided CD4 machines in the 4 Regional Hospitals and the National Reference Laboratory
·     Trained laboratory staff in the use of CD4 machines
·     Umbrella organization called `Network of HIV Positives (NETHIPS)' established to
      coordinate activities of PLWHA support groups and advocate for their rights
·     Trained 40 PLWHA and Care Givers on home based care; under Global Fund, trained 42
      field staff and 50 community care givers on home based care management
·     Trained 1,408 Health staff on management of OIs in the Regional and District hospitals as
      well as in the PHUs
·     Drugs provided to health facilities for the management of OIs of PLWHAs
·     Trained 30 Physicians, 60 middle level health workers, 46 nurses for HIV clinical
      management and other services
·     81 ART sites established, including public, private and NGO facilities in the districts and
      peripheral health units
·     Cumulatively 2,088 PLWHAs have received ART since 2005

Medical Waste Management

Strengthened the management of medical wastes through the provision of appropriate waste
disposal facilities and training of health care staff:
·     Conducted workshops for 42 Health Workers on Medical Waste Management
·     Trained 1,381 health care staff in medical waste management and injection safety in all
      (13) districts
·     Incinerators constructed in 4 district hospitals
·     8,934,300 condoms have been distributed nationwide through rural distribution network

Community and Civil Society Initiatives (Component 4)

Further, the SHARP was able to mitigate the impact on persons infected or affected by HIV by
ensuring the widespread provision and distribution of over 16 million23 condoms through NGOs,
community organizations and other public sector agencies, contributing to the overall national
condom distribution of more than 21.8 million condoms between 2003 and 2007. The CCSI
component of the SHARP also helped to mitigate the impact on persons affected by HIV by
providing HIV prevention and sensitization activities to youths, women, commercial sex workers,
PLWHAs, ex-combatants, refugees, orphans, and traditional leaders amongst others.
Sub-projects reached over 1.02 million men and women with HIV/AIDS messages; sold 1.14
condoms; trained 39,200 peer educators24, provided life skills training to over 9,500 men and

women in vulnerable groups; provided voluntary testing and counseling for over 47,800 men and
women; reached 1,816 CSWs with prevention messages and trained 880 CSWs in life skills; and
provided educational support to at least 342 orphans25.

Collaborative Partnership with Traditional Leaders - the component entered an agreement
with 149 Paramount Chiefs and 4 tribal heads nationwide to raise awareness among their subjects
which improved the geographic spread of the CCSI responses, by ensuring that the lowest
administrative division of the country was targeted.

Collaborative Partnership with the legislature - approved and funded 109 sub-projects for
Parliamentarians and partnership led to establishment of the Parliamentary Sub-committee on
HIV/AIDS and the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 2006.

Decentralized HIV/AIDS Response using Local Council Structures - implementation
arrangement included the transfer of block grants of US$44,000 to Local Councils to fund CCSI
activities within their jurisdiction, with the 19 Local Councils each expected to fund 13 sub-
projects.

Improved Participation of Community groups in the national response to HIV/AIDS
Improved participation by community groups in the implementation of the SHARP has been
noticed. This has ignited the concern of the people for their total participation in the
implementation of the CCSI project. To address this demand, the CCSI initiated a flexibility
approach towards funding projects. Sub-projects costing less than US $ 5,000 were encouraged.

646 Sub-projects (small - <US$25,000 and large scale>US$25,000) completed implementation
78 Sub-projects (small - <US$25,000 and large scale>US$25,000) still implementing
2 National HIV/AIDS Festivals implemented in the 4 regions and reached over 100,000 people
5 large sub-projects targeting High risk groups
6 RRI initiatives initiated and implemented by CCSI

As at October 2007 a total of 724 sub projects are in the CCSI system

Improved Capacity of CCSI Grantees
·        Over 800 agencies were trained in grant writing techniques
·        Initiated capacity building dialogue with members of the Drivers, Traders, and seamen's
union organizations, traditional healers and secret society leaders in sub-project design and
implementation for these specific vulnerable target groups
·        Trained 19 Local Councils in fiduciary management, proposal review, reporting and
monitoring and evaluation
·        Over 200 chiefs (including the 149 paramount chiefs and other traditional sub chiefs)
trained and sensitized on HIV/AIDS prevention and control at community level.

                                                         F              ANALYSIS

The SHARP was efficient in terms of obtaining high rates of return for some interventions that
were utilized to reach a wide swathe of the Sierra Leonean population at least cost. For instance,
the NAS utilized national music festivals and media to spread HIV awareness and messages
through popular medium. At a total cost of US$140,364 equivalent, the NAS hosted 2 national
HIV/AIDS music festivals reaching over 4,000 people and produced more than 4,000 30-minute
video programmes reaching a broader segment of the population.

Further economic efficiency benefits and the economic rate of return provided by SHARP-
financed activities could also be identified by comparing the longer term benefits of a Sierra
Leone early response to HIV which are difficult to quantify at present but are likely to be more
apparent over time in terms of the number of HIV infections averted during the critical post-
conflict stage where the population was more vulnerable, as well as contributing to reducing the
spread of HIV in that period. Also, the long-term benefits of instituting and screening all blood
samples for HIV during SHARP implementation to avoid HIV transmission through blood
transfusions will be evident by preventing incidence through this mechanism. Provision of
PMTCT services to pregnant women, which helps to limit the number of infants who become
infected by HIV from their mothers, as well as ensuring that those infants that do test positive
receive the care and treatment they require, will continue to contribute to the number of HIV
infections averted in the long term. Therefore, the opportunity cost of providing these preventive
services now compared to the higher numbers of the population that would require ART
treatment in the future without these SHARP interventions is likely to be much higher than Sierra
Leone can afford.

Based on studies that have been done in other African settings and elsewhere which incorporate
the capital and recurrent costs for the interventions, the financial cost for voluntary counseling
and testing could range from US$ 7­28 per person in the population26, while cost for PMTCT
using single-dose nevirapine could average US$11.69 per person targeted, annual cost of ARV
treatment using generic drugs average at US$360 per person, and up to US$4027 for blood
screening per HIV case averted. On the other hand, for these same interventions, it is estimated
that provision of VCT services contributes to HIV cases averted by preventing between 1 and 24
HIV cases, which can be averaged to 10 HIV cases averted for every 100 people tested. Similarly,
single-dose nevirapine for pregnant women results in a cost of US$11.24, blood screening costs
US$3.35, VCT costs US$22.32, and ART using generic drugs costs US$1,317.26 per life year
saved.

Using these estimates, it is possible to calculate the costs for Sierra Leone in terms of providing
the interventions highlighted above, and comparing those costs to the costs per life year saved or
HIV cases averted on the basis of the results achieved by the SHARP to reach a tentative
conclusion on the efficiency of the SHARP project. Using the estimates provided above, the
SHARP project was able to provide VCT services to 191,455 people (in health facilities and
community level sub-projects), screened 36,469 blood samples, PMTCT services to 74,336
pregnant women, and provided ART to 2,088 people. Therefore, using the average costs for these



26These figures are estimates derived by various cost effectiveness studies, which use differing
assumptions for the population between 15-49 years of age, HIV prevalence rate in population, how many
people enroll for VCT, and other factors to determine the average costs using economic modeling.

interventions as shown below, it can be assumed that the overall project expenses would be
approximately US$5,445,880 although some portion of these costs would be duplicative since the
services could be provided to the same persons. This does not include the costs of other HIV
prevention activities such as capacity building, awareness and sensitization raising, and condom
distribution, as well as coordination of the national response which took a large proportion of the
SHARP activities. Given this cost estimate, it is possible to say that the SHARP was efficient in
providing these HIV-specific services using about 30% of the project resources.

$17.5 average VCT cost x 191,455 tests = $3.35 million

$11.69 per PMTCT x 74,336 = $0.87 million

$360 ART x 1,000 (x 2 years for patients initiated on ART in the 1st year of ART provision ­
2006) = $0.72 million
$360 ART x 1,000 (for new patients initiated in 2nd year of ART provision) = $0.36 million

$40 x 3,647 HIV cases averted through blood screening = $145,880

It is also possible to estimate the cost in terms of number of life years saved and actual HIV cases
averted but that would require more specific cost, years lived on ART, and deaths data than was
available to the ICR team.

   ANNEX 8. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR

The Borrower has provided an Implementation Completion Report of its own, and
provided comments on the Bank ICR. The Borrower Implementation Completion Report
will be made available upon request, while the comments on the DRAFT ICR are below:

8.1
(b) Quality of Supervision

Bank's Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
A fair assessment of the Bank from the perspective of the Borrower should be
Moderately Satisfactory. Despite the frequent change of TTLs, each TTL introduced
initiatives that were result-oriented, such as the Rapid Results Initiative under Dr.
Miatudila; and Mr. Zampaglione, whose tireless efforts in turning the project around
during its trying period should be acknowledged. Under his leadership, much was
achieved by the project towards the realization of its development objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Bank's Rating: Moderately satisfactory
Overall Bank's Performance should be rated as Moderately Satisfactory. There is no
doubt about the project's managerial problems, but the blame for the delay in addressing
it should not be equally shared by the Bank and the Borrower. Credit should be given to
the Bank for swift responses by the TTLs to Project requests for release of resources and
re-allocation of the Credit proceeds.

8.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
"Based on ANC data, the prevalence trends show that the HIV prevalence rates have been
rising since 2002, with 2.9% in 2003, 4.1% in 2006, and 4.4% in 2007."

This statement does not give an accurate picture of the situation. We are of the view that
the prevalence (sic should be incidence, not prevalence) rate among pregnant women
based on the information provided has witnessed a decline. The prevalence rate among
pregnant women increased between 2003 and 2006 by 41.4% and between 2006 and
2007, the rate of increase dropped from 41.4% to 7.31%. It is probable that the drop will
continue to be noticed more especially with the expansion of PMTCT services. Data for
the continuing years 2008 and 2009 will provide much information for comparability.
