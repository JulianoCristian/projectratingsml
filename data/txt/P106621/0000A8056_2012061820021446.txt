                         Haiti aims to improve access and learning in basic education and to reach Education For All (EFA) by 2015. In order to achieve this, a greater number of higher quality
                         teachers is needed, among other inputs. This project would support the Government of Haiti (GoH) in the development and implementation of an accelerated teacher
                         preparation program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved the development objective of developing and implementing an accelerated teacher preparation program. A teacher preparation program comprising
                         institution-based training and practice teaching in assigned schools has been established, despite compounded delays notably due to (i) the preparations necessary to establish the
                         new model for accelerated teacher training, (ii) the 2010 earthquake, and (iii) delays in paying student-teacher stipends.

                         With respect to project targets, two cohorts of student-teachers were recruited and are currently practice teaching in classrooms throughout the country. In March 2009, the first
                         cohort of 2,750 student-teachers was enrolled in 18 selected teacher training institutes (Institut de Formation des Maîtres - IFM). Following the earthquake and a reassessment of
                         capacity of participating IFMs, the number of IFMs was reduced to 12. A second cohort of 1,826 student-teachers was recruited in December 2010. Project implementation was
                         marked by intermittent interruptions as a result of the delays in the payment of stipends to student-teachers by the Government. To date, the arrears for student-teacher stipends total

                         about US$2.3 million, corresponding to about 8 months of payments for the first cohort and 7 months for the second cohort. Despite these interruptions, it is expected that the vast
                         majority of the first cohort of student-teachers will be certified in July 2012 and subsequently employed as teachers in the public and non public sectors. It is also expected that the
                         second cohort will complete its first year of practice teaching in July 2012.

                         Initially a third cohort was planned to be recruited in September 2011, corresponding to the school year 2011/2012. Due to the difficulties experienced by the Government of Haiti in
                         releasing stipends for the student-teachers, the MENFP decided to postpone the recruitment of the third cohort to September 2012.

                         More than 40 percent of student-teachers are currently completing their practice teaching in rural areas.

                         Aside from the main activity on training of student-teachers, the project also supported (i) the development of a national curriculum for the accelerated teacher preparation program,
                         and (ii) the reinforcement of the selected IFMs. A first draft of the curriculum has been produced and the project launched the recruitment of a specialized international institution to
                         finalize the curriculum under APG2. For the IFMs, the project financed the rehabilitation of small infrastructure and provided training for teacher educators, as well as teaching-
                         learning equipment and related materials.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured in May 2012 with the following major changes and rationale. (a) The three Project components were modified to: (i) scale down components 1 and 3 to

                         take into account changes in the activities under the two components, including the removal of the activity related to the certification of successful teacher candidates, which will be
                         implemented under the Haiti Education For All Project – Phase II (APG2), and; (ii) reflect that Participation Performance Agreements (PPAs) include support for the participation of
                         student-teachers in teacher training through the provision of stipends. The decision to restructure the activities under the Project was made to facilitate the consolidation of the Haiti
                         education sector portfolio. (b) In view of the sector portfolio consolidation, and by reducing the scope of activities, it is expected that implementation of the Project will be completed
                         earlier than was originally projected. It was proposed in that regard to reduce the Project implementation period by eight months. The Closing Date was, therefore, brought forward
                         from January 15, 2013 to June 30, 2012. (c) The Project outcome indicators were revised. The target values for two outcome indicators were adjusted, and one intermediate outcome
                         indicator was revised in view of the proposed changes to Project activities. (d) A corresponding reallocation of the proceeds of the Grant was also made in line with the adjustments
                         that were introduced to the Project costs on a component basis.

                         Project activities will continue under the Haiti Education For All Project – Phase II (APG2. APG2 will assume financing of the certification of the first cohort of student-teachers, the
                         first year of practice teaching for the second cohort, and the recruitment of the third cohort, as well as the continued development of the teacher training curriculum.
