                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Haiti aims to improve access and learning in basic education and to reach Education For All (EFA) by 2015. In order to achieve this, a greater number of higher
                         quality teachers is needed, among other inputs. This project would support the Government of Haiti (GoH) in the development and implementation of an
                         accelerated teacher preparation program.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In January 2011, the Accelerated Pre-service Teacher Education Program (FIA) accepted 12 IFMs (teacher preparation institutions) responsible for providing training and practice
                         teaching support to student-teachers in the program, for the 2011 academic year. The second academic year of training began, with 1,526 student-teachers from the first cohort
                         starting practice teaching in assigned schools, and a second cohort of 1,826 student-teachers recruited and placed in institution-based training.

                         IFMs have received some material support in the form of equipment and school furniture; in the next few weeks, additional equipment and teaching materials will be distributed to
                         IFMs and student-teachers. In terms of technical and pedagogic support, the IFMs have received financial management reinforcement, and the Project will soon hire an agency to

                         manage a teacher education program for IFM teacher educators.

                         The teacher training curriculum is in the process of being developed, and will continue to be revised based on lessons learned from the first and second cohorts.
