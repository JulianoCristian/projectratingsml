Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Haiti aims to improve access and learning in basic education and to reach Education For All (EFA) by 
2015.  In order to achieve this, a greater number of higher quality teachers is needed, among other inputs.  
This project would support the Government of Haiti (GoH) in the development and implementation of an 
accelerated teacher preparation program.

MEETING TEACHER NEEDS FOR EFA 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1) 
The major changes to the Project and rationale are: 
 
(a) a reduction in the targets for two outcome indicators and one intermediate 
outcome indicator, in light of delays in project implementation due to capacity 
constraints exacerbated by the January 2010 earthquake, and 
 
(b) strengthening of the capacity of the implementing agency, the National 
Ministry of Education and Professional Training (MENFP), and of the Teacher 
Preparation Institutes (IFMs) in order to help ensure that the revised targets can be 
met.  
 
(c) a reallocation of the grant proceeds due to changes in component project costs.   
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
2) 
The Project was approved on April 29, 2008 and became effective on September 
26, 2008.  It supports the MENFP in the development and implementation of an 
accelerated teacher preparation program (FIA - 
Formation Initiale Accélérée
), designed 
to increase the number of high quality teachers and contribute to the achievement of 
Education for All (EFA) by 2015.  Recent high school graduates are selected for a three-
year program consisting of ten months in IFMs and two years of full time practice 
teaching.  New teachers are expected to begin teaching only one year after entering 
teacher preparation (when they begin their practice teaching), as opposed to the current 
three-year lag from institution-based training to classroom teaching in the conventional 
teacher training system.  
 
3) 
Prior to the January 2010 earthquake, the Project suffered from implementation 
delays and quality issues related to inadequate oversight by the implementing agency 
(i.e.: the Department of Training and Professional Development (DFP) of the MENFP)  
and insufficient professional development opportunities provided for teacher educators in 
the IFMs.  With a lag of six months after project effectiveness, eighteen IFMs were pre-
selected based on a survey which covered the amount of classroom space, number and 
qualification of teaching staff, qualifications of administrative and financial management 
staff and soundness of management procedures.  The IFMs enrolled the first cohort of 
student-teachers in March 2009 rather than in September 2008 as originally planned.  
Because the training in IFMs lasts 10 months, the first cohort was, therefore, not expected 
Page  7
7
to graduate before June 2010, a year beyond the initial schedule of the Project.  This 
delay was due to: (a) lower capacity than anticipated at project appraisal of the DFP of 
the MENFP; (b) insufficient planning with respect to the execution of activities; and (c) 
insufficient preparation on the part of some IFMs to receive the new cohort of student-
teachers (teaching staff not recruited and accommodations not available).  In addition, the 
IFM-based training for this first cohort revealed a lower level of proficiency of IFM 
teacher educators than anticipated during project preparation, and unmet professional 
development needs of teacher educators due to insufficient funds. 
 
4) 
The earthquake further reduced physical and human resources capacity both at the 
central and local levels, notably by destroying or damaging four IFMs and causing the 
tragic loss of the Director of the DFP, temporarily halting project activities.  Four 
additional IFMs informed the MENFP of their decision to withdraw from the Project.  
The number of IFMs participating in the Project is, therefore, being reduced to 11 from 
18 (one of the damaged IFMs has set up temporary installations and is likely to be 
prepared to continue offering teacher training through the Project).  There is a possibility 
that new IFMs could be selected towards the beginning of the 2011/12 school year, in 
particular to ensure national coverage of the Project in all 10 regions of Haiti.  If only the 
presently 11 identified IFMs continue to participate, the departments of Nippes and North 
would no longer be covered by the Project.   
 
5) 
Student-teachers in the destroyed/heavily damaged IFMs and in the IFMs that 
dropped out of the Project had to be transferred to the remaining IFMs, causing further 
delays and complications.  Training was interrupted in others IFMs for more than three 
months until April 2010.  As a result, the first cohort of student-teachers
—which was 
originally expected to graduate in June 2009—is now expected to complete the IFM-
based training in December 2010, and would not begin the two-year practice teaching 
before January 2011, three months after the start of the 2010-11 school year.    
 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
Components 
 
6) 
The Project components are: (1) recruitment and selection of teacher candidates; 
(2) accelerated teacher preparation; and (3) improved management of teacher preparation.   
 
7) 
Components 1 has been reduced in scope, and Components 2 and 3 have been 
expanded. 
 
8) 
The reduction in scope of Component 1 stems from a decrease in the number of 
student-teachers to be recruited for training by the Project.  
 
·
The number of student-teachers recruited for the first cohort in March 2009 was 
2,750, as planned. Because of the earthquake, dropouts and student-teachers 
Page  8
8
failing the mid-term exam, it is expected that less than 1,700 will have completed 
the IFM-based training in December 2010 against an initial target of 2,500.   
·
The number of student-teachers to be recruited for the second and third cohorts 
would decrease from 2,750 to 1,800 according to the diminished, post-earthquake 
capacity of the remaining IFMs.  In the event that more IFMs participate than 
presently envisioned, the number of student-teachers that enroll for the third 
cohort might increase slightly.  
 
9) 
The increase in scope of Component 2 stems from the addition to the Project of 
new advisors in each participating IFM.  
 
·
In order to improve the quality of training and supervision of student-teachers in 
IFMs, the Project will increase the grant provided to IFMs so that each IFM 
would recruit a Pedagogic Advisor and a Practice Teaching Advisor starting in 
2011. 
 
10) 
The scope of Component 3, which supports the overall management of the 
Project, has also been revised, albeit only moderately.  Some activities have been added, 
while others have been eliminated. 
 
·
Four technical assistants (TAs) and a project coordinator, responsible for leading 
the implementation of project activities, have been recruited.  The TAs and the 
Project Coordinator, who collaborates closely with the Acting Director of the 
DFP, work under the authority of the Project Technical Unit (PTU) General 
Coordinator.  
·
The Project no longer finances capacity reinforcement of the Human Resources 
Division of the MENFP and Regional Education Offices - DDEs (
Directions 
Départementales de l’Education
), since they have not been directly involved in 
project implementation.   
 
Institutional Arrangements 
 
11) 
Addendums to the Participation Performance Agreement (PPA) signed between 
MENFP and the IFMs will be drawn up each year to set annually a resource envelope 
based on the number of student-teachers recruited.   
 
Financial Management 
 
12) 
The IFMs will prepare simple financial reports to justify the use of the increased 
grant resources.     
 
Results/indicators  
 
13) 
Targets for two of the five outcome indicators have been revised downwards (see 
Annex 1 for the revised Results Framework).  
 
Page  9
9
(a) 
Access. With the reduction in the number of 
participating IFMs, fewer spots would be available for 
student-teachers, and with the delays in 
implementation not all three cohorts would complete 
all three years of the program. The number of 
student-teachers from the first cohort that are 
expected to complete all three years of the program 
(i.e. one year IFM-based training and two years of 
practice teaching) and become certified teachers in 
June 2012 is expected to drop to 900 against an 
initial planned target of 2,500.  Fourteen-hundred 
student-teachers from cohort 2 are expected to 
complete two years of the program (i.e. one year 
IFM-based training and one year of practice 
teaching) against an initial target of 2,500.  Fourteen 
hundred and forty student-teachers from cohort 3 are 
expected to complete one year of the program (i.e. 
one year IFM-based training) against an initial target 
of 2,500. 
 
ƒ
Original indicator
:
2,500 new teachers certified by 
program end (June 2012); 2,500 complete second 
year of practice teaching; and 2,500 additional 
complete first year of practice teaching.   
 
ƒ
Revised indicator
:
900 new teachers certified by 
program end (June 2012); 1,400 complete first 
year of practice teaching; and 1,440 additional 
complete the IFM-based training.  
 
(b) 
Equity.  The target percentage of certified teachers 
teaching in rural areas has been decreased given the 
Page  10
10 
 
new geographic dispersion of the IFMs presently 
identified to continue their participation in the Project. 
 
ƒ
Original indicator
:
At least 70 percent of newly 
certified teachers work in rural areas. 
 
ƒ
Revised indicator
:
At least 40 percent of newly 
certified teachers work in rural areas.  
 
14) 
The target for one of the three intermediate outcome indicators has been revised 
downward to reflect the lower number of student-teachers to be recruited annually under 
the Project, and the expected fewer number of regions covered. 
 
ƒ
Original indicator
:
At least 2,750 qualified candidates selected by the ten 
regional Departments for participation in teacher education. 
 
ƒ
Revised indicator
:
At least 1,800 qualified candidates selected annually 
by at least eight regional Departments for participation in teacher 
education. 
 
Financing 
 
15) Project 
Costs
.
The changes in the project costs are limited as shown in the table 
below.  The costs for Component 1 have been reduced because there will be less student-
teachers recruited in 2011 and 2012 for the second and third cohorts than initially 
planned.  There is a slight increase in the costs of Component 2 for two reasons: (a) the 
savings resulting from enrolling fewer student-teachers in the second and third cohorts 
are offset in large part by an increase since March 2009 to US$325 from US$150 in the 
yearly unit cost of training per student-teacher (the original unit cost had been estimated 
during Project preparation but proved to be insufficient to cover the costs of training); (b) 
an increase in the grant to each IFM to pay for the newly created pedagogic and practice 
teaching advisers; and (c) additional funds allocated to finance the professional 
development of IFM teacher educators. The costs of Component 3 have slightly increased 
due to the recruiting of new staff in the Project Management Unit (a position of 
Coordinator of the Project was created and four technical assistants have been recruited).  
This increase is practically offset by the reduction of activities aimed at building the 
capacity of the Human Resources Division of the MENFP and of the Regional Education 
Offices - DDEs (
Directions Départementales de l’Education
).

16) Reallocation
.
The changes in component project costs require a reallocation of the 
expenditure categories of the grants proceeds.  The unallocated amount equivalent to 5.8 
percent of the grant has been reallocated to the categories two and four.

Implementation schedule 
 
17) 
Although the duration of the Project remains unchanged, the implementation 
schedule has been revised to take into account the many delays in recruiting and training 
student-teachers.  Every new cohort was expected to enroll in September at the beginning 
of the school year and complete either training or practice teaching in June at the end of 
the school year.  With the delays experienced, the first cohort was enrolled in March 
2009 and the next two cohorts will be enrolled in January 2011 and January 2012, which 
is in the middle of the school year.  The same is true for graduation from IFM-based 
training which is planned for December of 2010, 2011 and 2012.  Practice teaching which 
will start in January of 2011 might end in June 2011 if the school year ends effectively in 
June (the school calendar is still unreliable because most schools were closed for four 
months after the earthquake). 
 
APPRAISAL SUMMARY 
 
Economic and financial analysis 
 
18) 
The economic analysis estimates total gains in completed years-of-schooling for 
students taught by additional teachers with improved teaching skills. Among the key 
inputs for the estimate of economic benefits, the number of students taught by new 
teachers trained under the Project would change, reflecting the proposed reduction in the 
number of student-teachers.  
 
The analysis uses the original cost data:

The number of students taught by new teachers each year is calculated as the 
product of student-teachers trained under the project and the average number of students 
per teacher (40):

The estimated gains to educational attainment in year for students taught by new 
teachers are assumed to be unchanged as shown below:

21) 
To calculate the additional lifetime earnings accruing to an individual with an 
extra year of education, we use the same methodology and figures used in the project 
appraisal document:  
 
·
Returns to education: 16.2 percent (World Bank CEM, 2006). 
·
2005
yearly income per ca
pita, taken as a proxy of worker’s earnings: $400. 
·
40
years working life span, beginning at age 15. 
 
22) 
Under these assumptions, the new estimated internal rate-of-return (IRR) for the 
project is estimated to be 19.6 percent, as opposed to the original estimation at 28.3 
percent, and the net present value (NPV) at a rate of return of 15 percent is estimated at 
US$3.3 million, as opposed to the original estimation of US$13 million.  
 
Risk 
 
23) 
Risks identified during implementation that might jeopardize achievement of the 
project development objective are: 
 
Risks  
Risk Rating 
Risk Mitigation Measures 
Political turnover and/or political 
unrest due to the upcoming 
November 2010 elections. 
 
H
The involvement of decentralized structures 
of the GoH means there is support for the 
project at more than just the central level, 
which may help counterbalance political 
opposition. 
 
Page  14
14 
 
Over the long-term, provisional 
tent cities in IFM properties could 
become disruptive to the FIA 
calendar, for example if there is 
social unrest or discontent among 
these populations. This could 
jeopardize outcomes particularly as 
IFMs grow in student population 
(due to relocation of students 
affected by the earthquake and/or 
recruitment of an additional FIA 
cohort). 
 
M
The project is in regular contact with the 
IFMs, who are aware of the general state of 
mind of the camp populations. 
 
Efforts have been made on all IFM sites 
with camps to separate the FIA students 
from the camp residents. 
The PTU may become overloaded 
with the increase in rhythm of 
project activities and with the 
addition of the Haiti Education for 
All Trust Fund to its portfolio, 
resulting in continued 
implementation delays. 
M
Additional staff members have been or will 
be hired since the earthquake to strengthen 
the human resources capacity of the PTU, 
including an additional procurement 
specialist and an administrative assistant 
exclusively for the FIA.
