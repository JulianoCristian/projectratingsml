The major changes to the Project and\n            rationale are as follows: (a) reflect that Participation\n            Performance Agreements (PPAs) include support for the\n            participation of student-teachers in teacher training\n            through the provision of stipends. The decision to\n            restructure the activities under the Project was made to\n            facilitate the consolidation of the Haiti education sector\n            portfolio; (b) in view of the sector portfolio\n            consolidation, and by reducing the scope of activities, it\n            is expected that implementation of the Project will be\n            completed earlier than was originally projected. It is in\n            that regard to reduce the Project implementation period by\n            eight months. The closing date will, therefore, be brought\n            forward from January 15, 2013 to June 30, 2012; (c) the\n            Project outcome indicators will be revised. The target\n            values for two outcome indicators will be adjusted, and one\n            intermediate outcome indicator will be revised in view of\n            changes to project activities; and (d) a corresponding\n            reallocation of the proceeds of the grant will also be made\n            in line with the adjustments that have been introduced to\n            the Project costs on a component basis."}, "docdt": "2012-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
