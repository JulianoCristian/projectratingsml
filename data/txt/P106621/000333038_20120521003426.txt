7. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Haiti aims to improve access and learning in basic education and to reach Education For All (EFA) by
2015. In order to achieve this, a greater number of higher quality teachers is needed, among other inputs.
This Project would support the Government of Haiti (GoH) in the development and implementation of an
accelerated teacher preparation program.

      MEETING TEACHER NEEDS FOR EDUCATION FOR ALL PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


     A. SUMMARY

1)      The major changes to the Project and rationale are as follows:

        (a) the three Project components will be modified to: (i) scale down components 1
        and 3 to take into account changes in the activities under the two components,
        including the removal of the activity related to the certification of successful
        teacher candidates, which will be implemented under the Haiti Education For All
        Project – Phase II (Grant No. H740-0-HT), and; (ii) reflect that PPAs include
        support for the participation of student-teachers in teacher training through the
        provision of stipends. The decision to restructure the activities under the Project
        was made to facilitate the consolidation of the Haiti education sector portfolio.

        (b) in view of the sector portfolio consolidation, and by reducing the scope of
        activities, it is expected that implementation of the Project will be completed
        earlier than was originally projected. It is proposed in that regard to reduce the
        Project implementation period by eight months. The Closing Date will, therefore,
        be brought forward from January 15, 2013 to June 30, 2012.

        (c) the Project outcome indicators will be revised. The target values for two
        outcome indicators will be adjusted, and one intermediate outcome indicator will
        be revised in view of the proposed changes to Project activities.

        (d) a corresponding reallocation of the proceeds of the Grant will also be made in
        line with the adjustments that have been introduced to the Project costs on a
        component basis.


     B. PROJECT STATUS

2)      The Project was approved on April 29, 2008 and became effective on September
26, 2008. It supports the MENFP in the development and implementation of an
accelerated teacher preparation program (FIA - Formation Initiale Accélérée), designed
to increase the number of high quality teachers and contribute to the achievement of
Education for All (EFA) by 2015. Recent high school graduates are selected for a three-
year program consisting of ten months in IFMs (Teacher Preparation Institutes) and two
years of full time practice teaching. New teachers are expected to begin teaching only
one year after entering teacher preparation (when they begin their practice teaching), as
opposed to the current three-year lag from institution-based training to classroom
teaching in the conventional teacher training system.


                                             1
3)      The Project was restructured in October 2010 to (a) reduce the targets for two
outcome indicators and one intermediate outcome indicator, in light of delays in project
implementation due to capacity constraints exacerbated by the January 2010 earthquake;
(b) strengthen the capacity of the MENFP, and of the IFMs to help ensure that revised
targets could be met; and (c) reallocate the grant proceeds due to changes in component
project costs. With the restructuring, 11 IFMs qualified to remain in the training program.
One additional IFM in the North department was subsequently selected for participation.
Although there continues to be no IFM in the Nippes department, in order to maintain
national-level geographic representation of teachers trained by the Project, student-
teachers continue to be recruited from the Nippes department and are placed in the IFMs
of the neighboring South department to undergo the program training.

4)      Following the 2010 restructuring, the Project has experienced delays primarily
caused by late payment by the MENFP of stipends meant to be provided monthly to
student-teachers during the three years of the training program. The GoH paid student-
teacher stipends until October 2010. However, due to an error in budget line allocation, it
began experiencing difficulties in releasing the stipends, which interrupted training of
Cohorts One and Two in addition to delaying the recruitment of Cohort Three. Five
months of stipends were therefore financed by the Project between March 2011 and
March 2012 (US$1.5 million) as a stopgap measure to prevent further disruptions in
training activities. However, the GoH continued to experience difficulties in releasing
the budget, which has resulted in accumulated arrears of US$2.6 million as of March
2012—equivalent to 9 months of stipends for Cohort 1 and 8 months for Cohort 2—and
which prompted the decision to prioritize the payment of stipends by the Project. It is
expected that the Project will finance about three months (about US$900,000) of
additional arrears by closing, to be financed from the undisbursed amount of the Project
grant (about US$420,000) and from amounts already disbursed into the Designated
Account but not yet disbursed in the country. The remaining balance of accumulated
arrears is expected to be paid under APG 2, until the MENFP is able to release the
necessary budget.

5)      In December 2010, 1,542 student-teachers from the first cohort satisfactorily
completed institution-based training, and subsequently began practice teaching in
February 2011, one month late due to student-teacher protests linked to the continued
delays in the payment of stipends. In addition to stipend-related delays, continued delays
dating from the launch of the Project caused the FIA training calendar to become
misaligned with the primary school calendar. As a result, the practice teaching training
calendar was compressed into fewer months, and 1,528 student-teachers from the first
cohort completed the first year of practice teaching in July 2011 and began their second
year of practice teaching in October 2011. It is expected that this cohort will complete
practice teaching in July 2012, under APG 2; certification of this cohort is also expected
to be financed under APG 2.

6)      In December 2010, an additional 1,826 individuals were recruited into the second
cohort, using a more stringent and targeted process than was followed for the first cohort
of student-teachers. One-thousand five hundred and twenty six individuals from this
cohort completed institution-based training in December 2011 and began the first year of
practice teaching in February 2012. It is expected that this cohort will complete the first

                                            2
year of practice teaching in July 2012, under APG 2. This second cohort also
experienced a period of disruption in training due to protests on the late payment of their
stipends, and must also follow the compressed practice teaching calendar. However, the
student-teachers of the second cohort have benefited from an improved management of
IFMs, as several of the measures envisaged in the 2010 restructuring have been put in
place, namely the recruitment of Pedagogic Advisors and Practice Teaching Advisors.
IFM directors and financial directors also received financial and management training as
well as increased support and supervision from the Project technical assistants, which has
led to greater comprehension and compliance by IFMs of the terms of the PPA.

7)      The Cohort Three recruitment process, which was expected to begin in the fall of
2011, was also delayed due to the unavailability of the GoH budget for student-teacher
stipends. A decision was thus made to postpone the recruitment of Cohort Three, thereby
providing additional time for the GoH to release the budget needed for the stipends.
Financing for Cohort Three has therefore been absorbed into APG 2; it is expected this
cohort will be recruited and will complete both years of practice teaching under APG 2.
With this cohort, the non alignment of the FIA and primary school calendars will be
rectified, as it is expected that Cohort Three candidates will be recruited in order to
complete institution-based training from September 2012 to July 2013, allowing those
student-teachers to obtain a full academic year of practice teaching beginning in
September 2013.

8)      With respect to the training content, a draft teacher training curriculum has been
completed and distributed to IFMs, with teacher educators trained accordingly. However,
the Project team will continue to make improvements to this curriculum, including
reinforcing the quality of existing training modules and creating additional training
modules not initially planned but subsequently requested by the MENFP. These
reinforcement activities will be financed under APG2.


  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Components

9)       The Project components are: (1) Recruitment and Selection of Teacher
Candidates; (2) Accelerated Teacher Preparation; and (3) Strengthening the Management
of the Accelerated Teacher Training Program (ATTP). Component 1 and Component 3
activities will decrease in scope since many activities will be implemented under APG 2,
while Component 2 increases in scope to facilitate the financing of the student-teacher
stipends.

10)    The expected activities financed by Component 1 are reduced in scope, as the
third cohort to enter teacher training will be recruited and selected under APG 2
financing.

11)     Component 2 activities increase in scope despite the fact that Cohort One will be
certified and Cohort Two will complete the second year of practice teaching under APG
2. This increase stems in part from the addition of one IFM to the Project, increasing the

                                            3
total number of block grants disbursed to IFMs. In addition, the Project has increased the
amount of the grant provided to IFMs—and the PPAs signed between the MENFP and
IFMs have been amended accordingly—so that IFMs directly pay the student-teacher
stipends which were previously paid by the GoH.

12)      Component 3, which supports the overall management of the Project, will
decrease in scope due to the shortened Project execution period. Although the
institutional arrangement and support activities planned for the management of teacher
preparation will remain the same, operational costs will be significantly lower than
initially allocated due to the early Project closing.

Results/indicators

13)    PDO-level outcome indicators. Following the 2010 restructuring, there were five
outcome indicators: two measuring access and one each measuring quality, equity, and
governance, respectively. The total number of outcome indicators remains unchanged.
However, the two access outcome indicators require adjustments in their target values
(see Annex 1 for the revised Results Framework):

       (a) Indicator One, Access. Since Cohort Three will no longer be recruited under
           the Project, the indicator end targets measuring the number of student-teachers
           from Cohort Three (1,440) expected to complete the institution-based training
           is no longer applicable. Targets for the number of certified teachers remain
           the same since 900 of the 1,528 student teachers from Cohort 1 that finished
           the first year of practice teaching are expected to finish the second year of
           practice teaching and become certified, and 1,440 of the 1,526 student
           teachers from Cohort 2 that finished the institution based training are expected
           to complete the first year of practice teaching. The revised targets are
           expected to be met in July 2012.

              Original target values: 900 new teachers certified by program end; 1,400
               complete first year of practice teaching; and 1,440 additional complete the
               institution-based training.

              Revised target values: 900 new teachers certified by program end and
               1,400 additional complete the first year of practice teaching.

       (b) Indicator Two, Access. Due to the current political crisis, it is unclear whether
           the nomination and appointment of public sector teachers will be possible by
           the start of the 2012/13 school year in September 2012. The target value for
           certified candidates employed as teachers has therefore been reduced, taking
           into account that some public sector teachers are hired on a contractual basis,
           but that most are appointed by the MENFP. The revised targets are expected
           to be met by end of September 2012.

              Original target values: Access. Of those certified at least 80% are
               employed as teachers; at least 50% of those are employed in the public
               sector.

                                             4
               Revised target values: Access. Of those certified at least 80% are
                employed as teachers; at least 10% of those are employed in the public
                sector.

14)    Intermediate Outcome Indicators. One intermediate outcome indicator has been
revised to account for the reduced number of cohorts to be financed by the Project:

               Original indicator: At least 1,800 qualified candidates selected annually by
                at least eight regional Departments for participation in teacher education.

               Revised indicator: At least two cohorts recruited with at least 1,800
                qualified candidates selected for each cohort by at least eight regional
                Departments for participation in teacher education.

Financing

15)     Project Costs. The changes in the Project costs are shown in the table below.
There is a reduction in costs for Component 1 due to the absorption of Cohort 3
recruitment into APG 2. Component 2 costs will increase significantly for two reasons:
(a) the increase in the total number of block grants disbursed to IFMs due to the addition
of one IFM since the 2010 restructuring; and (b) the inclusion of student-teacher stipends
in the grants provided to IFMs in order to allow the Project to pay the stipends. Finally,
Component 3 costs will decrease, as the shortened Project execution period will entail
lower operating costs.

       The change in Total Project Costs from US$5.78 million to US$5.86 million since the 2010 restructuring
     results from an increase in the value of the US dollar in comparison to the SDR. The exchange rate used
     for the revised calculations, as established on April 12, 2012, is 1 SDR = 1.542420 US$.

Closing date & implementation schedule

17)      The Project closing date will change from January 15, 2013 to June 30, 2012, and
the implementation schedule has been revised accordingly. The reduced implementation
period means that no student-teachers will be certified by Project closing. Rather, Cohort
One will complete the first year of practice teaching and begin the second year of practice
teaching and Cohort Two will complete the institution-based training. The final months
of practice teaching and certification of Cohort One, the first year of practice teaching for
Cohort Two, and the recruitment and institution-based training of Cohort Three—
activities initially planned under the current Project—will be financed by APG 2.


   D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

Economic and financial analysis

18)    The economic analysis estimates total gains in completed years-of-schooling for
students taught by additional teachers with improved teaching skills. Among the key
inputs for the estimate of economic benefits, the number of students taught by new
teachers trained under the Project would change, reflecting the proposed reduction in the
number of student-teachers.

The analysis uses the original cost data:

19)     The number of students taught by new teachers each year is calculated as the
product of student-teachers trained under the Project and the average number of students
per teacher (40):

20)    The estimated gains to educational attainment in years for students taught by new
teachers are assumed to be unchanged as shown below:



                                                                 7
IV. Estimated Gains to Education Attainment in Year for Students Taught by New Teachers
                                                     Additional Years
Addional teachers in classroom                                    0.23
Teachers with imrproved teaching skills                           0.15
Total Gains to Education Attainment                               0.38


21)    To calculate the additional lifetime earnings accruing to an individual with an
extra year of education, we use the same methodology and figures used in the Project
appraisal document:

       Returns to education: 16.2 percent (World Bank CEM, 2006).
       2005 yearly income per capita, taken as a proxy of worker’s earnings: $400.
       40 years working life span, beginning at age 15.

22)     Under these assumptions, the new estimated internal rate-of-return (IRR) for the
Project is estimated to be 17.4 percent, as opposed to the revised estimation as of the
2010 restructuring, which was 19.6 percent. In addition, the net present value (NPV) at a
rate of return of 15 percent is estimated at US$1.5 million, as opposed to the 2010 revised
estimation of US$3.3 million.

Risk

23)     Risks identified during implementation that might jeopardize achievement of the
Project development objective are:

Risks                                 Risk Rating Risk Mitigation Measures
Continued political turnover and/or       H        The involvement of decentralized structures
political unrest due to the recent                 of the GoH means there is support for the
political transition.                              Project at more than just the central level,
                                                   which may help counterbalance political

The PTU may become overloaded             M        The implementation of some of the Project
with the increase in rhythm of                     activities has been postponed to the Phase 2
Project activities and due to the                  of EFA, to focus the current Project on a
execution of the second Phase of                   few key priorities.
the Education For All Project—
which is expected to become
effective in February 2012—
resulting in continued
implementation delays.
