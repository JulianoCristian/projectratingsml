"Ratings for the Meeting Teacher Needs\n            for Education for All Project for Haiti were as follows:\n            overall outcome was moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, and both the Bank and\n            the borrower performance were moderately satisfactory. Some\n            important project lessons learned were: (1) Accelerated\n            teacher training is an effective approach in the Haitian\n            context in which there is an undersupply of qualified\n            teachers. One important advantage of the program was that\n            student teachers were actively educating primary students\n            after only one year of pedagogical training. (2) If there is\n            a stipend for student-teachers, it is critical to ensure at\n            the outset that that stipend can and will be paid. The Bank\n            and the recipient need to ensure that the institutions with\n            decision-making power regarding the stipend are on-board\n            with its timely payment. Failure to regularly disburse the\n            stipend can demoralize and disillusion the student teachers\n            and jeopardize the program. (3) A progressive implementation\n            of stipends may provide a solution to fiscal constraints and\n            to retention of student-teachers. (4) Implementation of a\n            teacher training program should be coordinated with the\n            academic year to ensure greater efficiency and less\n            disruption to the training institutes. The teacher training\n            program began its first cohort in March of 2009 which\n            misaligned graduation of student-teachers with the beginning\n            of the next school year. This meant that graduates would be\n            released from the program with a long hiatus. It also was\n            disruptive to the Teacher Preparation Institutes who had\n            ongoing programs and had to suddenly accommodate the influx\n            of new students."}, "docdt": "2012-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
