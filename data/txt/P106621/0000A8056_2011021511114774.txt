                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Haiti aims to improve access and learning in basic education and to reach Education For All (EFA) by 2015. In order to achieve this, a greater number of higher
                         quality teachers is needed, among other inputs. This project would support the Government of Haiti (GoH) in the development and implementation of an
                         accelerated teacher preparation program.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         2011. A second cohort of 1800 students was selected in December 2010 to begin training. Course work will begin in early February 2011 in selected Teacher Preparation Institutes
                         (IFM). The small rehabilitation program to improve working conditions in the selected IFMs was completed in December 2010. IFMs will also receive some equipment and pedagogic

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured in October 2010 due to delays in project implementation due to capacity constraints exacerbated after the earthquake in January 2010. The changes
                         include: (i) a reduction in the targets for two outcome indicators and one intermediate outcome indicator, in light of project implementation delays and (ii) an increased support for
                         strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and IFMs to ensure that the revised targets can be met; and, (iii) a reallocation of the Grant proceeds due to changes in
                         component project costs.
