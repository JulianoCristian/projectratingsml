                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Haiti aims to improve access and learning in basic education and to reach Education For All (EFA) by 2015. In order to achieve this, a greater number of higher
                         quality teachers is needed, among other inputs. This project would support the Government of Haiti (GoH) in the development and implementation of an
                         accelerated teacher preparation program.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         For the second academic year of training (2011), the Project is financing 1,526 student-teachers from the first cohort for the first year of practice teaching in assigned schools and
                         1,773 student-teachers of the second cohort who passed the final test to enroll in institution-based training.

                         During the political transition period, Project implementation slowed down and therefore the delivery of materials and equipments to the 12 participating IFMs (teacher preparation

                         Arrears on the payment of the stipends to student-teachers by the Government have continued to accumulate over the past months despite the decision to use the Project funds to
                         finance up to three months of payments in March 2011. This situation has provoked intermittent interruptions of the training activities, resulting in a longer academic year than

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Education for All Project Phase 2 Project that will be considered by the Board of Executive Directors on December 1, 2011 would assume financing of additional cohorts. A
                         Project restructuring is being considered that would ease the transition of financing from this stand-alone Project to that project.

                         To improve the process for the development of the training curriculum, the Project will (i) recruit a specialized international institution to provide technical assistance in finalizing the
                         teacher training curriculum, and (ii) review the procedures and institutional arrangements for its validation.
