                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bhutan Education Development Project is expected to achieve its development objectives by project closure on June 30, 2011. Theproject will have exceeded its target for
                         increasing the number of student places at the middle and higher secondary levels of education, improved education quality and strengthened institutional functioning. Of the 28
                         schools to be built under the project, four are still under construction and are expected to be completed in advance of the start of the next academic year in February 2011. Most
                         activities under Component 2 for improving education quality have been completed. However, the resource centers established under the project have not seen their potential
                         maximized owning primarily to insufficient budget for their functioning. Due to cost escalations during the project's implementation period and the construction of additional classroom
                         blocks at several sites, the project has a financing shortfall of approximately US$3.0m. The Royal Government has given its assurances that any shortfall will be met in order to

                         financing. A lack of budgetary allocation to RCs has resulted in the cessassation of a number of activities, including the conducting of annual workshops for RC coordinators. An

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Owing to a 200 percent increase in the estimated cost of construction and a shortfall of financing for the large school building program, the MOE Secretariat building will not be
                         constructed under EDP. Resource centers require on-going budget allocation at the dzongkhag level to maximize their potential and allow them to function as envisioned under the
                         project. The next full project implementation support mission is tentatively scheduled for December 2010, after which the ISR will be updated.
