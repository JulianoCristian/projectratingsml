                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bhutan Education Development Project (EDP) is expected to achieve its development objectives for increasing access to middle and higher secondary education, improving
                         teaching-learning at all levels, and strengthening human resources and institutional capacities in the Ministry of Education (MOE). The seven-year project will close on June 30, 2011.
                         As the third IDA-financed education project in Bhutan, following on earlier operations supporting primary and junior secondary education, EDP has helped ensure that the annually
                         increasing number of students moving to the middle and higher secondary levels have adequate school facilities. The project has financed 28 new schools across the country, many
                         in remote locations. This is seen as important for stemming an increasing tide of urban drift, particularly among youth. The secondary gross enrollment rate has increased from 48 to
                         75 percent and from 18 to 45 percent at the middle and higher levels , respectively, during the project period.

                         To raise Bhutan#s level of technology and connectivity, the project has provided computers in all 63 of the country's middle and higher secondary schools for the teaching of basic
                         computer skills from grade 9. Focusing on the key subjects of English and Mathematics as foundations for future learning at advanced levels, the project has financed a reformed

                         Mathematics curriculum from the primary to higher secondary level. EDP has supported significant institutional development within the Ministry of Education (MOE) through 12 of
                         long-term fellowships (Masters degrees) and over 80 shorter-term training programs outside Bhutan. This has brought both enhanced knowledge of education policy and planning, as
                         well as valuable exposure to good teaching-learning elsewhere. EDP also helped lay the foundations for the young Royal University of Bhutan (RUB) through financing its secretariat
                         building and technical inputs for its medium- to long-term strategic plan.
                         IDA financing to the education sector in Bhutan, which is not continuing with under the new Country Program (2011-14), including EDP, has been instrumental in helping Bhutan
                         achieve all EFA and education-related MDG goals, with the exception of gender parity at the tertiary level. As the largest single IDA investment ever in Bhutan, EDP underscores the
                         high priority placed by successive Royal Governments on education system development in Bhutan.
                         Bhutan benefits from a well organized, planned and managed education sector, and skillfully coordinates the use of external resources toward achieving its sector goals. The World
                         Bank#s engagement in the education sector in Bhutan over nearly three decades, and more recently under EDP, has helped build those competencies, skills, knowledge and results.
