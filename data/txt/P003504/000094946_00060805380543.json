In the case of acquisition of sub-urban\n            vegetable plots, State regulations require payment from the\n            project unit. Compensation fees for cultivated land should\n            be based on an estimated annual production value, per an\n            average three year period, prior to acquisition, and,\n            resettlement grants should at least, maintain the living\n            standards of the affected population. Likewise, affected\n            collective units must use land compensation, and\n            resettlement grants to develop production, and/or create\n            jobs, for vulnerable groups. The county land administration\n            department, in coordination with the project owner and the\n            affected populations, should engage in an effort to provide\n            labor, through agricultural production, and township\n            enterprise development, under strict land control for\n            township construction. In consultation with the affected\n            population, the following are avenues of participation in\n            the resettlement process: 1) selection of specific\n            residential sites for housing locations; 2) choice for\n            affected people to either build their own houses, or select\n            government built houses; 3) ability to elect employment\n            opportunities; and, 4) grievance mechanisms will be\n            available, during resettlement implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
