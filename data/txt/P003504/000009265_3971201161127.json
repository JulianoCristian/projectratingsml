During the planning and design stage,\n            potentially negative environmental impacts include:\n            reduction of flood discharge ability; removal and\n            resettlement of residents in the right of way; loss of land\n            resources; and the erosion of roadbed soil caused by\n            wastewater from ditches. These will be mitigated\n            respectively by rationally selecting alignment; executing a\n            reasonable resettlement plan providing suitable\n            compensation; restricting the amount of farmland acquired;\n            increasing the number of waterspouts, and avoiding the\n            waterfall effect by adjusting their positions; and paving\n            road surfaces with stone or concrete. During the\n            construction stage, potential impacts anticipated are: 1)\n            increased river residue caused by litter and erosion in the\n            construction site and in the new road; 2) air, water, and\n            soil pollution caused by oil, gas, fuel, or paint in\n            equipment, asphalt-mixing or cement-mixing stations; 3) dust\n            and noise pollution around construction sites; 4) bad\n            drainage conditions; and 5) mosquito-breeding conditions,\n            such as that caused by still water ponds. These impacts will\n            be alleviated by: 1) covering and protecting topsoil with\n            green plants; 2) collecting and recycling lubricants to\n            avoid spillage and leakage; 3) installing equipment to\n            control air pollution, and removing asphalt-mixing equipment\n            to safe distances from inhabited areas on the leeward side;\n            4) regularly spraying the temporary road with water, and\n            installing and setting up sound barriers; 5) building\n            suitable toilet facilities; and 6) taking measures to reduce\n            mosquito-breeding environments. During the operational\n            stage: 1) air pollution will be further reduced by\n            controlling vehicle emissions; 2) water pollution caused by\n            road runoff into irrigation systems and water sources will\n            be avoided; 3) litter processing equipment and appropriate\n            legislation will inhibit/prohibit littering; 4) injuries and\n            deaths caused by toxic spills and leakages produced by\n            transport will be headed off by planning and managing a\n            program to reduce such accidents."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
