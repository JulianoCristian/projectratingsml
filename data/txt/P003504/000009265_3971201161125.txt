III ENVIRONMEATTL PROTECTION PERFORMANCES
3.1. DESIGNING PERIOD
1. REASONABLE SELECTION OF ROUTE LINE: In the selection of the program of
the project route, at the same time of pursuing reasonable alignment and low cost, sufficient
consideration of the various enviromnental factors such as the occupation of the cultivable
field and the farm lands, the protection of the residential areas, the development design of
the towns and cities, the removal amount, of the source of the construction materials and the
selection of the material source should be taken. In the mean while, opinions of the local
authorities along the route should be widely and comprehensively collected. Large portion ol
the six connecting lines are to be expanded on the basis of the original existing roads. Silnce
there is a large population but small amount of field in this area, occupation of land should bC
reduced as much as possible and the direction of the original existing roads and the original
occupied land should be best utilized so as to reduce the removal amount and the occupation
of good fields to the minimum. The principle that the route should be "close to the towns but
does not go through the towns" should be sufficiently taken into consideration and the
densely populated residential areas should avoided.
2. Air-borne Dust Pollution to the Atmosuhere:  At the designing of the moad.
consideration should be taken of the selection of quarry, borrow and deposit area, treatment
of waste substances, and the selection of the sites of lime soil and asphalt mixing plants
which may be likely to bring adverse effect on the sensitive environmental spots and the
aforesaid sites and stations should be positioned in distance from the residential areas.
3. Flood-proof: The main line of this Project is in a north-south direction and its flood-
proof and flood-drainage capacity has been sufficiently considered in the Design Report. The
connecting lines works are all in the direction of east-west and in terms of topography it is
high on the west side while low in the east. Therefore, there exists no problem of flood-prooi
and flood-drainage with these connecting lines which naturally have the function of leadinU
the water flow and draining the flood.
3.2. Construction Period
1. Noise Pollution: Noise in the construction period of the road mainly comes from the
construction plant and the transportation vehicles, which, if strongly affect the human bodv
for a long duration, might introduce many kinds of diseases and result in deafening due to
noise effect. Such deafening is related to the variation of the degrees of the noises as well as
the time of being exposed to the noises. In order to protect the health of the construction
workers, in accordance with the "Hygienic Standard for Industrial Enterprises Noises", tlhe
workers should be reasonably arranged for shifts of the pperation of the construction plant
so as to reduce to the time of being exposed to noises or to arrange the alternative
operations of high noise and low noise. At the same time, attention should be paid to the
maintenance and correct operation of the machinery so as to .keep the noise degree of the
7



construction plant to its minimum. Workers who are close to the noise source should be
provided with labour protection measures such as the earplugs or helmets and, in addition.
be permitted to enjoy shortened work time.
Since the human bodies are very sensitive to the noise, in order to guarantee the night rest of
the residents around the construction sites, the construction plants of high noises located in
the sites which is within the distance of 150 meters from the residential area should be
stopped operating from 22:00 p.m. to 6:00 am during the night time.
Noises of the road construction plant has the characteristic of suddenness, irregularity,
discontinuity, and high strength, and investigations show that sometimes the noise of the
construction site exceeds the Grade IV noise standard which normally is alleviated by
variations of the construction methods. For instance, operations which have powerful noise
sources may be arranged in day time (6:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.) or the operation time of the
various kind of equipment may be adjusted. Transportation of materials, knocking, human
screaming are regarded as the noise sources of the construction activities which the
contractors should alleviate through proper construction and strorng administration.
2. Air Pollution: Pollution to the atmosphere during the construction period is mainly that
by the dust which mainly results from dust emission from continuous operations such as lime
soil mixing, construction vehicles and construction equipment. In addition, small amount of
powder dust also arises in the course of loading and unloading of the road construction
materials and at the asphalt concrete mixing plant. In order to degrade the air pollution at the
construction site and to protect the health of the construction staff and the adjacent residents,
the following measures should be carried out:
(1) The mixing plant should have proper sealing facilities and the mixing stations should have
Grade II Dust Removal Accessories. There should be no villages or sensitive units within an
area of 200 meters in the downward wind direction.The access roads are selected at the
places I OOmeters from the inhaditant sensitive points.
(2) The site roads must be sprayed with water, especially the sites and the entrance and exit
roads of the lime soil mixing plant, asphalt concrete mixing plant. Water trucks must be
provided.
(3) Sealing facilities must be adopted in the course of transportation and covering measures
must be taken in long duration constructions.
(4) The contractor must strengthen his control over the materials which are easy to scatter
and lose and these kinds of materials must not be stocked in an exposed way. The top
cultivable soil removed from the borrow pits is required to be stockpiled in a concentrated
way and after the works is completed shall be backfield and returned for cultivation.
Hygienic administration must be strengthened and waste substances must be deposited in a
concentratea area for further treatment.
8



(5) Aggregates required for the w,orks are mainly purchased and the lcal authorities have
special administration systems responsible for the installation and management of the quarry.
In particular, strict regulations on the location of the quarry and the explosion materials are
available. Therefore, exploration and obtaining of the road construction materials for This
Project do not have strong impact on the enviromnent.
3. Biological Resources Protection
During the construction period of this Project, cultivable lands shall be excluded from the
selection for borrow areas as much as possible and, if as shown necessary for the need of the
works, the (30 cm) top soil shall be maintained and be-backfield upon the completion of the
works so as to reduce the affect on the biolo-gical system and the agriculture to the minimum.
The contractor should take measures to shorten the occupation time of the temporarY land
and restore the vegetation or return the land for cultivation as soon as the works finishes.
Education of the workers should be strengthened with regard to the protection of natural
resources and no cutting of trees and fruit trees is permitted.
The construction vehicles should travel on the fixed transportation roads to avoid the
damage to the farmiing land and the vegetation.
Grass and trees should be planted in time on both sides of the roads and on the side slopes
and appropriate remedial or reconstruction of the damaged irrigation or drainage svstem or
manual ponds should be managed in time. The contractor should frequently clean and pay
attention to the smooth flow of the drainage system. Road construction materials are
required to be stocked in a concentrated manner and be fenced with soil. The stocking
locations must be far away from the water area to prevent the material from being washed
into and affecting the water body.
3.3. Service Period
1. Control of Traffic Noises
(1) administration of the public security communication, highway transportation and road
maintenance should be strengthened and vehicles in excess of the standards should be
forbidden to travel on the roads in accordance with the "Regulations on Prevention and
Resolution on the Noise Pollution to Environment of the People's Republic of China".
(2) Based on the evaluation results concluded in the Connecting Lines Works Environmental
Affect Evaluation Report, the sound environment of most of the sensitive spots on both
sides of the connecting lines complies with the evaluation standard as of that "on both sides
of trunk roads". It is not necessary to take noise reducing and sound separation measures.
9



Considering that the predicted traffic amount might change and partial adjustment was made
to the route line in the design drawing, it is necessary to strengthen the noise monitoring
during the service period. Feasible environmental protection measures should be taken to the
sensitive spots depending on the monitoring results. Landscaping or partial noise reducing
measures should be taken to the individual sensitive spots which have exceeded the standard.
2. Control over the Pollution of the Tail Gas of the Vehicles
In accordance with the preliminary testing result, the CO pollution on both sides of the
connecting roads is very slight and the Grade II standards can be met at locations 10 meters
away from the road side. The pollution of NOx is also relatively klight. Under Type D stabilitv,
only individual points possibly have higher density of NOx at locations 10 meters away from
the road side, but do not exceed the standard. Therefore, the atmosphere pollution in the
service period has very small effect on each of the sensitive spots. Through prediction and
evaluation on the atmosphere pollution on the connecting lines, it is noted that the
atmosphere pollution on the connecting lines has very small impact on each of the sensitive
spots. Thus it is unnecessary io take any environmental measures. Some individual sensitive
spots shall be monitored.
3. Maintenance of the Drainage System
The drainage system in the service period may suffer depositing or blocking because of the
rain scour to the side slope of the subgrade or the washing of the road dust or sand and thus
needs regular cleaning treatment, especially to the side ditch along the whole route so as to
assure smooth and free drainage system.
The drainage outlets and the side ditches should be paved with mortar masonry stone to
avoid scouring which in turn shall result in the effect of small water falls. Administration
over the vehicles transporting easily scattered and loose materials.
4. Through methods of propaganda or formulation of regulations, the passengers shall be
prohibited from random casting rubbish such as drinks sacks, easy-to-open cans etc. so as to
keep clean on both sides of the road.
5. Bulk materials transported through highways such as coal, cement, sand and aggregates
or simple-packing chemical fertilizers or agrochemical tend to scatter around without well
protection measures and the canned materials are also likely to leak to thus pollute the
environment on the road and on both sides of the road. Therefore, inspection over the
transportation vehicles coming through the entrance of the expressways must be
strengthened and this problem shall be resolved with the assistance of the legislation of
highway communication administration laws.

H7. Environmental Mlonitoring Plan
The purpose of formulating the environmental monitoring plan is to supervise the execurion
of each of the environmental protection measures, to promptly adjust the EAP according to
the monitoring results so as to provide records of the execution time and execution
procedure of the environmental protection. The main principle of the formulation is mainly in
the areas where the environment is affected and the key points are the sensitive spots.
6.1. Monitoring Target and Monitoring Items
(i) Durinng the construction period, the environment is mainly affected by dust andi the
noise of the construction equipment and the smoke and dust produced in the heatinn and
refinery of the bitumen. Therefore, it is required that open type should be chafiged into close
type construction and conforming asphalt mixing plant be equipped so as to reduce the
damage from the pollution.
1. It is predicted that all the construction sites ghall be able to meet the limit on noise of the
construction site.
2. If the road dust emission affects more than 100 meters in the downward wind direcTioll.
water should be frequently sprayed to cut down the dust emission amount. In addition0-.
"Passive Dust Collector" should be used to monitor the dust emission amount and in order
to control the efficiency of the water spraying numbers of water spraying should be
determined. Special monitor should be performed to the unpaved road (construction access
road and roads under construction) which raises dust easily.
3. In addition to the requirement that the contractor must take restriction measures to the
transportation which may result in dust emission and that of leaky materials, monitorine over
the environment should be well performed and the environmental laws must be stnctlN
carried out by the contractor who should keep touch with the District and County levei
environmental protection units.
4. The main substances in the asphalt mixing plant which pollute the atmosphere are dust.and
the bitumen smoke. Normally at locations 100 meters in the downward direction of the wind
the bitumen smoke cam meet the Grade I standard (i.e. the p,ermitted average densitv of
emission within 8 hours is < 150 mg /NMv), the BAP can meet the reference standard of
Beijing District (standard limit: 1.0 ug / 100 in) and TSP can meet the Grade 11 standard of
the national atmosphere environmental quality.
According to the expected environmental affect analysis and the evaluation results, the items
to be monitored during the construction period are determined as TSP, bitumen smoke, BAP
and noise.
(ii) During the service period the main affects on environment are made bv the tail -,as ot
IS



vehicles and the traffic noise. According to the expected environmental affect analvsis ana
the evaluation results, the items to be monitored during the service period are determined as
NO,, CO, and noise.
6.2. Environment Monitoring Plan
The Environment Monitorinnt Plan is detailed in Table No. 6 and the standards for noise shall
refer to the Urban Area Environment Noise Standard as detailed in Table No. 4 th.. the
standards set for both sides of the trunk roads shall be adopted. The standard for atmosphere
shall take the Grade II standard set out in the Atmosphere Environment Quality Standards as
detailed in Table No. 5.
