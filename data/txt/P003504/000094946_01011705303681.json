Key lessons address the\n            following issues. 1) The beneficial impact of long-distance\n            trade, was enhanced by the inter-provincial cooperation, an\n            ambitious undertaking, but successful due to strong\n            preparation, and management, which has subsequently been\n            financed in national highways projects. 2) Delays in the\n            implementation of electrical, and mechanical systems,\n            hindered an optimal operation of assets built under the\n            project, (similar to delays under other projects implemented\n            during the 1990s); thus stricter control of procurement\n            schedules concerning these components, needs to be enforced\n            by implementing agencies, and the many central government\n            agencies involved in the clearance process. 3) The\n            constraints posed by operating the expressway under one\n            specific branch of government, hinders the financial\n            viability of the project, but in order to enhance\n            sustainability, both Hebei and Henan Provinces have agreed\n            to take steps for further commercialization of their\n            respective expressway management companies. 4) Taking into\n            consideration the five main cities along the SAXE corridor,\n            coordination of expressway planning, with city plans\n            requires further review, including mechanisms to improve\n            coordination with municipalities, and the Provincial\n            Communications Department."}, "docdt": "2000-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
