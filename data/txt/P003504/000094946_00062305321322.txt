1. Description of the Proposed Project
1) Upgrading work on Xinxiang--Zhengzhou class I highway
is a temporary work to achieve original capacity of the
existing class I highway before building of Xinxiang--
zhengzhou Expressway. The proposed section for upgrading,
till year 2004 , will take two in one" status between
BeiJing--shenzhen National Trunk Highway and National
highway  107  .  After  year  2004  upon  completion  of
Xinxiang--zhengzhou expressway and the second Zhengzhou
Yellow River Bridge at new alternative alignment , the
upgraded section will mainly take the traffic volume on
National highway 107
2) Based upon the recommended alignment , Upgrading work
on Xinxiang--zhengzhou class I highway consist of :
North section of the Yellow River Bridge(starting from
the terminal point on Anxin expressway ending to the
north bank of YR ): this section is 39.326km long with
fully-access-controled and service road being built .
There need to be newly built 1 simple interchange, 24
overpass separation interchanges, to reconstruct 1 toll
station, 9 passageways ,newly built 9 small bridges, and
7 middle bridges ,150 culverts   as well as 29.848km of
approach road and service road and 43.5km of continuous
road ;
the section from the north bank of YR to Longhai railway
interchange (south section. to north bank of YR involves
the  Yellow  River  Bridge  itself  ):  this  section  is
30.447km in total and will be provided with barrier
(fence) for isolating motorized and non-motorized vehicle
lane  . The major intersections will be installed with
signal control system of red & green light ,while the
other  intersection  will    built  overpass  bridge  for
pedestrian only allowing access to pedestrian. This
section need to be newly built 9 overpass bridge for
pedestrian with total length of 315m, reconstruct 1 toll
station ,and newly increased fence 49584m in length,
barrier 24690m and 4 sets of signal lights and widening
of pavement as well .
3) Affected by the proposed Jiaozuo Yellow River Bridge
and Xinxiang--Zhengzhou expressway along with the second
Yellow River Bridge, the traffic voloum on the upgrading
section will increase before 2004 and will sharply
decrease in 2004 , and then with the year going , it will
re-increase .
3



4) Since the proposed project is the World Bank financed
project , the saving from the Bank loan under National
Highway Project will be used. According to the loan
closing date under the project , the upgrading project
planned initially to be commenced in December of 1998 and
completed by the end of September 2000 , with 23 months
of construction period
The total investment of the upgrading work is estimated
to be RMB 532.11 million yuan in which the savings from
the Bank loan US $19 million (RMB 157.70 million)will be
used .
2. Description for Local Physical Environment
5) The proposed project is in middle-north part of Henan
Province and   both sides of Yellow River  . The north
section of Yellow River lies to western side of Huabei
plain which belongs to Haihe valley with wide flat
ground . Because the Yellow River has ever changed its
river courses in centuries, the acient river channel,
river bank and river floodland can be seen along the
route; The south section is located in the Yellow River
alliuval plain area which belongs to Huaihe valley where
the Yellow River has frequently changed its river courses
and over-flooded its river bank , thus this section area
can clearly reflect geomological feature of the YR
changes .
6) The project area falls with transition area from warm
semi-arid climate zone to north semi-tropical climate
zone , which belongs to warm continent monsoon climate
zone with semi-moisture , semi-dry climate feature and
distinct four seasons. The climate is mild, with dry and
windy springs, hot and rainy summer. In the autumn, there
is a sharp difference of temperature between day and
night hours; in winter, it. is cold with little rain and
snow
7) The project area belongs to stability heterogeneity
engineering geology of the Yellow River alluvial plain
and is in the area of 7 degree basic earthquake
intensity.
8) The project area goes through Xinxiang and Zhengzhou
city and also involve a small part area in Wuling county
of Jiaozuo city . The three cities of Zhengzhou, Xinxiang
and Jiaozuo are relatively economic developed city
comparing with other city in Henan province and Average
Gross National Product for the three cities are all above
the average level of the whole province
4



9) Since the villages adjacent to both side of highway
has been relocated While construction of the existing
XZH, there are only 8 villages within 200m on both side
of the project and beside of this , such villages is 150m
away to the project . South section of YR is almost close
to Zhengzhou urban area where many commercial facilities
was built on both side of highway . No special
environmental sensitive area including hospitals, schools
and scenery resort and recovery spot etc. was built on
the existing XZH
10) Through investigation, no special sensitive area such
as hospital, school , scenery spot , recovery spot etc.
Located on both side of the existing Xinxiang-Zhengzhou
and through investigation, no cultural relics was
distributed underground or on the ground along the
route
11) In accordance with the statistics analysis on the
monitoring results for the four acoustic environmental
monitoring  spot  of  the  existing  XZH         ,  acoustic
environment along the route was impacted by highway
traffic noise on the existing XZH . Out of the four
monitoring spot , except for one spot is better , the
rest three is poor . It is indicated quality of acoustic
environment within 200m off the XZH can not reach the
catalogue "4" area in environmental Noise Standard for
Urban Areas  (GB3096-93)"  . Particularly   environmental
noise Leq is very serious at night in which the highest
over-limit value is 18.2dB(A),
12) Present air environment status was monitored in the
course of Environmental Assessment , and its location of
monitoring point is as same as that of acoustic
environment . As stated in the monitoring results, air
environment on north section of the YRB can meet the
Grade II standard limit in environment Air Quality
Standard (GB3095--1996)" , while south section fail to
meet above standard ,for TSP is the main pollutant
indicator above the standard limit. As a whole, TSP on
the  whole  section  is  the  main  pollutant  in  air
environment and was above the standard limit on south
section; Concentration present value of CO, Nox is low
and not above the standard
13) The cohesive soil and sand soil is prevailing along
the route of  XZH . According to the monitoring results
for lead content in the farmland layer along the route,
the lead content is between 18.8--21.56mg/kg , which is
far below the Grade II standard (standard limit is
300mg/kg) in the soil Environmental Quality Standard"
(GB15618--1995)     It imply the  lead content  will  not
pollute the soil of farmland layer of the project and
5



will  be  still  within  the  range  of  natural  soil
background
14) it is indicated from monitoring result at Huayuankou
profile of the YR in 1997 that water quality near YRB can
not  meet  the  standard  of  III  category  in  "quality
standard  for  ground  water  quality  "(GB3838--88),  and
water quality was slightly organic polluted
3. Prediction of Environmental Impact
15)  According  to  the  information  with  comparison
analysis, in construction period of the project , scope
of impact due to construction noise are not beyond 200m
off the construction site at daytime. No people will be
affected during upgrading the Yellow River Bridge ;
Because many business housings are located on both side
of highway on south section which would restrict
transmission of the noise,  environment impact scope by
construction noise is small ; As the villages on both
side of the project is over 150m away the construction
site, impact by construction noise to these villages will
not  be  serious.  During  construction  period  of  the
project   ,  acoustic  environmental  quality  near  the
villages will keep same as usual
16)  During construction period , upgrading work on the
Yellow River and its south section will focus on access-
controlled work and separating installation ,thus blown
dust due to construction activity is not so much and not
adversely affect the air environment; During construction
on north section, blown dust will adversely impact the
area within 200m leeward of- construction site , in
particular serious impact within lOOm leeward, but almost
no village  is  located within  lOOm   of both  side  of
highway , therefore, blown dust due to construction may
affect the villages on the north section in light
manner . As the construction period of the project lasts
23 months, the affected period due to construction dust
will only lasts 23 months
17) As an upgrading project , the earthwork required for
the  project  is  a  little  and  not  need  more  land
acquisition , thus eco-environment would not seriously be
destroyed by construction activity , in addition, some
eco-environmental damage could be recovered soon in many
cases ;
Cultural relics along the route was surveyed, excavated
and protected before building the existing Xinxiang--
Zhengzhou class I highway , hence, the cultural relics
would not be adversly affected by the proposed upgrading
work.
6



Construction activIty-.would disturb existing traffic each
other,. it is,"important for the contractors to properly
arrange their working time and construction dispatching;
The environmental impact in other aspect is not serious
during   construction   period,   after   the   necessary
environmental measures being appropriately taken , such
adverse impact could be mintll?zed to the lowest degree
18)  Environment  impact  by  the  traffic  noise  at  the
sensitive point was predicted with prediction model in
the EIA report. American FHWA model is used to predict
traffic noise . As shown in the prediction results , by
the year 2004 upon completion of upgrading mark ,
environmental impact by traffic noise will increasingly
rise year by year and will sharply drop in 2004 , later
on will go up again year by year . By the end of
evaluation year 2019 , traffic noise would   beyond the
level in the initial operation stage (2000). In the year
2000  of the  initial operation  period  , with  a  large
traffic flow at daytime peak hour , traffic noise value
for the most of the sensitive point would above the
standard  limit  ( standard  limit  is  same -as  acoustic
environment), but its over-limit value is not high; In
middle operation period , traffic noise at different time
would  not  above  the  Standard  limit;  in  long-time
operation period , with a large traffic flow at daytime
peak hours, traffic noise for the most of sensitive point
would above the Standard and also above the level in
initial operation period .-With average traffic flow for
both daytime and nighttime in evaluation time , traffic
noise for all sensitive point would not beyond the
Standard limit
19) Environmental impact by the motorized vehicle exhaust
was predicted with prediction model within 200m of the
project  . As  indicated    in  the  analysis  results  of
prediction , in evaluation year upon completion of XZH,
average concentration value of CO, Nox in air due to
motorized vehicle exhaust would not above the Standard
for all the sensitive point of both side of the project.
In line with average wind speed for years, prevailing
wind  direction  in  one  year  ,stability  with  higher
frequency, average concentration value of CO, Nox on south
section is higher than that on north section . After
predicted concentration value plus its present value,
average concentration value of No. will above the standard
while CO is below the Standard limit.
20) As stated in prediction result regarding accumulated
lead content in farmland soil on north section , by 2019
the lead content adjacent to both side of highway will up
to 40.737mg/kg which is almost exceed by one time compare
with the present status, but is still far below the Grade
7



II   standard   limit   in   soil   Environmental   Quality
Standard"(GB15618--1995)  ,only- account-ing for  13.6%  of
the Standard limit.
21)   With adequate interchanges and passageways on -the
project to be built, it will relief of  social separation
due to upgrading work; the landscape along the alignment
will remain as same as usual after upgrading work; water
quality in the Yellow River would not be directly
affected ; benefit to both social and economy will be
remarkably huge upon completion of the project
4. Environmental Mitigation Measures
22) In order to reduce adverse impact on environment in
the  course   of  construction  and  operation  period,
environmental   mitigation  measures  to  be  taken   in
design ,construction and operation stage was proposed in
the EIA report . please see Environmental Action Plan of
the project for detail
22)    In  order  to  ensure  execution  of  environmental
mitigation measures, environmental management program was
proposed in the EIA report , please see EAP for detail
23) Environmental monitoring program was stated in the
EIA report outlining environmental element, pollutant
element,  frequency  & time and monitoring point  . For
detail please see EAP.
24) All people involved in the environmental management
and   environmental   monitoring   have   been   trained
accordingly  ,  thus  staff  training  program  regarding
enviionmental protection will not be included in the
EIA
25). The persons related to environmental management and
monitoring involved in the proposed project have been
trained before, hence training plan for this project will
not be listed again.
5. Economic Benefit of the project
27)   Through analysis of calculation,  economic internal
return rate of the project is up to 15.27% , economic net
present value is RMB Y 95.4409 million , economic benefit
cost ratio is 1.214 and economic investment recovery term
is 17 years, all of which can show the project will have
good economic benefit .
28)    As  estimated,  total  investment  of environmental
protection amount to RMB Y  6.933 million   , accounting
for 1.3%  of the grand total investment cost
8



6., Public Participation--
29),  Non-government organization -along the project all
positively support to the upgrading work and also put
forward their- suggestion to some issues which need to be
paid more attention during upgrading work
30) As shown in the feedback questionnairs, the majority
of public people hold support attitude to the upgrading
work and assume that traffic accident would be reduced
and traffic safety be ensured upon upgrading work is
completed. Only a few people disagree the upgrading
project , mainly for they think social interruption would
be caused and normal communication for the residents on
both side of highway would be affected after completion
of the upgrading work.
7 . Conclusion through EIA
31) On basis of comprehensive analysis and assessment,
the main conclusion from the EIA Report is as follows
below :
Upgrading scheme of Xinxiang--Zhengzhou class I highway
is  reasonable;   environmentally,   upgrading   work   on
Xinxiang--Zhengzhou class I highway is feasible provided
that all environmental mitigation measures proposed in
the EIA report are taken
