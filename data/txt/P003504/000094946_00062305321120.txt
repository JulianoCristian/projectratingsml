shall be planted so
as      to       hider

Beside of the content in above table, for mitigating or
avoiding environmental impacts due to accident events in
the operation period, the following measures are proposed
herein:
7



1. Enhanced management of vehicles to ensure they are in
good condition;
2. Strengthened training services for drivers to forbid
any driving in drunkenness and fatigue, and to forbid any
forcible overtaking, any driving in drunkenness shall be
seriously punished .
3. No over-loading and overspeeding of vehicles. Any
vehicle carrying toxic, harmful, flammable, explosive and
volatile among any other dangerous things should have
permissions   issued  by  public   security,   fire   and
communictions departments;
4.  The  proposed  section  of  highway  is  a bottle-neck
section on YR without alternative roadway being used ,
hence, in case of windy, snowy, foggy and freezing days,
vehicles should be driven at limited speed, and traffic
police shall patrol on the road to solve the problem in a
timely manner ;
5. In case of any explosion and fire, fire department
should be promptly informed and before dealing with the
accident, traffic police shall conduct traffic congestion
and the coresponding road section   should be driven at
the limited speed;
6. In case of any traffic pollution event, emergency
remedies should be provided as required, and responsible
environmental agencies at different levels should be
immediately informed such that corresponding measures can
be taken as appropriate;
IX. Ezivironmental Management Program
Henan Provincial Highway Administration Bureau shall be
responsible for environmental management and coordination
work in construction and operation stage of the Bank-
financed project in Henan province .
The highway managemenet and maintenance gang have been
set up in the area sections where shall be administrated
by Xinxiang and Zhengzhou city respectively on XZH .The
number of such gang distributed along the route is 4 in
total of which one part-time environmental management
personnel responsible for each gang respectively , thus
such four part-time environmental management persons
shall be responsible for environmental management work at
their own maintenance section
Aforesaid highway management maintenance unit of both
cities and all part-time environmental management persons
at  each  maintenance  gang  will  be  in  charge  of



environmental   management   work   in   construction   and
operation stage of the project
X.   Environmental Monitoring Program
Henan  Provincial  Highway  Administration  will  entrust
Henan   Provincial   Environmental   Monitoring   Center   to
implement   all   environmental   monitoring   of   relevant
element in construction and operation stage of the
project
Environmental monitoring program for the construction and
