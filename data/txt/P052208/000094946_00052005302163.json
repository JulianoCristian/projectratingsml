        transport services, and, will reactivate trade, including\n            the promotion of public/private partnerships of primary\n            transport facilities. The components call for: 1) regulatory\n            reform, and private sector development, to develop a\n            domestic private sector, active in the transport sector.\n            Sub-sectors include regulatory framework for civil aviation;\n            port sub-sector reform; commercialization, and liquidation\n            of the Ministry of Public Works' (MOPW) construction\n            units; development of a domestic road transport, and\n            construction industries; and, promote trade, and transport\n            facilitation; 2) restructuring of MOPW, which will include\n            consulting services, technical assistance, and training, to\n            assist with the establishment of transitional arrangements\n            among the decentralized units. A social mitigation program\n            will be financed, to address redundancy quantities,\n            statutory entitlements, and staff reinsertion into the labor\n            market; 3) environmental protection to monitor the sector\n            environmental performance, and, present a national\n            catastrophe prevention, and mitigation program. In addition,\n            both emergency works, and studies will be financed to\n            support coastal protection activities."}, "docdt": "2000-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
