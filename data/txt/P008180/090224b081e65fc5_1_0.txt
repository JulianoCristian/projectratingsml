SCHEDULE 2
Description of Project
The Project consists of:
A. Works. The completion of construction of two sec-
tions of controlled-access toll expressways, including earth-
works, bridges, viaducts, tunnels, paving, interchanges,
toll stations, and compensatory works such as the diversion
of rivers, the relocation of existing roads and services, and
the construction of agricultural underpasses and service
tracks. Provision will be made for future extension of the
expressways at certain interchanges.
One expressway section is about 59 kilometers long and
extends from Coche (a suburb of Caracas) to Tejerias,
where it will link with the existing four-lane expressway to
Valencia.
The other expressway section is about 35 kilometers long
and connects the city of Valencia with the existing coastal
road to Puerto Cabello at El Palito.
B. Services. Engineering services during the construc-
tion period of the Project in connection with design, docu-
mentation, construction and supervision.
