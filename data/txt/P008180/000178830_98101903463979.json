The project consists of the completion\n            of construction of about 94 km of multilane, toll\n            expressways or \"autopistas\". Two separate sections\n            of autopista are involved, one of 59 km in length from\n            Tejerias to Coche, in continuation of the existing\n            expressway from Valencia, and the other of 35 km in length\n            from Valencia to Puerto Cabello. The project will yield a\n            reasonable economic return on capital investment, resulting\n            principally from the savings in vehicle operating costs by\n            using the new highway facilities as an alternative to the\n            existing inadequate and congested roads."}, "docdt": "1961-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
