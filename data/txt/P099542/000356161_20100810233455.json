Pakistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: teams preparing emergency projects\n            need to consider how to strike the balance between emergency\n            objectives and longer term institution-building approaches\n            and policy reforms and whether combining these two\n            objectives makes sense. Project preparation should allow\n            implementation to begin immediately after effectiveness,\n            particularly in emergency operations. Therefore, issues such\n            as financial flows, terms of reference for consultancies and\n            procurement should be in place by project effectiveness. A\n            results framework with measurable indicators needs to be in\n            place as well as a functioning monitoring system, including\n            arrangements for a timely impact analysis. Project results\n            that are immediately relevant to the beneficiaries, their\n            families and communities, and the public at large, are an\n            effective means of building and expanding support for\n            disability programs."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
