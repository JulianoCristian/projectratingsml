1. Country and Sector Background
Country Overview: During the 1980s, the economy of the Dominican
Republic suffered serious imbalances. The economic trough
occurred during the 1990-1991 recession when GDP declined.
Social spending levels, already inadequate, reached a low point.
To reverse the trend, the Government initiated a comprehensive
stabilization program in 1990. By 1993 significant advances
toward macroeconomic stability were achieved.
The inadequate expenditure in the social sectors is reflected
in: the average entrant on the labor force has completed only
four years of school; 20t of the adult population is illiterate,
and formal sector unemployment is high (25w in 1994). Levels of
education and salaries for unskilled and semi-skilled workers
are among the lowest in the Caribbean. Low average basic
educational attainment and productivity also contribute to
underemployment in the informal sector, accounting for 22t of
the labor force, and to a high degree of income inequality. The
wealthiest 20t of the population captures over half, and the
poorest 20t only 4t of total income.   Some 20t of the population
is estimated to be poor.
Education Sector: During 1982-91, public expenditure on
education fell from 1.9 to 0.9%. Insufficient financing spurred
severe deterioration in the basic education system. Its impact
on the coverage, quality and efficiency of basic education was
severe.  In 1991, only 16% of five-year olds were enrolled in
public preschool classes.   An estimated 90% of the relevant age-
group was enrolled in primary schools. However, only half of



the children enrolled in public primary schools, could expect to
complete the primary cycle.   Some 10% of children in the age
group 7 to 12 never attended school and annual repetition and
dropout reached 18 and 16%, respectively, in 1991.    The lowest
participation and completion rates were found among that 65% of
the population living in rural and peri-urban areas. Private,
mainly urban schools, which account for about 20% of students
enrolled at the primary and 30% of students at the lower
secondary levels, increased enrollments as a response to the
crisis in the public sector. However, many of these schools
were equally constrained in terms of resources available to
offer education of acceptable quality.
Education Sector Reform: In 1989-90 civil society initiated a
series of actions, which progressed from protests, through
dialogue with the Government, to consensus, crystallizing in the
Plan Decenal de Educacion (Ten-Year Education Plan, 1991-2000).
The Plan aims to expand service coverage, raise student
achievement levels, and strengthen sector management. To
support the execution of the first phase of the Plan, the
Emergency Phase, the IDB approved a loan in 1991 (US$29
million), in parallel with a complementary loan extended by the
1BRD (US$ 15 million).
The Plan's implementation achievements to date have surpassed
expectations. The Government has more than doubled basic
education spending since 1991. As expenditures increased,
enrollments rose. The Secretariat of Education reports that
enrollment in grades 1 to 8 climbed 9% during 1991-94, and
repetition and dropout rates declined to 13 and 11%,
respectively, between 1991-94. Overall completion rates at the
primary level rose to 60%.
2. Objectives
(a) Improve the quality of basic education; (b) increase
enrollment and especially completion rates, with priority
directed to children from low income families; and (c)
strengthen technical and resource management capabilities for
basic education.
3. Rationale for Bank's Involvement
Consistent with the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(May, 1995), and the Inter-American Development Bank's
Assistance Strategy, the Government recognizes that continued
improvement of social services in general, and basic education
services in particular, is essential for laying a sound
foundation for social stability, sustained economic growth, and
the alleviation of poverty.
In view of both banks' support of the first phase of the Ten-
Year Plan and their experiences elsewhere in the basic education
subsector, the Government has requested the support of both
institutions for the Plan's second phase. Given that the
-2 -



proposed project would account for less than 15t of the
Government's planned expenditures in the education sector from
1996 to 2000), the particular value-added of the banks' further
participation would lie in the consolidation of policy and plan
implementation efforts, with a focus on assuring adequate
educational quality, overall sub-sector efficiency, and improved
monitoring and evaluation in the future.
4. Description
The Component Educational Development would provide inputs to
strengthen school effectiveness. It would improve equity by
increasing coverage and targeting low-income children, and
efficiency by raising the quality of education and the share of
students completing basic education. The Component Management
Inputs would support the gradual deconcentration of the
Secretariat of Education responsibilities and strengthen the
effectiveness of resource use in the sector. It would further
support monitoring and evaluation of the Plan, and selected
studies.
5. Financing
Total ( US$m)
BORROWER                 11.0
IBRD                     37.0
IDB                      52.0
Total Project Cost       100.0
6. Implementation
The Secretariat of Education will be responsible for the
execution of the project. The Secretary of the Secretariat of
Education would be responsible for project management. The
Secretary would be assisted by a single Project Coordination
Unit, whose Coordinator would be responsible for two units
within the PCU:    (i) the Technical Unit, which would monitor
and support technical execution of project components, focusing
on the build-up of decision-making and implementation capacity
within the respective Secretariat of Education departments
during project implementation; and (ii) the Administrative Unit,
which would manage the project's personnel, procurement,
finance, accounting, and auditing activities.
7. Sustainability
The sustainability of the Project is confirmed by the strong
political support from the Government of the Dominican Republic
and its Ten Year Education Plan (1991-2000) which aims to expand
service coverage, raise student achievement levels, and
strengthen sector management.
8. Lessons learned from past operations in the country/sector
(a) importance of broad support among project stakeholders,
appropriate technical designs and efficient implementation
-3 -



arrangements; (b) strong government commitment and heavy
investments in consensus-building by sector stakeholders, in a
relatively stable macro-economic environment; (c) need to retool
curriculum, didactic materials, and school rehabilitation and
maintenance components to account for the special needs of
preschool education and multigrade classrooms; and, (d) Strong
leadership from the Implementing Agency, supported by a
competent project coordination unit.
9. Program of Targeted Intervention (PTI) Y
10. Environment Aspects (including any public consultation)
The project would enhance environmental conservation through
introduction of environmental themes in the basic education
curriculum and is rated "C".
