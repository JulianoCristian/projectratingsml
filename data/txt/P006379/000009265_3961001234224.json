and\n            organizational policy changes required to achieve\n            sustainable, integrated multimodal transport in the\n            metropolitan regions of Brazil.  The specific objectives are\n            to : a) support the government in its efforts to transfer\n            the Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos (CBTU) subdivision\n            to the state of Sao Paulo; b) strengthen institutional,\n            organizational and policy reforms; and c) contribute to\n            poverty alleviation and environmental improvement.  The\n            project includes an investment component (IC) and an\n            institutional development (ID) component.  The IC component\n            includes civil works and goods to implement the proposed\n            rehabilitation of stations, track, rolling stock, signaling,\n            power supply, telecommunications, traffic engineering\n            equipment and construction of transfer points required to\n            integrate CBTU with other modes.  The ID component consists\n            of the development and implementation of policies and action\n            programs to : 1) establish organizational, financial and\n            institutional reforms; 2) operationalize multimodal and\n            tariff integration between CBTU-SP, and Ferrovias Paulistas\n            (FEPASA) feeder bus systems; 3) identify an investment\n            program to consolidate the rehabilitation and\n            decentralization; 4) study and recommend different\n            management alternatives; and 5) provide technical and\n            management training to CBTU employees."}, "docdt": "1992-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
