The key lessons learned include: 1)\n            Although this project has been highly innovative in\n            supporting one of the first rail transport decentralization\n            initiatives in the world, a more gradual transition would\n            have likely minimized the difficulties associated with the\n            actual transfer. 2) Despite the fact that the state-owned\n            operating agency is better placed than Brazilian Urban Train\n            Company (CBTU) to respond to local realities, Metropolitan\n            Train Company of Sao Paulo (CPTM) is still constrained by\n            political interference and bureaucratic red tape, which\n            affects its productivity. This is best addressed through a\n            concession to the private sector. Decentralization is,\n            therefore, only a mandatory stopover to greater private\n            sector participation. 3) In systems where there is\n            substantial fare evasion, it is important to challenge base\n            data on evasion estimates more thoroughly and periodically\n            than was done by CBTU. The impact of fare evasion should not\n            be underestimated as it has led to inaccurate estimates of\n            total passenger traffic and the amount of operating\n            subsidies required. 4) The issue of whether to purchase new\n            trains or rehabilitate existing trains was heavily debated\n            during appraisal. The Borrower opted for rehabilitation due\n            to lower costs and relatively shorter time periods involved.\n            Given the delays experienced, it might have been preferable\n            to have opted for a mix of rehabilitated and new trains."}, "docdt": "1999-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
