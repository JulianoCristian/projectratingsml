institutional development impact\n            as substantial, bank performance as satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance as satisfactory. The main lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) Political buy in of\n            Government into a proposed far fetching privatization is an\n            absolute necessity for its successful implementation. 2)\n            Reform is a long-term process that spans the life of more\n            than one project and requires the adoption of an agreed\n            approach by all concerned parties. 3) Working through\n            existing national directorates instead of project units, and\n            using civil servants instead of contractual personnel for\n            project implementation strengthens Government's\n            capacity and ownership. 4) The pilot project was based on a\n            successful pilot program for USAID to train civil servants\n            and motivate them in joining the private sector. The scaling\n            up within the project failed as only few civil servants left\n            as a result of the training. 5) It is important to have\n            clear arrangements regarding coordination and information\n            sharing among donors of the program. 6) The Bank failed to\n            provide adequate resources to ensure proper project\n            supervision and implementation assistance. 7) Development\n            objectives have to be realistically assessed. 8) Built-in\n            flexibility is therefore an essential feature of such a\n            project. 9) Accountability of service providers should be improved."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
