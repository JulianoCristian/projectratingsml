{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fifth, Sixth, and\n            Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 5-7) Project\n            for Uganda were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some key lessons learned included:\n            the PRSCs are an excellent vehicle for dialogue, not only\n            between the Government and Development Partners, but also\n            between the Ministries. This is a well-known benefit of\n            PRSCs, but it bears repeating. The ministries reported\n            widely that the PRSC series created a valuable forum to\n            discuss cross-cutting issues such as issues related to\n            public service reform and decentralization. The ministries\n            also expressed that their cases could be better heard in\n            inter-ministerial, multi-donor settings. In the PRSC series,\n            most of the indicators missed some element of the specific,\n            measurable, attributable, and relevant or time bound (SMART)\n            criteria, all of which are critical for indicators to be\n            useful. For example, if an indicator is attributable, but\n            not time-bound, then it cannot be useful to measure results\n            of a program. Conversely, an indicator may be time bound,\n            but too general to be attributable to the activity whose\n            results are being measured. While the indicators for PRSC\n            5-7 were driven by the Government's results framework\n            and Bank's desire to foster ownership, the Bank should\n            have recognized that these were not suitable for the\n            Bank's goal of measuring results. Nonetheless, there is\n            frequently a concern that a policy operation that\n            \"takes its time\" and which needs to advance\n            incrementally may be viewed internally by the Bank as simply\n            repeating actions of the prior credit. One solution might be\n            that gradations should be better specified and nuanced, and\n            actions and targets better calibrated, so that it will be\n            clear that the policy agenda is moving forward while also\n            moving at a rate where there is sustained government\n            ownership and an actual ingraining of the policy reform. At\n            the same time, the Bank may also need to better temper its\n            ambitions about the pace and scope of reform that can\n            realistically be achieved each year, recognizing that many\n            reforms will be incremental, rather than substantial."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
