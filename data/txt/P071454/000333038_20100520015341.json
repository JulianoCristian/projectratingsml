"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the AJK (Azad Jammu and\n            Kashmir) Community Infrastructure and Services Project for\n            Pakistan were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            responsibility of Community Physical Infrastructure (CPI)\n            implementation was clearly vested in Community Based\n            Organization's (CBOs) and this enhanced CBOs'\n            institutional capacity. Immediate tangible outputs of CPIs\n            including labor opportunities encouraged community\n            members' participation in planning, financial\n            management, procurement, project management, and decision\n            making. Professionally developed training materials may be\n            used for capacity building. The level of amount of community\n            share needs to be revisited. In the light of a number of\n            donor agencies operational in similar conditions with\n            variable rates of community contributions, it is important\n            to take into account different level of poverty and harsher\n            living conditions in very remote areas. Well developed,\n            clear and more transparent criteria for the selection of\n            union councils within the districts were not clearly\n            stipulated in the project. The selection criteria should\n            consider factors including poverty, remoteness, number and\n            type of development interventions undertaken by other\n            developmental organizations in the village, along with\n            willingness of local communities to participate in the\n            project interventions. Poverty assessment must be carried\n            out at the onset of the project for the community selection.\n            Internal audit, on a regular basis, considerably enhances\n            the control environment and contributes to effective\n            governance. It is essential that the activity is conducted\n            regularly to ensure achievement of the desired objectives."}, "docdt": "2010-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
