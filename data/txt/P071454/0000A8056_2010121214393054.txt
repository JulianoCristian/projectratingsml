                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist in delivering cost effective and sustainable community development programs and basic infrastructure services to
                         under-served rural, urban and peri-urban communities (the communities) in AJK, using participatory community-based approaches, and, to that end: (a) to
                         support an increase in the number and capacity of community representative organizations; (b) to enhance the capacity of the territorial, district and municipal
                         governments to extend technical, financial and management support to community representative organizations; and (c) to generally enhance accountability
                         and transparency through the establishment of improved operational, financial and budgeting procedures and monitoring and evaluation systems.

                         Overall disbursement as of November 15, 2010 is US $29.34 million which is approximately 98 percent of the credit amount of US $30 million. 190 sub projects including 24 rural
                         roads and 166 buildings are complete. Work on 50 sites is above 80%, on 13 sites it is more than 60 % and on remaining seven sites it is about 50%. With November 30, 2010, as
                         the project closing date, seven schools, one Vocational Training Institute, two Union Council offices and a Police Station in Dhirkot are on critical path. These add up to US
                         $1,285,000 or just 4% only of the total project cost. However, all of these building are in fairly advance stages of construction. The mission conducted field visits to approximately 60
                         sub-project sites to assess quality of construction. The mission found that the quality of construction on the project funded projects met the project specifications and it was generally
                         better than many other donor or public sector funded construction. The costs were also fairly comparable. Therefore, the Mission is of the view that the project development
                         objectives are likely to be achieved.
