SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Paraguay
Seventh Hiahwav Project (Loan 2140-PA)
Attached is of the "Project Completion Report on Paraguay - Seventh
Highway Project (Loan 2140-PA)", prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Office. The PCR covers the same ground and generates the save basic
findings as the Performance Audit Report (PAR) issued on June 30, 1993 (Report
No. 11999 which dealt with the same and the three preceding highway projects in
Paraguay. Since the government had already commented on the PAR, no adlitional
comments on the PCR were sought.
The PCR indicates an ex-post economic rate of return for the major
civil vorks of around   23Z.  It draws attention to insufficient borrower
commitment and poor results in institution building and maintenance in the roads
sector. The PCR also emphasizes low borrower standards of record keeping, vhich
made it difficult to retrieve information on key project events.
The PCR is candid and of good quality. It concludes, as did the PAR, that
overall project outcome was unsatisfactory, institutional development partial,
and sustainability uncertain.

PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Repod (PCR) for the Seventh Highway Project in Para-
guay for which Loan 2140-PA in the amount of US$46 million was approved on May 11, 1982.
The LoIan was closed on June 30, 1991, four years behind schedule. The last disbursement was
made on July 3, 1991. Total disbursements amounted to US$45.99 million, the diftereace
US$0.01 million was cancelled.
This PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations Division of the Latin
America and Caribbean Country Department IV based on, inter alia: (i) a draft completion report
prepared by the borrower; (ii) a project completion report prepared by the Inter Ameican Devel-
opment Bank (DB); (iii) Bank sources, including the loan documents, appraisal report, supervi-
sion reports, correspondence; and (iv) interviews with Bank staff.
While this report was being prepared the Operations Evaluation Deparment carried out
a comprehensive review and audit of the last four highway operations of the Bank in Paraguay
including this one. Their report 'Performance Audit Report on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and
Seventh Highway Projects in Paraguay' incorporates the results of this operation. The OED
report, which includes pointed observations on the results and experience of this project, was sent
to the Borrower for comments. Because the more comprehensive OED report was sent to the
Borrower it was considered unnecessary to send also this one. This PCR, therefore, does not
have a section on Borrower Comments.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
gb3ectives
1.   Tle Seventh Highway Project (Highway 7) shared with the preceding six the same
objectives of promoting social and economic development by strengthening the roads subsector.
The project comprised: (a) widening Rt.2 (60 kIm) and upgrading Rt. 3 (98 kh) and Rt. 8 (28
kin); (b) upgrading the planning capacity of the Ministry of Work's Tranport Coordination and
Planning Office (OCPIT) and strengthening the General Directorate Roads' (DGV) technical am'
managerial capacity, through: establishing sectoral plamning and progamming systems, assisting
with staffing programs, hiring consultants and training staff; and (c) strengthening the mainte-
nance operations of DGV through: establishing road maintenance management and pavement
evaluation systems, and hiring equipment fleet and workshop management consultants (section
3).
elmentation ,and Results
2.    Initiation of the project was substantially delayed by: (a) the economic and political
instablity in the early 1980s; (b) the Goverment's reluctance to proceed with new works until
adequate financing to complete works already under constuction was secured; (c) protracted
negotiations to obtain additional foreign financing; (d) protted discussions over which in -
tion, the IDB or the Bank, would finance what section of Rt.3, and (e) lengthy arguments over
the construction sequence for the sections. These delays, the decrease in US dollars costs, the
need to supplement funding for works strted under the FRth Project on a section of Rt.3 leating
to one in the project, the eventual availability of additional foreign. fiancing, and the suspension
from 1985 to 1987 of disbursements in local curency, required redefining the project's scope,
reallocating loan funds, and changing loan disbursement rates. The Closing Date was extended
five times between December 31, 1987 (the original date) and June 30, 1991 (when the loan
account was finally closed) (paras 5.1 to 5.6).
3.    Total cost of the works originally in the project were US$76.9 million, 37% less than the
appraisal estimate (US$123.3 million). Ihe difference was used to finance an expanded project
scope that included completion of two road sections initiated in the Fifth and Sixth Highway
Projects (Loans 1529-PA and 1736-PA), strengthening 10 ka of another road, constuction and
upgrading weighing stations and addiional studies (paras. 5.7 to 5.9). Ihe expanded project was
financed partly by the neamerican Development Bank (IDB, US$17.6 mfllion) and by
FONPLATA (the Financial Fund for the Development of the Plata River Basin, US$8.4 million).
4.    The sector planning and management component fell far short of achieving its objectives.
Although sector planning was organized, and agreed studies were carried out by the planning unit
(OCP1T), failure to staff DGV and OCP1T, to improve data gathering and planning systems, and
to integrate plans into the miniisterial decision making process, canLeled out the effort. The
maintenance component of the project failed to estabh's a functional maintenanc management
system or to improve equipment and workshops management (section 6).
5.    Reassessment of the economic rate of reurn of the roads woks in the project, including
completion of the two roads initiated under the Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects, indicates that
despite the delays the civil works yi Ided good rates of returns, except paving the Villarrica -
Rumi road which was probably somewhat premature (section 7).



- iii -
Sustainability
6.    The civil works in the project are expected to generate sustained benefits. Historically
paved roads have received reasonable, though very expensive, maintenance in Paraguay, which
bodes well for the sustainability of the benefits. The lack of progress in transport planning is
being followed up by technical assistance financed by 1DB. The meager achievements in improv-
ing maintenance are being followed up by the Japanese Overseas Development Fund (OECF)
which is helping Paraguay purchase large amounts of maintenance equipment and providing
operational and workshop management assistance (section 8).
L*essons LeaMed   -
7.    Successfil implementation was seriously impaired by a weak assessment of the risks of
undertaking a project for which inadequate financing was available (para 5.14). There were
insufficient funds to cover 30% of project cost and it took Paraguay more than two years to
secure the additional funding (para 5.9). This brought about delays in the exution of the civi
works. In addition, there were insufficient funds to complete works started wder previous
projects (para. 5.5) and eventually those works had to be brought under the project.
8.    The limited success of the project's maintenance component was the result of an opdmis-
tic assessment of the ministry's management capacity, and of its willingness and ability
to fund asset preservation rather than new construction. The Government's lack of commibtm
to institution building, particularly planning, and its ability to properly staff MOPC (aras. 5.10
to 5.13) seriously hurt the project.
9.    The effect of these deficiencies was compounded by the economic instability of the early
1980s and the absence of an understanding between the Government and the Bank on exchange
rate policy. This disturbed Bank-Borrower relationships and somewhat affected project imple-
mentation, in particular because it led to a suspension of disbursements towards the local currency
component of the project between 1985 and 1987. On balance, however, becase the foreign
component of the project was quite substantial, the project was only marginally affected by the
suspension. Yet, large arrears in local currency payments to conmractors were buiit up by the
ministry which slowed contract execution and fiuther delayed project completion. In addition,
discontinuities in Bank-staff in the late 1980s weakened project monitorng and prevented the
Bank from responding adequately to the deteriorating project (section 11).
10.   Project shortcomings are most disturbing because they occurred in areas in which the
Bank had provided abundant arsistance throughout its prior 20 year association with Paraguay's
roads sector, namely: transport planning, institutional efficiency and road mainenance. Improve-
ment of these key components of highway management should remain a chief Bank concer  In
its next lending operation the Bank intends to try a different approach to dealing wih these areas.
Instead of persisting on building up an in-house capability to carry out asks, atention will be
focused on preparing MOPC to use private contractors much more extensively ta in the past.
11.   Record keeping under the project was notoriously lax, to the extent that it has been quite
difficult, if not impossible to retrieve information on project expenditues, trafflc volumes,
technical data on the civil works and other project related statistics. Under futre operations the
Bank should ensure that adequate record keeping is sustained through the life of the project
(section 13).

Sector             Transport
Sub-Sector         Highways
2.    Background
2.1   The Tnsxort Svt. Paraguay relies heavily on its transport system and the links to
its neighbors for its development. Domesdc movements are predominandy by roads, which carry
100% .of passenger and about 93% of freight (the rest moves over the rivers 6%, and by rail
19%). International traffic is handled 50% by road, 35% by river transport and 15% by rail. The
roads network comprises about 53,000 km; however, 80% of road traffic is carried over the
28,300 kan of national roads. Of these 2,600 km are paved, and mosdy in fair condition, and
25,700 kn are earth roads, mostly in poor condidon.
2.2   Sector Obiectiv   he Seventh Highway Project (Highway 7) shared with the preceding
six projects the same sector development objectives: to promote social and economic development
by strengthening road transport, the dominant mode.
2.3   Sector &    Th le Bank's strategy context In which this project was carried out was to
strengthen the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MOPC), especially the Directorate
General of Highways (DGV), to expand efficiently the national road system and improve its
maintenance. This required, beer alla, to assist the Office of Integrated Transport Planning and
Coordination (OCP1 in tackling overall sector planning.
2.4    Bank Tran=gt Lending. At the time of the project the Bank had financed six highway
projects and one port project. During that long association, Bank highway fnancing was concen-
trated on: (a) upgrading, paving, and strengthening the trunk road network, 1,400 of the 2,600
km of paved roads; (b) developing, equipping, and training a road and equipment maiance
unit, including the introduction of a road maintenace, and an equipment management system;
(c) upgrading DGV's engineering capabilities; and (d) initiating tratspo, and bighway plxnnng,
including their related data gathering.
2.5    Macroeconomic and Political Instability of the 1980s. Ihe project was carried out while
the macroeconomic envitronment in Paraguay was deteriorating. To attempt to reverse the situa-
tion, the Government embarked on a public expeaditre program fiuded mostly with foreign
borrowing and domestic credit. Movetary expansion rose; foreign debt increased; inflation rose;
the Guarani depreciated; the balance of payments deriorated. To counteract the balance of pay-
ments deficit, the Government imposed multiple exchange rates, of which the public sector
became the main beneficiary. This frther fueled intion and stagnation. The multiple ex-
change rates system did not solve the balance of payments problem and ended up distorting
incentives, causing the Bank to stop development of new projects for Paraguay and to suspend



disbursements towards the local currency component of ongoing projects betweea 1S85 and 1987.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1    Eoiect-Obietive. The project was a r.equel to the last four of the six previous projects.
Its objectives were to: (a) pursue construction and upgrading of primary roads; (b) upgre
planning and strengthen DGV's technical and managerial capabilities, and (c) upgrade the effli-
cienqc of DGV's maintenance operations.
3.2    Pziect escriptimo. The Project had three components:
EaA  civil works and their supervision, for (a) widening of about 64 km of Route 2
(Sn. Lorenzo - Eusebio Ayala), Including 30 km of additional two lanes; (b)
paving about 98 km of Route 3 (Tacuara - Sta. Rosa); and (c) paving about 28
km of Route 8 (Vilarrica - Flumi).
EMU  strengthening sector planning and improving MOPC's technical and managerial
capacity through (a) the establishment at OCP1T of a system o" annual sectorial
planning and 2rogranning, (b) the provision of planning consultans to OCP1T
(c) the restaffing of DGV; and (d) the training of DGV engineers.
aC strengtening MOPC's maintence operations through: (a) the establishmt of
a maintenance managemen systm; (b) the establishment of a pavement evalua-
tion system; and (c) the provision of consultants to help imprmve equipment
nanagement and workshop performance.
3.3    Dated covenants defed the imetable to Implemen various actions under Part B and C
4.    Projoct Design
4.1    Con=tul EmM          The project's concept was a carry over from previous projects
with no impormt innovations. In hindsight, the governments conmient to the instonal
objectives and the maintenac could be questioned, as it is licely that for MOPCIDGV and thdr
political superiors, the domninant consideration when the project was set up was to secure contin-
ued extern  financing to expand the network rather than Improving maitnance or building up
the institution.
4.2   Feasibility studies we   ailale, but the quality of engineering designs, some of which
were 15 years old, was questionable. May costruction problems had their origin in the de-
signs. However, It Is difficult to ascerta how many were caused by poor engieering, and how
many by the desire to raise standards beyond those in the feasibility studies.
4.3   The differences between OCPfT and DGV, which were originally defined as a  burf' dis-
put that "would be clarfied and resolved during project lmplementatd,  turned out t be
signficnly more intable. Collaboation betwee the two eded up being atremy limkt.
Recommendations in studies done under OCP1T leadership were never heeded by DGV.
4.4   Parmount impotanc was given in project design to instituton building, staff steng-
thening, planning and coordination, but lack of interest, or failure by the Goveamnt to imple-
ment the components contributed to the project's meager achievemen.
4.5    Praj=rn. The project was prepared in October 1980; a sector mission in June-
July 1981 provided the context; It was appraised in September 1981; and a post-appraisal mision



-3-
in December 1981 was necessary. Negoaations were completed in March 1982 and the Bank
approved the loan in May 1982. However, the project did not become effective untl December
1982. after a long delay caused by the slow congressional ratification process in Paraguay.
S.    Project Implementation
S.    C Qangs In Proi  Scoe Sart-up of the civil works (Routes 2,3 and 8) was delayed by
between one and four years, by: (a) slow ratification of the 'oan; (b) Governmeat's reluctance
to proceed with new works until financing for works under way was secured; (c) the negotiaons
to secure addi. aal financing; (d) protracted discussions on the extent of. and constucion
sequence for the sections of Route 3 financed by the Bank and by the lnteramerican Development
Bank (IDB). In the end, the Bank-financed portipn of Route 3 had to be delayed unil the IDB-
financed portion was under way and until procurement problems which delayed ft, were cleared.
5.2   These delays, in addition to the decision to use project funds to supplement the fimcing
for high priority works started under earlier projects when additional foregn financing for the
project works became available, forced changes In project scope. This was done in three Loan
Agreement amendments.
5.3   The first In July 1983 provided for: (a) the inclusion in Lne project of roads of the Fift
and Sixth Highway Projects which, due to cost overns, needed supplemental banchg.: the
completion of the Coronel Oviedo - Tacuara road (91 kIn), the spur from Tacuaa to San Estmis-
lao (7 Km) and the paving of Route 6 (180 kn); and (b) the deletion from the project of 70 km
of the orginal 98 on Rt.3. Financing of the additional works was accommodated by lower
contract prices and by the co-fnancing secured by the government.
5.4   The second amendment, in September 1985, reinroduced in the project the 70 km of Rt.
3 that were taken out in the fim amendmen, and extended the deadlines for a number of cove-
nats on technical assistance and nsitution building.
5.5   The third amendment in May 1990, was for the purpose of including in the project other
high priority actvities. The following were added: (a) strengthening 10 km of the Coronel
Oviedo - Tacuara road; (b) repair and installation of equipment at two weighing stations; (c)
construction of the bufldings for two weighing stations, and istllaion of safety equipment at
all six stations; (d) the feasibiity study for a port and shipping project and of a road user charges
study; and (e) the procurement of traffic counting equipmem and desktop computers.
5.6   These changes brought about modificadons of the Bank disbursement ates: it was shifed
from 20% to 49% of total costs in 1984, when the co-inancing became available, and from 49%
to 37% for Part A.3 in 1987. The suspension of disbursements towards the local component of
project costs between 1985 and 1987 does not seem to have affected the project particularly, as
the foreign exchange component of the project was quite high'. The aosing Date was also
changed a mnuber of tm: from December 31, 1987, to December 31, 1988, to December 31,
1989, to December 31, 1990, to June 30, 1991.
5.7   Expected Cost and Financn   The appraisa estimate of project cost (Table 7) was
USS123.3 million of which US$82.2 million were foreign costs and US$41.0 milion local cost
Civil works and supervision were US$122.0 million (99% of project cost), the remaining
USS1.3 million were to finance techical assistance and equipment purchases. The Bank loan
I/    Still, as a result, considerable arrears with the conactors were built up by the minis-
try, which slowed contract execution and delayed project completon



-4-
was to cover USS45.3 million of foreign cost (excluding about USS0.7 million for the front end
S.ee); the Government was to provide US$41.0 million and unidentified co-financiers would
provide the balance of foreign-currency financing (US$37.0 million).
5.8    Actual Cos For comparable items as included at appraisal and excluding finance charg-
es, actual pro,ect costs are estimated to have been US576.9 million, about 37% less than expected
(Table 7). However, the inclusion in the project of financing for works initiated under earlier
projects, and of additional high priority works and activities brought total project costs t
US$98.4 million, onl; 20% below the project's appraisal cost estimate. The figures ae esdmates
based on various sources, as no exact accounting of costs was kept. ContribuW  to the lower
cost were: (a) vigorous competition for project works - a reflection of the depressed economy
of the mid 1980s - which brought down construction prices; and (b) when measured in US
dollars, the depreciation of the Guarani.    1
5.9    Changes in Co-financing Most amendments in project scope had their origin di the lack
of firm financing for the project- When in 1982 the OPEC Development Fund could not accom-
modate the financing needs of Paraguay, the Government, with Bank help, tued to other co-
financiers. By December 1982, the Government had secured US$46.5 million in paallel financ-
ing from IDB for the construction of a larger section of Rt.3, the Bank would thea finance a
smaller sections. In October 1984 the Government obtained an US$8.4 million loau from the
Plta Basin Development Fund (FONPLATA) for the construction of 28 km of RL8 originaly
induded in the project. Actual financing of the Project was then: Bank US$45.3 million; co.
financiers US$26.1 million and Government US$25 million. Of the US$46.5 million MDB loan,
US$6.5 million were used for financial expenses, US$17.6 million for 'works and supervision,
and US$22.5 milliosz were cancelled In 1991.
5.10   Chanees in Thnical Assistance and StAffing The Government generally met the dates
to submit the four-year transport sector plans and the four-year expenditure forecasts for high-
ways, but implementation of those plans, which depended on the availability of financing, ater-
nad and otherwise, was mostly off the mark.
5.11 Road maintenance covenants required: (a) establishment of an adequately staffed pave-
ment evaluation group by June 30, 1983; (b) submission of a road rebabilitationlistto be updated
annually by July 31, 1983; and (c) submission of an equipment renewal program and for estab-
lishing an inventory control system in the central workshop by July 31, 1983. The Government
did not meat these deadlines and in July 1984 obtained agreement from the Bank to postpone the
deadlines to December 31, September 30 and December 31, 1985 respectively. According to
Annex 3 of the Bans supervision report dated April 10, 1991, the results of these covenants
were, on the whole, satisfactory. However, the inventory contol system was not implemented.
5.12   Staffing covenants required: (a) hiring an experienced engine  and an experienced
transport economist for OCP1T by January 1, 1983; (b) hiring of enginees for DGV to meet the
staffing targets in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement by June 30, 1983; and (c) complete the
staffing of the central workshop by July 31, 1983. All staffing covenas were postponed to
March 31, 1986. Neither DGV nor OCPIT complied with them, due to budgetary and political
constain. However, consultants were hired to improve management of the repair shops and
to assist in transport planning.
5.13 In 1990, the project scope was amended to include a feasibility study fot a port and
shipping project, (para. 5.06). The Bank also agreed to the financing of advisory services. The
studies were used in the preparation of a follow-on project 'he acquisition and insallation of
various computers, trafficcounting, weighing-station equipment is stll not complete.



5.14  ChangUes andRisks. In retrospect, most of the changes in project sc-)pe could have been
avoided if: (a) the uncertainties of co-financing arrangements had been assessed; (b) MOPC's
lack of capacity (o undertake maintenance programs had been taken into account; (c) the depar-
ture of qualified staff to more lucrative employment had been stemmed; (d) the disinterest of the
Government in retaining qualified staff had been identfied; (e) the deficiencies in MOPC's
budgeting systems had been identifled; and (t) the lack of coo-dination betweeA DGV and OCPrr
had been considered Most of these issues had been addressed unsuccessfully in previous Bank
projecs, and the risk of them affecting this project was not taken properly into account

21 Originally in the Sixth Highway Project
6.2   Sectoral Planning and Stafflng lbis component was only parday achieved. OCPIT did
carry out most of the agreed studies and an annual investment plannng system for the tanLsport
sector was established. However, the recodaions of the studies were not implemented
because the implemendng unit did not get along with the studying unit, and the ann   plans have
not done much good, as they are not taken into account in the budgetary decision making process.
Stafflng as agreed was not carried out, party for budgetay reasons but also for lack of interet
The training progrm  was done reasonably close to expectatos but its benefits are doubtf&l
because trained staff left the ministry as no attempt was made at retaining them. Staff that did
not leave were soon transferred to posidons in which the training was hardly necessary. Substan-



-6-
tial TA was provided to OCPIT, but the technology transfer was low and failed to reach its objec-
tives: especially the integration of planning processes into ministerial decisio making.
6.3   Strengthening of Maintenance Onertions. Although the pavement evaluation unit was
established, the project failed to establish a fumctional paved road maintenance management
system. On the basis of an inventory taken during the project by the new unit, a list of roads to
rehabilitate was prepared, it served as the basis for a road rehabilitation program which Is being
financed with additional foreign loans.
7.    Economic Reassessment
7.1    Despite the delays in carrying out the civil works the project had a significat econmic
impact. It enhanced domestic business and the competitiveness of Paraguay in intematonal trade;
it also helped in the social and economic development of the county. In pardcular, the comple-
tion of Rt.6 (initiated under the Fifth Highway Project) and the opening of Rt.3 (Tacuasa to Santa
Rosa) contributed to expanding the agricultural frontier of the coutry and notably increased
commercial, social and other activities in new areas.
7.2    As mentioned before, record keeping during project execution was not as complete andlor
accurate as would have been desirable; this has made it particularly difflcult to carry out accurate
analyses on completion of the project. Traffic counts, which were supposed to have been cared
out periodically as part of the project were not done, and cost accounting was too relaxed. 'he
Borrower prepared an incomplete Completion Report, particularly void of facs and figures. The
assessment of the economic yield of investmens in the project was done, therefore, as a simula-
tion exercise, in which the best information avaiable was used to generate best estates of the
respective parameters. In this situation there is a tendency to exercise caution and esmates tend
to become rather conservative. The fact tht, even under these cicumstancs, most investmens
in the project still yield fairly good rates of retr attests to the meris of the works that were
done.
7.3    Although traffic growth rates are estimated to bave ben lower ta expected at appraisal,
they were still considerable. Rt2, the maint road to Brazil, in particular, would clearly not have
been able to handle the volumes of traffic it currently carries without the imprWemens done
under the project The economic rate of retn of having invested in the Rt.2 widening and
rehabilitation works is estimated to have been around 30% (Tables 10 and 11). Silarly, the
return on the investments of having improved the Corond Oviedo to  auaa  toad (which was
originally started under the Fift Highway Project) and Its contnaton to Sat Rosa are estimat-
ed to have been 21% and 17% respectively (Tables 12 and 13). Pavig the then unpaved road
fiom Villarrica to $umi might have been somewhat premature the invme  s   ed    to
have yielded just over 7% (Table 14). However, thanks to the road, the area has matred into
a well established agriculral district. Moreover, the road is part of the important, but still
incomplete, north-south axis of the country. To complete it to Coronel Bogado, close tOD Encar-
naci6n on Rt. 1, the government has recendy placed a reques for finacing with the In-eramerican
Developmen Bank. Finally, having completed under the project the paving of RL6 from Pirap6
to the junction with Rt.7 close to Ciudad del Est, which was initiated utnder the Sixth Highway
Project and ran out of funds, was estmated to have yielded an economic rat of return of 15%
when the completion report for that project was prepared (August, 1987). 'Me road has become
the main soybean trade route to Brazil and the rest of the world; it helps to generate a large
proportion of the county's foreign exdchnge eanings and, thus, has become one of the lifelines
Paragua can't do without.

8.    Sustainability
8.1   Benefits of the civil works are expected to be sustained throughout their design life, as
paved roads historically have received better maintenance than the rest of the network. However,
as shown in the economic analysis, the estimated rates of return of the investments are predicated
on the execution of periodic maintenance, resealings in particular, an area in which MOPC has
lacked notoriously in the past.
9.    Bank Performance
9.1   The 69 staff-days spent in the field on the preparation and appras  of the project, and
166 staff-days on the supervision (Table 10) represent an average deployment of Bank staff for
this type of project. During preparation and appraisal, Bank staff failed to assess the imporace
of institutional issues that had already affected earlier projects, and did not apreciate the risks
of proposing a project without a strong government commitment to solve those problems. During
project implementation the Bank righdy supported Government efforts to complete ongoing works
before starting new ones. Supervision was adequate until 1987 when it was curtailed on account
of heightened country related uncertainties and questions about the continued execution of the
project After 1987, staff changes, the suspension of loan disbursements and the hiatus in new
lending caused by the disagreement with the government on macro-economic management, led
to a fter relaxation of supervision.
10.   Borrower Performiance
10.1  The performance of DGV in managing the civil-works contraus was satactory. How-
ever, DGV did not upgrade its engineering and planning capacity as agreed, and abandoned the
effort to enhance its road maintenance and equipment management systems after consultants who
had sustained the effort departed. Factors coutbuting to the poor performance of the main-
nace effort included financial constrai  and political pressures.
10.2   OCPT's sts as an advisory body in a system in which fal decision a   basw on
non-technical criteria, was, and continued to be wealc Fiscal constrai and lack of commiment
at top Ministry levels inhibited the development of OCP1T as an effective planning and program-
ming unit. The use of consultants to perform line functions undermined the transfer of know-
how. Those trained under the project had strong incentives to leave, and no effort was made to
reuin them. Of those who stayed, many were transferred to positions which did not require the
training they received.
10.3 The relationship between DGV and OCPIT was persistently biting and hindered effective
coordination and fruitful use of studies and consultants. Partly because of this, the political
authorities at the ministry were unconvinced of the value of planning and prefewred to retain final
decision-making, particularly on expenditures, based on non-techncal non-transparent criteria.
11.   Bank-Borrower Relationship
11.1  The protaed start-up process strained Bank-Borower relations, which were further
stressed by the delays encountered by the government in fding co-financing for the project
Satisfactory agreements were finally reached by the Government with both IDB and FONPLATA.
Ihis allowed the parallel co-fiancing of the project by the three lending instdons, easing the
burden on the government and eventually permig the project to proceed.



- 8 -
11.2  The Bank's relationship with MOPC were forced by the latter's lack of commitmem to
the institutional strengthening objectives of the project and by its breach of related covenn.
The situation was complicated by the extensive and unsuccessful discussions with the Ministry
of Finance on the system of multiple exchange rates.
12.   Consulting SericeslProcurement of Goods and Works
12.1  Consulting Services. Bank-approved procedures were used in hiring all consultants.
Consultants for OCP1T carried out the studies agreed at appraisal and those added in May 1990.
Overall, the consultants performed well, although, for reasons beyond their control, they cold
achieve limited levels of technology transfer. Supervision consultants performed satisfaorily.
12.2  Procurement of Goods and Works. Procurement of goods was limited and uneventfll.
Bank-approved ICB procedures were used to procure all civil works. Use of these procedures
did not unduly delay the contracting process and did result in reduced project cost and cosider-
able savings to the government. In the process, DGV became conversant with ICB conactDng
procedures and contracts. There was an active participation of local contractors in ICB, some
of them in joint venture with foreign fms. The Project helped, thus, to strengthen furter the
local construction industry.
13    Project Documentation and Data
13.1  The Staff Appraisal Report and legal agreements provided a very usefiu framework of
reference for project implementation. During implementation, quarterly project progress reports
by MOPC, albeit delayed, provided some information on progress and ptoject status. However,
records and information on the project were poorly kept, in a non-systemaic manner. It has been
quite difficult, if not impossible to retrieve project information ex-post, especially expenditur
data, trafflc counts, and technical data on the civil works. Bank supervision reports and the Aide
Memoire after each mission were helpful; but, by their very nature these reports are limited. The
main responsibility for record keeping is the Borrower's, and in this case performance was lax.
Bank supervision missions were weak too, in enforcing contractual agreeme  in this area.
IDB's final report on the constuction of Route 3, and an incomplete completion report prepared
by the Borrower were also used to draft this report.
