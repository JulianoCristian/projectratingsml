This second phase of IADP would extend\n            coverage to parts of Rift Valley and Coast Provinces, and to\n            additional districts in Western, Eastern, Central and Nyanza\n            Provinces. Institutional arrangements would be strengthened\n            and technical features further refined. Major components\n            would include livestock development, storage and marketing\n            facilities, small irrigation schemes, improved extension\n            services and training, conservation measures, credit\n            development, and provision of farm inputs. Rural access\n            roads and domestic water supplies would also be improved.\n            About 38,000 smallholders would be expected to adopt\n            technical crop packages, while about 24,000 smallholders\n            would benefit directly under the livestock component.\n            Disease control provisions would have a broader impact\n            throughout Project districts."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
