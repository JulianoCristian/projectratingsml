        Management Adjustment Credit (PRMAC) for Bangladesh were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, project\n            sustainability was uncertain, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: all successful\n            negotiations and implementation of reform program require\n            meeting of minds. In the course of implementation of PRMAC\n            it became clear that the communication between International\n            Development Association (IDA) and Government of Bangladesh\n            (GOB) was not always at its best. The present procedure of\n            sending IDA missions to monitor progress of the program\n            sometimes may not fully succeed in communicating GOB's\n            efforts and difficulties to IDA management. Depending on the\n            work-style or method of the task manager and/or mission\n            personnel, IDA often tends to stake narrow legalistic view\n            of the conditionalities, loosing sight of the ultimate\n            economic goals or objectives and the context within which\n            they are to be judged. It will serve both IDA and borrowers\n            better if IDA management could make assessment of the\n            evolving conditions and interpret the reforms scheme in\n            terms of the objectives and contextual specificity."}, "docdt": "1997-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
