"7070;7421", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Foot and Mouth Disease\n            Emergency Recovery Loan Project for Uruguay were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: emergency projects can be an effective\n            tool to assist a country in controlling animal disease\n            outbreaks, provided that conditions exist for a rapid Bank\n            response in terms of project preparation and disbursement of\n            funds. The design of an operation to address the economic\n            emergency caused by a zoonotic event should be sufficiently\n            flexible to combine short-term containment measures with\n            support to strengthen surveillance and prevention systems in\n            order to ensure long-term sustainability and minimize the\n            risk of subsequent emergencies. The development of an\n            individual animal tracking system represents an extremely\n            effective mechanism to ensure adequate epidemiological\n            surveillance and more rapid and effective containment in the\n            event of an outbreak. The establishment of such system will\n            be greatly facilitated by the previous existence of a\n            reliable reporting system for farm livestock inventories and\n            transactions. Enhanced individual tracking systems\n            integrating health and geo-referenced data not only help to\n            manage and mitigate disease outbreaks, but also can\n            represent a valuable tool for on-farm herd management, as\n            well as a source of strategic information on livestock\n            production, logistics, marketing, processing, and food\n            safety issues. Efficient, timely and uninterrupted operation\n            of a Livestock Information System that involves animal\n            tracking can be affected by the rules and regulations of the\n            public service, particularly in terms of procurement\n            procedures, flow of funds and remuneration levels for\n            specialized staff and Information Technology (IT) operators.\n            The achievement of a sustainable national disease free\n            status should also incorporate transboundary disease\n            surveillance and control with neighboring countries. Strong\n            and continuous programs of education and training of the\n            public and private veterinary services as well as farmers\n            and public in general are required to update the evolving\n            sanitary threats. The benefits, advantages and limitations\n            of fast-track additional financing as an instrument to\n            increase project funding should be carefully evaluated to\n            determine if it represents the best option to expand and/or\n            consolidate the outcomes of an emergency operation. If so, a\n            more detailed design and appraisal will be required, in\n            order to incorporate those elements not fully addressed in\n            the original design."}, "docdt": "2010-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
