The outbreak of FMD\n            brought the rural areas and meat industry to a standstill,\n            left an already financially embattled sector of producers\n            facing increased costs, reduced revenues and uncertainty,\n            and generated a major fiscal deficit. The Foot and Mouth\n            Disease (FMD) Emergency Recovery Project supported a\n            comprehensive set of inputs including vaccinations, training\n            and awareness campaigns, and development of a tracking\n            system that resulted in improved overall herd sanitary\n            status and the development of modern and effective\n            surveillance systems. Finally, FMD was eradicated in the\n            country, rural economy was reactivated, and high quality\n            beef exports were re-established. Uruguay positioned itself\n            as a globally recognized model for effective food safety and\n            surveillance through the establishment of their innovative\n            Animal Tracking System."}, "docdt": "2010-09-21T07:41:04Z"}
