       contain, and mitigate the impact of the outbreak of FMD,\n            through vaccination of the national herd, by strengthening\n            the monitoring, and surveillance capacity in the country, to\n            prevent future outbreaks, and, by identifying alternative\n            markets for Uruguayan beef in the short-run, and restore the\n            country's presence in the premium beef market in the\n            long-run. The project will contribute in minimizing the\n            impacts of the emergency, by defraying substantial,\n            unexpected expenditures incurred in the implementation of\n            the comprehensive containment, and recovery plan. Although\n            the achievement of a rapid, sustainable reinstatement of a\n            sanitary status, will enable the country regain access to\n            premium export markets, and re-activate livestock\n            production, risks associated with the deteriorating sanitary\n            situation in the region, and the effectiveness of similar,\n            neighboring countries' efforts, will require extreme\n            caution to avoid recurrence of the current FMD outbreak. To\n            this end, a regional task force has been created, to\n            coordinate efforts, and ensure measures are being enforced\n            region-wide, and, project activities will directly support\n            these measures."}, "docdt": "2001-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
