MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR THE URBAN TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Kenya for SDR 77.1 million (US$115.0
million equivalent) to help finance an Urban Transport Infrastructure Project. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years.
Background
2.    Kenya has a high natural population growth rate and one of the highest rates of
urbanization in the world. In the decade 1979-89, the urban population grew by over
5.1% p.a., compared to the total population growth of 2.7% p.a. Based on recent trends,
the urban share of the total population will rise from 19% in 1989 to 21% in 2000. It is
expected that during the next decade over half of the urban population increase will come
from rural-urban migration. Urban areas in Kenya function as trading centers for
agriculture and their economic importance goes beyond being centers of population and
industry. Financial services are concentrated there, as are the centers of trade, transport
and communication services, manufacturing, construction, and government. Support for
the economic growth needed to reduce unemployment and increase incomes will require
both structural reforms and investments in basic infrastructure. However, the capacity of
the local authorities, who have the mandate to provide and maintain this basic
infrastructure, has been on the decline for nearly two decades.
3.    Against this backdrop, the high rate of urban growth continues to put tremendous
strain on basic social infrastructure, local authority finances and administrative capacity.
The government recognizes that improved infrastructure is critical to attract private
domestic and foreign investment to support Kenya's economic growth. Weak local
administrative, financial and operational capacity are adversely affecting the quality of
service and maintenance of all basic municipal infrastructure. Some segments of the
economy, particularly the industrial sector and the higher income population, have found
alternate ways to compensate for the decline in service standards through such means as
private water wells, private generators for electricity, etc. The urban poor, however, who
must rely on the government for the provision of basic municipal services, are
particularly hard hit by this decline in service delivery standards, as they have no
alternative means to access such services. Over 30% of Kenya's urban population today
is below the poverty line and the proportion is higher in the larger towns such as Nairobi
and Mombasa.
4.    One of the sub-sectors which has been particularly neglected is the road network
in Kenya's cities and towns. Urban transport in Kenya was recognized as an emerging



issue late in the 1 970s, but over the past twenty years the sector has not received serious
attention. Investments in the urban transport sector have not kept up with population
demand. Traffic growth has outstripped the government's capacity to provide and
maintain adequate road infrastructure and the deterioration of the roads are visually
evident. In major towns, such as Nairobi and Mombasa, congestion has become a
problem. Road condition problems are compounded by the density of traffic during peak
periods. Poor road conditions and congestion impose serious economic costs in terms of
lost productive time, wasted fuel, increased vehicle maintenance and repair costs, higher
traffic casualties, and environmental pollution. Less than 20% of all urban roads in the
country are in adequate condition. Long travel and waiting times due to poor road
conditions particularly affect the poor, most of whom live in the periphery of the towns.
Sector Organization
5.    Kenya has 140 local authorities, ranging from  major municipal councils,
including Nairobi City Council (NCC), to town councils, county councils and urban
councils. All are corporate bodies with their own assets, staff, budgets, etc., constituted
under the 1963 Local Government Act (Cap 265). In the late 1980s, their numbers grew
rapidly, reflecting a policy of dispersed urbanization enunciated in 1986. This expansion
has exacerbated the shortage of qualified personnel in the local authorities in the areas of
financial management and engineering capacity. Most of the local authorities today have
financial bases which are grossly inadequate to maintain their assets and cover their
administrative overhead.
6.    Urban local authorities have relatively wide responsibilities. All are responsible
for land use planning and development control; all maintain roads and are responsible for
street lighting and cleaning, refuse collection, fire protection, environmental health,
markets, bus parks, slaughter houses, parks and recreation. Several local authorities also
operate water supply and/or sewerage systems. County councils manage the rural local
authorities. Larger local authorities operate many services with their own staff and
equipment, while the staff and operating resources of the smaller ones are supplemented
by central government equipment and/or technical supervision. The Ministry of Local
Government (MLG) has overall jurisdiction over the functioning of the all local
authorities in Kenya. Local authorities are required to operate as autonomous institutions
under the Local Government Act. The provisions and procedures under the Local
Government Act, are not without problems. There is a growing recognition at all levels
of government that the current local authority system in Kenya is in need of considerable
overhaul if it is to meet the economic and social needs of its citizens.
Municipal Reform Initiatives
7.    The local authority system (its finances and operations) has deteriorated to such
an extent that fundamental structural changes are necessary to provide the required
environment for sustainable municipal infrastructure development.  Both physical
investments and a concurrent program of municipal reforms and capacity building of the
local authorities are necessary to ensure sustainability of all municipal infrastructure
investments, including urban road infrastructure investments. In 1990, the Bank, in



collaboration with the government, undertook a comprehensive review of Kenya's local
government system, particularly its finances. The findings of this review are contained in
the report "Kenya: Local Government Finance Study", (Report No. 8997-KE, April 23,
1992). The primary objective of this study was to identify a reform program necessary to
bring the local authorities of Kenya out of their current financial and operational distress
so that, over time, they would be better able to plan, finance, deliver and maintain basic
urban services, such as road infrastructure. Based on the study, a Municipal Reform
Program (MRP) is currently being formulated to strengthen management and financial
capacity of the local authorities to sustain and maintain infrastructure investments. The
MRP, many elements of which are already under way, is assisting the local authorities by
strengthening their financial and managerial capabilities, and enhancing their technical
capabilities in infrastructure maintenance. The key elements of the program include: (i)
improving local authority financial, technical and personnel management capacity and
operations; (ii) improving local resource mobilization and (iii) reforming the current
Local Government Act. Ultimately, the objective would be to build adequate capacity
and to create financing mechanisms whereby the local authorities would be in a position
to finance their local infrastructure needs without continuing dependence on the central
government.
Urban Transport Sector Issues
8.    The major problem in Kenya's urban roads is not the lack of network capacity,
but the poor quality of roads as a result of weak financial, management and technical
capacity of most of the local authorities which have the primary responsibility for
investing in and maintaining the urban road network. While deteriorating infrastructure is
by no means limited to the urban road network, the extent of the problem is most evident
and urgent in this sub-sector, requiring immediate and substantial rehabilitation to
maintain and enhance the efficiency of the system. Economic and financial costs of
delaying effective intervention would be considerable. Although the central government
currently bears most of the financial burden for maintaining the urban road network, this
should be primarily the responsibility of the local authorities. Consequently, a concurrent
set of municipal reforms aimed at improving financial and operational performance of the
local authorities is essential in order to provide a sustainable environment and the
necessary revenue base such that the local authorities can assume increasing road
maintenance responsibility over time. While several broad urban transport issues (such
as more effective demand management, public transport policy reforms and strategic
transport planning in the large cities as Nairobi and Mombasa) need to be addressed over
time, these issues are not as urgent as the need to improve road maintenance capacity of
the local authorities. Road maintenance is a very significant local authority function and
expenditures on routine and periodic maintenance account for over 60% of local authority
recurrent budgets.  Instilling maintenance discipline among the local authorities in
general, and for the road sub-sector in particular, is critical to sector development efforts.
9.    At the GOK's request, the Bank prepared a Sector Study during 1989-1990
entitled "Kenya: Urban Transport Development Issues", (Report No. 7881-KE, May 9,
1990), which proposed a program of policy and institutional reforms and investments for
Nairobi and other large towns. The Study identified several issues which needed to be



- 4 -
resolved to improve Kenya's urban transport infrastructure system. The key among them
were: (a) adopting an investment policy framework to ensure allocative efficiency; (b)
strengthening the planning, management and operational capacity of sector agencies; (c)
improving road safety; (d) enlarging the revenue base of local authorities; (e) developing
a metropolitan growth strategy which relieves development pressures in Nairobi; (f)
establishing and enforcing appropriate demand management policies and programs; and
(g) increasing the efficiency of public transport operations. While all of the above issues
are significant to urban transport problems in Kenya, urgent emphasis needs to be placed
on improving basic maintenance and strengthening maintenance management capacity in
the sub-sector; and this is the primary focus of the Urban Transport Infrastructure Project.
The Project, however, lays the groundwork to address the broader sector development
issues over time.
Urban Transport Sector Development Strategy
10.   The government's immediate strategy focuses on a program of road rehabilitation
and maintenance, with emphasis on building both financial management and maintenance
capacity within the local authorities. This program will complement and support the
institutional, financial and operational initiatives under the MRP, and has been designed
to address priority tasks, while setting the stage for some of the longer term reforms for
the sub-sector. Weak technical and institutional capacity at the local authority level has
been a significant cause of urban road system deterioration. Virtually all maintenance
work has been traditionally reserved for execution by the local authorities' work forces,
but local engineering staffs are weak.   Major policy reforms in road maintenance
funding, contracting out road maintenance activities and strengthening local authority
management and financial capacity are essential for a sustainable solution to the urban
transport problem. Under the Project, there will be a major shift away from urban road
maintenance by force account of the local authorities towards contracting out such
services.  Increasing maintenance management capacity also requires immediate
attention.  The concept of an independent maintenance management and work
inspectorate function is being introduced under the Project to ensure high quality of work
and efficient use of resources. These policy reforms, along with those under the MRP,
are the key elements of the sub-sector development strategy as well as design features of
the Project.
11.   Increased financial resources are required to meet the backlog of road investments
as well as to ensure their sustainability through the provision of adequate maintenance.
Local authority revenues are insufficient to maintain the urban roads, even if all were in
maintainable condition. The government has now introduced a Road Maintenance Levy
Fund (RMLF), which is financed by a levy on automotive fuels and charges on transit
vehicles. The RMLF is designed to augment the overall level of domestic funding for
maintenance, in addition to regular budgetary expenditures.  This Fund has been
introduced to help finance the costs of maintaining the entire road system in Kenya,
including the urban roads.

Project Rationale
12.   A well functioning system of local government which can provide the necessary
quality of a full range of basic public services, on a sustainable basis, is one of the
necessary element to support Kenya's strategy of improving infrastructure, including
local authority roads. Having an efficient road network in Kenya's towns, the centers of
economic activity, ranks as a high priority need given the current poor condition and the
long neglect of the network. The dual objectives of having an efficient urban road system
and having a well functioning local government system are closely interrelated. The
Project serves as an instrument to bring together these two objectives and establishes the
primacy of maintenance, particularly in a resource constrained environment. While
improvements in many aspects of the sector are necessary, the Project focuses on high
impact and high return investments as a priority to ensure long term sustainability. It
explicitly recognizes that efforts to improve the physical quality of infrastructure must be
accompanied by creating a supporting policy, institutional and financial environment in
which the investments are made. The Project simultaneously aims to improve the
institutional and financial capacity of the sector agencies to ensure that the full benefits of
the physical investments are adequately captured, while supporting a program of physical
investments which provides a tangible framework to promote sector reform efforts. The
Project, thus, focuses on the hardware (improved network quality, maintenance and
engineering practices) aspects of sector development efforts, to complement the software
(improved financial and operational performance of the sector agencies) aspects of the
program which are being pursued in parallel through the MRP.
Project Objectives
13.   The objectives of the Project are to: (i) increase the economic efficiency of the
urban road network; and (ii) build sustainable road maintenance capacity - institutional,
financial and engineering - in the Project towns and the MLG through a program of
municipal reforms. The Project represents a substantial investment by the Government in
Kenya's urban centers for the benefit of the national economy. The Project would serve
to: (i) establish adequate maintenance capacity and encourage basic maintenance
discipline in all the local authorities and assist the MLG to efficiently plan, manage, and
finance the maintenance of urban roads; (ii) improve the conditions of the urban roads
through a balanced investment program of routine and periodic maintenance,
rehabilitation, improvements and improved traffic management measures in the Project
towns; (iii) direct investments towards those segments of the urban road network in the
Project towns which are used largely by the poor and improve the latter's access to non-
motorized transport facilities; (iv) introduce measures to increase implementation
efficiency through increased use of existing private sector capacity for both construction
and maintenance; and (v) improve management, financial and operational practices of the
Project towns so as to strengthen their capacity to better finance and maintain road
infrastructure.

Project Description
14.   The Project covers 26 urban centers in Kenya. The local authorities are: Nairobi,
Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret and 22 other urban centers. The Project consists of five
components:  (i) road, transport and traffic management infrastructure investments
(US$118.5 million); (ii) capacity building (US$14.5 million); (iii) program and policy
studies (US$0.8 million); (iv) Project implementation support (US$19.7 million); and (v)
future Project preparation support (US$1.5 million). The total cost of the Project is
estimated at US$155.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of about US$62.0
million equivalent (40% of total Project cost). The government's contribution to the
Project, totaling about US$40.0 million equivalent, will be provided to the beneficiary
towns through the MLG. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The economic and financial analysis tables and key performance indicators
are shown in Schedule B. The procurement and the disbursement profiles are shown in
Schedule C.  A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in Kenya are given in Schedules D and E, respectively. A Staff Appraisal
Report (Report No. 13848-KE) is being distributed separately. A map is also attached.
Project Implementation
15.   MLG would have overall responsibility for implementation of the Project. The
Transport Management Unit (TMU), under the MLG's Urban Development Department,
would act as the Project Manager with specific responsibilities and functions: (i) overall
Project management; (ii) overseeing maintenance planning, budgeting, management and
works inspection undertaken by the local authorities; (iii) design review; (iv) procurement
management and contract administration; (v) Project accounting, financial management
and control; (vi) information technology and management information systems; and, (vii)
general administration and facilities management. The Project will be implemented
according to an agreed Project Implementation Plan and the civil works will be executed
in two phases. For the first phase, covering years 1 through 3, all investments have been
fully designed and an initial allocation of Project resources has been made to the Project
towns, largely based on their population (allocations to Nairobi and Mombasa have been
adjusted somewhat due to their large population compared to other towns).  For the
second phase, covering years 4 through 6, investments have been identified for each town
and design work will be completed during the first phase. In addition to annual reviews of
routine maintenance performance by the Project towns, there would be a comprehensive
mid term review of the Project.
16.   A Project town's share in the total second phase investments will be based on its
overall performance during the first phase, as determined by agreed technical
performance criteria, during the mid term review. A Maintenance Management Section
(MMS) within TMU would monitor the physical performance of works implemented by
the towns. It would also be responsible for the management and works inspectorate
function. For all works that would be implemented by TMU on behalf of the towns, there
would be consultation with the local authorities during the planning, design and
construction phases. Funds for routine and periodic maintenance (from the RMLF and
regular budgetary allocations) for all local governments would be channeled through



TMU which would be responsible for allocating the Project funds among local
authorities and for undertaking financial and performance auditing in accordance with
agreed guidelines. The local authorities would have the responsibility for: (i) preparing
annual maintenance plans (which would have to be approved by their councils); (ii)
signing-off on the list of works; and (iii) undertaking routine maintenance (by those
Project towns who have been assessed to have adequate capacity). In addition, each local
authority will be responsible for contract management and supervision, with assistance
from the TMU. The government would enter into subsidiary agreements with each of
the Project town indicating detailed implementation arrangements and the respective roles
and obligations of the parties during Project implementation.
Project Sustainability
17.   The Project contains policy and institutional components which are designed to
ensure sustainability of the investments. Initial eligibility requirement for participation
by the Project towns is based on past maintenance performance. The allocation of second
phase investment funds to a particular Project town would be linked to its prior
maintenance performance, as well as improved local revenue generation and expenditure
management efforts, so as to provide an incentive for continued good maintenance
performance and to sustain maintenance discipline.  Further improvement of the
maintenance management capabilities of the Project towns and the MLG related to the
urban road network will be pursued through the introduction of independent works
inspectorate and maintenance audit functions. Project sustainability, as it applies to the
issue of financing maintenance of urban roads, can be assured only through
improvements in the overall financial and operational capacity of the local authorities.
The recently established RMLF is an important step towards finding a long-term solution
to national and urban road maintenance financing problems. Long term improvements in
the financial health of the local authorities and in the quality and efficiency of local level
service delivery capacity are being pursued through the MRP. The MRP needs to be
viewed as a necessary and complementary effort to the Project. As a first step in the
MRP, initiatives are already underway through a Japanese PHRD Grant funded Project
for a selected number of towns aimed at improving accounting, budgeting, resource
mobilization and expenditure management practices.  These initiatives are already
beginning to yield positive results by way of realistic budgetary practices, improved
revenue yields and better expenditure management in a number of Project towns. These
efforts are also being closely coordinated with a similar initiative funded by the GTZ for
some of the smaller local authorities in Kenya. There is now a concerted effort by both
the government and the donor community to create the necessary institutional, financial
and operational environment to ensure sustainability of investments at the local level.
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement
18.   The Bank's involvement in the urban sector started with the Nairobi Sites and
Services Project (Cr. 543-KE and Ln. 1105-KE) in 1975, followed by the Second Urban
Project (Cr. 791-KE and Ln. 1550-KE) in 1978.  In 1983, in parallel with the
implementation of the Second Urban Project, the Secondary Towns Project (Cr. 1390-KE
and Ln. 2319-KE) was initiated and was completed in 1991.  The lessons learned from



the Secondary Towns Project, as well as prior Projects in the sector, are documented in
the "Performance Audit Report: Kenya: Secondary Towns Project", (Report No. 13127,
June 9, 1994).
19.   Previous experience with urban Projects, as well as with road sector Projects in
Kenya hold a number of useful lessons: (i) Project design must reflect the intent, interests
and priorities of the beneficiaries and the stakeholders to ensure ownership of the Project;
(ii) essential to success of any sector development effort is the need to strengthen local
institutional capacity; (iii) adequate provision of domestic funding for maintenance is
essential to ensure sustainability after Project completion; and (iv) in general, any first
effort in a sector, or a subsector, needs to be supported by a continuing dialogue on sector
policy initiatives and reforms to ensure that the Project fully supports an agreed set of
sector goals and policies. Follow-up operations are required to cement gains and extend
policy and institutional gains not fully addressed by the initial Project. These lessons
have been incorporated in the Project design through sustained dialogue between IDA,
GOK, MLG, and the officials of the local authorities. This dialogue was carried out
through a series of workshops and on-site consultations between the technicians, the
executives and elected public representatives.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
20.   The Project is fully consistent with GOK's development objectives as well as the
Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy which is being distributed separately for
discussions by the Board. In particular, the strategy focuses on supporting changes in the
macro-economic incentive framework and improving infrastructure to promote
accelerated and efficient economic growth based on export-oriented private sector
investment. The Project would support the Bank Group's objective of building the
maintenance capacity of sector agencies to ensure the sustainability of physical
investments. IDA's involvement would assist the government in: (i) strengthening
technical, financial and managerial capacity of the local authorities; (ii) increasing the
economic efficiency of the urban road network, and improve accessibility for the poor;
and (iii) establishing efficient organizational and funding arrangements for road
infrastructure maintenance throughout Kenya. The Project would be supported by a
broader program of municipal reforms, which itself may require considerable time to be
achieved, but which are essential to ensure sustainability of all municipal infrastructure
investments. The Project would also complement the Bank Group's on-going support for
the classified road network and rural roads in Kenya. The government is fully committed
to the comprehensive long-term sector reform and development program but lacks
domestic technical and financial capacity to implement it without strong external support.
Because of the number and complexity of the sector issues involved, no other donor has
yet shown serious interest in this sector. The Bank Group's involvement at this stage is
the best option for initiating major and lasting improvements.
Agreed Actions
21.   The government, in its Macro-economic and Structural Policy Framework 1995-
97 document, submitted to the Consultative Group Meeting in December 1994, undertook



- 9 -
to raise domestic funding for road maintenance to 50% of maintenance needs in FY96
and to full funding by the year 2000. A detailed annual maintenance funding plan,
consistent with the above undertaking, has been agreed with the government. In addition,
the following have also been agreed: (i) a list of Project towns which are in compliance
with routine maintenance performance requirements so as to be considered initially
eligible for participating in the Project, supported by independent audit reports verifying
their actual routine maintenance performance; (ii) the carrying out of a mid-term review
by March 31, 1999; and (iii) an undertaking to make available, through the MLG, the
following annual amounts (totaling US$40.0 million equivalent) for the Project to be
used primarily for routine maintenance expenditures: FY95/96 - US$4.0 million,
FY96/97 and FY97/98 - US$7.0 million per year, FY98/99 - US$8.0 million, FY99/00
and FYOO/01 - US$7.0 million per year, to be passed to the Project towns through the
MLG. MLG will provide IDA with quarterly analytical statements showing amounts
received by MLG and amounts disbursed for routine maintenance expenditures and other
Project related activities. The government has submitted to IDA a satisfactory Letter of
Sectoral Policy on municipal and financial reforms as well as the time frame for taking
key actions, and a final Project implementation plan.
22.   The following would be conditions of credit effectiveness: (I) MLG would have
concluded subsidiary agreements with at least 6 of the 26 Project towns indicating
detailed implementation arrangements and respective roles and obligations during Project
implementation; (ii) GOK would have made available and deposited with MLG an initial
amount of not less than $1,670,000 equivalent; and (iii) MLG would have appointed all
key staff within the TMU as agreed necessary for efficient Project implementation.
Environmental Aspects
23.   The Project has been classified as Category B. The Project would have few
adverse environmental impacts. All maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement works
affect existing roads and do not involve any land acquisition or permanent resettlement of
people. The major capacity improvements in Nairobi have been designed to utilize only
existing rights-of-way. Some tree felling would be needed but replanting has been
included in the construction contracts. For the most part, environmental effects of the
Project would be positive. The most significant would be the expected reduction in the
rate of growth of urban traffic accidents and fatalities. Decreased air and noise pollution
from exhaust fumes, dust from unsealed roads and congestion, as well as improved
drainage and better street lighting, would positively contribute to an improved urban
environment. An "Environmental Mitigation Plan" has been agreed with the government.
Provisions would be included in civil works contracts to cover landscape preservation,
prevention and abatement of water pollution, dust abatement (during work and materials
transport operations), use of pesticides, disposal of waste materials, construction site
sanitation and safety, traffic safety and signing, as well as fire prevention. Correctly
applied and enforced, these clauses will ensure that construction and maintenance works
cause minimal impact on people living near the Project roads.



- 10-
Poverty Impact
24.   While the primary objective of the Project is to improve urban transport
infrastructure management, with particular emphasis on maintenance, the needs and
concerns of the urban poor have been considered through specific Project design and
selection criteria. The design of road rehabilitation and improvement works was
specifically broadened from traditional approaches to place emphasis on footpaths and
other facilities for non-motorized road users. The criteria for selecting the location of
road works specifically identified needs in the low-income areas of each town, along
with those of industrial areas and city centers. In many cases, improvements were
selected to improve travel between these areas, increasing the access of the urban poor to
jobs and city services. This was achieved through off-road paths or footpath and cycle
track improvements even where the road itself was otherwise not considered for
rehabilitation or maintenance. The Project supports pilot works of the Non-Motorized
Transport (NMT) Study undertaken by the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program
(SSATP), which looks more deeply at the mobility needs of low-income urban
communities, and identifies small-scale works designed to meet these needs. The traffic
management component of the Project includes provision for minor improvements to
intersections, pedestrian crossings and bus stops, aimed at safety, congestion and public
transport needs. While this component is not directly targeted at the poor, many of its
benefits will accrue to pedestrians and bus passengers--most of whom are the poor.
Program Objective Category
25.   The Project will primarily contribute to increasing public sector efficiency
through a program of institutional, financial and operational improvements in the local
authorities. It will also support and encourage increased road maintenance work by the
private sector.
Participatory Approach
26.   Ample participation has been achieved in Project preparation by MLG and local
authorities. Project preparation efforts and Project design reflect deliberate and sustained
dialogue between IDA, GOK, MLG, and the local authorities. The MLG and the local
authorities met regularly to review Project preparation, resolve problems and reflect local
priorities in the Project design. This has helped to create a strong sense of ownership of
the Project in both the national government and in the local authorities. The ownership of
the Project by the local authorities is demonstrated through signed subsidiary agreements
reflecting the priorities established by these local authorities and their acceptance of the
performance criteria which will determine second phase allocation of project funds. The
existing Inter-ministerial Urban Transport Policy Coordination Committee and the Inter-
ministerial Technical Steering Committee (ITSC) would continue to play their roles in
Project implementation. Under the ITSC, subcommittees, grouping together Project
towns on size and regional basis, have been formed. These subcommittees meet to
discuss technical aspects of the Project and prepare recommendations to the parent ITSC
committee. They would continue to meet during the Project implementation, providing a
forum for local authorities to discuss issues affecting the execution of the Project.



Benefits
27.   Direct benefits would accrue to the economy by  (i) increasing the economic
efficiency of the urban road network through reduced vehicle operating costs; (ii)
reducing travel time and traffic congestion; (iii) reducing future rehabilitation and
improvement costs through better maintenance planning programs; and (iv) better traffic
management measures. A concurrent program for the institutional strengthening of the
local authorities in their financial and operational practices will enhance economic
efficiency of municipal infrastructure investments, including those under the Project. The
urban poor would benefit directly through spot improvements in and around low income
residential areas; improved access to the work place and living areas; extensive
foot/bicycle path improvements, improved drainage, and better road safety measures.
Indirect benefits would result from the impact of institutional strengthening and capacity
building, particularly in the area of maintenance management and project
implementation. Some of these initiatives would also benefit road investments in local
authorities outside the scope of the Project through the application of the same
maintenance management practices as those designed under the Project. Dissemination
of the technical expertise and improved management capacity supported by the Project
would, in the longer-term, benefit the country as a whole by improving the planning and
execution of similar investment programs. The overall economic rate of return (ERR)
for the first phase investments (representing 48% of total civil works) in periodic
maintenance, rehabilitation and capacity improvements is estimated at 41% based on
quantifiable benefits such as reduced vehicle operating costs, reduced travel time, etc.
The composition of this overall ERR is estimated at 55% for the periodic maintenance
and rehabilitation component and 28% for the capacity improvement component. These
economic rates of return are appropriate to the nature of the investments. Sensitivity
analysis of the ERR for the first phase periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and capacity
improvements indicates that with a combination of 20% increase in costs, 20% decline in
quantifiable benefits and no subsequent period maintenance after the first cycle, overall
first phase ERR would decline to about 18% -- a rate which would still justify the
investments.  Second phase investments in period maintenance, rehabilitation and
capacity improvements, to be decided at mid-term review and subject to prior
performance, will require a minimum 12% ERR to qualify. The routine maintenance
component yields a benefit cost ratio of about 9.9 under base value assumptions. If the
proportion of high traffic volume roads was reduced by 50% the benefit cost ratio for
routine maintenance would fall to about 6.1.
Risks
28.   The Project has been designed as an instrument for introducing fundamental
changes in the way local level infrastructure investments are designed, financed,
implemented and maintained in Kenya. There are inherent risks associated with trying to
change the status quo. For the Project, the main risks are: (i) inadequate maintenance
discipline by the Project towns and the MLG and insufficient funding from GOK for
sustained maintenance of the urban road network; (ii) failure to adequately improve the
management and technical capacity of the MLG to effectively manage an investment



- 12-
program covering a large number of towns; and (iii) delays in implementing the required
reforms under the MRP to improve financial and operational performance of the local
authorities. These potential risks have been considered during the preparation and design
of the Project. The Letter of Sector Policy, the MRP and the establishment of the RMLF
(as a supplementary revenue source in addition to regular budgetary allocations) to fund
maintenance, provide strong foundations for the Project. In addition, the institutional
support component of the Project and the agreed implementation arrangements are both
designed to help manage these risks. Institutional risks will be mitigated through the
implementation of a capacity strengthening program to enhance staff skills in
maintenance management as well as other key areas such as procurement and contract
management, and Project management.  It would be unrealistic to expect that equal
progress can be made with all local authorities, in strengthening their capabilities or
enlisting support and commitment. Initial eligibility requirement for the Project towns is
based on past maintenance performance. The linking of subsequent allocation of
investment funds to maintenance performance, as well as to improved financial
performance, is designed to provide incentive for continued good maintenance
performance and to sustain maintenance discipline.  To ensure that the Project is
consistent with sector goals and policies, the Project's development objectives would be
pursued through continued sector dialogue with the government.
Recommendation
29.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

works under the project. ERR calculations have been based on costs and benefits, after adjusting for
taxes and duties.
2   Financial rate of return is not applicable in this project since there is no specific revenue generating
entity to which financial benefits accrue.
3   The Project aims to gradually increase the proportion of maintenance expenditure for the urban road
network financed by direct user charges (through the RMLF).

KENYA - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
As of September 30, 1995, there were 18 ongoing projects in the Kenya portfolio representing total
commitments, exclusive of cancellations, of $625.4 million. Undisbursed amounts totaled $401.4 million. FY95
disbursements totaling $151.4 million were only slightly below the $168.4 million and $166.8 million
disbursed in FY93 and FY94, respectively. However, the FY95 disbursement ratio (i.e., for investment
operations) of 16.3 percent showed an improvement over the respective FY93 and FY94 ratios of 14.2
percent and 15.4 percent. Disbursements for investment operations during the first quarter of FY96 were
$29.8 million (translating into a disbursement ratio of 6.6 percent).
As of September 30, 1995, four of the 18 ongoing credits were rated (in the course of the FY95 ARPP
exercise) as "problem" projects - all four were carryovers from the FY94 exercise. Since the FY95 ARPP exercise,
one of these projects has been upgraded to "satisfactory" in view of progress made in meeting outstanding policy-
related conditionalities; another project is being restructured; and for the remaining two projects, action programs
for addressing outstanding issues (procurement in one instance; inadequate budgetary allocations and
noncompliance with financial covenants) have been agreed with the Government. The FY95 experience in
dealing with these problem projects and a number of developments as elaborated below, should result in an
improved FY96 portfolio with supervision inputs (i.e., in tenns of supervision staffweeks) similar to the
FY95 average of slightly less than 16 staffweeks per project.
However, Government commitment and ownership remains critical to timely and efficient project
implementation, including resolution of major implementation problems if and as they arise. To this extent,
IDA will continue its supervision dialogue and follow-up with the Government, especially through the
Resident Mission and the recently established Operations Unit, on a number of generic implementation
issues and corresponding remedial actions agreed within the CPPR process initiated in August 1994 - the
first such exercise since the October 1990 Country Implementation Review. The major objective of this
exercise was to initiate an ongoing process by which the Borrower would play a greater role in overseeing
and monitoring the portfolio. The primary generic areas for which specific bottlenecks were identified and
dated corrective actions agreed, included (a) provision of adequate budgetary allocations, (b) more timely
processing and monitoring of drawdowns and replenishments of the Special Accounts (which are centrally
maintained and managed by the Borrower), and (c) timely preparation and auditing of all accounts required
under IDA-financed projects, and subsequent submission of the respective audit reports to IDA. A mini-
CPPR meeting was held in March 1995 (another review was held in July) to follow up on progress since
last August, and further actions and timeframes agreed within which to resolve these outstanding issues.
Results have been encouraging, although mixed. With one exception (noted above), the IDA
portfolio was adequately budgeted in FY95.  In addition, a number of projects have experienced
implementation delays resulting from counterpart funding not being released in a timely manner - adequate
and timely project budgetary provisions, including counterpart funds, will therefore continue to be a focus
of supervision attention during the coming year. While improvements in special accounts management and
utilization are being achieved, progress in timely submission of required/overdue audit reports has been
less-than-anticipated. The ongoing dialogue through the CPPR process initiated last year is expected to
facilitate resolution of these problems. Progress will continue to be reviewed periodically and additional
further corrective steps taken, as necessary. In the meantime, the Government has been advised that
unsatisfactory progress in these areas as per agreed benchmarks will result in IDA taking appropriate
remedial actions and could result in delays in future project processing.
