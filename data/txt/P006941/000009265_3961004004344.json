and\n            Sewerage Institute (AyA) strengthen the institutional\n            framework for the provision of water and sewerage services\n            in the country, including promotion of private sector\n            participation and develop and implement sound sector\n            policies; (b) support AyA in carrying out an institutional\n            and financial restructing strategy, to increase efficiency\n            in operations and achieve and consolidate financial\n            viability; (c) improve the quality of water supply\n            operations in the San Jose Metropolitan Area (SJMA); and (d)\n            improve the sewerage services in SJMA, mainly in poor areas.\n            To achieve its objectives, the project will include the\n            following components:  (a) the institutional strengthening\n            program includes technical assistance, equipment and staff\n            training for:  (i) developing and implementing improved\n            sector policies and institutional framework for the sector;\n            (ii) improving AyA's financial management and corporate\n            planning; and (iii) decentralizing AyA's activities\n            taking into account private sector participation and\n            possibilities for operating costs reduction; (b) the\n            unaccounted-for-water program includes technical assistance,\n            equipment and staff training mainly for:  (i) metering; (ii)\n            commercial system improvement; (iii) updating of consumer\n            and pipes cadastres; and (iv) operational control of the\n            SJMA water system; (c) The SJMA water supply and\n            distribution component includes civil works, equipment and\n            consultancy services for the construction of four wells,\n            pipe distribution facilities, storage tanks and pumping\n            stations; (d) the SJMA sewerage rehabilitation component\n            includes civil works, equipment and consultancy services\n            for:  (i) the rehabilitation of sewage collectors and\n            pumping stations; and (ii) construction of sewage collectors\n            in a poor neighborhood of the SJMA to improve its\n            environmental conditions; and (e) the operations and\n            maintenance component includes civil works, equipment and\n            technical assistance for:  (i) operation and maintenance of\n            sewerage systems; and (ii) rehabilitation of the Orosi pipeline."}, "docdt": "1993-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
