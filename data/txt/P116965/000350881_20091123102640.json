    the United Mexican States for an Influenza Prevention and\n            Control Project. The loan will help finance the costs\n            associated with the Mexican Government's effort to\n            monitor and control the A/H1N1 influenza epidemic, which\n            originated in Mexico in March of this year and has\n            occasioned more than 350 fatalities in the country. Given\n            that epidemiologists expect a second wave of influenza to\n            hit Mexico during the winter, the Mexican Government has\n            requested Bank support in strengthening its capacity to\n            monitor the spread of the virus (and influenza viruses more\n            generally) and to control influenza epidemic waves. The\n            project will assist Mexico in improving its National\n            Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE) including the\n            upgrading of the Borrower's national reference\n            laboratory for epidemiological surveillance, strengthening\n            the infrastructure to effectively distribute medicines,\n            vaccines and medical supplies and replenishing and expanding\n            the country's strategic reserves thereof."}, "docdt": "2009-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
