Its purpose is to minimize social unrest\n            and economic hardship, and help the country return to\n            pursuing long-standing human resource development\n            objectives. The ERP will bececome an integral part of\n            Burundi's 1995 budget, and is based on estimated needs\n            in five priority sectors (health, primary and secondary\n            education, agriculture, infrastructure and private sector).\n            It comprises import finance, civil works annd technical\n            assistance to: improve the social conditions of the\n            population; create employment; rehabilitate infrastructure;\n            and restore basic government functions. For health and\n            education, the most affected sectors, special programs have\n            been included such as: 1) a social fund for health, covering\n            medical expenses for parts of the population that cannot\n            afford them, and technical assistance necessary to hire and\n            train qualified medical staff and provide employment\n            incentives; and 2) special funds for education, to allow for\n            the training of new teachers and financial support of\n            families and children severely affected by the crisis."}, "docdt": "1994-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
