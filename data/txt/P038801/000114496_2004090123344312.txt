Re:
Loan 2668-CO Rural Transport Sector
Project - Amendment to Loan Agreement
Dear Mr. Director:
I refer to the Loan Agreement for the above referred project between the Fondo 
Nacional de Caminos Vecinales (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated May 27, 1986.
I am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to your request to amend the 
Loan Agreement to increase the Authorized Allocation to facilitate replenishment and 
more efficient use of the Special Account to match the requirements of the accelerated 
project implementation.
Based on your request, the Bank hereby proposes to amend the Loan Agreement by 
deleting Paragraph 1 (c) of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement and substituting it by 
the following:
"(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 
$6,000,000 to be 
withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 3 
(a) of this Schedule".
 
Because of its interest in the project, we are sending a copy of this letter to 
the representative of the Guarantor, the Minister of Finance and Public Credit.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing the enclosed copy of 
this letter and returning it to us.
Sincerely,
By /s/ Ping-Cheung Loh
