ARTICLE II
Guarantee
Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any of
its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, the Guarantor

﻿ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, specific security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority
over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external debt,
which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of the
creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization or
distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank,
equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and the Guarantor, in creating or
permitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provi-
sion to that effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitu-
tional or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with
respect to any lien created on assets of any of its political or
administrative subdivisions, the Guarantor shall promptly and at
no cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other
charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets
satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely


﻿as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking trans-
actions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative sub-
division thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or
operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any such
subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange assets held
by any institution performing the functions of a central bank or
exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions, for the Guarantor.
Section 3.02. (a) The Guarantor covenants that it will not
take, or cause or permit any of its political subdivisions or any
of its agencies or any agency of any such political subdivisions
to take, any action which would prevent or interfere with the per-
formance by the Borrower of its obligations contained in the Loan
Agreement or with the performance by the Project Companies of their
respective obligations contained in the Project Agreements and will
take or cause to be taken all reasonable action necessary or appro-
priate to enable the Borrower and the Project Companies, respec-
tively, to perform such obligations.

(b) Without limitation or restriction upon the provisions of

electricity and for transfers of funds from the Global Guarantee
Fund to act in respect of any application of any of the Project
Companies (1) for the setting and adjustment of such rates within
a period of not more than 30 days after receipt of such applica-
tion, and (2) for any such transfer of funds at such time as may
be required to supplement the revenues of such Project Company,
provided that such Project Company complies with the Guarantor's
requirements therefor; and (ii) take, or cause to be taken, upon
request all reasonable action required for the prompt issuance
to the Project Companies of such import and other permits and
licenses as shall be necessary for the acquisition and importation
of goods and services required for the carrying out of the Project
in accordance with the provisions of the Project Agreements.
Section 3.03. The Guarantor shall present to the Bank, when
available: (i) terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank of a
study, which the Guarantor intends to carry out or cause to be
carried out, on the structure of electricity rates in Brazil; and
(ii) the results of such study.
