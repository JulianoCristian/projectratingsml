(2) create a general cadastre\n            system providing clear and current definition of real estate\n            parcels forming the basis for real estate registration; and\n            (3) set up a simple, safe, and cost effective procedure for\n            land transactions. There are three project components. The\n            first develops cadastre by supporting aerial photography,\n            base map development, cadastral surveys, and a Land\n            Information System; by strengthening national and local\n            cadastre offices; and by supporting the Cadastre\n            Implementation Group that manages the cadastre component.\n            The second component establishes and operates a land book\n            system, trains staff, and provides institutional support for\n            local land book offices and the land book implementation\n            group. The third component provides institutional\n            strengthening by supporting the project coordination unit;\n            providing technical assistance to guide implementation and\n            enhance planning and management capacity of the project\n            agencies; and information system design and development and\n            assistance in carrying out cost recovery studies."}, "docdt": "1997-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
