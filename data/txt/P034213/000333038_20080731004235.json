Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            borrower commitment and ownership can turn even the most\n            difficult of projects around. Sometimes this commitment can\n            come from political events which have nothing directly to do\n            with the project. The building of public confidence in the\n            system and ensuring the public has access to the\n            professional support services (notaries, real estate agents)\n            is necessary not only for successful implementation, but for\n            truly achieving the objective of secure property markets.\n            Projects may place too high expectations on automation and\n            underestimate the complexity of large scale information\n            technology system development. Sustainability needs to be\n            built into project design; and this is largely about human\n            capacity. Farmers and rural business owners will respond\n            enthusiastically to innovative technologies corresponding to\n            their needs. There has to be consultation and a demand\n            driven element in any serious research and extension endeavor."}, "docdt": "2008-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
