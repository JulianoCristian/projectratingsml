achieve broad based\n            growth for poverty reduction. The project will assist the\n            Government of Mozambique (GoM) to implement key policy\n            actions outlined in its 2006-2010 Second Action Plan for the\n            Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA II) to improve public\n            financial management systems and adopting growth enhancing\n            reforms. The PRSC-8 is expected to help the GoM in: (a) the\n            consolidation and deepening of reforms in economic\n            management in the areas of budget implementation through\n            improvements in public financial management systems,\n            government procurement systems, internal and external audit\n            functions, and transparency in use of government resources;\n            and (b) removing constraints to growth, notably by\n            simplifying business procedures and developing a legal\n            framework to facilitate private sector participation in the\n            provision of infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2012-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
