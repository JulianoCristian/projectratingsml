                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (IDA 50650-MZ) was approved by the World Bank's Board of Directors on March 15, 2012 after the completion of six prior actions. The
                         program was signed on March 26, 2012 and became effective on May 7, 2012, after the conditions for effectiveness were met, including the issuance of a satisfactory Legal Opinion.
                         A single-tranche disbursement of US$108.8 million took place in June 2012.

                         The program has achieved satisfactory results so far, although some activities related to the operation were delayed as there were planned, originally, to be implemented in 2010.
                         The Government of Mozambique has been committed to achieving all results indicators before the program's closing date of December 31, 2012. As of end-2011, all the results
                         indicators were fully achieved.

                         Implementation capacity is adequate. The monitoring and evaluation system is based on relevant and easy to monitor indicators and program goals. Although the team, and the
                         development partners, have worked closely with the government on the institutionalization of a monitoring and evaluation framework, in the context of the Poverty Reduction Support
                         Program, including the Performance Assessment Framework, there have been some delays in the collection of indicator data. The team has been working with Government in this
                         regard, but these delays are not considered a source of risk for program implementation.
