MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIHE INTERNATIONAL DE'ELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOED CREDfT
TO THE UNTED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A FlNANCLAL AND LEGAL MANAGEMENT UPGRADING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to Tanzania for SDR14.6 million, the equivalent of US$20.0 million, on standard IDA tenis with
a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for financial and legal management up-grading.
It would be cofinanced by a grant from SIDA in the amount of US$226,000.
2.    Sector Baclgod. Shortly after independence Government set up the institutions
necessary for the proper functioning of the financial and legal management sectors. The NBAA
was established to promote the accountancy and auditing professions, examine and certify would-
be practitioners, establish and safe-guard accounting and auditing standards and ethics, and
generally service the professions. The Tanzania Audit Corporation (IAC) audits the accounts
of all parastatals, and a number of training institutions have been created for the financial sector,
including the Dar-es-Salaam School of Accountancy (DSA) (accounting technicians); the Institute
for Finance Management (IFM) unior and middle level accounting, banking, insurance and
pension staff); the Institute for Development Management (IDM) (middle and senior level
inancial managers); and the Institute of Accountancy, AnLsha (IAA) (full professional level
Certified Public Accountants (CPAs)).
3.    For the legal sector, the judiciary structure consists of 1023 primary courts, 86 district
courts, 20 regional courts, the High Court in Dar es Salaam and eleven zonal centers, and the
Court of Appeal, all on the mainland, while the court system in Zanibar, although separate, has
a structure similar to that described above. The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the
Govermnent, and carries out his functions through several divisions including, for example, the
Civil and International Division, the Legislative Division, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions
and the Administrator-General's Division. Other key sector institutions include the Law Reform
Commission responsible for the reglar review and reform of all Tanzanian laws, and the office
of the Company Registrar, formaUy known as the Department of Registration, Commercial Laws
and Industrial Licensing.
4.    Despite the creation of these instittions the demands on public sector accounting,
auditing, financial management, legal management, and administration of justice in Tanzania have
grown so rapidly during the last two decades that they have outtripped the capabilities of these
instituons to meet them. in public sector accounting and auditing, the regulatory body, NBL.
has not been able either to issue the necessary accouning and auditing standards or to enforce
those standards it has issued. Most government ministries and parastatal organizations find it
difficult to meet Bank or donor accounting and auditing requirements. Accountancy training
institutions have inadequate personnel and few, mostly out of date, text-bools. The national
success rate in the professional level accountancy examinations averages 20%. A 1989 study
revealed a national shortage of 2,000 Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), 5,600 semi-qualified
accuntan and over 15,000 accounting technicians.
S.    Ihe performance of the legal framework and the administration of justice suffer due to
lack of knowledge of modern commercia aw - an area neglected since the emphasis on public



-2-
sector development began in the late 1960s. The judiciary is also overloaded and inefficient, and
most of Tanzania's laws have not been revised or updated for ades.
6.    In addition, both sectors, created and developed over twi. decades to service a highly-
centralized economy, now have to adapt, revise out-dated laws and policies, and be strengthened
so that they can deal with the needs of the liberalized economic and political systems now
evolving in Tanzania.
7.    Govmen  &WW. The Government strategy (shared by the Bank and bilateral
donors) for developing accounting and auditing, involves, among other things, withdrawal of the
NBAA from the training of students for its own examinations, intensification of NBAA activities
in issuing and enforcing accounting and auditing standards, reviewing and monitoring the
performance of practising accountants and auditors, introducing continued professional education
(CPE) and a new Advanced Diploma in Government Accounting and Auditing for those
accountants wishing to specialize in government, removal of TAC's monopoly of the audit of
parastatal organizations, and material support to NJBAA and training institutions to enable them
to improve their performance in measurable ways.
8.    In the legal sector beyond the obvious need for improved skills and material resources,
there is currently no clearly-articulated long-term development strategy. There is, nevertheless,
broad recognition of major problem areas within the legal profession, the judiciary, and their
support services. Some of these needs are so obvious and non-controversial that they can (and
need to) be immediately addressed. Accordingly, Government, the Bank and bilateral donors
have agreed on a two-pronged strategy for meeting. the development needs of the sector,
consisting of, on the one hand, limited direct assistance to address some of the immediate human
and material resource needs of the sector; and on the othxr hand, a major sector study, with
Government, bank and bilateral donor participation, designed to diagnose the sector's problems,
and prepare an action plan for its long-term development.
9.    Proect  .WectiyA  The objectives of the project are to improve accounting and auditing
standards on the one hand, and the legal framework and the administration of justice on the other,
by strengthening key insutions involved in both activities through improvements in their human
and material resources; and undertaking studies designed to prepare a detailed strategy for the
development of the legal sector, improve cost recovery, and increase competition and efficiency
in the audit of parastatal organizations.
10.   Proect Descrtion. The project would, over a five-year period, provide assistance for:
(a) Elnancat Mnamet hnpro91et through upgrading of accounting and auditing
(US$14.6 million), training, technical assistance, office, classroom and transport equipment, and
office and residential accommodation for the accountancy regulatory body NBAA, the Office of
the Controller and Auditor-General (OCAG), the IAA which trains students for the highest level
(CPA) examinations, and the IFM which prepares them for intermediate level examinations; ()
Upgrading of the Lqgal Sector (US$6 million): (i) training and limited office and computer
equipment for the Attorney-General's Department; Judiciary, the Registrar of Companies and the
Law Reform Commission; and (ii) revision and publication of the laws of Tanzania, and (iii)
review of commercial and related laws relevant to private sector development and the parastatal
reform program; (c) Sudies (US$0.4 million) including (i) a legal sector study to prepare a
detailed strategy for the developmen of the legal sector; (ii) a cost recovery study to suggest
ways of improving cost recovery in project beneficiary insttions, and (iii) a TAC study to



-3 -
suggest practical steps necessary for implementing the Government decisicn to open up the audit
of parastatal accounts to competition; (d) Project Coo( dinatign (US$1.3 million) to pay for the
office costs and salaries of two project co-ordinators: one for the financial management
component, and the other for the legal sector component, and the incremental operating costs of
project institutions (to be financed by the Government). The project, to be implemented over 5
years, is estimated to cost US$22.5 million. Project costs and financing are summarized in
Schedule A. The proposed procurement methods, allocation and disbursement of the IDA Credit
are in Schedules B and C. Staff Appraisal Report No. 10625-TA is being distributed separately.
11.   Project hnplementation. No new institution is to be created under this project. The
aim is to reinforce existing institutions by providing them with the resources essential for carrying
out the tasks for which they were established. Each project beneficiary institution would
implement its own components of the project. However, in view of the large number of fairly
small government agencies involved, and to facilitate coordination of project implementation,
reporting, monitoring and supervision, project agencies have been grouped into two broad
categories corresponding broadly to the two functional areas the project is designed to improve.
Thus, financial management upgrading (basically accounting and auditing), involving the NBAA,
the IAA, the IFM, and ihi; Controller and Auditor-General's Office, as well as the TAC and cost
recovery studies would be coordinated by a Financial Management Component Coordinator
located in NBAA. The upgrading of the legal sector (including the legal sector study) involving
the Attorney-General's Office, the Registrar of Companies, the Law Reform Commission, and
the Judiciary, would be coordinated by a Legal Sector Component Coordinator located in the
Attorney-General's office. The above grouping of responsibilities has been tested and proved
effective during project preparation.
12.   Project Sustainabilitv. The reformed laws, trained personnel, improved examinations,
libraries, and accommodation provided under this project would continue to yield benefits with
little incremental recurrent expenditure for many years to come. In appropriate cases, e.g., IFM
and IAA courses, efforts would be made to recover as much of the cost of operation as possible,
thereby ensuring long-term sustainability.
13.   Lessons from Previous Bankf_DA Involvenent. Neither of the sectors, nor any of the
project institutions, has previously benefited from Bank Group assistance. However, based on
the findings of OED studies on technical assistance, and on experience from other projects, the
emphasis of this project would be more on training than on technical assistance (T/A); and more
on short-term than on long-term T/A. In particular OED Report No 8573, of April 1990, entitled
"Free-Standing Technical Assistance for Institutional Development in sub-Saharan Africa"
recommends continued Bank support for institutonal development on a free-standing basis,
properly designing terms of reference for consultants, and only commissioning studies when
needed. All these recommendations are reflected in the design of this project.
14.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. This project is a necessary practical foundation for the
policy dhanges IDA is promoting in Tanzania. Without Bank involvement, neither local
resources, nor donor funding, would achieve the level necessary to make the desired impact on
the performance of the institutions involved. Donors are keenly interested in working with the
government and IDA to develop a strategy for the long term development of the legal sector
under IDA's aid co-ordination.



-4-
15.   Aged Actions, (a) Condition of effectiveness: appointment of the two project co-
ordinators (paragraph 11 above) would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit; (b)
Conditions of disbourumUL   disbursement for the NBAA building would be conditional on
NBAA offering space in that building to the Tanzania Association of Accountants. Disbursement
for IAA's hostel and staff residential accommodation would be conditioned on confirmation that
the student population has increased sufficiently to justify the additional accommodation; (c)
Other cMnditl; during negotiations agreement was reached wifth the Govenmen on, among
other things: (i) the accounting and auditing standards to be issued by NBAA during the next five
years; (ii) the areas of law (mostly commercial and related aspects) to be reviewed during the first
two years of the project; and (iii) tie improvement of cost recovery at the Administrator-
General's office through the charging of realistic fees for services rendered to the public.
16.   Bank's Program  Cbjective Cates.  The improved accounting standards and
practices anticipated from the project are expected to result in better public sector management,
and the company law reform would assist private sector development and the Government's
privafization program.
17.   Environmental Asgt. The project is a technical assistance and training effort raising
no environmental issue.
18.    .Weet BenefitsT he project is expected to result in both quantitative and qualitative
mrovements in the perfrmance of beneficiary institutions. Although the institution building
nature of this projoct makes many of its benefits hard to quantify, a few of the benefits are
quantfiable, and would be closely monitored during the project. These include, for example,
the rates at which NPAA issues accounting and auditing standards; the success rate of [AA and
1PM students in national accountncy examinations; and the rate at which the Attorney-General's
Office and the Law Reform Conunission revise and publish Tanzanian laws. Non-quantifiable,
but nevertheless monitorable qualitative benefts would include: NBAA's capacity to introduce
and enforce accountig and auditing standards within Tanzmia, set and mark the necessary
examinations, and reguate the two professions; the efficiency and ease with which the Attorney-
General's Office carries out its duties; and the capacity of the courts and lawyers to administer
the laws.
19.    1Wa. The only foreseen risk is the possible inability of the beneficiary agencies to
absorb and put to good use the resources being provided through the projec. Built-in project
features, such as trinin, technical assistance, careful phasing of implementtion and highly de-
centralized but closely co-ordinated management are all designed to minmize this risk.
20.   Renmndation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend thiat the Executive Directors approve
it.
