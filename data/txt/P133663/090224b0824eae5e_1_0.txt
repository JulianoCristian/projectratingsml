                         The development objectives of the DPO series is to support reforms to strengthen macroeconomic and public finance management and lay foundations for stronger
                         growth and protection of the poor.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         protection of the poor has suffered a series setback and places this operation at high risk. This lack of progress can be largely attributed to the negative fiscal impact of the large
                         scale theft of public funds amounting to MWK 13.7 billion (equivalent to about US$34 million) during the period of April-September 2013, and the emergence of high fiduciary risks
                         associated with a compromised Government payment system and control environment. Whilst remedial emergency control measures have been put in place, there has been a
                         setback on macroeconomic and public finance management and none of the budget support envisioned for 2013/14 has been forthcoming. On the other hand, reforms that will help
                         strengthen growth at the sectoral level have progressed adequately.

                         Pillar 1: Strengthening macroeconomic and public finance management

                         Prior to Board approval, all DPO-1 prior actions were fully implemented and the overall reform program was broadly on track. On the fiscal consolidation front, there was encouraging
                         progress towards the clearance of domestic payment arrears and procurement reforms to improve the cost effectiveness of the Farm Input Subsidy Program. The fiscal deficit had
                         narrowed and there was a slight reduction in net domestic debt in 2012/13.

                         This progress was reversed at the start of FY2013/14, which was characterized by large overruns in expenditure partly reflecting fraudulent transactions (where total expenditure rose
                         sharply to 49 percent of GDP during the first quarter of FY2013/14, from the program target of 41.8 percent of GDP). The subsequent suspension of budget support in 2013/14 has
                         meant that fiscal consolidation is still taking place in a very difficult environment. Given the low levels of budgetary allocations to Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies,
                         domestic payment arrears have started to build up, which goes against some of the objectives of the reform program supported by the series.

                         To restore confidence in the public finance system and reduce the possibility of further fraud, the authorities have since late 2013 been implementing an Action Plan of remedial
                         measures covering five areas (i) Investigations and Prosecution; (ii) Auditing; (iii) Accounting; (iv) Administrative measures; and (v) Reforms (governance, public sector and PFEM).

                         While the immediate fiduciary risks have been mitigated through extraordinary arrangements put in place with support from development partners, these measures are not
                         sustainable and remain a source of a high fiduciary risk over the medium term.

                         Pillar II: Laying the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the poor:

                         Progress continues to be made in the implementation of core elements of the government's reform agenda that will help lay the foundation for sustained growth.

                         Energy Sector. To Government has maintained the monthly reviews of the Automatic Tariff Adjustment Formula since May 2012. This reform has helped the Electricity Supply
                         Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) improve its financial position to support its activities and the expectation is that the cost reflective tariffs will help attract the operations of independent
                         power producers to expand public access to electricity and improve the reliability of supply.

                         Seeds Market. Good progress has been made with the drafting of the Seed Bill, which has been prepared in a highly consultative manner with full endorsement from seed companies
                         and producers in particular. In 2013, legumes production increased by about 10 percent from 949,454 metric tons produced in 2012. Once passed and enforced, the proposed Seed
                         Bill will be critical to ensure that farmers can access quality seeds on the market that would effectively contribute to productivity increase.

                         Statistics. The authorities passed the 2013 National Statistics Act in May 2013, which has enhanced National Statistical Officeâ€™s authority to coordinate and manage the National
                         Statistical System (NSS). The authorities have also approved 2013-2017 NSS Strategic Plan, which seeks to promote the harmonization of statistics as well as oversee the
                         development and implementation of a comprehensive and well-coordinated system of producing, processing and disseminating official statistics. This will in turn help reduce
                         duplication and overlapping of activities and enhance consistency and comparability of statistical products. To date, only one quarterly MGDS II report has been provided against the
                         end of program target of two reports.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         a) Authorities should continue to secure a robust and strong payment system to reduce fiduciary risks and strengthen transparency and accountability; b) finalize a strategic
                         'Comprehensive PFEM Strengthening Action Plan', which will be linked to the Public Sector Reform Program to ensure complementary and maximize synergies; c) Accelerate
                         progress of the reforms that have been lagging behind, including those related to the revisions to the energy sector policy, clearance of bank reconciliation backlog and the
                         establishment of the M&E system for Social Protection Program; and, d) Authorities to establish a mechanism to monitor the stock of arrears on regular basis to prevent accumulation
                         of new arrears. As a result of the cash-gate, the management has decided to terminate the DPO series (which was originally conceived as a three single tranche operations), at
                         DPO-2 and the results framework has been adjusted accordingly.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
