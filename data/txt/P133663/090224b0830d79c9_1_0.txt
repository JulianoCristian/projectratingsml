F. Results Framework Analysis
Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The development objectives of the Economic Recovery DPO series were to strengthen macroeconomic and public
finance management and to lay the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the poor. The program was geared
towards consolidating macroeconomic policy reforms implemented under the stabilization effort undertaken since May
2012, as well as to prepare the ground for longer term structural reforms for the post-election period.

Indicator 1 :        Reduction in the stock of domestic payment arrears owed by State Owned Enterprises

                                                                                                 (26 percent cleared)
Date achieved        05/28/2013                06/30/2016                                        06/30/2014
                     By end June 2014, MWK 9 billion out of the MWK 35 billion total stock of SOE arrears had
                     been settled based on the maturity profile of promissory notes (out of a total stock of arrears of
                     MWK 72 billion identified at appraisal). Hence, at the time of the ICR around 26 percent of the
                     stock of domestic payment arrears by SOEs had been cleared, less than the 50 percent clearance
                     of the 2016 program target indicator, but on track in terms of incremental progress. However,
Comments             while progress was made in addressing the initial stock of arrears owned by SOEs identified at
                     the time of appraisal of DPO-1 in early 2013, during late 2013/early 2014 a significant amount
                     of new arrears were built up by MDAs estimated at MWK 170 billion as of end FY13/14. This
                     occurred as a result of the negative fiscal impact of the large scale theft of public funds in 2013
                     (known as “cashgate”), which triggered the withdrawal of planned budget support and resultant
                     shortfalls in resources to run government operations.
                     Reduction in the variance in primary expenditure between approved budget and actual
Indicator 2 :
                     outturn
Value                12 percent                < 8 percent                                       13 percent
Date achieved        05/28/2013                06/30/2016                                        06/30/2014
                   As a result of the “cashgate” public financial management scandal and the resultant suspension
                   of budget support by development partners, Malawi saw sharply lower grants in FY13/14.
                   Coupled with significant overspending on recurrent expenditures, this resulted in a substantially
Comments           larger budget deficit than anticipated. The gap was financed in part by higher domestic
                   borrowing, but the fiscal year also closed with substantial outstanding payment arrears owed by
                   the Government. Hence, the FY13/14 variance in primary expenditure was 13 percent, above the
                   program target indicator of less than 8 percent.
Indicator 3 :      Reduction in the rate of recurrent Audit Committee findings
Value              90 percent               50 percent                                      82 percent
Date achieved      05/28/2013               06/30/2016                                      12/31/2014
                   Five Audit Committees have been re-established with independent membership, each of which
                   is responsible for four MDAs. However, the Audit Committees have only met twice in total with
Comments
                   limited progress in addressing findings. At the time of the ICR, a total stock of 93 of 114 audit
                   issues (82 percent) remained unresolved.
Indicator 4 :      Increase in the number of power generation licenses for Independent Power Producers
Value              Zero                     At least one                                   Zero
Date achieved      05/28/2013               06/30/2016                                     12/31/2014
                   At the time of the ICR, no IPP generation licenses have been granted (although steps towards the
                   issuance of a first license is at an advanced stage). However, reforms undertaken by the
Comments           authorities have removed some of the policy restrictions that prevented market access for IPPs.
                   Electricity tariffs have been adjusted aiming to bring prices closer to cost recovery levels, a
                   prerequisite for attracting private investment.

                       some progress towards the program target indicator. Part of these savings came from a decrease
                       in international fertilizer prices. Another part of the savings is however the result of a change,

           ECONOMIC RECOVERY DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

             IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT


1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Malawi is an agrarian economy and relies on a limited number of primary commodities as the main
source of growth and exports. This has left the country vulnerable to weather related and terms of
trade shocks. Limited natural resource endowments, coupled with poor quality productive
infrastructure and landlocked supply chains have hampered efforts to diversify the economy. In
recent years Malawi has also struggled to address systemic weaknesses in standards of governance
and public financial management, undermining efforts to improve service delivery. The country is
also highly aid dependent, an additional source of vulnerability.

Throughout recent decades, Malawi has suffered from persistent boom-and-bust economic cycles,
mostly tied to shifting political cycles, where periods of economic growth have been followed by
bursts of inflation, fiscal imbalances and high interest rates. Coupled with an unreformed and high
cost investment climate, the economy has seen limited private sector investment and job creation.

Poverty remains severe with an estimated 38.7 percent of the population living below the national
poverty line in 2013 (according to estimates from the Integrated Household Panel Survey). Per
capita GDP of just US$ 253 in 2014 means that the country is among the world’s poorest.

The Economic Recovery Development Policy Operation (DPO) was prepared in a period of
renewed optimism and in the aftermath of a period of significant political uncertainty in Malawi
where a severe economic and governance crisis in 2011 had threatened to push the economy into a
policy-induced recession. The timely implementation of adjustment measures to address long
standing internal and external imbalances in the economy by the new administration of President
Joyce Banda, who came to office in April 2012 following the death of her predecessor President
Bingu wa Mutharika, helped to avert a full blown economic crisis.

Macroeconomic imbalances included severe shortages of foreign exchange and fuel, the
accumulation of an estimated MWK 72 billion in domestic payment arrears owed by the
Government and external payment arrears owed by the private sector estimated at about US$ 600
million. Reforms enacted facilitated the removal of key market distortions, most notably in the
petroleum and foreign exchange markets. These reforms were supported through a coordinated
response by the international community, including by the World Bank Group (WBG) via a
package of IDA operations that included a Rapid Response Development Policy Grant.

Preparation of the Economic Recovery DPO built on the results of a prior Rapid Response
Operation, as well as significant earlier experience of budget support in Malawi through a series of
three Poverty Reduction Support Credits, in addition to the longstanding partnership arrangements
established under the Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) group.

The DPO was prepared at a time when Malawi was experiencing major economic turbulence, and
focused on supporting efforts by the Government to put the economy back on track after the 2011

                                                 1
political and economic crisis, with a longer term program of reforms to support a sustainable
economy recovery. The operation was informed by longstanding dialogue and analytic work
undertaken by the Bank on macroeconomic policies, public financial management, agriculture and
energy sector reform.

The first of a series of three programmatic operations was prepared a year before Malawi’s 2014
presidential elections and it was anticipated that the series would straddle two governments, helping
to sustain and give continuity to key economic policy reforms.

The Economic Recovery DPO was an integral part of the World Bank Group’s FY13-16 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi, contributing in particular to CAS objectives to promote
more diversified, competitive, shock-resilient economic growth as well as efforts to mainstream
governance for enhanced development effectiveness. The programmatic series of three operations
aimed to support both the short term reforms necessary to consolidate macroeconomic stabilization,
as well as longer term reforms seeking to improve the efficiency of public expenditure, remove the
constraints to growth and diversification as well as improving the effectiveness of social safety nets.

1.2 Original Program Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The program development objective of the Economic Recovery DPO was to strengthen
macroeconomic and public financial management, and to lay the foundation for strong growth and
protection of the poor.

The operation was prepared as the first in a programmatic series of three operations, intending to
support the implementation of the Government’s medium term development plan, the Second
Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) 2011-16 approved in April 2012, as well as
the Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) adopted by the administration of President Joyce Banda in
September 2012, that provided for a series of short-term measures to restore macroeconomic
stability while aiming to mitigate the effect of structural reforms on the poor and most vulnerable
segments of society.

The program built on policy dialogue and reforms undertaken under the earlier Rapid Response
Development Policy Grant approved in July 2012 and aimed to consolidate reforms supported by
the three-year arrangement for Malawi under the IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program also
approved in July 2012. The program was geared towards consolidating macroeconomic policy
reforms implemented under the stabilization effort undertaken since May 2012, as well as preparing
the ground for longer term structural reforms after the May 2014 elections.

The following specific outcomes were expected as a result of the operation:
    A reduction in the stock of domestic payment arrears owed by State Owned Enterprises;
    A reduction in the variance in primary expenditure between the approved budget and actual
        outturns;
    A reduction in the rate of recurrent audit findings;
    An increase in the number of power generation licenses for independent power producers;
        and,
    An increase in the number of beneficiaries with savings of at least 30 percent1 of the public
        works wage one year after participation.


1 Note that while the target outlined under the description of policy areas in the Program Document (p.34) and in the
results framework (p.59) is for beneficiaries of the National Social Support Program with savings of at least 30 percent

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The policy areas supported by the program were aimed at strengthening macroeconomic and public
financial management, and laying the foundations for stronger growth and protection of the poor.
The program was closely aligned with the Government’s MGDS II and ERP, as well as the Public
Finance and Economic Management Reform Program (PFEM-RP) with the objectives of
accelerating the economic recovery process and getting the economy back on a sustainable growth
path.

The framework for the Economic Recovery DPO, provided for two main policy areas—
strengthening macroeconomic and public financial management, and laying the foundation for
stronger growth and protection of the poor—each with a series of related reform objectives, as
illustrated below.

 Main policy areas                   Reform objectives

                                            o strengthening external oversight of public finances;
                                            o strengthening internal controls on public finances;
                                                and,
                                            o enhancing efficiency in the use of public resources.

1.6 Other significant changes

The Economic Recovery DPO was prepared as the first of a series of three programmatic
development policy financing operations. After completion of the first operation (DPO-1),
preparation of the second operation (DPO-2) was suspended at an advanced stage (prior to
negotiations in April 2014) following the exposure of serious weaknesses in the country’s public


of the public works wage one year after participation, the grant and program summary (p.vii) refers to a target of 50
percent of the public works wage. For the purposes of the ICR, the target of 30 percent has been treated as the correct
figure.

financial management (PFM) systems. The revelation of the large scale theft of public resources in
a scandal known locally as “cashgate” undermined confidence in the effectiveness of PFM in
Malawi. As a consequence, significant aspects of the program went off track, as did the IMF
program. Multiple development partners suspended budget support operations citing fiduciary
concerns, placing Malawi’s fiscal position under significant strain, increasing uncertainty and
further contributing to macroeconomic instability. As a response, the government attempted to
address weaknesses in PFM systems via a short-term action plan. However, in the interim period
there was a change in government (in May 2014) and a shift in political focus from one of economic
recovery to deeper reform of public financial management and economic governance as part of
efforts to rebuild confidence. As such, it made greater sense for the Bank to consider a new program.
Hence, the second and third operations in the series were dropped and the ICR has been prepared
on the basis of a single Economic Recovery DPO only.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

The Economic Recovery DPO was prepared as a single tranche operation, intended as the first in a
programmatic series of three development policy operations. It was prepared during a period of
renewed optimism after the formation of a new administration following the 2011 governance crisis
as Malawi looked towards restoring macroeconomic balances.

The critical prior actions supported under the DPO represented a combination of actions that would
contribute to implementation of the government’s medium term policy (the MGDS II) as well as
the shorter term Economic Recovery Plan. The program was prepared in a consultative manner
with dialogue undertaken within the CABS group of development partners providing general and/or
sector budget support to the Government of Malawi. This involved the agreement between
government and development partners on the use of a common Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF), from which prior actions and triggers were extracted for inclusion in the
program documents of individual development partner budgets support operations.

The following table lists the agreed policy areas and prior actions of the program across the two
pillars of engagement.

The program document for DPO-1 included six prior actions across the program, as well as a series
of indicative triggers for the proposed successor operations in the series (DPO-2 and DPO-3).
Result indicators were articulated at the program level with a baseline set at the time of preparation
of DPO-1, and target result indicators set for the end of the series (anticipated to conclude in 2016).

DPO-2, a number of revisions were proposed to the prior actions for DPO-2, with justifications for changes outlined in
the draft Program Document. These changes included the inclusion of six supplementary prior actions for DPO-2 based
on government’s emergency performance assessment framework drawn up in the immediate aftermath of the “cashgate”
crisis and in order to address immediate PFM weaknesses under the program. Since preparation of DPO-2 was suspended
and hence the operation was not completed (or the Program Document presented to the board), in this ICR we refer to
the original indicative triggers for DPO-2 as intermediate benchmarks for the performance of the program.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

The DPO was prepared as part of a medium-term support package to the—at the time—new
administration of President Joyce Banda. Following on from a standalone Rapid Response
Development Policy Grant, the Economic Recovery DPO series provided for support to
strengthening macroeconomic and public financial management, as well as laying the foundations
for stronger growth and protection of the poor. Preparation of the program built on lessons learned
from the earlier series of three Poverty Reduction Support Credits during 2007-11, as well as the
Rapid Response Development Policy Grant. These included:
      Government ownership, political will and commitment are key determinants in the
         successful implementation of institutional and structural reforms;
      Progress tends to be slower in reform areas where the political economy context is critical,
         yet not adequately understood;


                                                6
       Working within the harmonized framework for the provision of budget support—the
        CABS group—has enhanced the quality of policy dialogue, albeit with limited impact;
       Flexibility in the CABS Performance Assessment Framework should be encouraged to
        enable it to adapt to unforeseen external shocks and changing government priorities and
        programs; and,
       The importance of implementation capacity for the successful implementation of policy
        and structural reforms cannot be overemphasized.

The program was informed by significant analytical work by the World Bank including the 2010
Country Economic Memorandum identifying the key constraints to growth; an exchange rate and
foreign exchange study estimating underlying causes of persistent external imbalances in Malawi,
as well as work to assess the welfare impact of a parallel official and black market exchange rates.
A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment, as well as budget technical
assistance, helped to identify a number of priority reform areas to address weaknesses in the core
PFM systems of the government. This background analysis provided a sound basis to inform the
design of the operation.

The macroeconomic framework underlying the operation was informed by the assessment made by
the IMF in the context of the new three year ECF-supported program for Malawi, approved in July
2012 which also formed part of the international community’s response to front-load
macroeconomic and structural reforms implemented by the new Joyce Banda administration. The
Economic Recovery DPO was complementary to the ECF, providing a medium term agenda to the
latter’s objectives of improving fiscal sustainability and providing for a gradual build-up of
international resources to help cushion the economy against external shocks.

Technical assistance in support of a number of policy areas in the program came from a number of
Bank-financed investment lending operations, several of which were co-financed by other
development partners. These included the Financial Reporting and Oversight Improvement Project,
which was geared towards improving internal controls, reporting and oversight of government
finances; the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp), which focused on improving the
effectiveness of food security investments; the Energy Support Project, which aimed to improve
the reliability and quality of national electricity supply; and the Third Social Action Fund, which
sought to improve the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households.

The exposure in September 2013 of the large-scale theft of public resources by a group of
individuals working both inside and outside of government who exploited weaknesses in the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) placed Malawi in a vulnerable
position. Following the attempted assassination of a Ministry of Finance official, it was revealed
that a high-level syndicate had gained illegal access to the national payment system and stolen
public funds worth over US$ 50 million. This included over-invoicing for goods supplied to
government as well as payment against invoices to companies that did not provide government
with any goods and services. After release of funds, transactions were then deleted from the
payments system. Such practices required considerable organization with collusion at multiple
levels of transacting and approving authority. The incident exposed deeply entrenched corruption
and fundamental weaknesses in the country’s PFM systems. The repercussions of this scandal,
which became known locally as “cashgate”, caused a huge public outcry, the arrest of a number of
government officials, the dissolution of the Cabinet, and the suspension of critical external budget
support by CABS development partners. More generally, a number of key development partners
ceased using government systems altogether and suspended the channeling of Official
Development Assistance (ODA) through the budget. In an environment of weak expenditure
management and commitment control, this in turn put the fiscal accounts and efforts to consolidate

                                                 7
expenditures under significant stress, triggering a substantially enlarged budget deficit, high cost
domestic borrowing, the build-up of arrears and resurgent inflation. As the country’s fiscal position
deteriorated, uncertainty increased and private sector confidence slumped, along with Malawi’s
global reputation. Consequently, significant aspects of the program went off track, as did the IMF
program primarily as a result of sharply increased domestic borrowing requirements to fill the gap
in public finances. As such, a public finance crisis triggered fiscal instability, which then resulted
in a loss of macroeconomic stability, making a difficult situation even more challenging.

As a response, the government attempted to address weaknesses in PFM systems via a short-term
action plan. The Bank and a core of CABS group members that remained, in principle, committed
to budget support worked with the Government in the preparation and implementation of this short-
term action plan. Preparation of the second operation (DPO-2) continued up to an advanced stage,
but with a substantially revised program of proposed prior actions, incorporating key aspects of the
short-term action plan, as part of efforts to restore basic PFM controls and plug priority gaps in
government’s financial management and payment systems.

However, in the intervening period the May 2014 elections saw a change in government that in turn
triggered a period of reflection and a shift in political focus from one of short-term recovery to
deeper reform of public financial management and economic governance. The new government
indicated its intention to initially operate without budget support from development partners while
efforts were made to rebuild confidence and trust among both domestic and international
stakeholders. As such, it made greater sense for the Bank to consider a new program. The series
was terminated after just one operation (DPO-1) and the second (DPO-2) and third (DPO-3)
operations in the series were dropped.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

As a programmatic series, monitoring of DPO-1 took place as part of the preparation process for
DPO-2. This involved keeping track of progress in the implementation of the prior actions for DPO-
1 and policy dialogue around the proposed triggers for DPO-2. The team had regular contact with
the authorities, including through meetings of the CABS group, to monitor implementation of the
program. The team also worked closely to track progress towards the achievement of expected
outcomes of the series of DPOs as presented in the results matrix of the program document for
DPO-1. Monitoring of progress on the macroeconomic program was supported through preparation
of quarterly economic updates and participation in IMF ECF review missions.

As a result of the “cashgate” PFM scandal, a number of course corrections were made to the Bank’s
engagement on governance issues. In an effort to restore confidence and focus reforms around a
narrower set of systemic issues, government and the CABS development partners agreed on an
“extraordinary Performance Assessment Framework” to monitor progress in addressing PFM
weaknesses. The proposed program for DPO-2, which was suspended at an advanced stage,
included a number of additional prior actions drawn from this extraordinary PAF, in addition to
triggers proposed in the program document for DPO-1. Similarly, progress on governance reforms
was monitored under the Financial Reporting and Oversight Improvement Project, including
through the scaling up of a Multi Donor Trust Fund to support critical improvements to systems,
controls and procedures to address weaknesses exposed as part of the “cashgate” scandal.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

The early termination of the Economic Recovery DPO series points to a number of challenges in
both the appropriateness of the macroeconomic environment for providing budget support in

                                                  8
Malawi, and the integrity of PFM systems into which the proceeds of DPOs are disbursed.
Slippages in a number of the core public financial management policy areas supported under the
program raise concerns about Malawi’s ability to strengthen economic governance, despite long
periods of technical assistance and policy dialogue. Similarly, the evidence in Malawi suggests that
uncertainty with regard to the disbursement of the proceeds of DPOs can in turn contribute to wider
fiscal instability and dampen investor sentiment, triggering broader feedback loops.

The new government—which took office in May 2014—has made commitments to reform the
PFM framework and early signs suggest that reform efforts are genuine. In support of these efforts,
the Bank in partnership with other development partners is providing assistance to improve the
integrity of PFM systems via the Financial Reporting and Oversight Improvement Project. The
Bank is also continuing to engage on macroeconomic, governance and public finance issues.
Should these reforms gain traction, then there would be scope for reengaging with the authorities
with development policy financing as part of a mix of instruments.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The operation was prepared during a period of high expectations for Malawi following the
implementation of critical macroeconomic and structural reforms frontloaded by the Joyce Banda
administration to stabilize macroeconomic imbalances and assuage fuel and foreign exchange
shortages. This in turn helped avoid a policy induced recession and put the economy on a path to
stability. The Economic Recovery DPO aimed to consolidate stabilization efforts supported by the
Rapid Response Development Policy Grant, and to lay the foundation for stronger growth and more
effective poverty reduction. The program formed an integral part of both the Bank Group’s CAS
as well as the Government’s MGDS II and the ERP.

Despite the challenges experienced during implementation of the Economic Recovery DPO, and
the dropping of the second and third operations in the series, the broad objectives remain highly
relevant and the need for improved macroeconomic management and the maintenance of internal
and external balances is of continued importance to the country. Malawi continues to suffer from
persistent volatility in terms of macroeconomic policy and performance, with a stop-go cycle that
has damaged private sector investment and job creation and hampered efforts to diversify the
economy. Improving macroeconomic management is an essential pre-requisite if Malawi is to
succeed in meeting the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The
Bank Group’s program in Malawi on macroeconomics and fiscal management issues thus remains
of central importance and the objectives of the Economic Recovery DPO series, where the Bank
aimed to support a set of structural and macroeconomic reforms necessary to restore internal and
external balances, and put the country back onto a stable economic pathway, remain highly relevant
at the time of ICR preparation.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The overall expected result at the end of the program period was strengthened macroeconomic and
public financial management, laying the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the poor.
At the time of the ICR, which was triggered by an early termination of the series after the
completion of just one of the planned three operations, and in the wake of a substantial public
finance integrity scandal, the results are decidedly poor. Early progress appeared to be on track
with incremental headway towards result objectives, but the operation was unable to survive the
impact and fallout of the “cashgate”—essentially a risk that materialized—and resulted in

                                                 9
significant disruption to the program and ultimately undermined efforts to achieve the program
development objectives. Similarly, and with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the development
objectives of the series were set at an overly ambitious level.

Nevertheless, aspects of the program have achieved results at an intermediate level, and a number
of useful lessons have been learned on how best to engage in support of governance reforms in a
fragile institutional context. While progress towards reform objectives in a number of the main
policy areas stalled when the DPO series was suspended, positive movement towards some
intermediate reform objectives was achieved, demonstrating sustained ownership in a challenging
policy environment.

The Economic Recovery DPO included two main policy areas—strengthening macroeconomic and
public financial management, and laying the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the
poor—each with a set of related reform objectives, as illustrated below.

 Main policy areas             Reform objectives
 Pillar 1: Strengthening        Strengthen fiscal discipline to entrench macro-stability
 macroeconomic and                through the clearance of domestic payment arrears.
 public financial               Enhance the efficiency and transparency of public finance
 management.                      management by:
                                      o strengthening the budget policy framework and
                                          improving medium-term orientation;
                                      o strengthening external oversight of public finances;
                                      o strengthening internal controls on public finances;
                                          and,
                                      o enhancing efficiency in the use of public resources.
 Pillar 2: Laying the           Enhance agricultural productivity and diversification;
 foundation for stronger        Improve energy efficiency and the regulatory environment;
 growth and protection of       Improve efficiency in the provision of social safety nets; and,
 the poor.                      Strengthen the country’s statistical capacity.

Strengthen fiscal discipline to entrench macro-stability through the clearance of domestic payment
arrears. The expected results under this reform objective were that the stock of outstanding public
payment arrears owed by State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) would be reduced by 50 percent by the
end of the program, and that a zero ceiling would be imposed for the accumulation of new arrears
by Ministries, Departments and Agencies. The medium term expected outcomes were strengthened
fiscal discipline and no build-up of new domestic payment arrears.

Policies supported under the Economic Recovery DPO-1 included the validation of outstanding
payment arrears and the development of a plan for the full clearance of arrears owned by SOEs and
MDAs. At the time of preparation of DPO-1, the stock of arrears was estimated to be MWK 72
billion, of which MWK 35 billion was owed by SOEs. Progress towards the indicative trigger for
DPO-2 was on track, with 26 percent of the stock of SOE arrears (MWK 9 billion) cleared by the
time of the ICR. The 2016 end of program target was for 50 percent of SOE arrears to be cleared.

However, while encouraging progress was made towards clearing the stock of arrears identified at
the time of appraisal of DPO-1, the fallout from “cashgate” and the resultant suspension of budget
support from development partners (which resulted in significant cuts in budgetary allocations to
MDAs) coupled with weak commitment control across MDAs saw a significant increase in new
arrears incurred during late 2013 and early 2014. As of end FY13/14, the total stock of arrears
owed by MDAs had ballooned to an estimated MWK 170 billion, directly as a result of fiscal

                                                 10
pressures arising from the suspension of budget support. This total dwarfed earlier attempts to clear
arrears and indicates the depth of the challenge faced by authorities in controlling public
expenditure and preventing the accumulation of arrears by MDAs.

Enhance the efficiency and transparency of public finance management by: strengthening the
budget policy framework and improving medium-term orientation. The expected result under this
reform objective was that the variance between the approved expenditure and actual outturns would
be reduced from 12 percent to below 8 percent by the end of the program.

DPO-1 supported the preparation and adoption of a detailed budget formulation calendar, as part
of renewed efforts to operate a Medium Term Expenditure Framework. Incremental efforts under
the program saw progress with work towards the approval of the Budget Framework Paper for
2013/14 on track (the indicative trigger for DPO-2). However, as with the arrears position, despite
attempts to improve planning and budgeting, the link between activities supported under the
program and observed outcomes were eclipsed by events surrounding “cashgate”, the suspension
of budget support, and underlying weaknesses in expenditure management and commitment control.
Sharply lower grants in FY13/14, coupled with significant overspending on recurrent expenditures
resulted in a substantially larger budget deficit than anticipated. The gap was financed in part by
higher domestic borrowing, but the fiscal year also closed with substantial outstanding payment
arrears owed by the government. Hence, the FY13/14 variance in primary expenditure was 13
percent, above the baseline figure of 12 percent and above also program target indicator of less than
8 percent.

Enhance the efficiency and transparency of public finance management by: strengthening external
oversight of public finances. The expected result under this reform objective was a reduction in the
backlog of Treasury Minutes from over 60 months in 2012 to 48 months by the end of the program.

DPO-1 supported the submission of Treasury minutes for the FY05/06 and FY07/08 to the Public
Accounts Committee of Parliament, as part of efforts to strengthen accountability over the use of
public funds and improve value-for-money. The breakdown of public finance controls that occurred
in the aftermath of the “cashgate”, the build-up of significant off-budget payment arrears, and a
prolonged period during which IFMIS was suspended and payments made manually, has caused
significant disruption to the normal process of preparing government’s annual financial statements.
This in turn affected the auditing of government’s financial statements by the National Audit Office,
presentation to parliament of these statements, and finally the preparation of Treasury Minutes by
government in response to control weaknesses highlighted during parliamentary discussion of the
audited financial statements. At the time of ICR, there is a three year backlog in the preparation of
audited financial statements. As such, no Treasury Minutes were prepared during the period from
appraisal of the operation to ICR. The backlog has remained at above 60 months and in excess of
the program target indicator.

Enhance the efficiency and transparency of public finance management by: strengthening internal
controls on public finances. The expected result under this reform objective was a reduction in the
rate of recurring audit findings from 90 percent in 2012, to 50 percent by the end of the program.
The medium term expected outcome was strengthened external oversight of public finances.

DPO-1 did not include any prior action under this reform area, but progress towards the indicative
DPO-2 trigger of instructing the ten largest spending ministries to ensure that respective Audit
Committees are functional, with baseline data of pending bank reconciliation created, and a
reduction in the rate of recurrent audit findings showed mixed progress.


                                                 11
Five Audit Committees have been re-established with independent membership, each of which is
responsible for four MDAs. However, the Audit Committees have only met twice in total with
limited progress in addressing findings. At the time of the ICR, a total stock of 93 of 114 audit
issues (82 percent) remain unresolved. This reflects some modest progress from the baseline of 90
percent in 2012, but well short of the end of series target of 50 percent.

Enhance the efficiency and transparency of public finance management by: enhancing efficiency
in the use of public resources. The expected result under this reform objective was that public
investments in agriculture be equally distributed among the three ASWAp pillars by the end of the
program.

The program supported under DPO-1 included the revision of bidding documents for the annual
procurement of fertilizer under the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) in order to align the
allocation of tonnage demand with unit price ranking in order to increase value-for-money. This
reform contributed to a more efficient procurement of fertilizer, achieving cost savings in FY13/14
estimated at US$ 10 million. However, a weaker application of the tonnage allocation formula in
FY14/15 reduced the efficiency of the procurement process somewhat. Progress towards the DPO-
2 indicative trigger to review the FISP in light of new research findings and the Agriculture Public
Expenditure Review saw more limited progress. While the FISP has been credited with increasing
maize yields, the basic subsistence crop in Malawi, the program is widely considered to be
inefficient and subject to abuse. The costs and management of the program crowd out other longer
term agricultural productivity enhancing activities, and the program imposes a substantial fiscal
burden on Government finances.

In broad terms, the FISP continues to dominate public expenditure on agriculture. Efforts to see a
more balanced distribution of public investments in agriculture and reduce the share of fertilizer in
the agriculture budget are progressing slowly under the ASWAp process whereby agricultural
stakeholders regularly meet to discuss policy issues. There is a growing consensus on the need to
reform FISP by revisiting its objectives, its targeting and implementation modalities to reduce its
fiscal burden, to improve its technical and financial efficiency and to promote both higher
productivity and crop diversification. The Bank has contributed to this FISP reform dialogue by
producing policy briefs to help summarize the findings and evidences of various research papers
and to help formulate clear reform options. The Agricultural Sector Public Expenditure review,
completed in 2013, has also been instrumental in providing evidence on the need to rebalance the
agricultural budget beyond the ASWAp Food Security pillar in general and beyond FISP in
particular.

Enhance agricultural productivity and diversification. The expected result under this reform
objective was an increase in legume production by 20 percent compared to the 2012 level by the
end of the program. Legume production in the 2013/2014 cropping season significantly increased
compared to the previous 2012/2013 campaign (by 19.9 percent in just one year). This increase is
for a large part attributable to good weather conditions but the distribution of subsidized legume
seeds under the FISP also contributed to increased access to seeds and to making improved varieties
more affordable to a greater number of smallholder farmers.

No specific prior actions were included under DPO-1 in this policy area, but an indicative DPO-2
trigger provided for the completion of a review of the legal and regulatory framework for quality
seed production. The objective being to remove blockages preventing the greater availability of
modern seeds and to open the seed market to varieties accredited in other countries of the Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC), thereby facilitating increased agricultural productivity
and crop diversification. The DPO has been instrumental in moving this agenda forward and in

                                                 12
ensuring that private sector, especially seed companies, will be consulted on the proposed legal
reform agenda of the seed act. A draft Seed Act has been finalized and is being discussed with the
Ministry of Justice and should be submitted to Parliament’s approval in 2015. The Bank, with
complementary instruments, is now supporting the Government in elaborating a new seed policy
and strategy to guide the implementation of the new seed act and to further clarify some SADC
harmonization requirements as well.

Improve energy efficiency and the regulatory environment. The expected result under this reform
objective was the issuance of at least one power generation license to an independent power
producer by the end of the program.

DPO-1 supported the undertaking of monthly reviews of the Automatic Tariff Adjustment Formula
for electricity as part of efforts to ensure that electricity tariffs reflect market fundamentals, a
particularly challenging area of reform. The objective being to both safeguard the financial viability
and reinvestment capacity of the Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi, as well as increasing
the likelihood of Malawi attracting new investment by Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The
end of program target provided for the granting of at least one power generation license to an IPP
by 2016. Efforts to reform the energy policy, the indicative trigger for DPO-2, were on track. At
the time of the ICR there were no longer any policy restrictions preventing market access for IPPs
and while one license was close to being granted, there are as yet no formal approvals of IPPs in
Malawi.

Improve efficiency in the provision of social safety nets. The expected result under this reform
objective was an increase in the number of National Social Support Program beneficiaries with
savings of at least 30 percent of the public works wage one year after participation from 13,000 in
2012 to 49,000 by the end of the program. The expected outcome was a more responsive system
for cushioning the poor and most vulnerable.

DPO-1 supported the approval of the National Social Support Program as part of efforts to create
an enabling policy environment for the implementation of social protection interventions in Malawi.
DPO-2 provided for the establishment of a M&E system. As of end FY13/14, a total of 99,153
people had joined the Community Savings and Investment Program of the National Social Support
Program. Of this total, 78,330 (79 percent) meet the savings criteria of at least 30 percent of the
public works wage one year after participation. This substantially exceeds the 2016 end of program
target. Of this total, 47,781 of the beneficiaries (61 percent) are female, suggesting highly positive
gender outcomes.

Strengthen the country’s statistical capacity. The expected result under this reform objective was
an increase in the number of MGDS quarterly reports published from zero in 2012 to four by 2016.
The expected outcome was the production of high quality, timely and accessible statistical
information.

There were no prior actions under this reform area under DPO-1, but DPO-2 provided for an
indicative trigger supporting the development of the National Statistics System Strategic Plan 2013-
17, which was approved in 2013. Progress in efforts to increase the availability of MGDS reporting
had a more limited impact, partly due to the lack of sanctions for failure to submit quarterly reports.
At the time of the ICR, quarterly progress reports were being produced by sector working groups
on average once per year, below the end of program target indicator of four per year.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Evaluation of the operation is complicated by the fact that result indicators were set assuming a
series of three operations (anticipated at the time of appraisal of DPO-1 to conclude in 2016). With
the dropping of the second and third operations (DPO-2 and DPO-3), some judgment must be
exercised on the contribution of the one completed operation, against the broader results framework
for the series.

Nevertheless, the overall outcome rating is judged to be “unsatisfactory” given the lack of
significant progress towards the program core goals of improved macroeconomic and public
financial management. In hindsight, the program development objectives were set at an overly
ambitious level. While incremental process was achieved across a number of intermediate aspects
of the program (particularly under Pillar 2), the Malawi’s public financial management system and
the resultant theft of substantial amounts of public resources served to dramatically undermine the
overall effectiveness of the program. That a proposed three-year program went so significantly off
track so soon after approval, it is hard to consider an overall outcome rating that is anything other
than “unsatisfactory”.

However, while the aggregate impact of the program was less than anticipated, a number of sector
specific reforms within the program did gain traction and achieve results at the intermediate level.
Of these, incremental reforms in agriculture (and in particular on FISP procurement) and in energy
pricing were notable.

Perhaps most critically, the objectives of the program—namely to support improved
macroeconomic and fiscal policies, and to maintain international and external balances—continue
to be highly relevant to Malawi’s development needs and remain at the core of the WBG’s County
Partnership Strategy for Malawi. The WBG remains closely engaged in these areas via a mix of
instruments.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Data from the IHPS indicates that the overall incidence of poverty in Malawi fell slightly from 40.2
percent of the population in 2010 to 38.7 percent in 2013. Urban areas displayed an increase in
poverty over this period, while rural areas experienced a slight decline in the share of those who
are poor. Rural areas have a significantly higher poverty incidence than urban areas, but the
difference is shrinking over time as rural areas see a relative improvement while the situation in
urban areas is deteriorating.

Substantial mobility into or out of poverty was experienced by around a third of the population
over 2010-13. Some two thirds of Malawi’s population did not see much mobility over 2010-13
either into or out of poverty: 44 percent remained non-poor while 23 percent remained poor over
this period. But substantial mobility was experienced by the remaining third of the population:
around 17 percent managed to escape poverty during this period while 15 percent became poor.

Consumption inequality declined somewhat between 2010 and 2013, suggesting a slight
improvement in shared prosperity over this period. That is, the shares of overall national


                                                 14
consumption of the bottom four quintiles increased modestly from 2010 to 2013, while the share
of the 20 percent of the population with the highest consumption declined over the same period.

If implemented as anticipated at the time of appraisal, the reform program supported by the
Economic Recovery DPO should have had beneficial effects on the poor by helping to establish a
more stable macroeconomic environment. Prior actions on public financial management are
necessary in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending, particularly in
key social sectors that would be likely to directly benefit the poor. In practice, the continued large
stock of payment arrears owed by government has served to undermine private sector confidence
and the investment and job creation that is necessary to propel economic growth in Malawi.
Similarly continued macroeconomic uncertainty, and in particular persistently high rates of
inflation, discourage saving and depress the purchasing power of the poor in particular.

However, intermediate aspects of the program have achieved encouraging results at the meso level.
In particular, the successful implementation of the National Social Support Program saw
substantially greater participation and impact than anticipated, with very strong female
participation. Similarly, strong growth in the production of legumes, in part facilitated by increased
access to seeds under FISP, is expected to have strong positive poverty and gender effects.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Malawi has suffered from persistent and recurring bouts of macroeconomic instability throughout
much of its economic history, with the effect that spells of economic growth have rarely been
sustained for long enough periods to have a meaningful impact on poverty. A proximate cause of
the persistent macroeconomic imbalances has been institutional weaknesses and a wide governance
gap between policies enacted and those actually implemented. While many of the weaknesses in
Malawi’s PFM systems had been present for a long time, the systemic breakdown and large scale
theft of public resources was exposed shortly after the completion of the Economic Recovery DPO-
1, and served to destabilize the political setting and government’s reform program.

Institutional change is clearly a long term and challenging agenda in Malawi, and a process which
will require strong national ownership and drive to achieve results. DPOs can play an important
role during such a transition but, evidence from other countries suggests, are most effective as part
of a mix of ODA instruments including not only budget support, but also investment lending and
technical assistance.



                                                                     15
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

The fallout from Malawi’s “cashgate” PFM scandal had a number of effects. Firstly and most
significantly, the public exposure of the theft of resources resulted in immediate and substantial
reductions in the volume of assistance disbursed through government systems, as well as the
withdrawal of bilateral development partners from the CABS group. Multilateral development
partners in the CABS group (including the World Bank, the European Union and the African
Development Bank) remained broadly committed to budget support in principle, but delayed and/or
suspended ongoing operations pending the implementation of structural reforms to improve PFM
systems. While the net impact on total ODA received by Malawi was more ambiguous, the sudden
loss of budget support and a sharply reduced share of development assistance received on-budget
placed the government’s FY13/14 fiscal account under immediate stress. The financing gap was
filled by increased domestic borrowing, driving up inflation and interest rates, as well as by
substantial payment arrears, in turn damaging macroeconomic stability. In aggregate, efforts over
many years in Malawi to pool resources, reduce aid transactions costs, improve predictability and
gradually increase the use of national systems were reversed in a very short space of time.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

Malawi’s economic and governance institutions remain fragile, with a still contested consensus on
the causes of the country’s poor growth performance and on the underlying reasons for the
breakdown of PFM systems. Incremental progress on aspects of the program was achieved, with a
number of preliminary policies put in place to support macroeconomic stability, better growth
prospects and improved protection of the poor. However, the as-yet limited impact between reforms
undertaken and higher level development outcomes suggest both weak causality and the primacy
of broader factors outside the program.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The operation was prepared in a timely fashion and in response to a window of opportunity to
consolidate reforms enacted by the (at the time) new administration of President Joyce Banda, and
support efforts by the government to move towards a medium term economic reform program. The
team involved participants from across the WBG’s sectors/practices, attempting to address the
critical challenges associated with macroeconomic management, public finance, agriculture and
social safety nets. Preparation took place in a coordinated manner, with the Bank working alongside
other development partners within the CABS group. The program was, at both the time of appraisal
and ICR, highly relevant to Malawi’s developmental needs.



                                                16
However, overly ambitious objectives and assumptions, together with the fact that the program
unraveled so soon after approval suggest key weaknesses in quality of entry. Furthermore, risks to
reforms supported by the operation might have benefitted from a deeper appreciation of the local
political economy context and a fuller understanding of the extent to which the (formal) PFM
system was operating in a weak (informal) governance environment. As an example, the policy
area on strengthening external oversight had a corresponding prior action on the submission of
treasury minutes for 2005-07, for an operation that was approved in 2013. This severe issue in the
timeliness of basic budget information is, in retrospect, an indication that there was a lot about the
contemporaneous budget process that the Bank did not know, and perhaps should had provided a
warning sign. Hence, in aggregate a rating of “moderately unsatisfactory” is proposed for quality
of entry.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Supervision of the operation, the first in an intended series of three, was undertaken as part of the
preparation of the second operation in the series. Monitoring of the results indicators also took
place as part of regular economic policy dialogue with the authorities. Despite challenges
associated with the fallout of the “cashgate” PFM scandal—the culmination of a chain of events
that caught everybody off guard—efforts were made to complete preparation of the second
operation, with an increased focus on remedial measures aimed at restoring basic controls and
oversight. However, preparation of the second operation was later suspended and the series
terminated when there was a change in government and a change in the focus of government policy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Despite disappointing results at the PDO level, the operation was appropriate in its design, highly
relevant to and closely aligned with Malawi’s development strategy. The breakdown in confidence
in the country’s PFM framework, and in particular the massive collusion in the circumvention of
PFM controls that allowed the theft of resources to take place, was hard to foresee. However, poor
results and the termination of the series so soon after board approval raises questions about the
adequacy of preparation. As such, the overall Bank performance is judged to be “moderately
unsatisfactory”.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The reform program supported under the Economic Recovery DPO involved the participation of a
number agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development; the
Ministry of Agriculture; and the Ministry of Energy.

While the weaknesses in the integrity and management of PFM systems in Malawi had existed for
several years, the extent and gravity of these weaknesses came to light only after the public
exposure of the theft of public resources during the course of the program. The fiscal pressures that
ensued as development partners withdrew resources, basic planning, budgeting and commitment

                                                 17
controls broke down, saw a crescendo of macroeconomic and fiscal instability that undermined the
development objectives of the operation. Similarly, these challenges also resulted in the IMF
program going off track. Aggregate government performance is therefore rated “unsatisfactory”.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The primary agency responsible for coordination during the preparation and implementation of the
operation was the Debt and Aid Division of the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and
Development. Malawi’s coordinated approach towards development policy financing under the
CABS group is notable, even if the results have been mixed. The division exercised strong
management and coordination throughout the preparation and implementation of the program.
However, concerns over the appropriateness of design for a program that went off track so soon
after approval also weigh on the rating for implementing agency performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The negative impact of systemic institutional weaknesses in the integrity of Malawi’s public
finances, together with a lack of oversight and culture of impunity outweigh the efforts of key
implementing agencies. As such the overall rating for borrower performance is “moderately
unsatisfactory”.

6. Lessons Learned

The mixed results of the Economic Recovery DPO provide some useful lessons learned on the
effectiveness of development policy / budget support operations in the context of a fragile
institutional environment. Malawi has a long history of budget support provided by development
partners, with well-established coordination arrangements under the CABS group. Similarly, the
Bank has significant prior experience with DPOs in Malawi, having financed three programmatic
Poverty Reduction Support Grants (during 2008-11) and a standalone Rapid Response
Development Policy Grant (in 2012), prior to the preparation of the Economic Recovery DPO series.

The program was well prepared, relevant to the Government of Malawi’s needs, closely embedded
in existing strategies and processes, informed by a solid base of underpinning analytic work, and
aligned with the objectives of the MGDS II and ERP. Lessons learned from previous DPOs were
applied during the preparation of the Economic Recovery DPO, including careful alignment with
government priorities, strong coordination with other development partners, and complementarity
between Bank-financed investment lending operations and the DPO series to generate mutual
leverage for achieving development objectives.

However, the experience of the DPO also points to the risks of “partial reform syndrome”, a
situation where governments undertake reforms at a superficial level only producing the form but
not the substance of modernized institutions. The breakdown of Malawi’s PFM that occurred in
2013 highlights the need for a thorough understanding of the local political economy of reform and
the importance of looking beyond the veneer of formal rules-based systems, to the underlying
informal arrangements that allowed for collusive behavior to take place.



                                               18
The fallout from Malawi’s “cashgate” saga, and the resultant suspension of budget support by
development partners similarly raises questions about the role and purpose of budget support in an
aid-dependent economy such as Malawi. At the time of ICR preparation, the authorities are
struggling to execute the budget in a highly constrained environment with a much diminished
resource envelope. Spending demands have been hard to rein in, and having resorted to financing
an enlarged budget deficit via high cost domestic borrowing, Malawi has entered into a high
inflation, high interest rate equilibrium, weakening growth prospects. Similarly the negative
signaling effect of the loss of budget support has dampened private sector confidence and played a
part in the depreciation of the domestic currency, in turn putting the fiscal accounts under increased
pressure and further stoking inflationary risks. Development policy financing could be seen as a
two-edged sword with the provision and then suspension of budget support serving to amplify
political/business cycles in the economy.

Thus the withdrawal of budget support has placed the government under significant and increased
pressure. In Malawi’s case this has produced a number of negative effects and may damage growth
and poverty reduction prospects. However, it also has the potential for positive impact by sending
a strong message on the need for structural reforms to public financial management and integrity
to be undertaken before budget support can be resumed. Thus at the time of the ICR, while the
Bank and other CABS donors are not currently disbursing DPOs3, policy dialogue on the issues
continues and by keeping the option of resuming budget support at a future date on the table, there
are positive incentives in support of critical reforms.

In addition, despite mixed results at the overall outcome level, the Economic Recovery DPO did
achieve meaningful results at the technical level in a number of areas of the program on agriculture,
energy and social safety nets. The most notable area of progress was on reforms to fertilizer
procurement under FISP, an area that lays at the core of Malawi’s public policy, where the
introduction of a revised tonnage allocation formula helped reduce costs and improve allocative
efficiency. Similarly, reforms on energy pricing were sustained beyond the program, pointing to
deeper ownership.

Despite challenges, development policy lending remains a key instrument in support of Malawi’s
development agenda and forms part of a mix of ODA modalities available to the country. In the
right circumstances, DPOs can play an instrumental role and as part of a mix of aid instruments by
helping (at the margin) to support critical reforms necessary for stronger and more resilient growth
and poverty reduction.

In moving forward, key lessons learned for future DPOs in Malawi are highlighted below:
     Greater attention will need to be paid to the financial management domain in highly aid
       dependent environments so as to avoid pro-cyclicality in budget support. The fiduciary
       element to the “cashgate” revelations in Malawi created a highly damaging multiplier
       effect as a series of development partners who were providing budget support and reliant
       upon government’s financial management, simultaneously withdrew resources.
     There is a sense that government is no longer driving the policy agenda, responding to
       policy proposals that are put forward by development partners, and therefore exercising
       weak ownership over the program leading to “partial reform syndrome”. This calls for a
       rethink in the way that a future program may be put together, with much greater emphasis
       placed on ensuring strong government ownership over reforms. Similarly, and in a low


3At the time of ICR, the African Development Bank was considering a sector policy lending instrument that would
provide a form of budget support, earmarked for expenditure within the social sectors.

                                                      19
        capacity environment this would suggest the identification of a program with a narrower
        focus, and with prior actions and triggers formulated at a more downstream/outcome
        oriented level. Lessons from the “cashgate” experience also point to the need for increased
        use of independent verification methods to confirm the actual status of reform measures
        adopted, particularly with regards to PFM systems and controls.
       The experience of the Economic Recovery DPO points to the need for a strong focus on
        timeliness of fiscal information and integrity of systems, suggesting that these features in
        particular (as opposed to other PFM elements which could matter in other contexts) need
        to be priorities in any future budget support operations. Furthermore, the fact that there was
        partial success across a range of structural areas of the program, but not complete (or
        irreversible) success in any, suggests the need to narrow the scope of structural reforms to
        only the most macro-critical areas where progress would be harder to unwind after
        completion of an operation.
