and lay the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the poor. The program
is geared towards consolidating macroeconomic policy reforms implemented under
the stabilization effort undertaken since May 2012, as well as prepare the ground for
longer term structural reforms for the post-election era.
Links to CAS: The proposed DPO series is fully consistent with and closely linked
to the objectives of the FY13-16 Country Assistance Strategy approved by the
Board in January 2013. The CAS seeks to contribute to Malawi's efforts toward a
more diversified, competitive, shock-resilient socioeconomic growth. The DPO is
also linked to the main pillars of the Africa Regional Strategy.
Risks and     Three main risks could influence the expected outcomes of the proposed operation:
Risks         (a) External shocks: The country remains vulnerable to weather-related and other
Mitigation    external shocks, which could have an impact on the overall GDP growth, consumer
prices, and external balance. A shortfall in maize output was partly responsible for
the acceleration of inflation during 2012-13. A weather-related sharp decline in
tobacco production could have consequences for foreign exchange balance and
hence exchange rates in the short-term. There remains a potential risk of spillovers
from the global economy, including a decline in prices of Malawi's exports, and a
reduction in aid flows. All of these vulnerabilities pose significant risk to nascent
vii


﻿macro-economic stability. Mitigation: The authorities are regularly monitoring
macroeconomic developments, including as part of the program with the IMF. A
continuation of the policy reforms instituted in 2012 such as automatic price
adjustment mechanism for fuel and flexible exchange rate would allow the economy
to adjust to shocks with minimum policy response. Where needed, the government
is expected to respond through appropriate policy measures. The Bank team will
help the Government of Malawi (GoM) to formulate and implement such responses.
In 2012, the Government responded to the decline in maize output by fiscal
tightening which is being supported by the Bank through advice on public
expenditure policy.
(b) Political risk: Political risk remains high in the context of Presidential elections
planned for May 2014. Policy reforms instituted in 2012 have been followed by
considerable depreciation of Kwacha and annual inflation in excess of 30 percent.
These developments are putting pressure on the Government's resolve to stay the
course. Pressures on the budget are likely to increase during fiscal year 2013-14
posing further risks to macroeconomic stability. Mitigation: These risks will partly
be mitigated by a better communication by the government on how the policy
reforms are having some positive impacts and the time needed to let these reforms
work. This could be complemented by more informed public debates based on
emerging evidence from the on-going Public Expenditure Review and poverty
policy notes, which includes analysis on the FISP.
(c) Implementation capacity risks. The systemic problem of capacity in GoM
continues to pose a risk to the reform program and may cause delays in
implementation of some of the reform measures supported by this operation. Weak
management of public finances and reports of widespread corruption and extortion
by public officials in procurement and fraudulent activities within the PFM systems
represent a significant risk. Mitigation: To address this risk in the short term, the Bank
intends to increase its engagement at the technical level to ensure the reforms under this
operation are implemented and sustained. In addition, the DPs are supporting the GOM
through a combination of capacity building and technical support, including support for
statistics and monitoring and evaluation. Specifically, the risks can be mitigated by the
pace of reforms supported by the implementation of a more harmonized PFM program
under the Multi-Donor Trust Fund.

﻿REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
ECONOMIC RECOVERY DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION (DPO 1)
I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
1.    This program document proposes the Economic Recovery Development Policy
Operation to the Republic of Malawi for SDR 33.4 million (US$50 million equivalent),
on standard IDA terms. The proposed operation is the first in a programmatic series of
three single tranche operations, which intends to support the implementation of the
Government of Malawi's (GoM) new medium term development strategy, the Second
Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) 2011-16, approved in April 2012,
and the Economic Recovery Plan.' The rationale behind the decision to start a new DPO
series is based on the need to help the GoM implement its medium term reform agenda
while at the same time ensure predictability in the financing of the reforms through the
series.
2.     The DPO series is designed to assist the GoM  consolidate reform measures
undertaken since May 2012 aimed at stabilizing the economy, supporting quick
growth rebound and protecting the poor and the most vulnerable while setting the
stage for longer term structural reforms. Specifically, the operation will support two key
pillars: (i) strengthening the macroeconomic and public finance management through
measures aimed at strengthening fiscal discipline to entrench macro-stability as well as
improving efficiency and the transparency of the public finance management; and, ii)
laying the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the poor through reform
measures aimed at enhancing agriculture productivity and diversification; improving energy
efficiency and the regulatory environment; improving efficiency in the provision of social
safety nets; and, strengthening the country's statistical capacity.
3.     The choice of the reform areas is based on the outstanding reform agenda
currently being pursued by the GoM on strengthening PFM and efficiency in
government expenditure, addressing constraints to growth and economic diversification as
well as advancing the inclusive growth agenda through productive social safety nets. The
operation also represents a continuation of an on-going policy dialogue with the authorities
and builds upon reforms implemented under the Rapid Response Development Policy
Grant (2012 RRDPG). The operation also builds on reforms supported under the Poverty
Reduction Support Grant 1-3 (2007-2010 PRSG series) as well as consolidates the reforms
supported by the three-year arrangement for Malawi under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) approved in July 2012.
4.     This Program comes at the time when the economy is going through a difficult
recovery process in the wake of a severe economic and governance crisis of 2011,
which had threatened to push the economy into a policy-induced recession. The timely
implementation of adjustment measures to address the long standing internal and external
imbalances in the economy by the new Administration under President Mrs. Joyce Banda,
which came into office in April 2012, averted a full blown economic and social crisis. The
manifestation of the macroeconomic imbalances included the accumulation of an estimated
MK72 billion in government domestic payment arrears, severe shortages of foreign
ERP lays out action plans over the short to medium term to accelerate progress towards poverty reduction through
sustainable and inclusive growth. It also proposed a social support package, which will be built on existing programs to
mitigate the impact of the reforms on vulnerable sections of society.
1


﻿exchange and accumulation of external payment arrears by the private sector, estimated at
about US$600 million. These reforms have facilitated, among others, the removal of market
distortions (especially in the petroleum sub-sector and foreign exchange markets), the
strengthening of the macroeconomic management and the clamping down on some of the
loopholes in the public finance management, while scaling up social safety net programs to
cushion the poor and the most vulnerable groups from unintended effects of the economic
adjustment process.
5.     While the reforms have laid the foundation for the country's recovery, a
harsher external environment than earlier anticipated has weakened the pace of the
economic recovery. The significantly reduced tobacco and sugar proceeds in 2012 and
higher than anticipated foreign exchange demand for clearance of the backlog of external
payment arrears as well as to meet the current import needs and external obligations have
exerted significant pressures on the exchange rate. Continued depreciation of the exchange
rate2 and drought induced increases in local food prices has contributed to the surge in
inflation above its envisaged path.3 The rising cost of living, on the back of high inflation
rate and continued depreciation of the Kwacha has also intensified demands for wage
increases, especially in the public sector, as evidenced by the recent industrial actions.
Therefore, achieving fiscal sustainability going forward and preventing an inflation-
depreciation spiral would be critical.
6.     The proposed operation will provide US$50 million equivalent in budget
support needed to ease the emerging fiscal pressures and sustain the current economic
reforms while setting the stage for longer term objectives of improving efficiency in
government expenditure, reducing poverty and achieving a sustainable and inclusive
growth. The Program will be informed by Analytical and Advisory services (AAAs) and
Technical support, including the 2013 Public Expenditure Review4 and the Diagnostic
Trade Integration Study update, and will be provided within the harmonized framework for
the provision of budget support in Malawi, the Common Approach to Budget Support
(CABS), comprising IDA and five other participating Development Partners (DPs).5 The
program is also anchored on the new FY13-16 Country Assistance Strategy and will
provide a platform from which the Bank will engage in policy dialogue with the authorities
on key policy areas supported by this operation.
II. COUNTRY CONTEXT6
A. Political Context
7.     Following the death of the late President Bingu wa Mutharika, who ruled the
country from 2004 until his death in April 2012, the former Vice President Mrs. Joyce
Banda, took office as the first female President of Malawi. The new Administration had
to implement critical macroeconomic and structural reforms immediately after getting into
2 Traditionally, the months of September to March are known as the lean season for foreign exchange as the supplies tend
to be the lowest, due to seasonality of agriculture.
The drought conditions in the southern part of the country in 2012 left close to 2 million people under threat of being
food insecure. But the crisis was averted by the GoM's timely release of the emergency food assistance with support from
the DPs.
4 The sectors covered by the 2013 PER, include Agriculture, Transport, Health, Education and social protection and is
scheduled for delivery in late September 2013.
Other members of the CABS are the European Commission, United Kingdom (DFID), African Development Bank,
Norway, and Germany (KfW). The UNDP, Ireland and IMF have observer status.

﻿office to avoid economic collapse, with some encouraging early signs of a recovery. The
GoM's resolve to address governance issues, including the normalization of relations with
its neighboring countries and the international community, has yielded positive results as
evidenced by the resumption of budget support and the recent signing of the Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) between the Governments of Malawi and Mozambique on the
stalled interconnector energy project.
8.     Malawi is now preparing for its fifth Presidential and Parliamentary elections
scheduled for May 2014. President Banda's administration faces the challenge of
maintaining support for its economic policy reforms with calls for policy reversals,
especially the flexible exchange rate regime and the automatic price adjustment for
petroleum products. So far, none of the opposition parties have provided alternative policy
options. For the first time since she took office in April 2012, President Joyce Banda has a
minority in Parliament after one of the main opposition parties, the United Democratic
Front, relocated from the GoM's side. All political parties are focused on the upcoming
elections.
B. Social Context
9.     Malawi is ranked 170 out of 186 countries surveyed in the United Nations
Human Development Index of 2012. According to the recent report of Malawi's Third
Integrated Household Survey (IHS3 2010/11), absolute poverty has declined by less than 2
percent since 2004/05, to 50.7 percent. Although poverty in urban areas reduced from 25.4
percent in 2005 to 17.3 percent in 2011, this gain was counterbalanced by a worsening in
rural poverty from 55.9 percent to 56.6 percent. Stagnant poverty levels raise questions on
the effectiveness of the Malawi's Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP), in alleviating
poverty and food insecurity in a sustainable manner. With the majority of the poor living
in rural areas, rural growth through agricultural transformation is clearly critical as Malawi
strives to reduce the number of its people who live in absolute poverty.
10.   While the human development indicators represent a mixed picture, Malawi is
likely to meet four of the eight MDGs - which is a noteworthy achievement in the Sub-
Saharan Africa context. Health is being improved by reductions in chronic malnutrition,
measles immunization for children less than a year old and life expectancy has surged, from
38 in 2005 to 53 in 2012. Trends in under-5 and infant mortality have been improving
steadily for two decades. Unfortunately, the HIV prevalence rate in Malawi is still one of
the highest in the world: 10.6 percent for adults aged 15-49 in 2010 (12.9 percent for
women and 8.1 percent for men), slightly down from 11.8 percent in 2004. AIDS is the
leading cause of adult deaths in Malawi and is a drain on public resources. As for the
education MDGs, though Malawi has made progress, the quality of education is still low by
regional standards. In general, Malawi is likely to meet the goals related to reducing child
mortality; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; ensuring environmental
sustainability and developing a global partnership for development. To strengthen the
demand for evidence based policy making and to improve the monitoring of social
outcomes as well as the impact of the interventions, more efforts are needed to improve the
country's statistical capacity and the reliability of its data.
FISP account for over 60 percent of the total budget allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
3


﻿C. Economic Context
11.   Malawi, a landlocked agrarian economy, continues to rely on a few primary
commodities, which makes it vulnerable to weather and terms of trade shocks. The
country is also highly aid-dependent. Agriculture, the main stay of the economic and the
main source of growth and exports, is central to reducing poverty. Expanding and
diversifying agricultural exports and expanding commercial agriculture is high priority.
With support from DPs, the GoM is promoting production of legumes and has introduced a
pilot program to promote cotton production. However, the success of agricultural
diversification will inter alia depend on availability of quality seeds and seeds varieties,
investments in irrigation infrastructure, adequate rural roads access and marketing
infrastructure. Currently, there are no seeds available in the market for new crops like
cotton, and even for traditional crops, which limits the country's ability to increase
productivity and support crop diversification. This DPO series seeks to improve the legal
framework for an efficient seeds market.
12.   Improving economic infrastructure is essential to increase competitiveness and
attract potential investors. Unreliable power and water supplies and excessive transport
costs need urgent attention. The 2010 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) identified
the unreliability of power supply as one of the primary constraints to growth. The energy
sector needs both public and private investments to eliminate energy shortages, by
upgrading transmission and distribution systems to reduce energy losses and improving
both energy efficiency and transmission interconnections to the Southern African Power
Pool (SAPP). Therefore, the reinstatement of the Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC) Energy Compact in June 2012, the recent signing of the MOU by Governments of
Malawi and Mozambique for the interconnector project and the Kapichira II (the hydro
power plant) soon to come on stream reflect positive developments. Low electricity tariffs
remain a major impediment to investments by Independent Power Producers (IPPs). But
raising tariffs alone cannot resolve the country's investment blockages; there is need to also
review the regulatory framework. The proposed reforms under this operation therefore seek
to improve energy efficiency and the regulatory environment.
13.   Having a functioning Public Finance Management system is an essential
foundation for fiscal discipline. Malawi has been implementing PFM reforms for over a
decade but progress towards fiscal discipline has been slow with lack of ownership and
non-adherence to the country's own PFM rules and regulations. While the capacity to carry
out more timely audits, both external and internal audits, has improved, the quality and the
follow-up on internal and external audits are still uncertain; regulation and operational
guidelines for internal auditing are not yet well embedded. The proposed operation, which is
being complemented by the Financial Reporting and Oversight Improvement Project, seeks to
address the outstanding PFM gaps in a harmonized approach to ensure that they are sustained.
D. Recent Economic Developments
14.   After registering high rates of economic growth averaging 7 percent during
2006-10, the pace of Malawi's growth started to slow down in 2011, where the
economy is estimated to have grown by 4.3 percent. This was on a back of a difficult
macroeconomic and governance environment in 2011/12, which was adversely affected by
a combination of events, including significantly reduced donor inflows and tobacco
4


﻿proceeds, higher fuel/fertilizer prices, and the overvaluation of the kwacha, leading to fiscal
and external imbalances. Despite improvements in the supply of foreign exchange and fuel
during the second half of 2012, the slowdown in the real sector activities in 2011/12 and the
contraction in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors led to low real GDP growth rate of
1.9 percent in 2012.

15.       Specifically, the agriculture sector is estimated                        to   have registered          a  negative
growth of 2.9 percent in 2012, on account of underperformance in the production of
tobacco,8 cotton and maize. The decline in maize was largely attributed to poor and erratic
rains in the southern part of the country. The manufacturing sector, being the hardest hit
during the economic crisis in 2011, is estimated to have contracted by 6.4 percent on the
back of difficulties in accessing foreign exchange and intermittent power and water
supplies.
16.       Inflation has been on an upward swing since early 2011 after being in single
digits for the past five years. Headline inflation spiked to 37.9 percent (y-o-y) in February
2013, up from 10.9 percent (y-o-y) in February 2012. This was driven largely by the rise in
food prices, especially maize (related to the impact of drought in the southern region) and
in non-food prices, triggered by the adjustments in the fuel, water and electricity prices, and
the feed-through effects of Kwacha depreciation (figure 1). As such, the annual average
inflation for 2012 stood at 21.3 percent.

17.    Economic performance during 2011 and early part of 2012 was also marred by
loose fiscal stance characterized by heavy reliance on domestic financing, which
crowded out credit to the private sector (figure 2). The implementation of the 'zero-
deficit budget' in 2011/12 created large fiscal imbalances as the GoM was not able to generate
enough revenues. Domestic tax and non-tax revenues declined to 22.1 percent of GDP and
grants fell to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12, from 24.5 percent and 7.6 percent of GDP,
respectively, in 2010/11 (Table 1). The loose fiscal stance resulted in a sharp deterioration in
the fiscal balance to -8.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12, compared with a balance of -2.9
percent of GDP in 20 10/11. This large slippage reflected unrestrained primary spending of -
6.0 percent of GDP, which led to a sharp increase in domestic borrowing from 1.7 percent of
GDP to 6.7 percent of GDP.
18.    Fiscal performance during the first half of 2012/13 was satisfactory as the GoM
met most of the performance targets and the structural benchmarks under the ECF
program. The GoM has been able to eliminate the fuel subsidy9 with the reinstatement of
the automatic price adjustment, and has also repaid about MWK 12 billion of existing stock
of domestic payment arrears (out of total arrears of MWK 72 billion) in 2012/13. While the
impact of the unification of the exchange rate (and the subsequent floatation) on foreign
exchange revenue has been       positive,to its impact on   foreign  exchange sensitive
expenditures, especially fertilizer imports, was more pronounced." The immediate impact
of recent wage increases to civil servants following the industrial actions in February 2013
was a 6 percent increase in the GoM wage bill for 2012/13 budget (0.3 percent of GDP),
which was largely funded by cuts in the Other Recurrent Transactions (ORT) from various
9The cost of fuel subsidies was about US$67 million (1.2 percent of GDP) in 2011, but it must be noted that fuel was
hardly available at the subsidized price in 2012.

﻿votes and other budgetary savings. While the impact of wage increase on the 2012/13
budget is neutral, it has a signaling effect to the market.
19.   Malawi's balance of payments suffered a significant weakening in 2011 from a
surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to a deficit of -1.9 percent of GDP in 2011. The
strong deficit in the current account was the main factor behind the worsening of the
balance of payments, as it widened from -1.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to -5.9 percent in
GDP in 2011. The deterioration was largely due to high levels of imports (33.4 percent of
GDP) vis-i-vis exports (22.5 percent of GDP) and very low levels of international reserves.
The current account deficit narrowed to -4.7 percent of GDP in 2012, mainly on account of
significantly higher official transfers. FDI slowed in 2011 to 1.1 percent of GDP from 2.9
percent of GDP in 2010, partly due to worsening governance and macroeconomic environment.
20.   Malawi's exchange rate supply has significantly improved following the recent
liberalization of the exchange rate regime, which has addressed the overvaluation of
the kwacha. While the impact of the changes in the exchange rate regime on the economy
is yet to be fully realized, it is expected to be positive as evidenced by improved supply of
foreign exchange and fuel, improved earnings for smallholder tobacco farmers and
exporters and the gradual elimination of external imbalances (Annex 4-C Box 1). The
Kwacha is yet to stabilize and has depreciated by additional 66 percent against the US
dollar since May 2012 after losing about 50 percent of its value. The continuous
depreciation of the Kwacha is partly explained by the increase in demand for foreign
exchange, especially following the clearance of private sector external payment arrears
(estimated at over US$600 million), uncertainty in the market as well as insufficient supply
of foreign exchange from the export side. Further tightening of the fiscal and monetary
policy stance may be needed to eliminate the risk of a Kwacha depreciation-inflation spiral.
21.   To contain the growth in credit and money supply, the Reserve Bank of
Malawi (RBM) has hiked the bank policy rate in a phased manner to 25 percent in
December 2012, from 13 percent prior to the reforms in May 2012. In response, the banks
have increased both their lending and deposit rates, with the prime lending rates increasing
from about 18 percent to above 40 percent, making borrowing for both working capital and
production expansion more expensive. On the back of these developments, the spread
between lending and fixed-deposit rates has slightly narrowed. The increases in bank policy
rates have also been accompanied by the surge in the Treasury bill rates in excess of 35
percent for 91-days T-bills in March 2013.
22.   Risks to bank's portfolios has been elevated over the last 18 months and the RBM
has intensified its monitoring and surveillance over the financial system, with special
attention being paid to the distressed banks. The tight Kwacha liquidity conditions in the
banking sector in the aftermath of the May 2012 exchange rate liberalization exposed some
weaknesses in the banking system. This saw the increase in the number of banks seeking
accommodation from the RBM through the discount window, which prompted the RBM to
introduce a temporary non-collateralized window to provide relief to stressed banks at a
rate above the policy rate. 12 Nevertheless, a number of the banks still have difficulties in
meeting their liquidity needs and the RBM is working with them to ensure that their
portfolios are restructured and balance sheets are adjusted. While the Non-Performing Loans
(NPL) are at low levels, with their share as a ratio to total loans at 7.0 percent as at end
12 The non-collateralized window was closed end November 2012.

﻿December 2012, the magnitude of the on-going loan restructuring and the higher than expected
increase in interest rates have made loan servicing expensive, implying rising NPLs.
23.    The GoM    is undertaking measures to reduce the contingent liabilities and
operational loss risks posed by the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).13 Currently, the GoM
is proactively monitoring/supervising the activities of the SOEs on quarterly basis, with specific
attention being paid to procurement activities. The GoM has also issued promissory notes to
clear the stock of outstanding payment arrears owed by SOEs accumulated over the past three
years. Moreover, the recent adjustments in electricity tariffs have contributed to the
improvements in ESCOM's financial position as the tariffs are now cost reflective. Meanwhile,
the on-going restructuring of Air Malawi14 will, in the medium term, help reduce fiscal
pressures and the move towards the automatic price adjustment mechanism for petroleum
has also reduced the contingent liability risks associated with the National Oil Company of
Malawi (NOCMA)." Others like the water utilities remain a problem as their tariffs are not
fully cost reflective and ADMARC continues to make losses.
E. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
24.    The Malawi's medium term economic outlook has improved but remains with
significant downside risks related to weather and terms of trade shocks and potential
fiscal slippages in a contested political environment. This notwithstanding, economic
growth is projected to rebound to the pre-2010 levels in the medium term, with real GDP
growth for 2013 projected at about 5.0 percent in 2013, on the back of production rebound
in agriculture. The outlook for the current agriculture season is positive based on the
expected recovery in tobacco production and production expansion in other cash crops
including cotton and legumes. The GoM has also embarked on a two crop a year initiative,
which is part of the Greenbelt irrigation program to increase crop production for the
domestic and international markets.
25.    The manufacturing, the sector is expected to start showing signs of a rebound
during the second half of 2013 as supply chains begin to normalize. Mining and
quarrying is projected to grow at an average 6 percent during 2013-2016, to be boosted by
projected increase in coal production in 2013-14 as well as the coming on stream of the
niobium mining project at Kanyika by 2014 with construction beginning in 2013. Overall,
real GDP growth is projected to average 6.4 percent during 2014-2016 (Table 1), based on
the assumption of good weather, favourable commodity prices, FDI and aid inflows.
26.    Inflation is also projected to start slowing down and to remain on a stable path
in the medium term owing to the implementation of tight fiscal and monetary policies,
expected stabilization of the exchange rate and good agriculture production. Further
depreciation of the Kwacha even at the on-set of the tobacco auction season, could affect
the inflation projections for 2013, considering the lagged effects of depreciation on non-
food inflation. Food inflation is however expected to start decelerating with the onset of the
harvest season.
3The contingent liabilities are mainly loans /overdrafts from banks and payment arrears while the operational losses arise from
administratively set prices and tariffs that are below cost-recovery levels.
14 The Ethiopian Airlines has been announced as a new strategic investor to take over the Air Malawi (2012) Limited with the
equity share of 49 percent
15 The government guaranteed loans for fuel imports pose risk to the budget, but currently this risk is being mitigated by
the automatic price adjustment mechanism and the limited role played by NOCMA in fuel importation.

27.    The short to medium       term   fiscal outlook presents risks, especially fiscal
slippages. The medium term macroeconomic-fiscal framework shows that GoM faces a
shrinking resource envelope over the medium term. It projects a reduction in grants of
nearly five percentage points of GDP from a high of 15.1 percent in 2012/13, to 10.5
percent of GDP by 2015/16. Consequently the overall expenditure will have to be reduced
by about 3.4 percent of GDP, which will be a challenging task. Given that the projections
target a reduction in interest payments of about 1.2 percent of GDP, the outlay on goods
and services in the recurrent and development budgets will have to be reduced by about 2.0
percent of GDP over the next three years. But the achievement of the fiscal targets could be
affected by possible decline in revenues and the increase in social protection expenditure.
Additional fiscal risks to be monitored stem from the February 2013 minimum wage
increases, the emerging borrowing pressures and election related spending.
28.    Given limited fiscal space and the fact that a large proportion of the budget in
non-discretionary, the GoM will have to focus on measures for expenditure
prioritization and controls while also seeking to improve efficiency of public
expenditures. A decline in net domestic debt would entail containment of spending,
buoyant tax revenues and a sizeable increase in concessional borrowing. As such, the GoM
will continue to implement a number of tax policy measures and tax administration
mechanisms to further boost its domestic revenue (projected to average at 24.4 percent of
GDP during 2013-2016). 16 The authorities' efforts to strengthen the monitoring and
supervision of SOEs and measures to reduce the contingent liability risks through reforms
supported by this operation will go a long way towards achieving fiscal sustainability. The
GoM will need to properly manage the fiscal risks, especially the wage demand pressures,
pressure to expand social protection expenditures, and election related spending.17
16 The GoM is also putting in place measures to improve tax administration and tax collection through increased audits
and use of modern ICT systems to improve revenue collection. Efforts are also being made to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of collecting non-tax revenues.
17At 8.1 percent of GDP in 2012/13, the wage bill is the single largest item of expenditure. Control of the wage bill is
therefore a crucial element of the overall control of expenditures. Wages bill is projected to peak to 8.6 percent of GDP in

29.     Malawi's balance of payment remains vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. The
current account deficit is projected to narrow further from -4.7 percent of GDP in 2012, to
about -1.6 percent of GDP in 2013, on account of significantly higher official transfers
(Table 1). 18 The current account is projected to average at about 2.1 percent of GDP during
2013-2016 (figure 3) financed by aid inflows and FDI. Exports, expected to play a key role
in driving economic recovery, are projected to expand from 22.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to
an average of 36 percent of GDP during 2012- 2016, on the back of the projected increase
in value added exports and diversified export crops, improved tourism receipts, favorable
tobacco prices and strengthening of global uranium prices. Meanwhile, imports are also
expected to pick up from 33.7 percent of GDP in 2011, to an average of 49 percent of GDP
during 2012-2016, partly to reflect the resumption of economic activities in support of the
ERP/MGDSII, including private sector investment operations in sector such as mining and
tourism. FDI is also projected to rise from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2011, to an average of
about 3.0 percent of GDP during 2013-2016, mainly on account of planned investments in
the mining and energy sectors.
2013/14, partly reflecting the deferred salary adjustments agreed in 2012/13 and projected to stabilize at 8.5 percent of
GDP. The total wage bill has been on an increasing trend increasing from about 5.4 percent of GDP in 2005/06. Over the
next three years, wage bill growth is expected to average 13 percent.
" About US$ 200 million has been provided in the form of budget support between July-February 2012/13. Overall,
Development Partners have supported Malawi with more than $ 600 million from the time when the President came into
office until the end of2012.

30.    Malawi's risk of external debt distress remains moderate. The 2012 Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) projects that the country's debt burden indicators are likely
to remain below relevant prudential thresholds under the baseline assumption of favorable
macroeconomic conditions. Malawi's stock of external debt has increased from US$683
million in 2008 to about US$1,140 million in 2011. The stock of external public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt is expected to gradually decline in the long-term from
about 30 percent of GDP in 2012 to about 13 percent of GDP in 2032. This outlook is based
on prudent macroeconomic policies and a favorable external environment, but there are
significant down side risks associated with a prevailing volatile political environment. The
country's narrow export base, reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and weak international
reserves also leaves it vulnerable to terms-of-trade and weather shocks. In particular, the
external sector debt burden indicator (Present Value of debt-to-exports) breaches the
sustainability threshold after an export shock.
31.    Fiscal dominance has contributed to the increase in domestic debt burden
indicators, whereby the PV of public debt to GDP ratio reaches about 45.5 percent in 2012
and gradually comes down to about 13.9 percent by 2032. Stress tests to public sector debt
dynamics reveal the need for significant fiscal consolidation and reform of parastatal
institutions. With projected lower levels of grants and limited fiscal space, the GoM will
have to make more informed expenditure cuts and/or postponement of some investment
spending. While the domestic borrowing risks are limited, the cost is high and both the
terms and the maturity structure work against the GoM.19
32.    Malawi's macroeconomic framework for 2013-2016 is deemed adequate for
this operation, although with downside risks. The adequacy of the macroeconomic
framework for this operation is premised on the authorities continued commitment to sound
macroeconomic management and progress on structural reforms to support measures to
improve controls and efficiency of government expenditure, while creating room for private

﻿sector activity and growth. Prudent fiscal stance and the maintenance of a flexible exchange
rate policy will provide key anchors for external sustainability and adequate budget support
would be essential. In the medium term, Malawi will need to tackle the structural
challenges to enhance the country's chances of reaching its long-term growth potential. The
GoM will have to improve the efficiency of expenditures whereby similar or improved
public services could be delivered with contracting expenditures. The new ECF program
will also help instill fiscal discipline and ensure timely corrective actions. Notwithstanding
the risks in the near term economic outlook, the macroeconomic policy framework is
deemed adequate for this operation.
III. GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESS
33.   The Second Malawi Growth and Development (MGDS II) 2011-2016, which is
the country's second medium term plan, was approved by the Cabinet in April 2012 and
was launched in September 2012. The MGDS II is a medium term strategy designed to
attain Malawi's long term aspirations as spelt out in its Vision 2020 and strives to foster a
more inclusive job-creating growth to tackle the unemployment problem as well as reduce
poverty. The strategy reflects a general consensus on the country's broad goals for growth,
social equity, and governance. More specifically, the strategy recognizes that in order for
all Malawians to benefit equitably from economic growth, concerted efforts to promote
human and social development would need to be complemented by efforts to improve
labour productivity, structural transformation and economic diversification. The MGDS II
covers six thematic areas: Sustainable Economic Growth; Social Development; Social
Support and Disaster Risk Management; Infrastructure Development; Improved
Governance; and Cross-Cutting Issues-covering issues of gender, capacity development,
population, decent employment, productive activities, economic and democratic
governance.
34.   The MGDS II was developed in an all-inclusive process. All levels of society,
including women, the youth, private sector, civil society and development partners were all
involved in the MGDS II consultation process. The process of developing the MGDS II was
well integrated with the existing processes of the GoM led by the Sector Working Groups
(SWGs). The monitoring of the MGDSII will also be conducted with participation from
representatives of the Civil Society Organizations and Development Partners, through the
various SWGs.
35.   To accelerate the recovery process while mitigating the impact of the reforms
on the poor and most vulnerable, the GoM also launched the Economic Recovery Plan
in September 2012. This ERP is well aligned with MGDS II and its focus is on short term
measures to restore macroeconomic stability while mitigating the impact on the poor and
cushioning the poor and most vulnerable as well as the medium term structural reforms-
agriculture, mining, tourism, infrastructure and energy to support the growth agenda. In the
immediate term, the focus is on monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies, revenue
enhancing measures and expenditure control. In its proposed recovery plan, the GoM has
proposed a social support package, which will be built on existing programs especially
public works program to mitigate the impact of these reforms on vulnerable section of
society. These programs include: Scaling up labor intensive public works programme
(LIPW); Up-scaling of legume seed multiplication, agro forestry and soil conservation,
multiplication of cassava cuttings and sweet potato vines and extending village savings
12


﻿club; Up-scaling of school meals programme and vitamin A supplementation; and Up-
scaling of Social Cash Transfer Programme.
36.   The program supported by the DPO series has been discussed with major
stakeholders, including civil society organizations (CSOs), Academia and Development
Partners in the context of the MGDS II and ERP consultations. In addition, the Bank staff
held a session with CSOs on the proposed reforms during the program identification
mission.
IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
A. LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
37.   The new DPO programmatic series is an integral part of the Bank's assistance
20
program to Malawi in the FY13-16 Country Assistance Strategy, which is fully
aligned to the Africa Regional Strategy, the MGDS II and the ERP. The proposed
operation supports progress toward the strategic objectives articulated in the FY13-FY16
CAS, which seek to contribute to Malawi's efforts toward a more diversified, competitive,
shock-resilient socioeconomic growth. The CAS aims to: i) Promote Sustainable,
Diversified, and Inclusive Growth; ii) Enhance Human Capital and Reducing
Vulnerabilities; and, iii) Mainstreaming Governance for Enhanced Development
Effectiveness. The proposed DPO series, envisaged in the CAS, seeks to bridge the short
term reforms aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stabilization, and the longer term
reforms that seek to improve efficiency in public expenditure, remove constraints to growth
and economic diversification and improve efficiency in the provision of social safety nets.
38.   This DPO series will also contribute to the implementation of the Africa
Regional Strategy of the Bank. Two pillars of the DPO series aim at building the
country's resilience to exogenous shocks. The policy areas under the macroeconomic and
public finance management will help contribute towards the strengthening fiscal discipline
to entrench macro-stability as well as improving efficiency and the transparency of the
public finance management. Specifically, the focus will be strengthening budget policy
framework and improving its medium-term orientation; strengthening external oversight of
public finances; strengthening internal controls on public finances; enhancing efficiency in
the use of public resources. These measures will help improve efficiency in the
management of public finance, setting up a buffer against future exogenous external and
domestic shocks, as well as improving system controls and oversight to address, among
others, the accumulation of domestic payment arrears. Whereas under the pillar on laying
the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the poor, the focus is on measures to
enhance agricultural productivity and diversification, addressing energy constraints,
improve social safety nets and build the country's statistical capacity.
39.   The DPO    series is also in response to the authorities' commitment to
implement the macroeconomic and structural reforms as well as provide a platform for
continuity of the reforms in the medium term, ensure predictability of the much needed
financing as well as stability in the GoM's reform program. The choice of a programmatic
DPO series is based on the fact that it supports a multi-sectoral and multi-year approach,
which complements the on-going investment lending operations (see diagraph below), and

B. COORDINATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT
PARTNERS
40.    As was the case with the previous PRSC (I-III) series and the RRDPG, the
Bank has been collaborating very closely with the IMF. A joint IMF/World Bank Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for low-income countries (LIC-DSA) was undertaken in
early 2012 in the context of the Article IV consultations. The Bank team has also
participated in IMF mission discussions with the authorities on the quarterly reviews under
the new ECF-supported program in FY13, and has provided continued/continuous inputs
into the development of the macroeconomic framework. In the identification of prior-
actions for the DPO 1, attention has been paid to the benchmarks under the new ECF
arrangement to avoid cross-conditionality.
41.    The macroeconomic assessment underlying this operation is in line with the
new ECF-supported program for Malawi approved in July 2012. The objectives of the
new ECF program include fiscal sustainability and a gradual build-up of international
reserves to help cushion the economy against external shocks. More broadly, the program
will guide the implementation of policies to create the stable macroeconomic environment
14


﻿needed to achieve the main objective of the second Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy (MGDS II) of reducing poverty through sustained private sector led growth and
wealth creation.
42.   The new DPO series has been coordinated with the CABS DPs and will continue
to be implemented within the framework of the CABS. The CABS represents a group of
development partners that use a joint approach in the provision of budgetary support to the
Government of Malawi. In September 2005, the initial CABS group and GoM agreed on a
Joint Framework (JF) agreement for budget support cooperation designed to formalize their
relationship and provides for a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) on which to
base disbursement decisions.21 The JF represents a memorandum of understanding on
principles governing budget support cooperation in Malawi. Some of the principles
governing this cooperation include alignment to the country's poverty reduction strategy,
joint reviews, and predictability of funding.
C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
43.   The proposed DPO series builds upon the Rapid Response Development Policy
Grant (2012) and the Poverty Reduction Support Grant (2007-2010 PRSG 1-3). The
Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (P126155) focused measures to entrench
macroeconomic stability through the national budget, improve the functioning of the
petroleum markets and incentives to exporters, including smallholder tobacco farmers,
strengthen social protection interventions and the resilience of the most vulnerable groups
to shocks, and improve economic management of the farm input subsidy program (FISP).
The Poverty Reduction Support Grant (P099313) series focused on reforms geared towards
improving economic governance, business environment, social protection and agricultural
markets.22
44.   The proposed DPO series is also linked with the on-going Financial Reporting and
Oversight Improvement Project, which is geared towards improving internal controls,
accounting, reporting and oversight of government finances at the central and decentralized
level of Ministries, Departments and Agencies in Malawi- aligned with reforms under pillar
23
one.
45.   Pillar two reforms are linked to the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach
(P105256), which focuses on improving the effectiveness of investment aimed at food
security and sustainable agriculture growth. The Irrigation Rural Livelihoods and
Agricultural Development Project (P131760), which also addresses overdependence on rain
fed farming with improved water management, strengthens institutions for long-term
irrigation development and raise agricultural productivity, is also linked to the pillar two.
The Malawi Energy Support Project seeks to improve the reliability and quality of
electricity supply in the major load centers using improved technology. Meanwhile, the
Third Malawi Social Action Fund (P07591 1), seeks to improve the livelihoods of poor and
vulnerable households and to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to manage local
development.
21 The Bank did not sign the 2005 JF. The process of coming up with a new JF is at an advance stage.
22 PRSC I was approved on October 30, 2007, PRSC II, on May 28, 2009 and PRSC III on 8 June 2010.
23 The FROIP is the first project under the PFEM Multi-Donor Trust Fund.

﻿D. LESSONS LEARNT
46.   A number of important lessons relevant for the design of the proposed DPO-1
emerged from the CAS Completion Report and PRSC I-III ICR have been taken into
account in the development of this operation. They include:
*  Government ownership, political will and commitment are key determinants in the
successful implementation of the institutional and structural reforms. In areas where
Government ownership is less broad based, the likeliness of objectives being met is also
low. The Bank has therefore invested more in terms of staff time and other resources at
the preparatory stage to ensure adequate client capacity and ownership of reforms is
built. This operation has benefited from ownership by the GoM of reforms being
supported.
*  Progress tends to be slower in reform areas where the political economy context is
critical, yet not adequately understood. The pace of reforms tends to be much slower
when the reform actions involve political decisions (Cabinet/Parliament) for
implementation. The DPO series has fewer reforms that require Parliament approval.
*  Working within the harmonized framework for the provision of budget support, the
CABS, has enhanced the quality of policy dialogue across donors, notwithstanding the
inherent coordination challenges. Continuous dialogue with the GoM has been critical
in keeping up the momentum on reforms supported by this operation and this was
enhanced by the CABS framework.
*  Flexibility in the CABS PAF should be encouraged to enable it to adapt to unforeseen
external shocks and changing government priorities and programs. Given the urgent
need to support the government reforms, the operation has adopted some of the policy
actions outside PAF from GoM's own short term recovery plan.
* Importance of implementation capacity for the successful implementation of policy and
structural reforms cannot be overemphasized. This is more strongly evidenced by the
limited progress the implementation of PFM reforms where there reforms have been
implemented and later on abandoned. The more harmonized approach to PFM under the
PFEM MDTF is bringing a new systematic approach to tackling the persistent PFM
problems, which are also being supported by this operation.
E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
47.   The proposed operation is built on some key findings from a series of analytical
work by the Bank and other DPs in Malawi, which have form the basis for the
identification of the key reforms supported by the DPO series (table 3). This includes
the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), Comprehensive Exchange Rate and Foreign
Exchange Study, the Comprehensive Package on Competitiveness, Growth and Poverty
Reduction and the Welfare Impacts and Mitigation of Exchange Rate Unification in
Malawi, all of which contributed to the identification of key reforms to achieve
macroeconomic stability, address energy constraints, improve agriculture productivity and
farm incomes, and enhance efficiency in social safety nets; and the Public Expenditure
Financial Accountability and the Budget Technical Assistance for FY13 National Budget,
which enabled to identification of reforms to improve the public finance management,
16


﻿address the domestic payment arrears (including avoidance of the generation of new
arrears) and building the country's statistical capacity.

﻿V. THE PROPOSED ECONOMIC RECOVERY DEVELOPMENT POLICY
OPERATION (DPO-1)
A. OVERALL DESCRIPTION
48.    The DPO 1 is the first in a series of three one-year operations whose overall
objective is to support the implementation of policy reforms and institutional
development under the GoM's MGDS II and ERP. The DPO-1, specifically seeks to: i)
strengthen the macroeconomic and public finance management through measures aimed at
strengthening fiscal discipline to entrench macro-stability as well as improving efficiency
and the transparency of the public finance management; and ii) lay the foundation for
stronger growth and protection of the poor through reform measures aimed at enhancing
agriculture productivity and diversification; improving energy efficiency and the regulatory
environment; improving efficiency in the provision of social safety nets and strengthening
the country's statistical capacity.
49.    Development Objectives: The development objectives of the Economic Recovery
Development Policy Operation series are to strengthen the macroeconomic and public
finance management and lay the foundation for stronger growth and protection of the poor.
These reforms are in line with FY13-16 CAS and the GoM's own MGDS-II, ERP and the
Public Finance and Economic Management Reform Program (PFEMRP) aimed at
accelerating the economic recovery process and getting the economy back on the
sustainable growth path.
50.    Prior Actions. The program focuses largely on the medium-term measures that aim
at strengthening budget policy framework and improving its medium-term orientation;
strengthening external oversight of public finances; strengthening internal controls on
public finances; enhancing efficiency in the use of public resources; enhancing agriculture
productivity and diversification; improving energy efficiency and regulatory environment;
improving efficiency in the provision of social safety nets; and, strengthening statistical
capacity. The specific reforms supported in each area are described in the following
sections; the GoM's Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1); and the DPO-1 policy matrix
(Annex 2). The prior actions listed below support the Government in its effort to implement
its economic recovery program.
51.    Good practice principles in conditionality. Box 1 provides information on how good
principles on conditionality have been applied in Malawi.
Box 1: How Good Practice Principles on Conditionality are being Applied to the Operation
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
*   The GoM has strong ownership of the proposed DPO 1, which supports several dimensions of the
Government's economic recovery reform plan where the Bank has comparative advantage and
complements the work being supported by IMF and other development partners. The proposed DPO 1
follows the successful in implementation of the Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (currently
under implementation) and PRSC 1-3 series, which demonstrates Malawi's track record of significant
GoM ownership and commitment to the reform process. The Bank's analytic work has contributed to
the formulation and implementation of selected aspects of the Government's economic recovery
reform plan. The Bank has had extensive discussions with the authorities on the policy options and the
Government departments identified the critical reforms needed to accelerate attainment of macroeconomic
stability and growth rebound, while mitigating the impact on the most vulnerable groups.
*   The prior actions selected have been extracted from the Government's Economic Recovery Plan and
Public Finance and Economic Management Reform Program and are linked to the pillar on regain
19


﻿macro-balance, social impacts and their mitigation, and growth rebound.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
*   The CABS DPs and the GoM have signed a Joint Framework (JF) of budget support cooperation. One
of the principles contained in the JF is that of carrying out joint reviews. Every year one of the reviews
focuses on assessing Government performance in meeting the targets contained in the PAF.
*   The accountability framework (e.g. policy matrix) for measuring progress under the program has been
prepared and discussed with ministries and departments involved at technical levels.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities ofBank support to country
circumstances
* The DPO 1 team worked closely with Government counterparts from various ministries in designing and
monitoring reform implementation. The agreed accountability framework is fully consistent with the
Government's expressed policy intentions and internal accountability mechanisms. The CABS undertakes
biannual reviews, one during February-March and another during September-October. Both reviews are
aligned to the country's budget cycle. The February-March review takes place just before the Government
starts to prepare its budget. It focuses on the annual budget, public financial management issues, and an
assessment of the fiscal performance during the previous fiscal year. The September-October review
focuses on assessing Government performance in achieving the targets for each indicator in the PAF.
Decisions on whether to disburse budget support and how much disburse are based on the outcome of this
review.
Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditions for disbursement
* The DPO 1 program focuses on actions that are critical for the success of the reform aimed at aim at
strengthening the macroeconomic and public finance management while laying the foundations for stronger
growth and protection of the poor. There are 6 prior actions, which aim at enhancing efficiency and
effectiveness of government spending, improving accountability, transparency and the country's statistical
capacity, enhancing agriculture productivity, addressing energy constraints and improving social safety
nets. All prior actions agreed upon with full participation of the GoM and reflect the reform priorities of the
GoM which are supported by the Bank in the FY13-16 CAS. The actions for the proposed DPO 1
represent only those actions that will be critical for achieving the program's development objectives
and the various outcomes.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
* The preparation of this operation follows the lessons learned from the PRSC I-III and one program review
is planned. All of the prior actions as well as the expected outcome indicators for this operation focus on the
results of implementation of the supported reforms. The DPO's financial support is expected to provide
the much needed resources to support the GoM's economic stabilization process through the national
budget. The support is fully consistent with the Government's macroeconomic framework agreed with
the IMF.

﻿B.     POLICY AREAS
Pillar 1: Strengthening Macroeconomic and Public Finance Management
52.    This policy area supports a broad reform program on macroeconomic management
and the management of public finances. Specifically, it covers two specific reform
objectives, namely: i) Strengthen fiscal discipline to entrench macro-stability through the
clearance of domestic payment arrears; and ii) enhance efficiency and transparency of the
public finance management through measures to strengthen budget policy framework and
improve its medium-term orientation; strengthen external oversight of public finances;
strengthen internal controls on public finances; and enhance efficiency in the use of public
resources.
Reform Obiective: Strengthen fiscal discipline to entrench macro-stability through the
24
clearance of domestic payment arrears.
a. Arrears clearance
53.    Key issues: Malawi continues to face payment arrears problems despite efforts to
strengthen expenditure controls and improve PFM IT systems. A key purpose of improved
expenditure management is to hold spending within the approved budget and avoid the
build-up of arrears since domestic payment arrears undermine confidence in the budget
process. The 2011 PEFA assessment picked up the arrears problem but noted that there was
no readily available information about the volume of payments which were actually
overdue or the length of time they have remained outstanding (scored D). The indicator on
stock of expenditure payment arrears was not scored in the 2011 PEFA. Historically, this
problem has been associated with the failure of the GoM to control expenditure as well as
to live within its means, as evidenced by the 2005 audit, which revealed payment arrears
totaling MWK10.5 billion (equivalent to 5.8 percent of GDP). In addition to efforts to clear
those arrears, the GoM introduced the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) in 2005 to address, among others, the arrears problem and as such its
functionality was deployed to strengthen the GoM payment system, improve expenditure
control and contribute to improving fiscal reporting. This notwithstanding, the MDAs and
parastatals have been able to get suppliers to provide goods and services on credit (outside
IFMIS) as well as get the contractors to carryout construction work without having
sufficient funds in the budget.
54.    Serious deficiencies in the management and operation of IFMIS controls were
brought to light following reports of fraudulent transactions in IFMIS involving the
Police Services in 2011. In May 2012, it was revealed that about MWK 72 billion had
been accumulated to banks (about MWK 30 billion) and suppliers (about MWK 40 billion)
by the government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and parastatals. The
liquidity problems in the banking sector arose partly on account of suppliers not being paid
by the GoM, which resulted in their failure to service their bank loans. Of the total
domestic payment arrears, about MWK 37 billion were accumulated by SOEs (in the form
of loans and overdrafts). Meanwhile, MDAs accumulated arrears of around MWK 30.5
billion and arrears accumulated on pension contributions, salaries (e.g. teachers), utilities
24Domestic arrears are overdue payment obligations by central government, other than external payment arrears, including
wages and salaries, transfers, domestic interest, goods and services and payments to Malawi Revenue Authority for VAT
tax refunds (IMF definition, Article VI Consultation Report 2004).
21


﻿(electricity and water) and subscriptions are estimated at 5.2 billion. Payment arrears,
especially in the transport sector (estimated at above MWK 8.8 billion), are mainly on
account of addendums arising from extension of works, redesigning of some sections of
roads as well as fuel and foreign exchange challenges of 2011 and early 2012. Weaknesses
in the commitment management in IFMIS were at the heart of the recent cases of arrears
accumulation, which are symptomatic of the ineffectiveness of normal financial controls
and poor budget discipline. In this regard, the near term priority reform agenda for the GoM
is to put in place adequate expenditure monitoring and controls measures, improve the
business process and enhance commitments controls in IFMIS.25
55.    DPO-1 Prior Action 1: The DPO 1 is supporting the process of validating the
payment of domestic arrears through the National Audit Office and the development of an
arrears clearance plan by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Given the fact that the immediate
clearance of the historical stock of arrears is currently not feasible due to budgetary
constraints as well as related inflation risks, the GoM has converted the verified arrears into
government securities and has already issued promissory notes to banks to clear loans and
overdrafts made to the SOEs (MWK 37 billion). In addition, a total of MWK 7.7 billion
worth of promissory notes have been issued directly to contractors. In addition to
supporting the clearance of arrears owed by SoEs, the DPO 2-3 will support reforms that
will also help ensure that no build-up of new arrears through the rollout of IFMIS
commitment control module to all the Ministries, Departments and Agencies, which is to be
followed by the roll-out all the district councils. Complementing actions to strengthen the
functioning of Audit Committees and external oversight will also help improve the
effectiveness of internal controls processes and management as well as identify systemic
weakness in control mechanisms.
56.    The GoM   has also stopped commissioning new projects which do not have
adequate resources but also which do not have complete design and estimated costs. It
is expected that this measure will help to check unnecessary extensions and therefore
completion of projects within the estimated time. Furthermore, as a structural solution to
the generation of arrears and improving the credibility of the budget, the GoM will continue
to strengthen the recently reinvigorated the Medium Term Expenditure Framework. Once
all these initiatives are fully functioning the problem of the accumulation of payment
arrears would have been significantly reduced and/or eliminated. It is expected that at the
end of the program, 50 percent of the stock of domestic payment arrears owed by SOEs
would have been reduced and there will be no new arrears accumulated in the system by the
MDAs. The Central Internal Audit Unit will, on quarterly basis, undertake audits to
monitor accumulation of new arrears. These reforms will contribute towards achieving
macro stability and fiscal discipline in the medium term.
DPO-1 Prior Action 1: The Recipient, through its ministry responsible for finance, has
validated its outstanding payment arrears and has developed a plan for the full clearance of
said arrears for the State Owned Enterprises and the Ministries, Departments and Agencies.
Indicative Trigger DPO-2: The Recipient, through its ministry responsible for finance,
has cleared 25 percent of the outstanding stock of domestic payment arrears owed by State
Owned Enterprises and has rolled out commitment control under IFMIS to all Ministries,
Departments and Agencies, and to local district councils.
25 IFMIS business review process recently undertaken.
22


﻿Indicative Trigger DPO-3: The Recipient, through the Ministry responsible for Finance,
has cleared at least 50 percent of the outstanding stock of domestic payment arrears owed
by State Owned Enterprises and has verified non-accumulation of new domestic payment
arrears by the Ministries, Departments and Agencies.
Expected Results. i) Percentage of outstanding stock of public payment arrears (MWK 37
billion owed by State Owed Enterprise) cleared from 0% by 2012 to 50 percent by 2016;
ii) zero ceiling for accumulation of new domestic payment arrears by the Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Medium term outcome is strengthened fiscal
discipline and no build-up of new domestic payment arrears.
Reform Objective. Enhance the efficiency and transparency of the public finance
management26 by strengthening budget policy framework and improving its medium-term
orientation; strengthening external oversight of public finances; strengthening internal
controls on public finances; and, enhancing efficiency in the use ofpublic resources.27
b.     Strengthen budget policy framework and improve its medium-term orientation
57.    Key Issues:     While recent budget reforms have provided for significant
improvements in comprehensiveness and transparency of public financial management,
progress towards a credible budget has been slow. According to the 2011 Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA), the 2007/08-2009/10 period was
characterized by persistent over-spending in comparison to original budget which contrasts
with the previous three years each of which reported under-spending. There are also
shortfalls in revenue and cash flow forecasting. For instance, actual revenue tends to
consistently be above budget, as it had been in the previous three years, which affects
expenditure levels. Therefore, the credibility of the budget has been called into question
with regards to its ability to provide a reliable indication of the GoM's resource envelope.
As such, Malawi received a 'C' rating on deviations in composition of expenditure out-turn
compared to the original approved budget and scored 'D' in the deviations in aggregate
revenue out-turn compared with the original approved budget in the 2011 PEFA (Annex 4
D).
58.    Given the fact that budget credibility is at the core of a good budgeting system,
a credible budget is the one that is being implemented as planned and one that
accurately reflects a nation's priorities. This requires a prudent macro-fiscal framework
and realistic revenue projections; credible assessments of the existing cost of government
and the cost of new initiatives; a transparent and disciplined budget planning process;
robust systems of budget classification, execution, financial management and
accountability; and the availability of good information on spending and service delivery.
The multi-year planning and budgeting process is still at infancy and efforts are underway
to further strengthen the capacity of MDAs to meet the MTEF requirements. With the re-
invigoration of the medium term expenditure framework in 2011/12, the annual budget is
now being prepared within the medium term budgeting framework with a view to enhance
26 The GoM has committed to strengthening capacity of PFM institutions through the Public Finance and Economic
Management Reform Program (PFEMRP, 2011-2016), which was approved in July 2011.
27Financial Reporting and Oversight Improvement Project, under the PFEM MDTF, is also focusing on improving the
Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) and oversight functions of internal and external audit for better
implementation of the rules and regulations, fuller utilization of IFMIS functionalities and improved service delivery.

﻿the link between policy, planning and budgeting process to better reflect what is contained
in the MGDS II.
59.   DPO-1 Prior Action 2: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Finance, has
adopted a detailed budget formulation calendar. With the recent reinvigoration of MTEF
the GoM has come up with a revised annual budget formulation calendar to accommodate
the required medium term perspective, expenditure reviews and budget consultations. The
revised calendar has accommodate the preparation of Budget Policy Framework Paper and
the Medium Term Economic And Fiscal Policy Statement early on in the budget
preparation process so as to provide adequate time for undertaking review of macro-fiscal
performance, analysis of fiscal strategies, budget analysis, analysis of submissions from
spending agencies and timely review of budget ceilings, where necessary. The process will
proceed alongside a review of the macro-fiscal framework in order to determine an
affordable resource and expenditure framework for the annual budget and the medium-
term.
60.   The indicative trigger for DPO-2 Indicative Trigger DPO-2: In support of the
GoM's objective of strengthening the multi-year planning process, the DPO 2 will support
the approval of the Budget Policy Framework Paper (BPFP) for 2013/14.28 The BPFP,
which is a three-year rolling framework, will be used to streamline and guide the budget
process, setting out planned outputs and their associated expenditures in the medium-term.
It will attempt to outline an affordable medium term (2014/15 to 2016/17) financing plan,
in line with the country's commitments under the ERP and the MGDS II. The BPFP will be
linked to the Ministries' budget ceilings and will be discussed with the Cabinet.
61.   The indicative trigger for DPO-3 focuses on the development of the Medium
Term Fiscal Framework (MTEF) manual and its adoption by MDAs. This seeks to
complement the indicative trigger for DPO-2 on the BPFP. The MTEF manual will help
improve the use of MTEF as a strategic planning and budgeting tool within the Medium
Term Fiscal Framework. The MTEF manual will among others, incorporate the policy and
institutional procedures for construction of an MTEF, illustrate how the Public Sector
Investment Program (PSIP) is integrated into the MTEF, provide guidance and budget
formats for an integrated capital and recurrent expenditure forecasting structure, and,
establish a methodology for producing line ministry multi-year ceilings. Based on this
Manual, sensitization program will be carried out on the use of the manual in planning and
budgeting to enhance in-depth understanding of the underlying principles of the MTEF and
application of the MTEF as the foundation for effective implementation of program budget
reform.
62.   Through the proposed reforms under this series, it is expected that in the
medium term, budget planning and execution would be strengthened and the
efficiency of spending will be further enhanced. The expected result at the end of the
series is the strengthened budget policy framework and improvements in its medium-term
orientation as evidenced by the reduction in the variance in primary expenditure between
approved and outturn for 25 votes from an average of 12.0 percent during 2009/10-2011/12,
to 8 percent or less by 2016.
28 They are three-year rolling frameworks used to streamline and guide the budget process, setting out planned outputs and
their associated expenditures in the medium term.

﻿DPO-1 Prior Action 2: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Finance, has adopted a
detailed budget formulation calendar.
Indicative Trigger DPO-2: The Recipient, through the Minister of Finance, has approved
adopted the Budget Framework Paper for 2013/14.
Indicative Trigger DPO-3: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Finance, has
developed the Medium Term Expenditure Framework manual.
Expected Results: Variance in the expenditure between approved expenditure and outturn
for 25 votes from an average of 12.0 percent during 2009/10-2011/12, to 8 percent or less
by 2016. Medium term outcome is strengthened budget policy framework and
improvements in its medium-term orientation.
c.    Strengthen external oversight ofpublic finances
63.    Key Issues: While the GoM has made considerable progress in strengthening public
sector management systems with notable improvement in external auditing and
parliamentary scrutiny of financial accounts, challenges in the quality of audit and the
actions and follow up based on the recommendations of the National Audit Office (NAO)
and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament remain key. The performance on
follow-up of the recommendations of the Auditor General's reports is an important
milestone in ensuring transparency and value for money. According to 2011 PEFA, for over
a decade or so the lapsed time from the end of each fiscal year to the completion of
hearings by the PAC and the issue of the PAC Report has ranged from 34 to 58 months.
While backlogs of the Auditor General's reports has been recently cleared (in 2011),
backlogs remain in the issuance of Treasury Minutes.29 As of June 2012, only the Treasury
Minute for the fiscal year 2004/05, had been submitted to PAC, reflecting the extent of the
backlog with the Treasury Minutes for fiscal years 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09 and 2009/10
yet to be submitted. Records of follow-up of audit issues remain scarce and in particular,
Treasury Minutes recording follow-up of outstanding issues, are not issued on a regular and
timely basis and these continue to affect the timely response to persistent problems in
public finance management. External and internal audit reports repeatedly report on control
weaknesses, lack of adherence to laws and financial management regulations, and
ineffectiveness of sanctions against such breaches is costing tax payers billions of kwacha.
The 2011 PEFA score for evidence of follow up on audit recommendations was D.
64.    DPO-1 Prior Action 3: DPO-1 focuses on the submission of the Treasury Minutes
for fiscal years 2005/06 and 2006/07 to the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament.
The objective is to strengthen accountability in the use of public funds and to improve the
quality and timely follow-up on external audit reports and recommendations so as to ensure
that control measures are being put in place to improve efficiency and effectiveness of
government expenditure as well as enhance value for money. This reform action is also
being complemented by reforms related to improving internal controls and audit functions.
DPO-2 will focus on clearing Treasury Minutes for financial years 2007/08, 2008/09,
2009/10 and 2010/11 as well as the creation of baseline data of pending audit queries by the
MDAs. Whereas, DPO-3 will focus on Treasury Minutes for fiscal years 2011/12 and

level were also delayed and GoM's responses (Treasury Minutes) for the respective audit reports were also delayed.

﻿2012/13 as well as the reduction in pending audit queries per MDAs by 25 percent. In this
regard, DPO series seek to accelerate the process of clearing the backlog of Treasury
Minutes and ensure that accountability mechanisms are strengthened and the objective of
improved efficiency in government expenditure is achieved through reductions in pending
audit queries. It is expected that by the end of the DPO series external oversight of public
finances will be strengthened evidenced by the reduction of the backlogs of Treasury

Treasury Minutes for fiscal years 2005/06 and 2006/2007 to Parliament.
Indicative Triggers DPO-2: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Finance, has
submitted Treasury Minutes for fiscal years 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11 to
Parliament and has created baseline data of pending audit queries by Ministries,
Departments and Agencies.
Indicative Triggers DPO-3: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Finance, has
submitted Treasury Minutes for fiscal years 2011/12 and 2012/13 to Parliament and has
registered 25 percent reduction in pending audit queries per Ministries, Departments and
Agencies.
Expected Results: Reduction of backlog from over 60 months in 2012, to 48 months by
2016. Medium term outcome is strengthened external oversight ofpublic finances.
d.     Strengthen internal controls on public finances
65.    Key Issues: Internal controls and audit functions remain weak. Reforms over the
past five years focused on establishing the Audit Committees (ACs) to provide the
institutional mechanism to follow up on audit recommendations, but progress has been
rather slow. With a large number of ACs inadequately functioning, audit follow-up remains
weak, with the quality of audit compromised as some of the identified inefficiencies in the
system are allowed to persist with delayed execution of corrective actions, which ends up
costing the country billions of Kwacha. Lack of political commitment as well as lack clear
appreciation of the roles and functions of the ACs are among factors that have contributed
to the non-functioning of the ACs. According to the 2011 PEFA, evidence of management
response to audit reports remains weak and the country scored D on the effectiveness of
internal audit controls. This remains a big constraint in the promotion of accountability and
efficiency of spending in the PFEM reform program.
66.    There is evidence of backlog of audit reports to be considered by ACs in some
line ministries. In most instances, the ACs are not functioning and where they have met
their role is compromised and not well understood. In particular, the Committees are
chaired by the Controlling Officer (CO) and include only internal (to the line ministry)
representation. This however raises the conflict of interest risk as the COs are also the
30The GoM has a fully-fledged unit dealing with Treasury Minutes, including follow-ups. The Treasury Minutes are very
useful in preventing fraud and malpractices as they compile actions taken from the audit queries and the PAC follows the
matters to its conclusion. In the event that fraud cases are not properly handled, PAC has power to request the Fiscal
Police to apprehend the culprits. Prior to the issuance of Treasury Minutes, Chief Secretary in the Office of the President
and Cabinet produces the Government's response to the recommendations from PAC from their examination of Audit
General's reports.
26


﻿chairs of AC, which could undermine the internal audit function and thus the need to revise
the Audit Committee Charter. Strengthening of internal controls and audits is essential to
increasing efficiency of public expenditure. While some improvements have been noted in
responses from COs on the management letter recommendations, for the rest there is little
or no evidence on efforts in complying with requirements. With the new impetus on fiscal
controls from the GoM and the drive to improve efficiency in government expenditure,
efforts are now being geared toward injecting a new lease of life into the ACs.31
67.    Indicative Triggers DPO-2 and DPO-3: The DPO-2 will support the process of
reviving the Audit Committees in the ten largest spending ministries and ensure that they
are functional (having at least 4 meetings per fiscal year with clear set of deliverables). The
ten key spending ministries include Health, Education, Agriculture, Finance, Office of the
President and Cabinet (OPC), Transport and Public Works, Gender, Defense, Local
Government, and Mines. DPO-2 will also focus on creating baseline data of pending bank
reconciliation per MDAs. The GoM is also working on a mechanism to help them tackle
persistent audit issues in these key spending ministries in a systematic way with a goal of
ensuring that recommendations from audit reports are actually implemented and reforms
are undertaken to strengthen controls and transparency as well as ensure value for money.
The GoM is also in the process of revising the Audit Committee Charter through a
consultative process with MDAs to address some of the above mentioned challenges. These
reforms will also be supported through the FROIP project, which among others, focuses on
strengthening both internal and external audit function. Through FROIP, the sensitization
program for the ACs and COs will be rolled out to ensure that the importance of following
up on audit issues is well appreciated. DPO-3 will support the process of getting the ACs in
the remaining MDAs to function and will ensure that an updated bank reconciliation for the
MDAs is carried out on regular basis. It is expected that by these reforms will contribute
towards strengthening of internal controls of public finances and by the end of the DPO
series, there would be significant reduction in recurrent audit findings and improved bank
reconciliation.
Indicative Trigger DPO-2: The Recipient has instructed 10 largest spending ministries32
to ensure that respective Audit Committees are functional and baseline data of pending
bank reconciliation has been created per Ministries, Departments and Agencies as
evidenced by at least 80 percent reduction in the rate of recurrent audit findings and at
least one meeting held by all 10 Audit Committees during the first half of 2013/14.
Indicative Trigger DPO-3: The Recipient has instructed Audit Committees in the
remaining ministries to be functional and has carried out bank reconciliation for the
Ministries, Departments and Agencies up to three months before negotiations for DPO-3
as evidenced by at least 75 percent reduction in the rate of recurrent audit findings and at
least four meetings held by all Audit Committees per financial year.
Expected Results: Reduction in the rate of recurring audit findings from 98 percent in
2012, to 60 percent by 2016. Medium term outcome is strengthened external oversight of
public finances.

﻿e. Enhance efficiency in the use ofpublic resources
68.  Over the last ten years, the most important objective of the agriculture policy in
Malawi has been to achieve food security. This core objective was sought to be achieved
by the Farmer Input Subsidy Program (FISP) under which small farmers receive fertilizer
and seeds. After 7 years of implementation, FISP has had an impact on increasing maize
production and stimulating the seed demand and market. However, its fiscal burden has
been increasing from an average of 2.6 percent of GDP during 2010-2012, after
overshooting to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and picked up to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2013.
In term of FISP's share in the MoAFS budget, it currently stands at 85 percent of the
MoAFS budget (10 percent of the overall Government Budget). Based on the last IHS3
results that show a stagnation of poverty in rural areas over the last five years, there are
concerns about FISP efficiency and its real impact of its targeted beneficiaries, the poorest
farmers. There are thus concerns on whether FISP is the right instrument to help poor
smallholders access to and use of improved agricultural inputs; or whether FISP targeting is
relevant to achieve a large scale production increase. There are also major concerns from
DPs as well as from the civil society and farmers organizations, that FISP size may be
crowding out other critical investments in agriculture (irrigation, research, post-harvest
processing, etc.) as confirmed by the on-going Agricultural Public Expenditure Review
(AgPER) led by the Bank. The fiscal cost for the FISP remains unsustainably high while
the procurement of fertilizer has not led to real value-for-money and timely delivery of
fertilizer to farmers. There is therefore a consensus to start redesigning FISP based on a
two-step approach by: (i) immediately look at short-term efficiency measures to improve
implementation; and (ii) discuss medium-term reforms to improve its impact on the ground.
69. As part of the first step and as requested by other donors, the Bank is
participating in a FISP efficiency improvement committee led by the Principal
Secretary of MoAFS. This committee has already identified four sets of "quick-fix"
measures to improve next year FISP implementation: (i) the elaboration of a detailed
planning of FISP campaign to ensure a timely delivery of vouchers, fertilizer and seeds to
farmers; (ii) the introduction of e-vouchers on a pilot basis in some targeted districts to save
on secure paper vouchers and avoid frauds and corruption on the ground; (iii) the
introduction of a cell phone-based monitoring system to track in real time fertilizer delivery
and ensure adequate stocking of fertilizer in rural outlets and avoid beneficiary congestion;
and (iv) the revision of the procurement modalities for the selection of the most efficient
fertilizer suppliers and transporters to ensure value-for-money and a timely delivery of
fertilizer to farmers.
70. As part of the second step, the policy dialogue on FISP reform has already
started and will be further stimulated in the coming year by two key on-going
analytical activities: (i) the Bank-supported AgPER and (ii) the DflD-funded FISP
evaluation carried out by the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) from the
University of London. The overall approach is to analyze the FISP in a broader context of
public expenditures in agriculture. Preliminary results of the AgPER for instance
recommend to: (i) re-balance public investments to better support other critical agricultural
areas such as research and extension, small- and large-scale irrigation, supply chain and
agri-business development; (ii) better articulate support to productivity increase, targeted at
the middle range categories of farmers, with other existing social protection programs
targeted at the poorest categories of farmers.

﻿71.   DPO-1 Prior Action 4: The Recipient has revised the FISP fertilizer procurement
modalities with a refined bid evaluation methodology through DPO-1. It is estimated that
the efficiency saving measures introduced in the 2013/14 FISP procurement will result in
fiscal savings amounting to about US$ 10 million. The reform under DPO-2 will support
the GoM in organizing stakeholder consultations on the findings of the AgPER and the
FISP impact evaluation to initiate discussion on required reforms. This will help redefine
FISP objectives, content and implementation modalities to improve its efficiency and
impact on the ground, which should help reduce the fiscal burden and chart out the future of
FISP. Meanwhile, DPO-3 will support the revision of public investments in agriculture in
line with the priorities of MoAFS investment framework as detailed in its Agricultural
Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp) document, already validated by the GoM, the private
sector, farmers' organizations and donors.
DPO-1 Prior Action 4: The Recipient, through its ministry responsible for agriculture
and food security, has revised the bidding documents for the annual procurement of
fertilizer under the Farm Input Subsidy Program to align the allocation of tonnage
demand with unit price ranking for the purpose of increasing the Recipient's value-for-
money.
Indicative Trigger DPO-2: The Recipient, through Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Security, has reviewed the design of Farm Input Subsidy Program in light of findings of
various impact evaluations, agriculture Public Expenditure Review, and consultations.
The recommendations have been submitted to Cabinet.
Indicative Trigger DPO-3: The Recipient, through Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Security, has re-structured its public expenditure in agriculture in line with the redefined
Farm Input Subsidy Program objectives and priorities of the ASWAp framework, as
evident in 2014/15 budget.
Expected Results: Public investments in agriculture equally distributed among the three
ASWAp pillars. Medium term outcome is enhanced efficiency in the use of public
resources.
Pillar 2: Laying the Foundation for Stronger Growth and Protection of the Poor
Reform Objective: To enhance agriculture productivity and diversification; improve energy
efficiency and the regulatory environment; improve efficiency in the provision of social
safety nets and strengthen the country's statistical capacity.
a. Enhance agriculture productivity and diversification through efficient seeds market
72. Expanding and diversifying agricultural exports is one of the top priorities of the
Government's agricultural development strategy. The country remains too dependent on
a single agricultural export, tobacco. Despite an increasing demand in emerging economies,
tobacco prices are fluctuating and quality requirements are more and more strict. The
enforcement of the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco,
which would restrict, and possibly ban, the use of flavorants, which are essential
ingredients for Burley-filled tobacco products, may also threaten the market expansion of
the Burley tobacco which is mainly grown in Malawi. Burley tobacco still accounts for
about 80 percent of Malawi's agricultural exports and 60 percent of national export value.
29


﻿There is thus a need for the country to diversify in other agricultural productions for which
good emerging market prospects exist, mainly cotton or legumes such as groundnuts, soya
beans and pigeon peas.
73. Transforming the smallholder agricultural sector is also a key priority to ensure
agricultural growth. Smallholder farmers have to move beyond maize-based food security
to enter into more commercial-oriented productions. Constraints to agricultural
transformation include low productivity, very small land holdings with insecure tenure,
recurrent drought, lack of access to financial services and to market information, and scarce
and expensive transport to markets. On-going investments aim at increasing productivity
and farming system resilience through irrigation development, improved technology
dissemination, research and extension.
74.  However, one key constraint to increasing productivity and diversifying
smallholder agricultural remains the availability of quality seeds both for staple food
and export productions. There are several initiatives to support research in developing
new varieties and extension programs to make them available to farmers. The
implementation of the FISP, which includes a seed distribution component, has stimulated
the demand for improved seeds for maize and legumes. While availability of improved
seeds has significantly increased, quantities available on the local markets are still limiting
adoption by farmers. Some concerns with quality have also emerged, especially in the
legumes sector.
75.  It is therefore proposed to support the policy dialogue between the GoM, seeds
companies and farmers' organizations on seeds availability and quality. The Bank is
already facilitating a multi-stakeholder working group on "quality seeds for FISP". This
group acts as a platform to share information between seed companies, farmers'
organization and public services (research, extension and seed certification). There is a
consensus in this group that beyond working on seed availability, there is a need to improve
the regulation framework and on improving the seed certification process. Since the last
adoption of seed regulatory measures in 2005, the seed subsector has undergone massive
transformation with the emergence of numerous new stakeholders (seed breeders, seed
companies, agro-dealers, etc.). There is a need to review the regulatory framework for seed
certification, while protecting breeders' rights and stimulating the market through cross-
boundaries exchanges of germplasms. In that context, the need to comply with recently
adopted international regulations, especially with respect to international property rights
agreement (TRIPS) and the COMESA/SADC seed harmonization framework will be taken
into account.
76. The proposed DPO would facilitate the review of the existing seeds regulation
and legislation pertaining to seed production and registration and breeder's rights
based on a sound consultation with seeds companies and farmers' organizations. This
process should start with a review of the current seed legislation framework in Malawi that
would provide recommendations for further harmonization with the SADC seed framework
and the need to further stimulate the market for seed production and cross-boundary
circulation. The proposed DPO would ensure seeds companies and farmers' organizations
have been associated to the drafting of a new policy seed act and its regulations for the
efficient functioning of a comprehensive seed regulatory system.
30


﻿77.  This policy approach would adequately complement on-going investments in
strengthening and upgrading the Seed Services Unit to improve quality control and
certification, in research to develop new varieties and in extension to promote the adoption
of improved varieties by farmers. The process of developing seeds and significantly
increasing quantities will take three years or so and this is the rationale for supporting this
proposed reform under a DPO series.
78. Indicative Triggers DPO-2 and DPO-3: To improve farmers' access to quality
improved technologies and promotion of an efficient seed market, the GoM will undertake
a review of the legal and regulatory framework for quality seed production under DPO 2. It
will organize consultations with seed companies and farmers' organizations on
recommendations for amending the Seeds and Breeder's Acts through DPO 3. These
actions will ensure that the seed subsector is governed by a clear legal and regulatory
framework, based on a sound consensus between the Government, private sectors and
agricultural producers. At the end of the program, it is expected that agriculture
productivity and diversification will be enhanced as evidenced by the increase in quantity
and improvements in the quality of maize and legumes seeds.
Indicative Trigger DPO-2: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Security, has completed a review of the legal and regulatory framework for
quality seed production.
Indicative Trigger DPO-3: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Security, has finalized revisions of the Seeds Act and Breeders' Act following
consultations with private seed companies and farmers organizations.
Expected Results: Increase in legume production by 20 percent compared to the 2012
level. Medium term outcome is the increase in agriculture productivity and
diversification.
b.    Improve energy efficiency and the regulatory environment
79.   Key Issues: The electricity sub-sector in Malawi suffers from low coverage,
unreliable and inadequate supply, and high technical and commercial distributional losses
(including inefficient bill collection and low tariffs).33 Insufficient progress with reform of
energy sector policy and legal framework and continuing financial weakness at ESCOM
remain a challenge. The 2010 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) identified the
unreliability of power supply as one of the primary constraints to growth in Malawi.
Currently, the installed capacity stands at 283MW -- not all of which may be available at
any particular moment, given the increasing frequency of unscheduled outages -- while
peak demand is now estimated to exceed 330MW. No new power generation capacity has
been added since the commissioning of the Kapichira hydropower plant in 2000. This has
led to a significant investment by consumers and industry in expensive and inefficient back-
up arrangements (typically diesel gen-sets). Indeed, this form of energy security is
estimated to cost the population at least an additional 25 percent in spending on electricity
per month. At 8.7 percent, Malawi's access to electricity is lower than that of neighboring
33 In 2008, ESCOM  registered transmission and distributional losses of over 21 percent.
31


﻿Zambia (23.0 percent of households), Mozambique (11 percent), and Tanzania (11
percent).34
80.    The power sector regulatory environment and the general economic climate in
the sector are not attractive for large investors given the low average electricity tariff.
The issue of electricity tariff is important to investors who want to venture into power
generation and therefore there is a need to come up with a tariff structure that is cost
reflective and also be able to attract off-takers. Most of the sector's problems are caused by
the weak institutional and policy framework, which results in inadequate pricing, lack of
competition, inadequate routine maintenance, and insufficient new investment to expand
access. The reforms in the electricity sub-sector are not only expected to help the existing
operators to recover their operational costs but are also expected to open up the market for
new investors, the Independent Power Producers, whose entry will help ESCOM (which
has low generation capacity) meet national energy demands. Currently, ESCOM charges
approximately 6.90/kWh on average, which is below its cost of service estimated at
100/kWh. The average market tariff in the region currently stands at approximately
120/kWh and as such ESCOM needs to intensify efforts to make its tariffs more cost
reflective and bring them closer to the average regional rate, while ensuring that the poorest
segment of the population with access to electricity are being cushioned.
81.    DPO-1 Prior Action 5: To ensure that electricity tariffs reflect changes in the
underlying fundamentals, the Malawi Energy Regulator Authority (MERA) is now
reviewing electricity tariffs within the framework of the Automatic Tariff Adjustment
formula (ATAF) on a monthly basis where adjustments in tariffs are triggered by
movements in exchange rate (80 percent of the weight) and inflation (20 percent of total
weight) above the 5 percent threshold. Until recently, ESCOM used to carry out the
automatic tariff review less regularly and required authorization from the GoM before
tariff adjustments could be effected, which affected ESCOM'S operational costs. Following
the Cabinet decision to reinstate Automatic Price Mechanism for petroleum (APM) and to
continue the implementation of ATAF in May 2012, MERA is now reviewing how the
monthly changes in fundamentals (based as well as on other parameters such as operational
costs and implementation efficiency gains) are affecting ESCOM's financial position. But
according to the Energy Law, ESCOM is still obligated to initiate the request for tariff
adjustment to MERA for no objection and execution. So far, two electricity tariffs
adjustments have been implemented. Specifically, the two tariff adjustments in 2012 have
put ESCOM in a much better financial position. For instance, the tariff adjustments in May
2012 helped restore the real value of the tariff in US dollar terms to 60/KWh after falling to
40/KWh immediately after the unification of the exchange rate. The adjustments made in
November 2012 saw the average real price rise to 70/KWh. In order to move the electricity
tariffs closer to the market reference point, an accelerator of 2 percent will be added over
and above the adjustment in ATAF based on changes in market fundamentals. Tariff
adjustments for ESCOM are necessary, especially with the imminent entry by the IPPs
where ESCOM would be main the off-taker of power generated by IPPs.35
34 Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD), "Underpowered: The State of the Power Sector in Sub-Saharan
Africa, June 2008.
The GoM have committed through the Millennium Challenge Compact on Energy to a turn-around facility where
ESCOM will be required to make tariff adjustments and quarterly reviews by MCA will undertake. In an event where
there is a gap between the electricity tariff and the cost of production, the GoM will be required to cover for the difference.
32


﻿82.   The reforms supported by DPO-2 and DPO-3 will focus on improving the
policy and regulatory environment in the sector with the view of creating a conducive
environment for Independent Power Producers, where tariff adjustment closer to the
average market tariff in the region is a critical component for attracting the IPPs. These two
operations will support the process of revising the Energy Policy and the enactment of the
revised Electricity Act, respectively. The findings from the on-going Poverty and Social
Impact Assessment (PSIA) on energy will contribute to the on-going discussions between
the GoM and the MCC on future options for tariff adjustment, with increased focus on the
lifeline tariff option (Annex 4E). These discussions will also feed into the energy policy
review discussions and will inform the development of the new Energy strategy after the
Energy policy revisions. The restatement of the MCC Energy Compact in June 2012, the
Kapichira II soon to come on stream and the potential entry of IPPs will help improve
energy generation capacity over the medium term. It is expected that at the end of the series
the regulatory environment would have improved, electricity tariffs would be in line with
the regional average and more players would have entered the market.
DPO-1 Prior Action 5: The Recipient, through the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority,
has undertaken monthly reviews of the Automatic Tariff Adjustment Formula for
electricity covering the period May to November 2012.
Indicative Triggers DPO-2: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Energy, has reviewed
Energy Policy and through the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority, has undertaken
monthly reviews of the Automatic Tariff Adjustment Formula for electricity.
Indicative Triggers DPO-3: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Energy, has revised
and gazetted in full the Electricity Law of 2004 and through the Malawi Energy
Regulatory Authority has undertaken monthly reviews of the Automatic Tariff Adjustment
Formula for electricity.
.Expected Results: Issuance of Power Generation License for an Independent Power
Producer from 0 in 2012, to at least 1 by 2016. Medium term outcome is improved
efficiency in the energy supply and a more conducive regulatory environment.
c.    Improve efficiency in the provision of Social Safety Nets
83.   Key Issues: Currently, many of the social support interventions in Malawi are
uncoordinated. The interventions include public works programs, social cash transfers,
school meals, and savings and loan schemes. Most of these interventions, except for the
public works, are not implemented nationwide and have limited ability to scale up in times
of crises. In addition, these interventions have different targeting mechanisms, and it is
possible to double target a needy household in the absence of a harmonized targeting
mechanism. An estimated 50.7 percent of the population is classified as vulnerable (IHS3
20 10/11). The GoM has been providing social protection through various interventions to
help vulnerable groups manage the risks they face. The GoM's spending on social
protection was 5 percent of total spending in FY12/13 (excluding FISP) but is mainly
sourced from donors.
84.   The GoM    has taken major steps to strengthen the social safety net system.
After years of trying to get the GoM approve the Social Support Policy (SSP) and increase
33


﻿the budgetary allocations for social protection as stipulated in the SSP through the previous
PRSC series, the GoM finally approved the Policy in June 2012. The GoM aims to improve
the coordination and coverage of social protection programs. In line with the SSP36adopted
in June 2012, the GoM has begun to roll out large programs to reach more vulnerable
people and to cushion the impact of the stabilization effort on the most vulnerable groups.
There is clearly the need to strike a balance between economic incentives and the provision
of social protection as an investment that will protect the most vulnerable from falling again
into the poverty trap. Thus, the need to come up with productive social safety net programs
as poverty reducing instruments. Social protection and investments in productive safety
nets and resilience programs will help to reduce poverty and promote economic growth.
85.    DPO-1 Prior Actions 6: The Recipient has approved the National Social Support
Programme (NSSP). The NSSP will facilitate the operationalization of the SSP, which
provides guidelines for the design and implementation of social support interventions,
coordination, resource mobilization, monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the
instruments as well as the design of graduation and exit strategies for the beneficiaries. The
NSSP is expected to create an enabling policy environment for the implementation of social
protection interventions to maximize their impact. The indicative trigger for DPO-2 will
focus on reforms aimed at building the M&E framework for the SP sector to address the
problem of data availability and fragmentation. This action will help the GoM and key
stakeholders in the sector monitor implementation of social protection initiatives and assess
their impact. The indicative trigger for DPO-3 is on supporting the piloting a harmonized
targeting system of beneficiaries and unified registry of beneficiaries to three district
councils with the goal of improving access of the poor and extreme poor to social transfers
as well as improving targeting and effectiveness of such programs. The rationale for the
unified registry is to bring about a much better targeting system as well as minimize double
dipping. This would facilitate achieving sustainable results as well as the scale up of
delivery and coverage in times of crisis. These reforms will also track graduation of
beneficiaries, in addition to providing a clear picture of the population benefiting from the
programs. The expected result at the end of the series is improved efficiency and the
targeting of the social support programs.
DPO-1 Prior Action 6: The Recipient has approved the National Social Support Program.
Indicative Trigger DPO-2: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Economic Planning
and Development, has established the Monitoring and Evaluation system for the social
support programs.
Indicative Trigger DPO-3: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Economic Planning
and Development, has piloted a harmonized targeting system of beneficiaries and unified
registry of beneficiaries in three district councils.
Expected Results: Beneficiaries with savings of at least 30 percent of Public Works wage
36 The objective of the NSSP is to provide a framework for prioritizing targeting of support to reduce poverty and enable
the poor to move out of poverty and vulnerability. It consists of four main pillars: (i) provision of social support; (ii)
protection of assets; (iii) promotion of productivity enhancement; and (iv) policies to reduce exclusion. The NSSP is
meant to provide an overarching framework for all social support activities undertaken by GoM and donors. The GoM has
identified five social support programs that are to be included in the NSSP. These are: 1) public works; 2) social cash
transfers; 3) school meals; 4) micro-credit; and 5) village savings and loan schemes.
34


﻿one year after participation increase from 13,000 in 2012, to 49,000 in 2016. Medium
term outcome is improved efficiency in the provision of social safety nets and a more
responsive system of cushioning the poor and most vulnerable.
d.    Strengthen Statistical Capacity
86.   Key Issues: The quality and credibility of the country's statistics remains low. Data
gaps, time lags and data quality issues still exist despite progress made to strengthen NSO's
capacity. Challenges in the National Statistics System (NSS) include inadequate human
resources, low investment in infrastructure and equipment, low profile of statistics within
the sector ministries, inadequate capacity to collect, compile, store and disseminate and use
statistics, uncoordinated and un-harmonized statistical management. Reliable and timely
statistics on economic and social conditions are important for policy makers, private sector,
development partners and investors. The NSO has to date implemented three Strategic
Plans since 1996, and the fourth one covering 2012-2016 is soon to be completed. The
National Statistical System was launched in 2006, with the first phase culminated in June
2008 with the National Statistical System Strategic Plan (NSSSP) (2008-2012) covering six
ministries (Agriculture, Education, Health, Labour, Trade and Industry and Justice).
87.   Production of statistics by sectors has been disjointed. As a basis for sound
M&E, among others, Malawi has also been improving its statistics. The National Statistical
Office (NSO) has experience in administering the National Household Survey (with support
from the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on
Agriculture) and other mandated basic surveys, but there are data quality issues, especially
as it relates to crop estimates, among others, and as such there is need to establish closer
links between the NSO and both suppliers and users of data, outside as well as inside
government. As a result, production of statistics has been costly or not harmonized hence
the results produced have been inconsistent. The establishment of the NSS Strategic Plan
seeks to coordinate production of statistics. The GoM now has a government-wide and
results-oriented M&E system and is pushing for performance management. Among
challenges encountered during the implementation of the NSSSP 2008-2012, included lack
of coordination mechanisms to standardize and harmonize terms, concepts, methodologies
and procedures between sources, surveys and institutions, insufficient participation of line
ministries in the NSS due to lack of support from the leadership in the ministries, and non-
completion of the NSS work plan and financing strategy. These challenges will be
addressed through DPO-2 and DPO-3.
88.   Indicative Triggers DPO-2 and DPO-3: The DPO-2 will support the development
of the National Statistics System Strategic Plan 2013-2017, which will contribute to
improvements in the country's statistical and M&E systems needed to improve program
design and resource allocations. This Strategic Plan will present the vision, mission, core
values and objectives that are going to guide the NSS for the next five years. The NSSSP is
meant to oversee the development and implementation of a comprehensive and well-
coordinated system of producing, processing and disseminating official statistics. The
objective is to enable the country meet the ever growing demand for high quality, timely,
accessible statistical information needed for evidence-based decision and policy making.
The strategic plan has been aligned to local and international development frameworks such
as MGDS II and MDGs respectively. The indicative trigger for DPO-3 is the approval of
35


﻿the revised Statistical Bill. The strategic plan and the Statistics bill will help enhance
coordination of statistical activities in Malawi, enhance filling of vacant positions in the
statistical units of the various sectors as well as lay the foundation for a more harmonized
approach by DPs to supporting statistics in Malawi. The expected result at the end of the
series is the production of quality and timely statistics for planning, implementation,
monitoring and evaluating the progress of Malawi Growth and Development Strategy and
other critical statistics.
Indicative Trigger DPO-2: The Recipient, through the National Statistical Office, has
developed the National Statistics System Strategic Plan 2013-2017.
Indicative Trigger DPO-3: The Recipient, through the Parliament, has enacted the
revised Statistics Bill.
Expected Results: Number of quarterly MGDS progress reports published from 0 in
2012, to 4 in 2016. Medium term outcome is the production of high quality, timely and
accessible statistical information.
36


﻿VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A.     POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
89.   According to the recent report of Malawi's Third Integrated Household Survey
(IHS3 2010/11), absolute poverty has declined by less than 2 percent since 2004/05, to
50.7 percent. Although poverty in urban areas reduced from 25.4 percent in 2005 to 17.3
percent in 2011, this gain was counterbalanced by a worsening in rural poverty from 55.9
percent to 56.6 percent.37 The Gini coefficient for Malawi deteriorated from 0.39 in
2004/05 to 0.45 in 2010/11. Within rural areas, the index rose from 0.34 to 0.38, while in
urban areas it was fairly constant at about 0.49. Poverty rates among female headed
households are significantly higher than male headed households, with their limited access
to larger land holdings and failure to engage in cash crop production contributing to the
higher household poverty.
90.    Overall, the proposed policy actions supported by this operation are likely to
have positive impacts on welfare and its distribution (table 5). As spelled out in the
MGDS II, weak macroeconomic and public finance management systems and poor
governance are perceived to be critical causes of poverty since weaknesses, especially in
PFM, usually lead to inefficiencies in public spending, limited controls in the use of public
resource and fiscal losses, which affect the GoM's ability to deliver public services to the
poor. Strengthening of macroeconomic and public finance management will therefore
enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in public resource use; reduce the
outstanding payment arrears (or minimize the accumulation of new ones) in the medium
term, which is expected to improve the GoM's capacity to more effectively manage its
resources and the savings generated could be used for investment purposes, especially in
social sectors. More investments are also likely to benefit lower income groups through job
creation in constructions of public infrastructure and related activities.
91.    Reforms under the proposed operation will support efforts to enhance
agriculture productivity as well as strengthen social safety net systems to help bring
about quick gains for the poor and most vulnerable groups. The proposed measures will
enhance productivity of smallholder farmers through use of quality seeds and modern ways
of farming, and will also help improve the coordination mechanisms for the provision of
social safety nets as well as the targeting of existing programs with a view to reduce the
number of duplicate payments from different sources for the same beneficiaries. The
improved targeting is especially important for women as poverty incidence for women
tends to be higher. This will help improve the welfare of low-income groups, especially
women and children, by ensuring that those exposed to shocks at any given time are
reached on time. The improvements of statistical capacity and M&E systems will allow
better targeting of social program in future.
92.    Electricity subsidies in Malawi are highly untargeted due to a combination of
its flat tariff structure and the positive relationship between consumption and income.
This notwithstanding, measures to eliminate implicit subsidy in electricity will result to
higher tariffs for consumers of electricity (Annex 4-E). Given the fact that a very small
portion of the Malawi population has access to electricity (less than 7 percent), the impact
3 The difference between IHS2 and the IHS3 national absolute poverty rates is not statistically significant. The IHS3 rural
poverty rate is also statistically indistinguishable from that of IHS2.
37


﻿of tariff hikes will affect mostly those in the higher level of incomes.38 The tariff increases
would also increase the prices of other household consumption goods, which would put
additional pressure on all household budgets, even those poor without electricity
connections. Considering Malawi's continuing inflation and exchange rate increases and
the persistent large gap between tariffs and the cost of electricity supply, ESCOM will have
to increase tariffs further.

93.     There are two broad options for the tariff adjustment: a flat increase or a
differentiated increase that allows lower tariffs for lower consumption levels (figure 4).
In a simulation of tariff increases under the flat and lifeline scenarios, both proposed
increases increase tariffs by a greater percentage than that expected for costs, only the
increases modeled under the lifeline scenario would lessen the gap between tariffs and the
cost of supply and thereby ease the cost of subsidies for ESCOM (table 4). Creating a
lifeline tariff instead, in which tariffs are increased more for higher-consuming (generally
richer) households than for lower-consuming households, would cushion the direct impact
of tariff increases on the poorest electrified households, reduce the total cost of subsidies,
and make the distribution of electricity subsidies less regressive than it is currently.

a lifeline tariff instead, in which tariffs are increased more for higher-

households, would cushion the direct impact of tariff increases on the
poorest electrified households, reduce the total cost of subsidies, and make
the distribution of electricity subsidies less regressive than it is currently.
Under a lifeline tariff increase, the share of subsidies directed to the poorest

B.     Environmental Aspects
94.    The legal framework for the environment is in place, but capacity to implement
and enforce it remains a challenge. The Environment Act of 1996 provides the
framework for environmental management in Malawi, which applies to all public and
private activities that may influence environmental aspects. Environmental laws in Malawi
have been recently revised to take into account current trends in approaches to sustainable
use and management of natural resources and the environment. It is now mandatory to carry
out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for projects likely to have an
environmental impact. There is a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) and related
sub-sector plans. In the PRSP/MGDS environment, Vision 2020, MGDS, cross-cutting and
sector strategies have incorporated environment as a key action area. Environmental agency
and institutions of higher learning constitute an adequate planning capability and capacity
to monitor EIA programs. There are structures in place such as National Council on
Environment, Technical Committee on Environment which are cross sectoral and meet
regularly.
95.    The specific actions supported the DPO       series are not expected to cause
significant effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources of Malawi.
The policies supported under this programmatic DPO largely address institutional and
regulatory reforms. For instance, the economic management reforms should lead to more
efficient use of public resources, which may indirectly generate environmental benefits in
the form of better use of modern technologies. While the reforms in the energy sector are
focusing on institutions (fiscal sustainability of provision of electricity) and the regulatory
environment, there are potential indirect effects. Adjustments of electricity tariffs to levels
that reflect cost of supply could eventually enable ESCOM to start some of its investment
projects, which could have environmental impacts. For this, the Legislation on Commercial
Non-Renewable Resources Management is in place and is being implemented by Malawi
Energy Regulatory Authority. Energy prices are also regulated e.g. electricity and liquid
fuels and levies are appropriate. Regulations are being enforced by MERA which has the
capacity to monitor energy undertakings.
96.    Reforms related to agriculture have some potential of indirect effects on the
environment but the related environmental issues have already been taken care
through the on-going sector lending operation. The two agriculture-related DPO policy
measures should indeed progressively lead to agriculture production intensification through
the distribution of subsidized fertilizer and the expansion of seed multiplication fields
40


﻿which will require fertilizer application. Current utilization of fertilizer under smallholder
farming is very low and fertilizer use will not increase significantly preventing any major
runoff. The risk associated with agricultural intensification will however be mitigated by
extension activities delivered to farmers through two on-going Bank-funded projects: the
Agricultural Sector Wide Approach - Support Project (ASWAp-SP) and the Irrigation,
Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP). These projects include
large scale investments in extension to help farmers adopt sustainable land and water
management techniques. The ASWAp-SP in particular aims at improving FISP efficiency
and as such specifically targets farmers benefitting from the FISP. It promotes good
agricultural practices to help farmers make the most efficient use of the fertilizer distributed
under FISP. Promoted techniques include for instance spot application and pit planting to
avoid fertilizer losses and subsequent water pollution. Other approaches promoted by these
projects also cover alternative techniques to increase soil organic matter content to help
retain nutrients and the introduction of leguminous plants for atmospheric nitrogen fixation.
C.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
97.   Implementation entity. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) will be responsible for
overall implementation of the DPO series as well as for reporting progress and coordinating
actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. The MoF has experience in
coordinating and implementing DPO programs as evidenced by the implementation of the
PRSC 1-111 and RRDPG.
98.   The institutional arrangements for the preparation and execution of the DPO 1
fall within the framework of the CABS. On the Government side, CABS is both served
by a secretariat which is situated in the Debt and Aid Division of the Ministry of Finance.
The Secretariats coordinate preparations of PAF Priority Action Plans, implementation,
assessment and revision. For these activities, the Secretariat mobilizes sector experts in
various ministries and departments.
99.   While the M&E system has improved more generally in recent years, there is
room for further improvements. The MGDS II has provided more information in many
of the indicators, although the framework still needs to be improved in terms of the quality
of the indicators and its linkages to other sectoral M&E frameworks. M&E of the MGDS II
is coordinated by the M&E Division in the Ministry of Economic Development and
Planning and the M&E results framework for MGDS II is in place. Implementation of the
road map is being supported by a joint program of support with basket funding from the
European Commission, DFID, and UNDP. Under the program, M&E officers and
economists have been recruited, trained and deployed in all district councils of the country.
This will improve collection of data from the field for monitoring the MGDS II. M&E
divisions have also been established in most line ministries, and economists have all been
deployed in all line ministries to be responsible for monitoring implementation of the
MGDS II in their respective ministries. Currently only five sectors are yet to have district
level databank developed, including social protection. The Bank through this operation will
support the establishment of the databank for social protection at the district level.
100.  Program Monitoring. The Bank's supervision of the DPO series is aligned with
the CABS Framework biannual review meetings. In addition to two joint reviews, the Bank
also participates in IMF missions to monitor progress on the macroeconomic framework.
41


﻿Monitoring of the MGDS II is carried out in various sector working groups through Annual
Progress Reviews, but the implementation of sector specific results matrices is expected to
be carried out by the line ministries. The Ministry of Economic Planning and Development
is responsible for overall poverty monitoring. Progress against DPO 1 targets is being
monitored using Annex 2 which is used for monitoring progress against end-program
outcomes.
D.    FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
101.  Public financial management system. Malawi's fiduciary risk is high but the
framework is adequate overall to receive the proceeds of the grant. The government, in
close collaboration with development partners, has developed a medium-term Public
Finance and Economic Management Reform Programme (PFEM-RP) 2011/12-2015/16.
The PFEM-RP is designed to further advance the pace of public finance management
reforms in Malawi. The PFEMRP covers a broad range of areas that include planning and
policy analysis, resource mobilization, budgeting, procurement, accounting and financial
management, cash and debt management, parastatal financing, reporting, auditing, and
PFEM RP administration. A Multi-Donor Trust Fund to operationalize the PFEMRP has
been established is being managed by the Bank.
42


﻿Box 3: Public Financial Management Assessment, 2011 - Major Findings (extract from PEFA report)
Overall progress in PFM has remained relatively unchanged compared to 2008 PEFA, despite good progress in
some indicators.
Credibility of the budget: The period as a whole was characterized by persistent over-spending in comparison to
original budget which contrasts with the previous three years each of which reported under-spending. On the
revenue side actual revenue was consistently above budget, as it had been in the previous three years. Again,
therefore, the credibility of the budget is called into question - this time in terms of its ability to provide a reliable
indication of the GoM resource envelope.
Comprehensiveness and transparency: Though Malawi scores well in a number of areas associated with
comprehensiveness and transparency, various issues remain - Treasury Funds are not reported in the Estimates and
only appear in the Annual Appropriation Accounts as net figures. There is significant room for improvement in
terms of public access to key fiscal information
Policy-based budgeting: While the orderliness of the annual budget process has improved relative to the last
PEFA assessment, challenges lie ahead in terms of alignment of MTEF with the new priorities in the MGDS II.
Predictability and control in budget execution: Reforms are on-going in the Malawi Revenue Authority. The
Ministry of Finance has improved the cash management process. Debt management and payroll system are being
operated efficiently. The Procurement system continues to be unable to provide statistics with regard to the
implementation and comprehensiveness of competitiveness in public procurement. The IFMIS rollout process has
been concluded to the central government and 33 Local Authorities. Although awareness seems to be rising with
regards to internal control, the evidence does not yet support the finding of improved control and internal audit
procedures and processes being implementing and taking effect.
Accounting, recording and reporting: Progress in the period under review has featured the improved timeliness
of the closure of the accounts and the production of the financial statement for audit. Also, in-year budget
execution reports are produced on a timely basis and with some improvements is quality. However, management
information at service delivery units stills needs to improve. A serious control concern identified is the backlog in
bank reconciliations since July 2010. Timely bank reconciliation is an essential discipline in the ongoing checking
and verification of accounting practices across Government and it also provides assurance as to the integrity of
data used for reporting.
External scrutiny and audit: The period covered by this assessment has seen a backlog of external audits and
Public Accounts Committee (PAC) scrutiny cleared. However, there are still weaknesses in the actions and follow
up based on the recommendations of the National Audit Office (NAO) and PAC. In summary, NAO and PAC
scrutiny has been characterized by periods when there has been no public scrutiny followed by intense activity to
clear backlogs. In respect the Parliamentary Finance Committee, there is more opportunity for scrutiny of the draft
budget than for budget execution.
102.    Four Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments
have been conducted in recent years, in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2011. The 2011 PEFA
assessment, which found a number of improvements since 2008, was based on an analysis
of performance for the years from 2007-08 to 2009-11 (Annex 4E). Selected areas where
improvements have been made include cash management process, orderliness of the annual
budget process, debt management and payroll system, debt and guarantees, effectiveness of
internal audit, quality and timeliness of annual financial statements, and legislative scrutiny
of the annual budget law. The assessment reported that regardless of progress being made,
weaknesses remain on the credibility of budget (in terms of its ability to provide a reliable
indication of the GoM resource envelope); internal control; comprehensiveness and
transparency-Treasury Funds are not reported in the Estimates and only appear in the
Annual Appropriation Accounts as net figures and public access to key fiscal information;
timeliness of follow-up on audit recommendations and backlog in bank reconciliations
43


﻿(Box 2). The PFEM RP has taken into account the weaknesses identified in the PEFA 2011
report in order to ensure overall strengthening of the PFM.
103.  On audit follow up, all the audit reports submitted to Parliament for years
ended June 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 have been scrutinized and discussed
by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). This implies that PAC is current in terms of
scrutinizing all the reports that were submitted including a Treasury Minute for the year
ended June 2004, and 2005. However, Government is aware of the backlog of Treasury
Minutes which were mainly due to the absence of the Auditor General and irregular
meetings Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meetings due to funding challenges. The
appointment of the Auditor General in 2009 facilitated the clearance of a backlog of audit
reports. With increased funding to Parliament, PAC is able to meet more regularly to
scrutinize audit reports. The Government has currently submitted a Treasury Minute for
June 2006, 2007 financial years to Parliament.
104.  The 2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) found that in
2002, public procurement accounted for 16.2 percent of GDP, that corruption in
procurement was widespread, capacity low and sanctions for corrupt practices were not
effective. The Government has, in response, attempted to comprehensively address these
weaknesses. A new Public Procurement Act, based on international procurement standards
became operational in 2004 with the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public
Procurement (ODPP), headed by a Director and Deputy Director appointed by the President
and approved by the Public Appointments Committee of parliament. ODPP has policy,
standards and monitoring functions and does not procure. It has supervisory oversight of a
decentralized procurement system that since 2006 has been receiving intensive support
from the World Bank, UNDP and USAID. While challenges remain, there have been
significant advances in moving the public procurement system towards acceptable
standards and through a grant from Institutional Development Fund (IDF), Government
shall publish all contracts awarded above the threshold of MWK 45 million on the website
of Director of Public Procurement, Government Gazette, one newspapers of national
circulation and the website of the Ministry/Departments/Agencies or procuring entity
responsible within a period of 30 days of such award.
105.  The status of budget publication in the country: The GoM budget for the
financial year 2012/13 was presented to the Parliament on June 8, 2012. The budget
presented to the Parliament was in the form of the budget speech by the Minister of Finance
was immediately made available on the MoF website. The draft Estimate of Expenditure
books as well as the Financial Statements are also made available in hard copies.40
106.  Foreign Exchange Environment. Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy,
the Central Bank of Malawi was subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the
ECF arrangement approved in July 23, 2012. The recently updated safeguards assessment
for the Reserve Bank of Malawi notes that the RBM continues to publish financial
statements that are prepared and audited in accordance with international standards. From
40 The Financial Statement is available on www.finance.gov.mw
44


﻿the assessment, the principal safeguard concern was lack of operational autonomy for the
RBM and that already envisaged amendments to the RBM Act to limit lending to
government be expanded to strengthen RBM autonomy more broadly. Other
recommendations focus on enhancing oversight of foreign reserves management and
improvements to data compilation procedures. The latter includes measures to strengthen
transparency of contingent liabilities arising from letters of credit that can have implications
for program data. The RBM is committed to implementing the assessment's
recommendations, and has requested technical assistance to strengthen the compilation of
monetary and financial statistics.
Assurance Requirements
107.  Based on the high fiduciary risk associated with the operation, there will be
special fiduciary arrangements established for the grant. Within seven days of the
disbursement of the grant by IDA, the Ministry of Finance shall provide a written
confirmation to IDA, certifying the receipt of the Malawi Kwacha equivalent of the grant
into the Consolidated Fund Account of the GoM, the number of the account, the date of the
receipt, and the exchange rate applied to translate the credit currency into Malawi Kwacha ,
and confirming that the said amount has been appropriately accounted for in the recipient's
financial management system. In addition, as the National Audit Office is required by law
to submit its annual report and the audited accounts on the public consolidated fund to
Parliament within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year, a copy of the said reports and
accounts shall be provided to IDA within one month after the lapse of the 6 month period.
The GoM shall equally ensure that the annual entity financial statements of the Reserve
Bank of Malawi, audited in accordance with international standards on auditing as
promulgated by the International Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.
108.  The Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit of the
receipt and accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the
Recipient. Upon the Association's request, the Recipient shall: (i) have the account and the
recording of amounts of the credit into the Recipient's budget management system audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Association, in accordance with consistently
applied auditing standards acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to the Association as
soon as available, but in any case no later than four months after the date of the
Association's request for such audit, a certified copy of the audit report by said auditors, of
such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested; and (iii)
furnish to the Association such other information concerning the said account and recording
of credit amounts into the budget management system, and the audit thereof, as the
Association shall have reasonably requested.
E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
109. A single-tranche programmatic DPO of SDR 33.4 million (US$50 million
equivalent) will be disbursed upon grant effectiveness and following the Recipient's
request for withdrawal of proceeds of the grant. The proposed grant will follow the
Bank's standard disbursement procedures for development policy operations. The grant will
be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and
not tied to any specific purchases. Once the operation is approved by the Board and
becomes effective, and upon receipt of a withdrawal application signed by an authorized
signatory, the proceeds of the grant will be deposited by IDA in a US$ account designated
45


﻿by GoM at the RBM and forming part of the official foreign exchange reserves of Malawi.
Within two working days, the RBM will credit the Malawian kwacha equivalent of the
grant proceeds to the consolidated account maintained on behalf of GoM for budget
execution. The conversion from the foreign currency to the local currency will be based on
the prevailing exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the budget
management system.
110.  The RBM will not impose any charges or commissions on the Recipient for
these transactions. The Recipient will: (a) provide confirmation to the Bank within 30
days that an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds from the Bank has been credited in the
Recipient's budget management system, with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (b)
provide evidence that the Malawian Kwacha equivalent of the grant proceeds was recorded
as financing the GoM budget; and (c) ensure that the Malawian Kwacha equivalent of the
grant proceeds are subject to effective controls sufficient to ensure its use for eligible
budgeted public expenditures only as per the Financing Agreement.
111.  Disbursements by the GoM shall not be tied to any specific purchases and no
special procurement requirement shall be needed. The proceeds of the credit shall,
however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the negative list as defined in the
Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement. If any portion of the credit is used to finance
ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement, IDA
shall require the GoM to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to the
amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be
cancelled from the credit. The administration of this grant will be the responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance.
112.  The use of the Malawian Kwacha equivalent of grant proceeds to support
budgetary expenditures will be subject to audit by the Auditor General as provided for
by the Malawian Constitution. The Bank will have access to these audit reports.
F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
a)    External shocks
113.  The country remains vulnerable to weather conditions, especially drought and
floods, and its reliance on rain-fed agriculture increases its vulnerability. Lower
agricultural output would have a significant effect on overall GDP growth given the size of
agriculture in GDP. The maize shortages currently being experienced in the country from
the effects of the drought have contributed to the acceleration in inflation given the over 50
weight for maize in the consumer basket.
114.  There is also a risk of potential spillovers from the global economy, including
stagnation of euro area and world growth, a substantial fall in non-oil commodity
prices, and a reduction in aid flows. Slower world growth would adversely affect demand
for Malawi's exports (mainly tobacco), but the overall impact on Malawi's growth is
expected to be low. A substantial fall in tobacco prices would adversely affect the foreign
exchange balance and hence the exchange rates in the short term. It will also affect the
income of farmers and could in the end dampen growth.
46


﻿115.  As a    mitigation  measure, the Authorities are   regularly  monitoring
macroeconomic developments, including as part of the program with the IMF. The
continuation of the policy reforms instituted in May 2012 such as the automatic price
adjustment mechanism for fuel and flexible exchange rate would allow the economy to
adjust to shocks within minimum policy response. Where needed, the GoM is expected to
respond through appropriate policy measures and the Bank team will help the GoM to
formulate and implement such responses. Specifically, the DPO series and the 2013 Public
Expenditure Review will provide a platform for a dialogue with the GoM on the ways to
improve expenditure prioritization and controls as well as improve efficiency of public
expenditures. In an event where there are shortages in revenues, the Authorities have
committed to make necessary but better targeted expenditure cuts in the budget and the
Bank team will help them in this exercise. The GoM is also putting in place measures to
strengthen domestic revenue mobilization, to leverage on private sector resources and
intensify the export diversification drive to mitigate the risks. Special efforts are being
geared towards the promotion of tourism as a diversified source of foreign exchange
earnings and the improvements in the overall business environment with a view of
attracting private sector investment in various sectors (including energy and mining), and
take advantage of trade potentials within the region as well as outside.
b)    Political Environment Risk
116.  Political risks remain high in the context of the Presidential elections planned
for May 2014. The reforms instituted in May 2012 have been followed by considerable
depreciation of the Kwacha of over 66 percent (following the 50 percent Kwacha
devaluation in May 2012) and an acceleration of inflation in excess of 30 percent. These
developments are putting pressures on the GoM's resolve to stay the course. Significant
pressures on the budget are emerging, in the form of increase in wage demands, and are
likely to increase during the fiscal year 2013/14, posing further risk to macroeconomic
stability. The proposed reforms geared towards rebalancing of the FISP program faces
significant risks in view of the fact that the FISP is highly politicized.
117.  These risks will partly be mitigated by a better communication by the
government on how the policy reforms are having some positive impacts and the time
needed to let the reform work. This could be further complemented by more informed
public debates based on emerging evidence from the on-going Public Expenditure Review
and poverty policy notes, which includes analysis on the FISP.
(c)   Implementation Capacity Risks
118.  The systemic problem of capacity in GoM   continues to pose a risk to the
reform program and may cause delays in implementation of some of the reform
measures supported by this operation. Weak management of the public finances and
reports of widespread corruption and extortion by public officials in procurement and
fraudulent activities within the PFM systems represents a significant risk. Corruption has
been also identified in the recent Business Climate Survey as being one of the constraints to
doing business by the in Malawi.
119.  To address this risk in the short term, the Bank intends to increase its engagement
at the technical level to ensure that the reforms under this operation implemented and
sustained. Plans are also under way to pilot demand side governance instruments at the local
and sector levels to enhance civil society and user participation in its programs. In addition, the
47


﻿DPs are supporting the GOM through a combination of capacity building and technical support,
including support for statistics and monitoring and evaluation. Specifically, the risks can be
mitigated by the pace of reforms supported by the implementation of a more harmonized PFM
program under the Public Finance and Economic Management Multi-Donor Trust Fund and by
this operation. The recently approved Financial Reporting and Oversight Project aims to
strengthen internal controls, accounting, reporting and oversight of government finances at
the central and decentralized levels. Increased awareness of the seriousness of corruption and
the country's growing conducive and open political climate is acting as a mitigation
measure as it has empowered development stakeholders to flag governance and corruption
issues with ease.

Mr. Jim Yong Kim
President
The World Bank Group
1818 H. Street N.W
Washington D.C 20433
United States of America
Dear Mr Kim,
MALAWI: LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
1. On behalf of the Malawi Government, I write to request for the First Economic
Recovery Development Policy Operation (DPO-1) Grant of US$50 million
from the International Development Association (IDA). The DPO-1, which is
the first of a programmatic series of three single tranches, is intended to support
policy and institutional reforms under the Second Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy II (MGDSII) and the Economic Recovery Plan (ERP).
The program sets to consolidate gains from the macroeconomic and structural
reforms that were supported by the Rapid Response Development Policy Grant
(RRDPG) approved in July 2012.
2. The Program will focus on Macroeconomic Management, Public Financial
Management, Agriculture, Energy, and Social Protection. Specifically, the
program is aimed at: (i) strengthening macroeconomic and finance management
so as to strengthen expenditure controls, financial reporting and oversight at
national and sub-national levels and, (ii) lay the foundations for stronger growth
and protection of the poor through reform measures aimed at enhancing
agriculture productivity, addressing energy constraints and improving social
safety nets.
49


﻿3. The program will support Government's efforts of achieving fiscal discipline,
enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of government spending, improving
accountability, transparency and the country's statistical capacity, enhancing
agriculture productivity, addressing energy constraints and improving social
safety nets among others. More details on the proposed reforms to be supported
under this program are set out in Part C of this letter.
A. Recent Macroeconomic Performance and Developments
4. The Government of Malawi remains committed to staying the course on the
hard but important economic reforms that were rolled out in May 2012. The
reforms are already yielding some positive results as evidenced by availability
of foreign exchange, fuel and restoration of credit lines. The international
community continues to register confidence in Government's direction on the
unprecedented economic management and governance reforms as evidenced in
the increase in budget support and normalization of relations between Malawi
and her neighbors.
5. Nonetheless, Malawi's economic recovery remains fragile. Although the foreign
exchange reserve situation has improved it remains precarious at 1.7 months of
import cover as of February, 2013. The impact of the adjustment on the
economy has been greater than earlier anticipated as inflation has spiked and the
currency continues to depreciate.
6. Economic performance slowed down in 2012 as GDP grew by only 1.9 per cent from an
earlier projection of 4.3 per cent. This was largely on account of significant contraction in
Agriculture, and Manufacturing sectors. In addition, the Wholesale and Retail Trade, as
well as the Utilities sectors, among others, recorded growth but at a slower pace
compared to 2011. These are the sectors which drive the economy and whose accelerated
growth is vital in boosting growth in subsequent sectors.
7. The economy, nonetheless, registered an expansion in the other sectors which are mostly
service sectors. These sectors include: Mining and Quarrying; Information and
Communication; Construction; Transportation and Storage; Accommodation and Food
Services; Real Estate Activities; Financial and Insurance Services; Public Administration
and Defense.
8. The economy, is however, expected to rebound to 5.5% in 2013 on account of increased
output in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors.
9. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures in the economy have surged. Headline CPI
inflation for February, 2013 surged to 37.9% from 10.9 % the previous period
which is higher than the ECF programme projection of 22.4%. The urban and
50


﻿rural rates stand at 35.6 percent and 33.3 percent respectively. Inflation is being driven by
rising food prices and escalating transport and utility prices. However, the average annual
inflation in 2013 is projected to decline to 18 % as the food situation normalizes and growth
rebounds. The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) revised the bank rate upwards from 21% to
25% in November 2012 to ease inflationary pressures.
10. On the fiscal side, Government continues to exercise fiscal restraint. The
Government remains committed to implementing austerity measures, including
stringent controls on travel, procurement of capital assets as well as other goods
and services.
11. Malawi continues to closely monitor its debt to ensure that it remains
sustainable in view of debt servicing obligations. As of December 2012,
domestic debt stock stood at K204.17 billion while external debt amounted to
US$1.19 billion. Government will continue to repay its domestic debt to ensure
that domestic debt as a percentage to GDP is reduced to levels of less than 15
percent of GDP from 20 percent as of end December 2012.
12. On 8th April 2013 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund
completed the second review of Malawi's economic performance under a
program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (EFC) arrangement. The
Board's decision will enable an immediate disbursement to Malawi of about
US$19.6 million.
B. The Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II)
13. The Government adopted its third medium term poverty reduction strategy, the
MGDS II, which covers the period 2011 to 2016 and it was prepared using
participatory processes. The strategy's overall objective is wealth creation
through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development. It is
organized around six thematic areas as follows: (i) sustainable economic
growth; (ii) social support and disaster risk management; (iii) social
development; (iv) infrastructure development; (v) good governance and (vi)
gender and capacity development.
14. From these thematic areas, the strategy has identified nine key focus areas that
are seen as central to achieving the strategy's overall objective of wealth
creation. The focus areas are agriculture and food security; energy, industrial
development, mining and tourism; transport infrastructure and Nsanje World
inland port; education, science and technology; public health, sanitation, malaria
and HIV and AIDS management; integrated rural development; green belt
irrigation and water development; child development, youth development and
empowerment; climate change, natural resources and environmental
management.
51


﻿15. Within the framework of the MGDS II, Government also launched a short run
Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) in September, 2012 to accelerate the recovery
process whilst lessening the impact of the economic and structural reforms
undertaken on the poor and most vulnerable. The focus of the ERP is on
monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies, revenue enhancing measures and
expenditure control. Under the ERP, Government has also adopted a social
support package, which will consolidate existing programs like public works
programs to mitigate the impact of the reforms undertaken by government on
the most vulnerable. These programs include: Scaling up of the labour
intensive public works programme (LIPW); Up-scaling of legume seed
multiplication, agro forestry and soil conservation, multiplication of cassava
cuttings and sweet potato vines and extending village savings club; Up-scaling
of school meals programme and vitamin A supplementation; and Up-scaling of
Social Cash Transfer Programme.
C. Specific Reforms to be implemented
16. In line with the ERP and building on the reforms implemented under Rapid
Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG), the program will set the stage
for longer term structural reforms. Government will continue to implement
reforms aimed at reviving the economy, restoring confidence, and protecting the
most vulnerable from falling into the poverty trap in the short term while
broadening its economic base over the medium to long term. In line with this
agenda, I would like to highlight the various reforms that the Government of
Malawi intends to implement.
Pillar 1: Strengthening Macroeconomic and Public Finance Management
Public Finance Management (PFM)
17. Government is in the process of implementing a Public Financial and Economic
Management Reform Program (PFEM RP). The PFEM RP is a medium-term
programme aimed at strengthening PFEM systems and improving their
capacity. Under the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) funding modality of the
PFEM, the first project, the Financial Reporting and Oversight Project (FROIP)
signed on 15th March 2013 has been designed with a total estimated cost of US
$16 million. The first phase will cost US $ 8 million. Implementation of the
project has already started with focus on the Integrated Financial Management
System (IFMIS) roll-out to the remaining councils and consolidation, payroll
management, procurement planning, and external and internal audit.
18. Government continues to take necessary steps to address problems that exist in
PFM. In an effort to strengthen PFM transparency and accountability IFMIS has
been rolled out to 33 Local Authorities (LAs) out of 35. Plans are that by end of
52


﻿the 2012/13 Financial Year, all the 35 LAs should be connected. This will assist
in improving timeliness in financial reporting thereby enhancing accountability.
Through the FROIP, IFMIS business re-engineering will be done to improve
connectivity and integration of accounting IT software. In order to enhance
skills of accounting personnel, the FROIP will also assist in training staff in the
Accounting Common Service.
Arrears clearance
19. Verification of outstanding payments and arrears has been completed. In cases where
the creditors have agreed, Government is honoring these payments through
promissory notes which can be discounted on the market over four years. As for all
other arrears outside those sorted out through issuance of promissory notes, the plan is
to clear them over time through budgetary provisions. For the capital budget,
settlement of outstanding payments are being made for all fast moving projects that
require immediate payment by reallocating resources within the vote from projects
that are stalling. Further, in order to strengthen Commitment Control, Government has
started enforcing the issuance of Ordinary Local Purchase Oder's (LPO) Module in
IFMIS. Currently, some Ministries, Departments and agencies (MDAs) have already
started processing payments through the LPO Module. In addition, Government has
also directed that all Internal Procurement Committees should be chaired by
Controlling Officers to enhance oversight over procurement, as per the Public
Procurement Act (2003).
Improving the credibility of the budget
20. Government has adopted a comprehensive budget formulation        calendar to
accommodate the required medium term perspective, expenditure reviews and
consultations to support the recent reinvigoration of MTEF by the Government. The
new budget calendar represents a significant improvement as it provides for a more
explicit emphasis on macroeconomic, fiscal and strategy policy review at the outset of
the budget process. The calendar is meant to provide adequate time for undertaking
review of macro-fiscal performance, analysis of fiscal strategies, budget analysis,
analysis of submissions from spending agencies and timely review of budget ceilings,
where necessary. The introduction of a revised comprehensive calendar introduced in
2012/13, provides for sector performance reviews in the first quarter of the year to
facilitate the prioritization process for the upcoming financial year. The process will
proceed alongside a review of the macro-fiscal framework in order to determine an
affordable resource and expenditure framework for the annual budget and the
medium-term. In addition, Government is in the process of coming up with first
Budget Policy Framework Paper (BPFP), which is a three-year rolling framework, will
be used to streamline and guide the budget process, setting out planned outputs and their
associated expenditures in the medium-term. The BPFP will be linked to the Ministries'
budget ceilings and will be discussed with the Cabinet. The policy will consolidate all
Government's commitment to achieving a medium term fiscal consolidation through
accelerated domestic resource mobilization and expenditure prioritization to
53


﻿narrow the fiscal gap and reduce reliance on financial assistance in the medium
to long run.
Improving oversight
21. Under the area of oversight, Government is up-to-date in submission of Annual
Auditor General's Reports (AGRs) to Parliament. However, the FY 2011/12
AGR has been delayed due to the absence of the Auditor General (AG),
following his retirement towards end of 2012. The National Assembly has of
late identified and allocated additional staff to support the oversight role of the
Public Accounts Committee. Government through the Budget Division of the
Ministry of Finance will intensify its efforts on audit follow ups including
timely production of Treasury Minutes.
Strengthening Statistical Capacities
22. Government realizes that policy decisions based on accurate and meaningful
information are more effective in achieving desired outcomes. It is in this regard
that Government will continue to strengthen the National Statistical Office for
provision of coordinated, timely and high quality statistical information. In its
efforts to enhance evidence based decision making, Government will in the
medium term review statistics legislation.
Pillar 2: Laying Foundation for Stronger Growth and Protection of the
Poor
Enhance Agricultural Productivity, Modernization and Transformation
23. Recognizing the fact that agriculture remains the back bone of the Malawi
economy, Government has planned a number of reforms to modernize and
transform the sector. One such reform is the review of the legal and regulatory
framework for quality seed production. The selection of a consultant to carry
out the review is underway. Government expects to take on board
recommendations that will be drawn from the review.
24. Under food security, Government intends to review the Farm Input Subsidy
Program (FISP). In the short run, the processes and procedures will be revisited
to ensure efficiency in the implementation of the program. In the medium term,
Government intends to revisit the entire program to ascertain whether the food
security benefits of the FISP could be achieved in a different and better manner.
Currently a joint MoAFS Efficiency Committee has been formed to discuss
fertilizer distribution issues and make recommendations on how to improve
procurement and distribution of fertilizer for the 2013/14 program.
54


﻿25. Some of the areas where reforms will be made in the next FISP include:
timeliness  with key milestones to improve FISP planning and timely
procurement and fertilizer distribution; the strengthening of the pre-qualification
criteria for the selection of FISP suppliers and transporters; the tightening of the
criteria for the evaluation of bids based on a scorecard to ensure better value-for
money; the strengthening of penalties for late delivery as incentives to suppliers
to ensure timely delivery; the introduction of an improved fertilizer delivery
tracking system and the piloting of e-vouchers. Government is optimistic that
with proper implementation of these reforms, a lot of savings will be made.
Addressing Energy Constraints
26. Government plans to engage a consultant to undertake a cost of production
study. The results of this study will help Government and Electricity Supply
Commission of Malawi (ESCOM) in terms of the way forward on the level of
electricity tariffs with respect to market fundamentals. Government also wants
to bring more players in the power generating sector by improving the policy
and regulatory framework with the aim of creating a conducive environment.
Improving Provision of Social Safety Nets
27. Government approved the Social Support Policy (SSP) in July, 2012. The SSP
provides a holistic framework for designing, implementing, coordinating,
monitoring and evaluating social support interventions in Malawi. Currently,
Government has also adopted a National Social Support Programme (NSSP) to
provide and promote productivity-enhancing interventions and welfare support
for the poor and vulnerable, as well as interventions that reduce risks and the
impact of shocks. Through this program, Government intends to (i) Strengthen
the Social Support environment by supporting the operationalization of the
National Social Support Policy through the implementation of the NSSP; (ii)
Improving the coverage of Social Support interventions recognizing that social
support interventions in Malawi provided limited coverage to the target groups,
with the Social Cash Transfer Programme reaching only 35% of vulnerable
groups in 7 districts out of 28, and full coverage in only 3 of the 7 districts; and
(iii) Improving the efficiency in the delivery of social support interventions in
Malawi.
55


﻿28. I am confident that the outlined policies, programs and reforms will create a
conducive and enabling environment for rapid economic recovery and create a
strong foundation for growth to rebound.
Yours faithfully,
ir.'Ken L7inga,MP

﻿Annex 3: Funds Relations Note
IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under the Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for Malawi and Approves US$19.6 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 13/108
April 8, 2013
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review of Malawi's economic performance under a program supported by the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement. The Board's decision enables the immediate disbursement of an
amount equivalent to SDR 13.02 million (about US$19.6 million), bringing total disbursements
under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR39.06 million (about US$58.7 million).
The three-year ECF arrangement for Malawi in the total amount of SDR 104.1 million (about
US$156.2 million) was approved on July 23, 2012 (see Press Release 12/273).
Following the Board's discussion, Mr. David Lipton, First Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
"Malawi's performance under the Fund-supported program has been commendable despite a
difficult environment. The policy reforms have begun to yield positive results, including
increased availability of foreign exchange. The government also successfully rolled out its social
protection programs.
"Continued tight monetary policy and fiscal restraint are needed to contain aggregate demand,
stabilize the exchange rate and prices, and boost international reserves. The Reserve Bank of
Malawi (RBM) is committed to maintaining a tight monetary stance until inflation pressures
recede. The fiscal authorities are also committed to implementing prudent policies in the run up
to the 2014 general elections. In particular, the FY2013/14 budget will include measures to
offset the impact of recent wage increases on the budget. The authorities are also pursuing
reforms to broaden the tax base, improve revenue administration, and exercise greater control
over expenditures.
"It will be important to safeguard the stability of the financial system. The RBM is
strengthening its oversight of banks and is assessing the true financial condition of all banks
with a view to enforcing prudential regulations. It has also enhanced its monitoring of banks that
have continued to have difficulty meeting liquidity requirements.
"The authorities are making progress in implementing structural reforms to enhance the
country's competitiveness and exports. They are committed to removing regulatory hurdles to
doing business in Malawi."

﻿Annex 4: Background Information: Country Context, PFM and PSIA-Energy
A. Political Context
29.   Malawi went through a very turbulent period in 2010 and 2011. President Bingu wa
Mutharika ruled the country from 2004 until his death in April 2012. Originally elected
president as a member of the United Democratic Front (UDF), he soon split from the UDF to
form a new party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Through 2009 his administration
made substantial progress despite lacking a parliamentary majority: Malawi saw a
remarkable economic turnaround, sustained economic growth, progress on service delivery
and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and-most remarkable-improved food
security. As a result, President Mutharika's DPP was re-elected for a second term in office
(2009-2014) with a 60 percent majority in the 193-seat Parliament and also secured
considerable support from independent parliamentarians41. The administration was thus able
to pass with ease laws in support of the President's political and development agenda.
30.   In 2010 Malawi's record on governance began to deteriorate significantly. Especially the
application of checks and balances in the political process affected the environment for
growth, the investment climate, and service delivery. In 2010 and 2011 Parliament passed a
number of laws perceived as weakening democratic institutions and human rights. Local
elections, required since 2005 and planned for 2010, were again delayed. President
Mutharika and Vice President Mrs. Joyce Banda had a falling-out over succession strategies
and in early 2011, Mrs. Banda, though still Vice President, began taking her own political
course.
31.   Following the untimely death of President Bingu wa Mutharika, Mrs. Joyce Banda's
Peoples Party led-Government came into power in April 2012 has since been
implementing critical macroeconomic and structural reforms. President Banda's new
Cabinet42 succeeded in getting Parliament to repeal some of the laws perceived as abrogating
human rights and freedoms, such as the Civil Procedure Amendment Act and Section 46 of
the Penal Code. The administration also instituted inquiries into such prominent human rights
abuses as deaths in police custody and has begun to cut wasteful spending. It has also
undertaken to reinforce management of public procurement and controls and initiated
leadership change in key accountability institutions and the long-awaited Electoral
Commission has been appointed. The President also reached out to civil society, the
churches, traditional authorities, private sector, DPs, and neighboring countries to mend
relationships. The Lake Malawi border dispute between Malawi and Tanzania is being
mediated by a panel of three former presidents from the SADC region, including South
Africa's Thabo Mbeki.
32.   Corruption poses a serious challenge in the development of Malawi. The country suffers
from various types of corruption that impedes service delivery and patronage and nepotism
41The 2009 polls saw the number of women members of Parliament rise from 14 to 22.3 per cent. For the first time since
independence in 1964, Malawi also had the first female Vice President, Mrs Joyce Banda.
420ut of a 36 Member Cabinet, in the Peoples Party led-Government, a third are women.
61


﻿that exacerbates inequality and poverty in Malawi society.  Corruption is seen to be
particularly severe in the police, registry and permit services, customs, and the judiciary.
Corrupt practices and extortion by public officials in the procurement of goods and services
are said to be widespread in Malawi, and tender awards is plagued by patronage. The recent
the accession to power of President Banda is being hailed by some experts as a moment of
opportunity for Malawi to purge the legacy of high levels of political corruption. It remains
to be seen whether the regime change will translate to actual change on the ground in Malawi
to close the gap between the anti- corruption framework and implementation.43
B. Social Context
33.   According to the recent report of Malawi's Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3
2010/11), absolute poverty has declined only slightly since 2004/05, to 50.7 percent from
52.4 percent (Table 1) and income inequality increased in Malawi as reflected in the rise in
the Gini coefficient from 0.39 in 2004/05 to 0.45 in 2010/11. While poverty has remained
stagnant nationally, urban poverty has been reduced from 25.4 percent in 2005 to 17.3
percent in 2011. This gain was counterbalanced by a slight increase in rural poverty from
55.9 percent to 56.6 percent.44 The urban population experienced a rise across the board in
real consumption between 2005 and 2011, reflecting the fact that poverty reduction in urban
areas has been more solid and that the inequality in urban areas has remained fairly constant
at about 0.49. What is clear is that improvements in consumption and welfare in urban have
been significant and broad based, which reflect that fact that the urban population have
responded positively to the GoM's policies implemented over the past five years. In rural
areas, despite large state outlays targeting the rural communities (e.g. Farm input Subsidy
Program and extension services), real consumption of the poorest has declined and income
inequality has increased from 0.34 to 0.38. The better off households who were able to take
advantage of the provision of farm inputs to increasing their productivity, saw their real
incomes rise. This therefore calls for a change in strategy for addressing challenges in the
rural economy.
34.   According to the IHS3 Report (2012), women head 23.9 percent of all households.
About 18 percent of the households in urban areas are headed by females compared to
25 percent of the households headed by female in rural areas. In terms of rural areas,
southern rural (29 percent) has the highest proportion of female headings households and the
northern region has least (21 percent). Across age groups, the proportion of female headed
households increases significantly with increase in age. Nationally, the heads of the poorest
households have less schooling, are older, and are more likely to be female than the heads of
better-off households. The schooling conditional cash transfer program is helping to close
gender gaps in primary education, but only 66 percent of women are literate compared to 80
percent of men. The poverty gap and the severity of poverty measures confirm that the worst
poverty is concentrated in rural areas in the most densely populated south and north, while
the central region is better off.

poverty rate is also statistically indistinguishable from that of IHS2.

35.    The GoM     has been providing social protection through various interventions to help
vulnerable groups manage the risks they face. The GoM's spending on social protection
was 5 percent of total spending in FY12/13 (excluding FISP), which is mainly sourced from
donors. It includes cash transfer pilot schemes, labor-intensive public works, school feeding
programs, and investments in improving resilience to climate shocks through better
management of natural resources, flood risk, and irrigation. Currently, many of the social
support interventions in Malawi are not coordinated. Most, except for public works and
Inputs-For-Assets, are not implemented nationwide, are not amenable to scaling up in times
of crisis, and have different targeting mechanisms, so that it is possible to double-target a
single needy household. In line with the Social Support Policy (SSP) adopted in July 2012,
the government has therefore begun to roll out large programs to reach more vulnerable
people and to cushion the impact of the stabilization effort on the most vulnerable groups.
Social protection and investments in productive safety nets and resilience programs also help
to reduce poverty and promote economic growth.
36.    Stagnant poverty levels raise questions on the effectiveness of the Malawi's Farm Input
Subsidy Program (FISP) in alleviating poverty and food insecurity in a sustainable
fashion. Preliminary investigations show that FISP may have a differential impact on
different categories of farmers and could be an important factor behind increasing inequality.
This is yet another area that warrants further investigation before credible policy
recommendations could be drawn. However, the preliminary empirical evidence, based on
the nationally-representative IHS3 data, shows that a large share of better-off farmers are
benefiting from FISP inputs, most probably through redistribution and/or reselling from FISP
beneficiaries. This may obviously limit the impact of FISP benefits on poor households and
on poverty alleviation at large.

﻿C. Economic Background
17.   Malawi's economy has for decades been subject to various shocks partly due to the
structure of its economy, being largely a rain-fed agricultural economy locked in
subsistence maize production, prone to adverse weather conditions, landlocked and poorly
integrated into the region in terms of both trade and physical infrastructure. The
concentration of the economy on few primary commodities (notably tobacco and sugar) and its
high dependence on imports and aid inflows renders it vulnerable to shocks. These economic
vulnerabilities are being compounded by weaknesses in the management of the public finances,
the infrastructure deficit (especially energy and transport- market access) and a history of policy
reversals.
37.   Agriculture is the backbone of Malawi's economy, accounting for about 85 percent of
employment and about 80 percent of foreign exchange, about 60 percent of which
comes from tobacco alone. The structural transformation in agriculture that took place in the
mid-1990s saw particularly rapid growth in smallholder tobacco farms. Smallholders are
responsible for more than 80 percent of Malawi's agricultural production, but theirs is
predominantly subsistence farming, and reliance on rain leaves them vulnerable to bad
weather. Investment in productivity enhancements is minimal. As Malawi depends heavily
on transport through neighboring countries, the costs of importing raw material and
intermediate inputs and of accessing export markets are high to begin with and they are
exacerbated by extensive delays at ports, too many border procedures, and complex transit
arrangements. FDI has mainly gone into mining, manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and
services.

18.   Over the past five years, economic growth has been fairly balanced driven by a
dynamic services sector, as the agriculture sector's contribution to GDP started to decline.
The services sector has increased its share to about 33.1 percent of GDP, driven largely by the
telecommunication, retail and wholesale trade, and financial services (Figure 2). Meanwhile,
64


﻿agriculture sector, which used to be the main driver of growth in the late 1990s with a
contribution of over 35 percent, has seen its contribution shrinking to an average of 28 percent of
GDP during 2006-11 driven largely by tobacco exports. The country's population and labour
force remain predominantly rural and the transformation of the agriculture sector is still at its
early stages as evidenced by the fact that the share of labour force in the sector (over 80 percent)
is much higher than its share of GDP.45

19.    Malawi has also been experiencing protracted foreign exchange shortages since
2008, and the 2010 Country Economic Memorandum                identified the exchange rate
management as the main constraint to growth. The persistent overvaluation of the Kwacha
contributed to a steadily rising import bill during 2005-2010. This overvaluation led to foreign
exchange rationing and multiple exchange rates, which contributed to the informalization of the
formal foreign exchange transactions as banks also started to engage in forward trading in
foreign exchange with a negotiated premium above the official exchange rate. The Kwacha
overvaluation acted as an implicit tax on exports and import substitution (and as a subsidy to
imports) and as such Malawi's exports were uncompetitive within the region as well as outside.
The build-up of external payment arrears dating back to the 2008/09 global fuel and financial
crises, resulted in the freeze of the credit lines by suppliers to Malawi in 2010, with the situation
reaching critical levels in 2011.
20.    Efforts are underway to change in the Malawi's ranking in the Doing Business to
the top 100th by 2014. Specifically, the Authorities is working on a program aimed at creating a
pro-business environment in consultations with stakeholders in the private sector, civil society
and public sector. Moreover, a one-stop-shop has been established to facilitate the setting up of
businesses as well as to inform prospective investors of available incentives. The Parliament
approval of the Single License Bill, aimed at reducing the number of procedures and time
required to start a business is a step in right direction.47 Improving the business environment in
Malawi will require facilitating start-up of both formal and informal businesses and employment
creation by simplifying business requirements, facilitating access to credit, improving public-

﻿private dialogue, and removing unnecessary barriers to trade, especially nontariff barriers.
Malawi is also collaborating with other like-minded countries to improve trade, namely
Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, and Zambia through what is called the Accelerated
Programme for Economic Integration (APEI). The countries recently met in Mauritius to discuss
and agree on a set of policy reforms that would strengthen economic linkages and facilitate
exchanges among the APEI countries. The focus was on eliminating barriers to trade in goods,
promoting trade in services, improving the business regulatory environment and trade
facilitation.

﻿Annex 4-Box 1-: Recent Macroeconomic and Structural Reforms
The implementation of critical macroeconomic and structural reforms since May 2012, have facilitated the
move towards a floating exchange rate regime and liberalization of current account transactions, tightening of fiscal
and monetary policies, reinstatement of the Automatic Price Adjustment Mechanism for fuel and upward
adjustment to electricity tariffs close to cost recovery.
Exchange Rate and Foreign Exchange Reforms: Following the unification of the exchange rate in May 2012 and
the move towards a floating exchange rate regime, the parallel market premium has narrowed to 5-10 percent from
80 percent between February and April 2012. The value of the Kwacha has since responded to the movements in
market forces and the supply of foreign exchange has significantly improved. The supply of foreign exchange
continues to follow seasonal patterns, with a significant increase between May and August, with the lean season
during the months of September-March associated with sharp depreciation of the Kwacha.
Removal of restrictions on foreign exchange transactions by banks and foreign exchange bureaus. Additional
reform measures towards a floating exchange rate included market determined rates offered by foreign exchange
bureaus and cancellation of requirements for prior approval and pre-vetting of all imports in excess of $50,000.
Reversal of the surrender requirement for Tobacco dollars: This has improved businesses and consumers'
access to foreign exchange. Prior to this reform, all the proceeds from the sale of tobacco were being channeled
through the Reserve Bank of Malawi at an official exchange rate. During the 2012 tobacco auction season, tobacco
growers received their payment for the sale of tobacco through their respective commercial banks at the prevailing
market exchange rates. The timing of this reform was critical as it helped cushion smallholder farmers against the
adjustments in the economy, which effectively boosted the real incomes of the tobacco growers as the implicit tax
that existed on exports from the overvalued Kwacha was eliminated. In February 2013, the RBM issued a directive
where exporters are now allowed to retain a larger share of their earnings in foreign currency dominated accounts.
The export incentive scheme allows exporters retain 80 percent share of their export proceeds in their FCDAs
compared with 60 percent and the share to be sold to banks reduced from 40 percent to 20 percent.
Monetary Policy: The RBM has continued to tighten monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures as
evidenced by the three times hike in the benchmark rate since the May 2012, from 13 percent, to 25 percent in
December 2012.The non-collateralized window established by the RBM in June 2012 to meet the liquidity needs of
distressed banks was shutdown end November as it was discovered to be a source of growth in reserve money and
the continuous deterioration of the value of Kwacha.
Fiscal Policy: Over the past recent years fiscal discipline has been reasonable with the exception of spending
around the 2009 elections and the implementation of the 2011/12 budget in an environment of constrained revenues
and unadjusted spending. The Government has been implementing an austerity budget since July 2012 based on the
budget framework agreed with the IMF, with TA support on the Budget from the Bank. Based on the two quarterly
reviews of the ECF program for the 2012/13, the Government has managed to control the fiscal with noticeable
challenges on the monetary side. This notwithstanding, fiscal pressures and risks are mounting on the back of wage
increase demands, the out of court settlements running to billions of Kwachas for contract termination of a number
of public officials by the current regime and emerging drugs crisis.
Reinstatement of the Automatic Price Adjustment Mechanism for Petroleum: Since the APM was reinstated in
May 2012, petroleum prices have been reviewed on a monthly basis and based on movements in the exchange rate
and changes in import costs above or below the 5 percent threshold, price adjustments have been made with the
exception of the month of October where the decision to adjust the prices was withheld. The adjustment made in
November 2012, however took into account the developments in the international petroleum prices and exchange
rate since September 2012. This has eliminated the fuel subsidy regime and now the higher fuel import prices are
passed on to consumers in the form of higher pump prices. The supply of petroleum products improved significantly
between May and August, with some hiccups during the months of October-November attributed to the availability
of foreign exchange. The situation has since normalized.
Automatic Tariff Adjustment Formula for Electricity Tariffs: Between May and December, electricity tariffs
have been adjusted twice to reflect movements in exchange rate and inflation.

PFM Reforms
21.     Key Issues: The main challenge facing the authorities is to contain expenditure growth,
improve quality and efficiency of public spending and strengthen expenditure controls. Over the
last ten years, the country has been implementing PFM reforms with the main objective of
achieving macro fiscal discipline, effective allocation of resources, efficient and effective
delivery of government programs, transparency of public finances and strengthened
accountability. While this has yielded some improvements in the legal framework, IT systems
(IFMIS/HRMIS) and budget procedures,48 the full benefits of these reforms have not yet been
felt in terms of aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources and effective service
delivery. Key to achieve this objective is the establishment of processes to manage fiscal risks
and ensure predictable budget execution; establishment of links between planning and budget
preparations (particularly budget execution) to ensure that resources are allocated to priorities;
and setting up internal controls to ensure that meager resources are used for the intended purpose
and contribute to the efficient delivery of services. The overall progress in PFM has remained
unchanged compared to the 2008 PEFA, despite good progress in some indicators.

﻿E. Poverty and Social Impact - Preliminary Assessment on Electricity Tariff
Adjustments
23.    The pervasiveness of poverty is reflected in the demand and use of different types of
energy for both cooking and lighting. Malawi is heavily reliant on biofuel for its cooking
energy requirements and that biomass, especially firewood and charcoal. The demand for and
use of energy for lighting also seems to reflect the rural concentration of the population and
pervasive nature of poverty. There is evidence that Malawians, regardless is area of residence,
clearly distinguish between sources of energy for cooking and lighting. According to the 2011
Welfare Monitoring Survey report, paraffin is the main source of fuel for lighting for many
households, accounting for 74 percent, and 18 percent of the households used electricity. Use of
electricity for lighting was more reported in urban than rural areas, 42 percent and 15 percent,
respectively. Results of the survey have indicated that firewood was the most common source of
fuel for cooking in Malawi, accounting for 88 percent. Seven percent of the households used
charcoal and three percent used electricity and 3 percent used electricity for cooking. In urban
areas, 13 percent used electricity for cooking, 42 percent used charcoal and 44 percent used
firewood. In rural areas, 2 percent used electricity and 92 percent used firewood for cooking.
24.    According to the preliminary findings from the analysis on distributional and fiscal
impact of domestic electricity subsidies in Malawi, tariffs in Malawi have more than
doubled over the past two years, with the change coming in three large lump-sum
increases. During FY11, the average domestic tariff was MWK 6.3 per kWh; by November
2012, the average domestic tariff was MWK 18.5 per kWh. The gap between tariffs and cost
likely widened slightly further over the period despite the significant increases, as average cost
also likely doubled over the period. In FY11, the average cost of supply was MWK 13.1 per
kWh - MWK 6.8 higher than the average tariff. By the end of 2012, the average cost of supply
was MWK 7 higher than the average tariff, at MWK 25.5 per kWh.so
25.    Electricity consumption in Malawi is relatively high: in FY11, average consumption
was 354 kWh per month, and median consumption was 239kWh per month (Figure 1). The
average ranges from 140kWh per month for the poorest quintile of electrified households to 387
kWh per month for the richest. Though low compared to consumption in developed countries
(the United States average for 2011 was 940kWh per month), the average is almost identical to
South Africa's in the early 2000s and significantly higher than the current average in South
Asian countries (e.g., the average in India was 70kWh per month in 2010). 51 It is also
substantially greater than typical subsistence consumption estimates of 30 or 50 kWh per
household per month.
50 Malawi's electricity utility, ESCOM, conducted a cost of supply study in 2009 and is currently updating the study. In the
interim, this analysis has assumed that the cost of electricity supply was driven upward by economic fundamentals. It assumes the
cost of supply rose at a weighted average of exchange rate increases (80 percent weight) and inflation (20 percent weight).

26.    Malawi's overall electricity access rate was 7.1 percent in FY 2011 (Figure 2). This
very low electricity access rate is likely a primary driver of the high consumption, as the
households that would be most likely to be low consumers instead simply do not have
electricity access. The poorest two income quintiles had close to zero households with electricity
access, and the middle quintile only a one percent access rate. The access rate in the second-
richest quintile was still only 6 percent and in the richest quintile 28 percent. Given the
extremely low access rates in the poorest two quintiles, few observations were available to
analyze electricity usage and expenditures (only one household in the survey from the poorest
quintile and only 11 from the second-poorest quintile had electricity access), and statistics
reported for those two quintiles should be taken with that in mind.

27.    A notable share of households with electricity access (approximately 12 percent) report
not actually paying for their electricity. Given this, their electricity usage data is not captured in
the household survey used for this analysis, and they are therefore excluded from all statistics
other than access rates.
71


﻿28.    In line with the high electricity usage, electricity expenditures are also a relatively
high percentage of households' overall expenditures. On average, households with electricity
access devote 16 percent of their total monthly expenditures to electricity. This ranges from 27
percent in the poorest income quintile to eight percent in the richest income quintile.

29.    The share of electricity expenditures in total expenditures likely increased somewhat
from FY11 to the end of 2012, as tariffs increased faster than inflation (Figure 3). In
November 2012, the average electricity share of total expenditures would have risen to 34
percent, assuming that total expenditures rose at the same pace as inflation and that electricity
usage remained constant. That figure would range from an average share of 58 percent among
the poorest quintile to 17 percent among the richest quintile.
Electricity Subsidies: Cost and Targeting
30.    Together, the tariff, cost of supply, and electricity consumption data allow an
examination of the magnitude and distribution of household electricity subsidies. A
household electricity subsidy is defined as the difference between the utilities' cost of supplying
electricity and the amount a household paid for that electricity. As illustrated previously, per-unit
subsidies were large in 2010, and persisted, albeit at slightly lower levels, through the end of
2012.
31.    In FY11, ESCOM       spent over 5.2 billion MWK        on electricity subsidies to
52
households. This was equivalent to over half a percent of Malawi's GDP at the time. The
Government of Malawi has committed to cease supporting ESCOM in order to enable it to
operate on a commercial basis. Therefore, the cost of these subsidies were likely shouldered
entirely by ESCOM, though it may have offset some of the cost by obtaining cross-subsidies
from industrial and/or commercial customers.
32.    By the end of 2012, the net cost of annual subsidies had likely increased somewhat to
5.9 billion MWK, assuming electricity consumption remained unchanged from FY11 levels.
The total amount of subsidies payments would actually be somewhat larger than this, but it
52 The fiscal burden analysis assumes each domestic utility customer received a subsidy equivalent to that received by the
average household with electricity access
72


﻿would be offset by a small amount of cross-subsidy payments made by low-consuming
households with postpaid meters whose average tariff is above the cost of supply. If households
instead decreased their electricity usage to keep expenditures a constant share of their budgets,
the net cost of subsidies would instead have decreased substantially to 1.7 billion MWK.

33.    These subsidies are highly untargeted: 57 percent of FY11 electricity subsidies went
to households in the two highest income quintiles (among households with electricity
access) (Figure 8). The poorest quintile, among electrified households, received only 12 percent
of total subsidy payments and the second-poorest quintile only 15 percent. Notably, essentially
100 percent of the subsidies are going to the top three income quintiles among the population as
a whole, as there are almost no households in the poorest two quintiles with electricity access.

34.    This highly unequal subsidy distribution is due to a combination of Malawi's flat
tariff structure and the positive relationship between consumption and income. Given that
all electricity units were subsidized at approximately the same rate, households that consume
more electricity receive a greater total subsidy. As illustrated previously, the richer quintiles
consume more electricity, on average, so those households accrued more subsidies receipts.
35.    The subsidy incidence likely worsened from FY11 to November 2012, regardless of
if households compensated through increased expenditures or decreased usage. If
households compensated through increased expenditures, the incidence would only worsen
73


﻿slightly: the richest two quintiles would receive 59 percent rather than 57 percent of subsidies. If
households compensated through decreased usage, the incidence would worsen dramatically,
largely because poorer households would have to decrease usage by more than richer households
to keep their expenditure shares constant.

Options for Future Tariff Increases
36.    Considering Malawi's continuing inflation and exchange rate increases and the
persistent large gap between tariffs and the cost of electricity supply, ESCOM should
consider increasing tariffs further. Assuming that inflation for 2013 comes in at the projected
20 percent (just over half of its 2012 value) and that the exchange rate also increases by about
half of tis 2012 increase (i.e., about 60 percent), the cost of supply will rise by another 50 percent
by the end of 2012. Given that tariffs are already well below the cost of supply, an additional 50
percent increase in the cost means tariffs would have to be increased by almost 230 percent to
meet the cost of supply. Such an increase is unlikely to be feasible, for a variety of reasons, so
the following analysis considers more likely increases.
37.    There are two broad options for the tariff adjustment: a flat increase or a
differentiated increase that allows lower tariffs for lower consumption levels (Figure 10).
The flat increase would increase all tariffs by the same rate, as in the previous three tariff
changes. The scenario illustrated here increases tariffs by 70 percent. The differentiated increase
could come in several forms; the one illustrated here increases tariffs more for higher-consuming
households than for lower-consuming households, thus creating a "lifeline" tariff structure that
charges less per unit to households that consume less electricity. Specifically, the scenario
considered increases tariffs by 40 percent for households consuming under 200 kWh per month,
raises them by 70 percent for households consuming between 200 and 500 kWh per month, and
raises them by 90 percent for households consuming over 500 kWh per month.

38.    The latter "lifeline" option would likely have several benefits over the "flat" option.
It would mitigate the impact of the tariff increase on the lower-consuming households (who tend
to be poorer), as they would face a smaller increase than under the "flat" scenario. It would
improve the distribution of subsidies by income, as lower-consuming (generally poorer)
households would receive a greater subsidy per unit of consumption than the higher-consuming
households (whereas, with the "flat" option, all households would continue to receive
approximately the same subsidy per unit). It may also increase energy efficiency and reduce the
strain of peak electricity demand on the electricity system, as the differentiated structure would
incent all households to consume less.
39.    It would, however, have two primary downsides, though they are likely outweighed
by the benefits. First, to achieve the same average tariff with the differentiated increase as with
the flat increase, tariffs would have to be raised even more for the highest-consuming households
than under the flat increase. In the examples considered here, all households experience 70
percent increase under the "flat" option, and households consuming over 500 kWh per month
would experience a 90 percent increase under the "lifeline" option. Second, it is more
complicated to design a cost-recovery tariff under a differentiated structure than under a flat
structure. Under a flat structure, all households pay roughly the same tariff, so that tariff can
simply be set equal to the long-term marginal cost of electricity supply. Under a differentiated
structure, the utility must ensure the weighted average tariff equals the long-run cost of supply,
which can require detailed knowledge of consumer consumption patterns.
Impact of Potential Future Tariff Changes
40.    As tariffs under either scenario would increase more than expected 2013 inflation,
the increases would have a notable impact on the share of electricity in total household
expenditures and/or households' electricity consumption, though the lifeline tariff would
slightly cushion that impact for the poorest households (Figures 11 and 12).sa If total
expenditures rise with inflation, and electricity consumption remains constant, the average
electricity share in total expenditures would rise to 47 or 48 percent under the flat or lifeline
5 In the period between the tariff increase and the end of 2013, the impact would likely be even greater, as household budgets
likely will not fully inflate to the levels assumed here until then.
75


﻿scenario, respectively. Under the flat increase, expenditure shares would range from an average
of 82 percent in the poorest quintile to 24 percent in the richest. Under the lifeline increase, those
shares would be 78 and 26. If households instead chose to reduce electricity consumption to keep
the electricity share of their expenditures constant, they would have to reduce consumption from
an average of 140 kWh per month in November 2011 to 83 kWh under the flat increase or 100
kWh under the lifeline increase.

41.    The increase in electricity priceS54 beyond inflation would also pass through to other
household consumption goods, which would put additional pressure on household budgets.
This impact would be felt by both households with and without electricity access - though
households without electricity access are likely consuming fewer of the goods whose prices
depend significantly on electricity prices (e.g., manufactured goods) than households with
electricity access. A study in Australia found that, if producers passed on the full electricity price
increase to consumers, prices in other sectors (e.g., food, alcohol, tobacco, clothing, furnishings,
transport, etc.) would rise by about 1/33th as much as electricity prices.55 This is a very high
upper-bound, as (a) it is unlikely that there would be full pass-through to consumers in most
sectors and (b) electricity may be a greater input to consumer goods in a developed country such
as Australia than in Malawi. The degree to which this impacts household budgets would also
depend on the share of these other goods in their total expenditures.
42.    Although both proposed increases increase tariffs by a greater percentage than that
expected for costs, only the increases modeled under the lifeline scenario would lessen the
gap between tariffs and the cost of supply and thereby ease the cost of subsidies for
ESCOM. If households maintain their consumption levels, the annual net fiscal cost of subsidies
would fall from 5.9 billion MWK to 5.7 billion MWK under the modeled lifeline increase and
would rise to 6.3 billion MWK under the modeled flat increase. If consumers kept expenditure
shares constant and reduced consumption, both increases would significantly lessen ESCOM's
subsidy burden.

﻿43.      The distribution of subsidies would improve under the lifeline increase to better
than both the November 2012 and FY11 distributions; under the flat increase, however, it
is regressive 2012 (Figure 13). Because the lifeline increase targets subsidies to lower-
consuming households who also tend to be the poorer households, it would improve the benefits
incidence notably. The poorest two income quintiles would receive 26 percent of total subsidies,
an increase from the 22 percent of November 2012. In contrast, under the flat increase, the
poorest two quintiles would receive only 21 percent of subsidy payments. The richer quintiles
still receive the bulk of subsidy payments, however, as will continue to be the case as long as
higher levels of electricity consumption continue to be subsidized.
