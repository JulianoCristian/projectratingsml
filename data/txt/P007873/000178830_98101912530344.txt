I. OVERVIEW OF BASIC EDUCATION
Overview
1.01      Structure and Administration.  Formal education in Paraguay is
comprised of the following levels: primary education of six years, followed
by two three-year cycles of secondary (grades 7-9 and 10-12). Post secondary
education includes teacher training (grades 13-14) and universities of 4 to 6
years (Chart 1). The education system is administered on the basis of three
hierarchical levels: The office of the Minister, the General Directorate of
Education, located in Asuncion and comprising a number of specialized depart-
ments and Supervisory Offices located in each geographical department. For
primary education, a fourth level (educational nuclei) has been introduced in
selected areas in a number of geographical departments (Chart 2).
1.02      Education Finance and External Aid.  Resources devoted to education
in Paraguay are low when compared with Latin American countries with similar
income levels (e.g., Ecuador, Peru). Expenditures channeled through the
Ministry of Education and Workship amount to around 1.4% of GNP, and about
14.2% of public spending in 1979. Over the past five years, the percentages
have fluctuated as follows:
Public Education Spending
as a Percentage of:
1975      1978        1979
GNP                                1.4        1.6        1.3
Government Budget                 14.4       16.8       14.2
Source: Government
The principal reason for the decline from 1978 to 1979 in the GNP and budget
percentages devoted to education is the delay in the adjustment of teachers'
salaries during the rapid inflation of 1979.
1.03      Capital expenditures amounted to about 15% of total education
expenditures in recent years and to an important degree were financed by
external capital flows in the form of either grants or loans. In 1979 foreign
grants and loans to the education sector amounted to US$3.4 million, or 48% of
capital expenditures on education. The sources of capital financing have
been: USAID funding of $6 million for regional education centers in the early
1970s; Japanese financing for a vocational training center; loans totalling
$12.6 million from the Inter-American Development Bank for secondary agricul-
ture schools and farmer training in the 1970s and a loan for US$13.2 million
in 1980 for technical and lower secondary education. The World Bank has
approved three loans/credits totalling $21.1 million for education/training.

1.04      The basic objective of Bank Group lending to the education sector
in Paraguay has been to increase the supply of trained manpower required by
the economy, to expand the availability of general education in underserved
areas and to improve the quality of education. The first Bank Group education
project (Credit 347-PA, US$5.1 million, signed in December 1972) supported the
establishment of the first diversified secondary schools in the country as
well as the improvement of technical education. The project was completed by
the original closing date. The Borrower and the Bank completion mission
ranked the project as highly successful both in achieving project objectives
and in implementation. 1/ The second Bank project (Loan 1252-T-PA, US$4.0
million, signed in May 1976) is supporting the expansion and improvement of
the vocational training capabilities of the National Vocational Training
Service (SNPP) in order to respond to the urgent needs of the economy for
skilled and managerial workers. It has been implemented satisfactorily and
the loan was fully disbursed at the end of 1980, as originally scheduled. A
third Bank Group education project (Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA, US$12.0 million,
signed in December 1976) is assisting the Ministry of Education in expanding
and improving educational opportunities for children and adults in rural
areas. It includes construction of rural primary schools, and diversified
secondary schools, textbooks, teacher training, and technical assistance for
the improvement of administration. The implementation of this project is also
on schedule and the project is expected to be completed by the original
closing date of June 30, 1981.
Primary Education
1.05      Overview.  Primary education in Paraguay is, by law, compulsory
for all children between the ages of 7 and 14. The system comprises
about 500,000 students, taught by 12,000 teachers and housed in more than
3,300 primary schools. Sixty percent of the student population is rural
and half is female.
1.06      Organization and Management.  The Ministry of Education administers
the primary education system--through its Department of Primary Education and
38 departmental supervisory offices. The Ministry has had difficulty in
administering the system, particularly in rural areas, because it has a poor
information system and weak management controls. Supervision and maintenance
are relatively simple in urban areas, but exceptionally difficult in rural
areas because of inaccessibility and lack of financial and institutional
resources for the proper functioning of these services. Each departmental
primary supervisor has to cover an average of 68 schools and 273 teachers,
without official transport. Consequently, rural teachers remain largely
unsupervised and poorly informed of new education trends.
1/   Experience gained from the completed project indicates that:  (a) training
and upgrading of teachers and administrators contributed to successful
implementation of the education reform; (b) contracting technical assis-
tance specialists within the region was more cost-effective than recruit-
ing experts from outside; (c) the stability of project unit staff and
delegation of authority by management to the project director contributed
to successful project implementation; and (d) continuity of Bank staff in
project supervision contributes to satisfactory project implementation.



- 3 -
1.07      In order to improve rural primary education, the Ministry recently
established a fourth level of administration school nuclearization system in
six of the country's 20 departments. 1/ Each of the six departments has at
least one nucleus, comprising an average of 10-15 schools. Each nucleus can
serve up to 1,500 to 2,000 students, taught by 15 to 25 teachers on a double-
shift basis. The area covered by the nucleus has as its hub a central school
(grades 1-6); linked to the central school are subcentral schools (grades 1-6)
and associated schools (grades 1-4). Each nucleus is headed by a director
based at the central school who is supervised by his respective departmental
primary supervisor. The director has no teaching responsibilities. Duties of
the director include supervision of teachers in the nucleus under his respon-
sibility, attending parent and teacher meetings, evaluating annual progress of
education in his nucleus and personnel administration. Because of the rela-
tively short distances between the center and associated schools, the nuclear
director can frequently provide teachers with pedagogical support.
1.08      School Buildings.  Paraguay's primary education system includes
about 3,300 school buildings in 1979, housing about 4,500 elementary schools. 2/
About 2,700 of the school buildings (83%) were in rural areas. About 88%
of the rural schools were public compared with 66% in urban areas. Only
40% of the rural schools gave instruction through the full six grades compared
with 95% complete schools in urban areas. A clear majority of rural schools
(2,000 of 2,700) follow the plurigrado system (multigrade schooling programs).
1.09      Enrollments.  In 1979, the primary education system served 504,000
urban and rural children. Of the total, approximately 306,000 (61%) attended
rural schools. About 15% of the students were enrolled in private schools.
During 1970-79, enrollment in primary schools increased at an average yearly
rate of 1.9%; the growth rate for the 7-14 group for the same period was 2.6%.
As a result, the 7-14 age group gross participation rate decreased from 88% in
1970 to 86% in 1979. Increases in migration to newly colonized areas where no
schools are currently available may account for the decrease. While the
overall participation rate for primary students is encouraging, it must be
taken into account that a large proportion of students enrolled in each grade
are overage (about 70% on the average) due to high repetition rates and late
student entrance. For instance, less than 50% of first-grade students are
seven-year-olds, and less than one third of six-graders are 12 years old.
1.10      Student enrollments differ significantly between geographical
Departments (Table 1.1). As measured by the representation index (enrollments/
7-14 year olds), predominantly rural Departments in areas of recent coloniza-
tion are below the national average. The same is true of the capital city,
but clearly for a different reason: Due to more timely entrance and higher
retention rates, the system operates more efficiently in Asuncion and does
not inflate student numbers with overage students.

2/   In many cases, a school building is used to house two or more
administratively distinct schools.

1.11      Teachers.  In 1979 approximately 12,000 teachers filled 18,000
teaching positions in primary schools in Paraguay. Over 9O% of them are
female because the profession tends not to attract male candidates due to
social habit and traditionally low salaries. Only two thirds of the rural
teachers are certified compared with 95% of their urban counterparts. In
general teachers have been poorly prepared to work in rural environments.
They often are inexperienced in multigrade teaching techniques, and lack
intimate knowledge of local conditions that could make their classes more
relevant to rural audiences.
1.12      Teacher salaries in 1979 ranged from US$80 to US$120 monthly.
A comparative study of wages at the regional level conducted by the
Ministry of Labor indicates that primary school teachers were paid (on a
12-month basis) about the same as female office clerks and sales personnel.
In response to this situation, the government is progressively applying the
new salary scale (escalafon), which provides additional payments for (i)
experience, (ii) attendance at training courses, (iii) work in rural or
frontier regions, or with multigrade classes, and (iv) working two shifts
(double salary). In addition, Congress approved for FY 81 a 38% increase
in teachers' salaries. At present about 70% of rural teachers who work two
shifts receive a monthly remuneration of about Guaranies 30,000 (US$238),
which is satisfactory.
1.13      Teacher training.  Fifteen post-secondary (grades 13 and 14) insti-
tutions give two-year training programs to prepare primary school teachers.
Three are located in the Asuncion area; the remaining 12 are distributed
throughout the departments. The curriculum includes fundamentals of pro-
fessional development in education, primary curriculum development and prac-
tical training. Admission requirements to the pre-service training program
include a secondary diploma, as well as an admission examination and an
aptitude test. The combined pre-service enrollment for grades 13 and 14
totaled 1,400 students (9% male, 91% female) in 1980. An estimated 670
completed the program that year. On the average, enrollments in teacher
training schools are 40% below capacity, mainly because the majority was
established only recently. For some schools, however, actual and/or pro-
jected demand for teachers in the school's area of influence exceeds the number
of graduates corresponding to current enrollments. This requires an expansion
of existing facilities, as is the case of the teacher training school at
San Pedro. Another factor deterring higher enrollments is that, although
teaching ranks high in social esteem, traditionally low salaries discourage
many, especially males who serve as the sole support of a family, from
entering the profession. Assuming that teacher salaries continue to increase
at a rate similar to that in 1981 and teacher training schools start operating
at full capacity (producing about 1,000 graduates per year), there will be an
overall supply-demand balance for teachers around 1988 (Annex 2). Such an
overall balance, however, probably conceals local imbalances due to the
segmentation of the national market for teachers in Paraguay.

1.14      In addition to the teacher training schools, pre-service and in-
service training in administration, supervision and curriculum development
for primary and secondary education is given to about 1,600 students at the
Instituto Superior de Educacion in Asuncion. Six Regional Education Centers
also give in-service training. The six Regional Education Centers give
instruction at all levels from preschool through teacher training. Estab-
lished more than ten years ago, under the aegis of the Ministry of Education,
the Centers have their own administration/supervision and decision-making
authority. The REC's were established to promote educational innovation
through new curriculum and teacher training, to serve as experimental,
decentralized administrative units, and carry out in-service education
activities. The 1979 total enrollment approximated 11,000 students.
1.15      Curriculum.  A new curriculum for primary education, prepared with
UNESCO and USAID assistance, has been under experimentation since 1973 in
about 10% of all schools. The new curriculum differs from the traditional one
in that it (a) takes into account the different social, economic and cultural
environments of urban and rural children; (b) groups several dispersed subjects
into three areas of study (social studies and communication; nature and health
studies and industrial-arts and education for the home; and mathematics);
(c) introduces practical activities in laboratories, workshops and gardens;
(d) gives importance to the use of audiovisual materials and textbooks; and
(e) supports the participation of parents in adjusting the curriculum to
specific characteristics of school communities. Evaluation of this curriculum
is under way. Following possible modifications the curriculum will be eventually
applied to all schools in Paraguay.
1.16      Language.  Spanish and Guarani are the national languages of Paraguay,
with Spanish the official language. About 90% of the total population speak
Guarani, and for a third of this population it is their only language. About
74% of the population in rural areas speak only Guarani but have a fair
understanding of Spanish; 23% are bilingual and 3% speak only Spanish. The
study of Guarani is included in the curricula for secondary and teacher
training schools. Rural primary school teachers use Guarani to facilitate the
learning of Spanish as a second language. Children, after completing the
first cycle (grades 1-3) of primary education, learn enough Spanish to become
bilingual. The Ministry of Education, with technical and financial assistance
provided by the Bank (Loan 1346-PA/Credit 667-PA) and USAID, is developing a
new methodology for more efficient bilingual teaching at the primary education
level.
1.17      Textbooks.  The function of the Ministry of Education's Department
of Textbooks is to administer the preparation, production and distribution
of primary education textbooks. The Department is well-staffed with about
30 teachers, editors and draftsmen trained under a USAID program and expe-
rienced in implementing the textbook production component of Loan 1346/Credit
667-PA. Textbooks are written by teams of teachers who have received special-
ized training abroad. Private firms print the books after competitive bidding.
At present the Office of Internal Revenue distributes the books to rural
schools through its 163 local offices. Between 1976-78, about 500,000 text-
books and accompanying teachers' guides were produced for grades 1-4, and in
1979-80 325,000 textbooks for grades 5-6 were also printed by the Ministry of



-7 -
Education. These books met only about one-third of the need and were dis-
tributed mainly to urban schools. Consequently, a shortfall of about 1.2
million books remains. The textbooks produced by the government are to
service rural students, while urban students are mainly supplied with govern-
ment approved textbooks produced by private firms or individual authors.
The cost of privately produced textbooks is 82% higher than of those produced
by the government. The parents' average expense per child for the required
government produced textbooks (about four) in rural schools would be the
equivalent of about US$6, but should be substantially reduced in successive
years as book life is estimated at three to four years. The government
considers that this is not a hardship as the time the books are required to
be purchased coincides with the harvest. Present government policy is to
sell textbooks to students at 10% below cost and to provide each school
library with five to 10 sets.  The government is also trying to improve
textbook distribution by: (i) offering a monetary incentive (about 5%) to
textbook salesmen, including agents of the Internal Revenue Office; and
(ii) instructing supervisors, nuclei directors and teachers to urge parents
and local cooperatives to purchase the required textbooks. In July 1976
Decree No. 24-148 established a revolving fund with the proceeds of the sale
of textbooks and budgetary allocations to finance the distribution and print-
ing costs (15% of the cost of texts for grades 5 and 6 has already been
financed from this revolving fund). It is expected that in future, with
a larger number of books produced and sold, this fund will cover about 80%
of the cost of reprinting textbooks.
1.18      Evaluation.  Existing regulations to evaluate the performance
and achievements of Paraguayan primary school students have not been fully
implemented. Most teachers test their students at the end of the school
year to determine promotions, but these evaluations are largely subjective,
vary from teacher to teacher, and yield no data by which to evaluate overall
performance of the system. The government received assistance through Loan
1346/Credit 667-PA to review - and recommend improvements in - the education
and promotion system. The government is now considering recommendations for
improvement, but due to its lack of experience in this field, little improve-
ment can be expected without further outside assistance.
Adult Education
1.19      Paraguay's overall literacy rate is 84%, including 93% in urban and
78% in rural areas. In 1978 a total of 250 literacy centers (214 civilian,
24 military and 12 police stations) offered accelerated primary education to
adults and out-of-school youths in an effort to remedy educational inequalities
through basic education and training programs. The curricula offered at these
centers closely follow those for school education, except that the program is
concentrated into three years. An estimated 16,000 individuals were enrolled
at these literacy centers in 1979 taught by approximately 800 teachers. There
is no specialist staff at these centers, although about 85% of the teachers
had some type of training in the field of adult education.

II. ISSUES IN PRIMARY EDUCATION
2.01       The primary education system in Paraguay has three overriding
problems: (i) only about a third of the eligible rural children complete
six grades of primary school; (ii) learning achievement of the students is
comparatively low when students leave school; and (iii) the system has basic
administrative and managerial weaknesses.
Access and Efficiency
2.02       Paraguay has achieved a relatively high gross enrollment ratio
of 89%. However, these overall figures conceal important regional disparities
in enrollment coverage, the concentration of students in the early grades of
primary education and the low throughput (or efficiency) of the system. As
shown in Table 1.1, enrollments in primary education are neither evenly dis-
tributed among departments nor between urban and rural areas. In 1979 the
representation index by department varied from 0.68 in Alto Parana to 1.24 in
Misiones, and in rural areas from 0.44 in Amambay to 1.28 in Paraguari and
1.35 in Caaguazu. In other terms, a rural child of primary school age in
Amambay, Canendiyu.or Alto Parana had only one third or one half as much
chance to be in school than his counterpart in Caaguazu or Paraguari.
2.03       In addition, enrollments tend to be concentrated in the early years
of primary school. For each 100 places in rural schools, 31 places are
occupied by first grade students and only 6 by students in the sixth grade,
compared with a norm of 18 and 15, respectively. This skewed enrollment
distribution by grade is caused by the high rates of repetition and dropout.
As shown in Table 2.2, those who failed to be promoted and dropouts accounted
for about 28% of total enrollments in rural schools. Only two of every three
students were promoted from first to second grade in rural schools.
2.04       As a result of high failure during year-end examinations and dropout,
only about one-third of the relevant age group in rural areas finishes primary
school compared with almost 80% in urban areas. Table 2.1 shows the low effi-
ciency of rural primary schools.

The enrollment in grade 1 in 1973 had declined to 40% of its original size in
grade 4 in 1976, and to 21% by grade 6 in 1978.



- 9 -
2.05      These high failure and dropout rates are caused by both school
and non-school factors. Non-school factors include the inability of parents
to afford the direct 1! and indirect costs of schooling. Of these, the
indirect, or opportunity, costs include the need of poor parents for the
services and labor of their children.
2.06      School-related factors also contribute to repetition and dropout.
Schools frequently are located too far from a student's house, especially in
rural areas, making it physically difficult to attend or stay enrolled in
school. "Lock-out," or unavailability of schools beyond the third or fourth
grade (para. 1.09), prevents many students from continuing their primary
education. In addition, many parents withdraw their children from school
because of dissatisfaction with the irrelevance of the traditional curriculum
(still taught in 90% of the schools--para. 1.15), poor condition of school
buildings and lack of instructional materials.
2.07      As a consequence of the inefficiency of the system, two-thirds the
Paraguayan rural youth are unable to complete primary school. As farmers,
their limited (or lack) of literacy handicaps their ability to accept and
exploit information offered by extension agents and other public services,
or to seek, obtain and use agricultural credit productively. As entrants
to the labor force, their incomplete basic education limits their ability to
receive instruction in required vocational skills or pursue further education
to enhance their upward mobility. The solution to these problems of access
and efficiency would be to concentrate government investment in disadvantaged
rural areas according to the successful pattern of nuclearization (para. 1.07).
Quality
2.08      Although there are no direct measurements of learning achievements
in primary education, indirect factors suggest that cognitive achievement
is low among those who complete rural primary schools. Such indirect measures
of quality include teachers, curricula and textbooks.
2.09      About one third of the teachers in rural areas have received no
training in how to teach. Those who have been trained received little prepa-
ration for work in a rural environment where multigrade teaching predominates
(para. 1.11). Moreover, difficult conditions in rural areas provide little
incentive or attraction to qualified teachers, which adversely affects student
achievements. The curriculum taught in about 90% of the schools is traditional
and apparently much less effective than that introduced in 1973 (para. 1.15).
1/   Parents are expected to pay for about 30% of the cost of rural primary
education (1,372 guaranies for school material and uniforms out of a
total of 4,494 guaranies in 1975). In reality, however, they have
not been able to buy the necessary books.

ie shortage of instructional materials in rural schools adversely affects the
q. ;lity of education. Visits to rural schools reveal that there is an almost
total lack of learning and teaching materials in the classrooms. 1/ Teachers
have to resort to lecture teaching even at the first grade level. Thus, the
child's learning world is generally limited to the teacher's own knowledge and
experience. Moreover, printed curricula and syllabi are lacking as monitoring
tools; in some cases only one mimeograph copy is available for all the teachers
in a school. Finally, the lack of systematic testing makes it impossible to
identify, and thereafter correct, the weaknesses in scholastic achievement.
2.10      The consequences of low achievement in rural primary schools are
limited chances for upward mobility, for example: (i) disadvantages in
gaining access to secondary schools which are mainly concentrated in urban
areas; (ii) the inability to exploit information (e.g., agricultural extension)
or learning on the job (para. 2.07) to maximum benefit; and (iii) for women,
the perpetuation of low levels of education in future generations. A strategy
to raise the level of cognitive achievement among rural children should
include continuous in-service training and pedagogical support for teachers,
increase the supply of textbooks, implement the new curriculum on a wider
scale and introduce systematic student testing.
Administration
2.11      Primary education is managed in a highly centralized fashion, with
important decisions and much of day-to-day administration left to central
headquarters in Asuncion (para. 1.06). The causes of centralization are
rooted in past periods when most primary school students were concentrated in
a limited area around Asuncion. This is a problem exacerbated by (a) ill
trained personnel at headquarters; (b) government policies that keep salaries
low, thereby forcing many public employees to seek additional employment or
job assignments inside or outside the public sector; (c) inadequate physical
facilities (buildings, office equipment, office supplies) which keep the
productivity of public servants low; and (d) organizational structures
that do not take into account the need for coordination between various
administrative units.
2.12      The impact of these deficiencies is diverse:  Quality control
for teachers is lacking, particularly in rural areas, as the result of too
few supervisors in departmental Supervisory Offices and the difficulty of
sending supervisors from Asuncion (due, among others, to the poor transpor-
tation network). Processing of statistical information is too slow. Important
decisions have to be made without the guide of reliable information. Personnel
working part-time do not have the incentive or the expertise to produce high
quality work. Uncoordinated activities many times result in duplication of
effort, conflict between administrative units, and valuable time wasted at the
highest levels for the resolution of such conflicts.
1/   Only 0.7% of the public spending on education is for non-salary costs.



- 12 -
2.13      These problems are complex and cannot be overcome easily or quickly.
The government, realizing the serious consequences of excessive centralization,
has started in recent years a program of granting local administrators increased
authority through the creation of educational nuclei (para. 1.07). It is also
attempting to strengthen Supervisory Offices in each geographical department
through the provision of additional personnel and equipment and the transfer
of some decision making power. Both processes have been slow and should be
extended.
Education Development Plan and Strategy
2.14      Education in Paraguay has been developed in accordance with the
1969-1980 Education Development Plan and the 1977-1981 National Economic and
Social Development Plan. During 1969-1975 emphasis was given to improving and
expanding secondary education by including prevocational courses in lower
secondary education and establishing diversified secondary schools, in order
better to prepare graduates for entry into the labor force or for further
specialization. Since 1975 the Education Development Plan has called for
special attention to the needs of the poorer segments of the population; thus
the plan emphasizes formal and nonformal primary education. The government's
main objectives in primary education are: (a) to increase by 2.5% per year
the portion of the school age population which receives a full six years of
schooling and (b) to improve the quality and efficiency of primary education.
2.15      These two objectives are to be achieved by giving high priority
to primary education, with preferential treatment for rural and frontier
zones. The plan calls for enrolling about 90% of primary school age children
by 1985, which represents an increase of about 120,000 children compared with
1979 net enrollment. This goal will be achieved only through concerted action
in the rural areas, where nearly all the nonenrolled children are found. The
strategy for improving the quality of primary education includes:
(a) evaluation and revision of the 1973 primary education curriculum
to respond to national, regional and local characteristics of
development, taking into account the interests of the student
population;
(b) achievement of actual community, teacher and student participation
in the education process;
(c) implementation of the nuclearization system in order to improve
school administration and supervision, and facilitating coordination
of education activities with various public and private institutions;
(d) establishment of a permanent in-service training program
for supervisors, administrative staff, and teachers;
(e) provision of textbooks to primary school students; and
(f) expansion and reinforcement of health and nutrition education
and services.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Content
3.01      The proposed Rural Primary Education Project would assist the
Government in carrying out its priority objective of serving the education
and training needs of the poorer segments of the population, especially
in rural areas, by focussing on the primary education level. The project
would:
(a) expand and improve primary education for children and adults
in rural areas by:
(i)  establishing a school nuclearization system in 43
rural areas that is expected to improve education admin-
istration and extend the use of multigrade teaching
techniques, and building and/or equipping within these
areas about 500 schools in communities lacking educational
services or with facilities in immediate need of replacement
and/or extension;
(ii) establishing non-formal education/training programs for
adults, and providing the corresponding physical
facilities in 15 of the central schools of the 43 areas
included in the project;
(b) cover critical pedagogical needs at the national level by:
(i)  training and upgrading about 1,800 currently employed
teachers, and introducing incentives for retaining
competent teachers in rural areas (teacher housing,
supplementary salary for multigrade teaching, full
compensation for additional teaching time);
(ii) replacing the inadequate facilities of the teacher
training college at San Pedro and reequipping three
additional colleges;
(iii) completing the evaluation, revision, printing and
distribution of the curricula and syllabi for primary
education and grades 7 to 9 of secondary education;
(iv) printing and distributing basic textbooks to primary
school students and corresponding teaching guides to
primary school teachers;
(c) contribute to the improvement of central education administration
in the area of primary education by:
(i) providing additional technical assistance for the study
of a national education evaluation and tracer system;



- 14 -
(ii)  providing five additional computer terminals for better
processing oL personnel data and statistical information;
and
(iii)  financing a new unit (to be retained after project completion)
responsible for planning and implementing in-service teacher
training programs.
Elements of the Project
3.02      Nuclearization and Construction of Rural Schools.  This project
element would assist the government in creating 43 rural primary education
nuclei according to the model described in para. 1.07, and comprising about
500 schools as summarized in Table 3.1:

EXCLUDING 600 PLACES AVAILABLE IN EXISTING CLASSROOMS FOR ADULT EDUCATION,
TENTATIVELY, THE DEPARTMENTS OF GUAIRA, NEEMBUCU AND MISIONES,
Schools would be located in areas where deficiencies have been identified as
the highest according to a school mapping survey. Project nuclei were
selected on the basis of equity and the educational requirements of regions
where rural development projects are being, or will be, implemented. The 1979
school mapping carried out under Loan 1346-PA/Credit 667-PA determined the
nuclei catchment areas, the need for new, extension and replacement schools,
and the requirements for teachers, teachers' houses, furniture, equipment, and
teaching materials. Areas in the departments of Alto Parana, Presidente Hayes,
Canendiy4, Amambay, and Concepcion, which have greater need for school facilities
(Table 1.1), and in Itapua and San Pedro, whose population is expected to in-
crease rapidly as the result of colonization, would benefit most from the pro-
ject.



- 15 -
3.03     The project would provide for the construction of about 500 class-
rooms in about 200 1/ communities without schools or with schools in poor
condition, furniture and equipment for these classrooms, and teaching equipment
only for an additional 675 classrooms in about 300 communities. All project
central schools would be especially equipped for proper implementation
of health and nutrition programs. In addition, based on satisfactory experi-
ence with previous projects, economical teacher housing would be provided in
about 110 smaller communities where accommodations for teachers are either
unsatisfactory or nonexistent. This should serve as an incentive for attrac-
ting adequate teachers to these communities. Furthermore, it should ensure
closer participation in the activities of the community on the part of the
teachers.
3.04      Buildings for new schools to be established in 109 small rural
communities where no education facilities exist at present would have a
standard two classrooms and a small office/storage space. If the community
has no more than 80 school age children, and therefore requires only one
classroom (operating in two shifts), the remaining room would be used for
office and teacher housing. Existing schools in very poor condition have
been selected for replacement. It is expected that the new buildings would
improve the enviroment for learning and the effective use of teaching/learning
materials.
3.05      Project schools would offer the full six grades of primary education,
or only the first four grades when another school in the vicinity--no more
than three kilometers away--offers grades five and six. Teachers would work
two shifts and apply multigrade teaching techniques (receiving two salaries
and an additional premium for multigrade teaching). By concentrating in areas
with sizable population centers (actual or projected as the result of rapid
colonization), project schools would be characterized by a higher (and more
economical) average student/teacher ratio (35:1) than the current national
average (28:1).
3.06      Directors of nuclei would be especially trained (para. 3.12) and
would be provided with motorcycles to enable them to undertake their respon-
sibilities as technical and administrative supervisors of the 10 to 15 schools
in the nucleus. These motorcycles would be government property, and their
operating and maintenance costs would be covered by regular budgetary alloca-
tions.
3.07      The major improvement in primary education would derive from the
student's role in the learning process: "learning by working" on a small
farm or in a workshop, laboratory or school library. Project schools would
be adequately equipped for these activities. The project would provide basic
1/   Additional facilities in central schools would include an open multi-
purpose area, a multi-purpose workshop (home economics/practical arts),
and an office/library/storage room, and a special classroom (in 15 of
the 43 areas) for adult literacy courses (para. 3.09).



- 16 -
equipment and, for the first two years of the schools' operation, disposable
teaching materials (to be paid for thereafter by regular budget allocations).
3.08      With the help of the abovementioned improved education conditions,
it is expected that the policy of compulsory primary education would be more
effectively enforced, resulting by 1990 in about 92% of the seven year old
population in the regions affected by the proposed project being enrolled
in grade 1, and with the retention rate between first and sixth grades
increasing to about 34% from its present level of 21%.
3.09      Non-formal Education/Training Programs.  About 15 central schools
would provide literacy courses for adults in classrooms specially built and
equipped for this purpose. Staff of the Adult Education Department have been
trained to carry out these courses by a specialist whose services were financed
under Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA. The latter also helped revise the curricula
for these courses. The project would finance further training of about 40
teachers in adult education techniques, including the use of recently printed
textbooks.  The literacy program would include non-formal training courses
which would be designed to improve workers' skills, agricultural productivity,
and the quality of life of each community.   Instructors for these non-formal
courses would be volunteers selected from the most capable local workers,
especially trained teachers and agricultural extensionists. The reach of the
non-formal programs under the proposed project, however, would go beyond
literacy courses provided in the 15 central schools. Under an agreement
already reached between the Ministries of Education and Labor,the "Servicio
Nacional de Promocion Profesional" (SNPP), which is being strengthened
under Bank Loan 1252-PA, would use project school facilities while providing
mobile workshops and instructors for training in several rural oriented
specialities. The Ministry of Health and Nutrition, as agreed with the
Ministry of Education, would use school facilities as a base for carrying out
its rural service programs. Central schools would also be used for seminars
organized by the nucleus director to discuss rural development issues, teaching
methodology, use of available teaching aids, and the means for proper imple-
mentation of technical and administrative regulations established by the
Ministry of Education. In addition, central schools would be available during
weekends or out-of-school hours to teachers taking in-service training courses
using distance learning techniques. For this purpose central school libraries
would be provided with professional reference books.
3.10      In-Service Teacher Training.  The project would finance: (a) the estab-
lishment and operation of a new in-service teacher training unit and (b) the
implementation of an in-service teacher training program. Given the foreseen
need for recurrent in-service training and upgrading of teachers in the future,
the new permanent unit to be established in the Ministry of Education would
be responsible for planning and executing in-service teacher training programs.
After completion of the proposed project, expenditures for operating the unit
would be incorporated in the regular budget of the Ministry. The unit would
be staffed by an executive director, 40 educator/supervisors, and the nec-
essary supporting staff. An advisory council composed of representatives of
the Departments of Primary Education and Teacher Training and Regional Education
Centers and the Higher Institute of Education would establish in-service train-
ing policy and strategy for the executive director. The first activity of



- 17 -
the new unit would be to implement an in-service teacher training program
aimed to (a) train and certify as qualified teachers about 1,400 "bachilleres"
(general secondary education graduates) already teaching in rural schools;
and (b) upgrade about 400 project school teachers, directors and supervisors.
The program would benefit about 75% of all unqualified teachers in rural
areas. During negotiations the government should give assurances that it
will establish and staff, no later than January 31, 1982, and thereafter
operate, the in-service teacher training unit.
3.11      The in-service training program for certification as qualified
teachers of "bachilleres" at present teaching in rural schools would last
two years (about 1,400 hours). Courses would be offered in regional education
centers, the Higher Institute of Education in Asuncion, and teacher training
schools. The trainees would study in their own localities during the school
year, using printed materials prepared by the training unit staff and listening
to lectures broadcast by public and private radio stations. Nuclei central
schools would be used for seminars, discussions and evaluation of trainees.
Nuclei directors, together with teacher training coordinators and central unit
staff, would supervise practice teaching and assist trainees in the field.
The project would cover the cost of staff salaries, production and distribution
of printed materials, travel and per diem of staff and trainees, fellowships,
office equipment and furniture, and two vehicles for supervision purposes.
3.12      The upgrading of about 400 in-service teachers would be effected
as in Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA financed by the Bank (two summer courses of
eight weeks each). Trainees would be teachers of primary and adult education,
nuclei directors and supervisors assigned to project schools. The training
course would emphasize organization and administration of rural nuclei,
multigrade teaching techniques, health, nutrition and population education,
use of textbooks, and rural community development. Trainers would prepare
manuals of course content for distribution to participants and to libraries of
project and teacher training schools. This sub-component would also include
the construction and equipment of facilities for a regional school supervision
office and workshop for training teachers in the development of simple teaching
materials, for rural primary education. These facilities would be located at
Pilar to serve the southern departments (other departments are already served
by existing facilities).
3.13      Pre-service Teacher Training.  This project component would include:
(a) replacement, furnishing and re-equipping of the teacher training school
at San Pedro with a capacity for 200 students; and (b) the provision of
equipment for three more existing teacher training schools.
3.14      The capacity of the proposed new building for the San Pedro teacher
training school was determined on the basis of the number of graduates per
year from surrounding secondary schools and their preference for further
studies as shown in a survey carried out in 1979 by the Teacher Training
Department. The project facilities would include classrooms, a science
laboratory, a workshop for preparation of teaching materials for primary
schools, a library and administrative offices. As the project school would
operate under the national regulations for primary teacher training, it would
offer a two-year post secondary course. The curriculum is being revised to
include multigrade teaching techniques, health, nutrition and population
education, and



- 18 -
education, and community development in order to make training relevant to the
rural environment in which the majority of the graduates would teach. The
annual output of the project teacher training schools, in full operation,
would be about 100 qualified teachers who would be assigned primarily to rural
schools of the Departments of San Pedro, Canendiyu and President Hayes, where
the need for qualified teachers is great. This would represent about one-tenth
of the total teacher demand in 1988 (Annex 2), the remainder to come from
other teacher training institutions. In summer, school facilities would also
be used for carrying out in-service teacher training courses. During negotia-
tions the government gave assurances that the revision of the teacher training
curriculum would be completed by December 31, 1981.
3.15      Of the eight teacher training schools under the direct administration
and supervision of the Department of Teacher Training, three (Cordillera,
Misiones and Paraguari) lack basic training equipment, including professional
reference books. The project would finance the purchase of such equipment in
order to raise the standard of teacher training.
3.16      Curriculum Development.  This project component includes the finan-
cing of the completion of the evaluation and revision of the 1973 curricula
and syllabi for grades 4-6 of primary education and grades 7-9 of lower
secondary education. Revision of curricula for grades 1-3 is being financed
through Loan 1346-PA (Third Education Project). The basic technical and
administrative structure for curriculum evaluation has already been established
with the assistance of USAID specialists. In addition, UNICEF and UNFPA are
assisting the government in updating health, nutrition and population programs
included in the primary education curricula. The Curriculum Department of the
Ministry of Education would be responsible for coordinating the financial and
technical assistance being provided and for the implementation of this project
item. The department would be strengthened by contracting additional technical
staff (about 200 man/months) including evaluators, specialists in each curri-
culum area, and supporting personnel. The cost of these contracts is included
in the project, as well as the cost of field trips, office equipment and
materials, computerization of data, and printing of reports.  Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the government would implement the revised
curriculum "Educational Innovation" in all project schools.
3.17      Textbook Production.  This project component would provide to the
Department of Textbook Production of the Ministry of Education the materials
for printing about (a) 230,000 textbooks for grades 1-4 of rural primary
schools; (b) 10,000 teachers' guides; (c) 57,000 copies of the revised
primary education curricula (para. 3.16), including syllabi, by grade,
and pedagogically developed lessons; and (d) 16,500 copies of lower secondary
education curricula and syllabi by subject matter (para. 3.16). In addition,
the project would cover the cost of preparing manuscripts for lower secondary
education textbooks (about 200 man/months of subject specialists). Manu-
scripts would be completed in about three years. The Department is well
staffed to carry out this project component (para. 1.17).

3.18       Textbooks for grades 1-4 of primary education were prepared in
1974-1976. They include three titles each for grades 1 and 2 and four titles
each for grades 3 and 4.  The project would finance the reprinting of readers
for grades 1-4 and mathematics texts for grade 1. Since they are considered
to be of more critical importance for student achievement, stock is almost
exhausted and their use is mandatory in primary schools. The Department of
Textbook Production would revise the content to ensure that it conforms to
the new curriculum and would provide, from its revolving fund, counterpart
financing estimated at about 15% of total printing cost. The proposed number
of copies would cover the needs of rural students for a period of four years
for each book. The quantity to be printed is based on existing stock, and
distribution in the proportion of one book to two rural students. The titles
to be printed are shown in Table 3.2.

3.19       The textbooks for grades 1-4 to be printed, together with grade 5
and 6 textbooks recently printed with Bank financing, would complete the
minimum set necessary in primary education. In-service and pre-service
teacher training programs would include a course on the use of textbooks
to ensure effective results.



20 -
3Xz20     Present government policy is to sell textbooks at cost (from about
US$,ni80 to US$2.50 per copy and to provide each school library with five
to ten sets free of charge (para. 1.17). As large numbers of primary school
students are currently without basic textbooks, it is necessary to study the
possible impact of actual pricing policies on this problem. Such a study
shcuMd include an evaluation of current proposals to form a revolving fund
With the proceeds of textbook sales, with the expectation that in the future
textbook Droduction could become a self-financing venture. In addition, it is
recessary to assess the current system of textbook distribution, as it, too,
may be contributing to the problem of students' limited access to textbooks.
During negotiations, the government: provided assurances that it would undertake
and complete by June 30, 1982 a comprehensive study of textbook production
processes, pricing policies, and distribution systems with recommendations
for adopting measures that would improve availability of textbooks to students,
especially in rural areas, and thereafter discuss its findings with the Bank.
3,21     The facilities of the Ministry of Education would also be used to
rc`nL teachers' guides, curricula and syllabi for primary and lower secondary
education prepared by the Department of Curriculum. The project would finance
mate-1rials as well as minor pieces of equipment.  The printed documents would
be distributed free of charge to teachers of primary, secondary and teacher
training schools and would serve as reference books for the proper implemen-
tation of the revised curricula and syllabi.
3.22      Education Finance, Evaluation, Statistics, and Tracer System.
-his project component would include the financing of: (a) 18 man/months of
specialist services; (b) the cost of five computer terminals; and (c) the cost
of establishing and operating a student tracer system. The capacity of the
Planning Department of the Ministry of Education needs to be strengthened
i-r order for it to prepare annual and long term educational development
plans, establish criteria supporting its proposals for resource allocations
among educational levels and services, Technical assistance would be pro-
vided also for improving the evaluation system of the quality of instruction
ofrered to students and of the effects of alternative combinations of instruc-
t,onal "inputs" (school buildings, teachers, curricula, etc.) on student
performance. The Ministry of Education needs also technical assistance to
J_prove the statistical information system (para. 2.12) and for the establish-
ment and initial operation of a tracer system mainly for students leaving
technical and teacher training schools.  The five computer terminals to be
purchased under the project would link up with the existing computer in the
Ministry oE Education in order to modernize personnel administration and the
analysis of educational statistics.  This would permit the implementation of
recommendations given by the specialist in personnel administration, who was
financed under Loan 1346-PA/Credit 667-PA, and the proper use of the already
trained staff in carrying out a study of teacher salaries and employment
daca. The government gave assurances that it would (a) use the results
of the evaluation system study in preparing, by December 31, 1982, a plan
fci improving student achievement tests at the primary education level and
(b) carry out a study of the compensation required to attract qualified
teachers to rural schools.



- 21 -
3.23      Technical Assistance and Fellowships.  The project would include
60 man/months of specialist services and 72 man/months of fellowships, to
give about 20 selected nuclei directors the opportunity to observe implementa-
tion of the school nuclearization system in some Latin American countries.
The implementation schedule of this program is summarized in table 3.3 below.
During negotiations the Government gave assurances that it would contract
specialists and select fellowship candidates on terms and conditions that are
acceptable to the Bank, provide suitable counterpart staff for the specialists
and make appropriate arrangements for the placement of fellowship recipients.

IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
Cost of the Project
4.01      The total cost of the project, estimated at about US$28.4 million,
net of taxes, is economical: (a) the maximum use of local building materials
is made possible by the school design standard adapted; (b) the building
structures are simple, follow traditional forms used in rural construction,
and schools could be built entirely with community self-help programs;
(c) equipment and furniture lists have been confined to basic essentials and
specifications are unsophisticated for easy operation and upkeep; (d) fellow-
ships and specialist services would be provided within/from the region, cost
less than extra-regionally acquired technical assistance, and be more relevant
to the country's needs; and (e) schools would be used on a double shift basis
to the maximum extent possible, and would be used for other programs (paras.
3.09, 3.11 and 5.09e). The breakdown of the total cost by project item and
type of expenditure provided in Annex 3 is summarized below:

The government and the UNDP representative have agreed in principle that UNDP
funds (about US$0.2 million) available for financing technical assistance in
the social sector during 1982-84 could be used to contract the specialist
services described in para. 3.23. If this agreement is formalized, the saving
in the Loan would be canceled or used to finance additional programs in
furtherance of project objectives.
Base Costs
4.02      Civil Works.  Construction base costs have been estimated on the
basis of actual costs of schools currently under construction in areas of a
geographic character similar to the proposed project school sites under Loan
1346/Credit 667-PA. A local adjustment factor related to the accessibility
of the project site from central sources of construction materials and skilled
labor account for the range of unit construction costs indicated below. Rural
primary school unit construction costs range from US$152-197 per sq. m. of gross
building area. The design of these schools would follow the standards described
in para 5.02. The costs are comparable to similar construction in Latin
American countries (Nicaragua - US$170/sq m; Bolivia - US$160/sq. m.) where
access to project sites also poses a problem. Building costs for the San
Pedro Teacher Training School, and the regional school supervision at Pilar
(Nembucu) are estimated at US$210/sq. m.                    Both facilities adapt a



- 24 -
higher construction standard due to the nature of facilities required and the
level of trainees accommodated. Site development costs range from 18% of the
building cost (rural schools) to 25% (Pilar) depending upon the complexity of
site drainage, water and utilities requirements, and characteristics of the
terrain.
4.03      Professional Services.  The professional (design/engineering) services
required for school construction comprise only technical services in connection
with site surveys, design of site and building utilities (sewerage, water,
electricity) and full time construction supervision. The cost of these services
amount to about 2% of the construction cost of rural primary schools and 2.5%
for the facilities at San Pedro and Pilar (which are more complex). Standard
architectural plans for primary schools are complete and would require only
minor modifications (which would be carried out by the PIU's in-house architec-
tural staff) to suit the buildings to individual site conditions. Designs for
the San Pedro Teacher Training School and the regional office at Pilar would
also be executed by the PIU. The Ministry of Education would assume legal
responsibility for faults in construction attributable to deficiencies in the
building designs (as in the case of school building projects designed and
executed by the Department of Construction of the Ministry of Education).
Salaries of local specialists required for carrying out the programs included
in the project (curriculum development, textbook preparation, in-service
teacher training) are estimated to cost from US$300 to US$500 per month.
4.04      Furniture, Equipment and Textbook Costs.  Master lists of equipment
and furniture for each type of teaching/accommodation were reviewed and
approved during appraisal and costed according to prices of items awarded
in recent bids of equipment and furniture intended for similar schools under
Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA. Equipment and furniture costs are CIF project
site. The cost of textbooks to be provided under the project is estimated
at from about US$0.80 to US$2.20 per copy (materials, printing and delivery
included).
4.05      Technical Assistance.  Fellowships and specialist services are
expected to be mainly regional. Costs are estimated at an average of about
US$2,000 per man/month and US$5,000 per man/month respectively.
4.06      Foreign Exchange Component.  The total foreign exchange component
is estimated at about US$8.6 million or about 28% of the total project costs
net of taxes. Foreign exchange costs were estimated at 5% of the cost of
site works, 28% for construction, 35% for furniture, 90% for equipment,
materials, technical assistance, and foreign fellowships, and 15% for
project administration and professional services.
4.07      Duties and Taxes.  Local customs duties and taxes on locally procured
building materials, furniture and equipment are estimated at about 15% of
the cost of these items, and would amount to about US$1.85 million (including
contingencies). Directly imported educational equipment are exempted from
customs duties.



- 25 -
4.08      Contingency Allowances.  Physical contingencies have been
estimated at 10% of base costs, and applied to all project components with
the exception of technical assistance and fellowships for which none are
expected. Price contingencies for imported goods and services have been
estimated on the basis of recent price increases in international markets,
efforts to bring international inflation under control, and the special
conditions in markets for goods and services relevant to education projects.
As a result of these considerations, price contingencies are estimated as
follows:
CY  1981    1982    1983    1984-85
Imported Goods and Services                   12%      9.5%    8.5%      7.5%
Locally Procured Goods and Services           16%     14%      12%       10%
Total price contingencies for the project are estimated at about 41% of the
base costs plus physical contingencies on the assumption that: (a) construc-
tion and procurement would start by the first quarter of 1982; and (b) activi-
ties in the software components (curriculum development, personnel services,
etc.) would commence by late 1981.
4.09      Recurrent Costs.  The proposed project is estimated to generate
additional recurrent costs, and corresponding public expenditures, on the
order of US$1.4 million per year (at December 1980 prices). These additional
costs amount to approximately 3.0% of Ministry of Education budgetary alloca-
tions for total recurrent expenditures in 1980, and should therefore pose no
special problems for financing. The projected increases are insignificant in
comparison with the increase in national revenues (4.3% real growth rate,
1970-77) and the per capita income of the country (US$750 in 1977). About two
thirds of recurrent costs generated by the proposed project would be salary
payments, mostly for additional rural school teachers and a permanent central
staff for teacher training and retraining. An important source for additional
recurrent expenditures (about 25% of the total), would be the proposed provi-
sion of consumable materials to the project's rural schools for carrying out
their activities under the nuclearization program. On the other hand,
projected public expenditures for maintenance are low as it is expected that
substantial contributions will be forthcoming from local communities in the
form of both labor and materials. The funds to cover recurrent expenditures
would be provided from the national budget. Table 4.3 shows the recurrent
expenditures expected to be generated by the proposed project by 1985.

Financing and Disbursements
4.10      The total project cost of about US$28.4 million (net of taxes)
would be financed as follows:
(a)  the proposed Bank loan of US$17.0 million (60% of total
project cost) would meet 100% of foreign exchange costs
and about 42% of local costs; and
(b)  the Government would finance the remaining cost of
US$11.4 million (40% of total project cost).

4.11      The disbursement schedule is based on the satisfactory experience
in the implementation of the previous education projects in Paraguay
(Credit 347-PA, Loan 1252T-PA and Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA). Disbursements
are assumed to lag behind physical progress of the work and expenditures
corresponding thereto by about six and three months, respectively.

V. IMPLEMENTATION
Project Administration
5.01      Administration of the project is not expected to be difficult,
and is feasible for the following reasons: (a) about two-thirds of the
schools included in the project are located in existing sites; (b) build-
ing plans, furniture and equipment lists and specifications are in an
advanced stage of preparation; (c) tender documents are complete (documents
approved by the Bank for Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA would be used); (d) most
of the project elements are a follow through of activities carried out
under Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA; (e) the Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
which is satisfactorily administering Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA, would be
responsible for the management of this proposed project, and is well organized
and staffed to carry it out successfully; and (f) the implementation schedule
is reasonable. In carrying out its functions, the PIU would be assisted
by the related departments under the Ministry of Education and particularly
by the Departments of Education Planning, Primary Education, Teacher Training
and Textbook Production. The PIU would retain its present administrative
structure and key staff composed of the PIU director, project architect,
project engineer, educator, procurement officer, accountant and a bilingual
secretary. Additional support staff would be recruited for efficient super-
vision of the projects which are widely dispersed. The proposed project
would finance the cost of complementary salaries of key project staff,
additional office equipment and vehicles to facilitate construction super-
vision.
5.02      Design Standards of Project Schools.  The schools proposed under
this project would be built according to designs prepared from a study
conducted by the Project Implementation Staff of Loan 1346-PA/Credit 667-PA
in cooperation with CONESCAL. The design features a simplified traditional
method of construction making maximum use of local building materials and
the employment of non-semiskilled labor from the locality. This design,
used in the second and third construction phases of the project under
Loan 1346-PA/Credit 667-PA, reduced construction costs (resulting from the
use of a different design in phase one) by about 25% (from US$146 per sq. m.
in 1977 to US$112 per sq. m. of gross construction area in 1978). Further
cost reduction could be achieved if the assistance of the community in
constructing (via contribution of labor) were successfully tapped. The
experience of the Ministry of Education (MOE) using community assistance
has not however been productive, largely because of understaffing and under-
funding the MOE's Department of Construction, which carries out school repair
and maintenance work in addition to new construction. The PIU would need,
on the other hand, to increase its staff and develop well coordinated logis-
tical support in order to achieve success in rural school construction
administering the community labor force. The benefits that could be realized
by enlisting community assistance, namely: (a) a reduction in construction
expenditures by about 25% if labor is provided free by the community; and
(b) the community involvement in school maintenance make it worthwhile to
establish a closer working relationship between the PIU and the Department
of School Construction. The latter for instance could enter into a force
account contract with the PIU to manage community assisted construction



- 29 -
under the proposed project. This could solve some funding and staffing
problems of the Department of Construction and strengthen this institution
to eventually assume all school building activities of the MOE. At the
start of project implementation, the PIU would contract six man/months of
services of a specialist on low cost construction techniques for the devel-
opment of an alternative design to existing standards, investigating the
use of non-traditional construction methods and materials suitable to local
conditions, conforming to MOE requirements, and feasible for nationwide
adaptation in construction of schools or other rural facilities.
5.03      Project lmplementation Schedule.  The project is expected to be
completed within four years. The detailed project implementation schedule
shown in Annex 5 was discussed with the Ministry of Education officials
during appraisal and agreed on as a project implementation and monitoring
tool. The following activities have been completed by the PIU: (a) site
acquisition of about 50 project school sites (the remainder would be acquired
at the start of each succeeding construction phase); (b) final architectural
designs for the San Pedro Teacher Training School and the regional supervision
office at Pilar; (c) detailed furniture/equipment specifications and tender
documents; (d) terms of reference of consultants and contractual personnel;
and (e) terms of reference for the four studies to be carried out under the
project. Training programs are under preparation and the first batch of
trainees would be identified and undergo training by the end of 1981.
5.04      Procurement
(a) Construction - School construction contracts would be grouped into
economical packages to facilitate bidding and supervision. Due to
the dispersed location and small sizes of the schools envisioned under
this project, the bid packages are not expected to attract foreign
firms and, to the maximum extent possible, small local contracting
firms should be encouraged to participate in tendering. Construc-
tion contracts up to 1.0 million would be awarded using LCB proce-
dures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Bid and contract documents
used in the Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA would be adapted for this
proposed project. Civil works contractors would be prequalified and
interested foreign bidders would not be precluded from participation
in the bids.
(b) Furniture and Equipment - Contracts for furniture (about US$1.0 million)
and equipment (about US$3.0 million) would be awarded on the basis of
ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines (the use of the facilities of
UNICEF for procurement of primary school furniture, equipment and
materials would be considered). Furniture and equipment which
cannot be grouped in packages of at least US$100,000 totaling about
US$1.0 million would be procured using LCB procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank. In the case of ICB domestic manufacturers
would be allowed a preferential margin in bid evaluation equal to
the prevailing tariff or 15% of the CIF cost of imported goods,
whichever is lower. Items not exceeding US$10,000 per contract,
unsuitable for procurement through competitive bidding would be
procured through local shopping up to an aggregate total of US$500,000.



- 30 -
(c) Textbook Production - Paper for textbooks would be procured through
ICB. Printing contracts would be awarded on the basis of LCB among
local prequalified printers.
Disbursements
5.05      Disbursements would be made against withdrawal applications
prepared by the PIU accompanied by standard documentation covering procure-
ment of civil works under contract, equipment, furniture, textbooks, major
study contracts, professional and specialist services. Withdrawal applications
for payments of items acquired through LCB procedures and off-the-shelf
purchases, in amounts not exceeding USS10,000 would be supported by purchase
orders which would not need prior Bank approval.
5.06      Auditing.  Yearly educational and physical auditing would be
made by the MOE's technical departments involved in project implementation.
Financial auditing of the PIU's accounts and the management of the loan
account would be made by the Ministry of Finance. The yearly audit reports
by the MOE and the Ministry of Finance would be    sent to the Bank for
information.
Monitoring
5.07      Efficient monitoring, supervision and timely data collection
are essential to the early discovery of problems and the application of
adequate corrective measures. The PIU would be responsible for preparing
periodic progress reports, providing information on the quantitative and
qualitative aspects of the project. The standard forms developed for the
project financed under Loan 1346/Credit 667-PA for this purpose would be
revised to suit the reporting requirements of this proposed project, and the
relevant information would be sent on a regular basis to the Bank and the MOE
departments. Particular attention would be given by the PIU to: (a) proper
delivery of textbooks/teaching guides to students/teachers; (b) performance by
nuclei directors of their supervisory and coordination responsibilities;
(c) proper scheduling of training programs; and (d) placement of trainees
completing these programs.
Evaluation
5.08      Project evaluation would be made periodically by the PIU in
cooperation with the evaluation unit within the MOE (which was strengthened
through technical assistance and training programs financed under Loan
1346/Credit 667-PA) and the director of Primary Education. The main points to
be evaluated would be: (i) comparability between educational map data and
actual field experience during project implementation; (ii) effectiveness of
the textbook distribution system; (iii) supervisory coverage and effectiveness
in assisting teachers in the classrooms; (iv) changes in progression, repeater,
dropout and completion rates; (v) otudent achievement in project schools;
and (vi) participation rate of adults/youth in nonformal training courses
offered in project schools and achievements in literacy programs/courses. A
project completion report would be prepared by the government within six months
of project completion. Funding for the final project evaluation is included
in the project administration budget.



- 31 -
Coordination with Rural Development Projects, Bilateral and
International Agencies.
5.09      The proposed project has been designed with a view to assisting
the government in effectively coordinating various education development
programs:
(a)  Project schools would be located in areas envisioned for future
rural development projects; therefore the government or any
financial/development agency, including the Bank, may consider rural
development projects without a specific education component. This
trend of having education components of rural development projects
included in education projects (thus assuring nationally accepted
standards and priorities) would be maintained in Paraguay in future;
(b)  the UNDP representative in Paraguay agreed in principle to include
in UNDP's FY 1982 program about US$200,000 for financing technical
assistance requirements of the proposed project;
(c)  UNICEF's regional representative in Peru, its representative in
Paraguay, and government officials agreed in principle to implement
in the communities included in the proposed project programs on
rural community development (health, nutrition, sanitation home
economics, and training of rural teachers). In addition, UNICEF
would assist the government in the procurement of equipment for
project rural schools;
(d)  USAID is implementing a project that complements previous and
proposed Bank assistance to the education sector in Paraguay, thus
avoiding overlapping of foreign assistance;
(e)  coordination among government agencies is being encouraged.  The
facilities of project schools would be available to specialized
local agencies implementing nonformal education/training programs
for adult rural populations (agriculture, vocational training,
health, nutrition, sanitation, home economics). Finally, one of the
nuclei directors' main functions would be the coordination of these
programs at the local community level.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The project is expected to make a significant contribution to
the proper development of primary education in selected rural areas of 12
departments in Paraguay. The 43 project educational nuclei, comprising about
500 schools, would serve some 80,000 regular students by 1985 (about 25% of
total enrollments in rural areas). Within this broad context, the benefi-
ciaries would be: (a) 35,000 children in communities that currently possess
no schools or have substandard schools, and in which the project would provide
new school buildings and equipment, and (b) about 45,000 students in schools



- 32 -
which would receive instructional equipment. Furthermore, some 15,000 adults
and out-of-school youth would be provided with education/training facilities
and courses adapted to the productive needs of the local communities (agricul-
tural practices, home economics, carpentry, masonry, etc.). Access to both
regular primary schools and nonformal education/training programs would be
about equal for males and females. In addition to new school buildings and
equipment, it is expected that students in the project area would benefit
from improved teacher quality through the proposed training of 1,800 teachers
(many of whom can be expected to serve in project schools), school directors
and supervisors, and through revision of curricula and syllabi. The proposed
system of evaluation of student performance is expected to provide insights
regarding the individual and combined impact of the proposed improvements
in educational inputs on student achievement.
Risks
6.02      Identifiable risks are: (a) the potential underutilization or shortage
of some project facilities if the colonization and rural development programs
are not executed as currently planned, since information concerning them was
used to determine the location and size of project schools. This risk can be
avoided by constant monitoring by the PIU of developments and adjusting of
project school size in accordance with the most recent data; and (b) the
possible overloading of nuclei directors with a number of community functions,
which might reduce their performance regarding supervision of teachers in the
nuclei schools. Close monitoring of the pressures on, and performance of,
nuclei directors should reveal during project implementation whether any
modification of their assigned functions would be necessary.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the government gave assurances on the following
maters: Establishment and staffing of an in-service teacher training unit
(para. 3.10); revision of the teacher training curriculum (para. 3.14);
using revised curriculum in project schools (para. 3.16); a study of the
textbook program (para. 3.20); a plan for improving primary student achievement
tests (para. 3.22); a study of teacher compensation in rural areas (para.
3.22); and specialists, fellowship candidates, counterpart staff and the
placement of fellowship recipients (para. 3.23).
7.02      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project provides a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$17.0 million equivalent for a term of
17 years, including a 4-year grace period.
