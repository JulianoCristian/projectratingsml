The objectives of the multisectoral project\n            were to: (i) minimize the adverse economic impact of the\n            July 1990 earthquake and the Pinatubo eruption by assisting\n            in the reconstruction of essential infrastructure and other\n            facilities to promptly restore economic activity in the\n            affected area; and (ii) introduce measures to reduce the\n            negative impact of future disasters. Bank's performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: i) it\n            is essential that systems are established in government\n            agencies so that they can implement at short notice large\n            emergency projects; ii) if international technical\n            assistance is required, experts should be recruited quickly,\n            since their most useful advice can be given at the\n            commencement of rehabilitation efforts; iii) the early\n            allocation of adequate ftnds is vital to the implementation\n            of disaster relief efforts; iv) the government's\n            budgetary allocations to the agencies concerned should be\n            revised to take account of the newly available funds; v) it\n            is important that the lessons learned from the Luzon\n            earthquake be promulgated throughout the Government and to\n            Agency Regional Offices, since a similar intensity\n            earthquake or other national calamity could occur at any\n            time in any part of the country; and vi) National Housing\n            Authority (NHA) considered that its close and focussed\n            project supervision was a crucial factor in the timely\n            completion of this component."}, "docdt": "1997-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
