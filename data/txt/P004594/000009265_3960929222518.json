The reconstruction\n            investments will be focused on four subsectors:  (a) roads\n            and bridges - to reconstruct and rehabilitate a portion of\n            the national highway system and a portion of the local roads\n            and bridges connecting towns and villages to the highway\n            system; (b) housing - to reconstruct or repair homes\n            destroyed or damaged in seven urban areas; (c) medical\n            facilities - to reconstruct and re-equip damaged hospitals\n            and clinics; and (d) irrigation - to reconstruct damaged\n            irrigation systems.  Project technical assistance will\n            prepare detailed designs and procurement documents and\n            supervise contracts for project components."}, "docdt": "1990-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
