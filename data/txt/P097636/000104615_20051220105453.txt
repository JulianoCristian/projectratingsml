1. 
Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
The Punjab Education Development Policy Credit (PEDPC-III) would be the third and last of a series of 
three development policy Credits to suppor
t
the Government of Punjab’s three year education sector 
reform program (PESRP) to enhance access, improve quality of education, and improve gender parity 
in Punjab, Pakistan’s largest province.  The program was supported during the first year through the 
US$ 100 million Punjab Education Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC), which was approved by the 
Board in February 2004, and in the second year through the USD$100 million Second Punjab 
Education Development Policy Credit, which was approved in March 2005.  The proposed Credit 
would support the program’s final and third year that builds upon impressive progress achieved during 
the first two years of the reform program, and would help to deepen the reforms that have been 
implemented with high level of commitment.   
 
Bank budget support has been instrumental in supporting the Government of Punjab’s MTBF and the 
underlying strategy for promoting fiscal sustainability.
 
2. 
Proposed objective(s)
 
The purpose of this third development policy Credit is to provide budget support for the Province of 
Punjab, which is implementing a wide-ranging sector reform agenda backed by fiscal and fiduciary 
reforms.  The reforms are being implemented through the District Governments through annual Terms 
of Partnership Agreements (TOPs).  The program would contribute to closing the social gap and 
helping the Country progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to poverty

reduction and Education for All (EFA).  Improvements in education outcomes in Punjab, the largest 
province of Pakistan, have a countrywide impact, and success could motivate other provinces to follow 
a
similar path and undertake sector-wide reforms. 
 
3. Preliminary 
description: 
 
The Credit supports the key pillars of the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) 
–
which 
are:  (A) 
public finance reforms 
to increase public spending for education (and other pro-poor 
services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability; (B) 
reforms that
 
strengthen devolution and improve 
the fiduciary environment and governance
;
and (C) 
education sector reforms
 to improve quality, 
access and sector governance.
 
The Program Document of the first Punjab Education Sector 
Adjustment Credit (PESAC) presented the three year PESRP.  There has been steady progress, and a 
number of sector initiatives are already beginning to show impact, including promising increases in 
school enrollments.
