This proposed credit will complete the series of\n            annual programmatic development policy credits (DPC) in\n            support of PESRP. Phase II of PESRP is being prepared by the\n            Punjab Government, and the Bank has been requested to\n            support it through a new series of annual DPCs. Key pillars\n            of the PESRP are: (A) public finance reforms to increase\n            public spending for education (and other pro-poor services)\n            and to ensure fiscal sustainability; (B) reforms that\n            strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment\n            and governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve\n            quality, access, and sector governance. There has been\n            steady progress during the past two years, and the Program\n            is showing improvements in enrolment and in reducing the\n            gender gap at the primary and middle school levels. The\n            proposed third credit will assist the Government in\n            completing the agreed reform framework."}, "docdt": "2006-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
