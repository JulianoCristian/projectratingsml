Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) the LWMPP approach depended on active\n            community involvement, but was able to deliver goods and\n            services only after a long period of time. Establishing\n            credibility with farmers long accustomed to empty promises\n            requires that tangible rewards for their efforts commence as\n            soon as practicable following those efforts; 2) in a project\n            with substantial environmental objectives, and often complex\n            efficacy and efficiency treatment trade-offs, it is\n            important to measure at least local environmental impacts.\n            This data may later be modeled into broader environmental\n            impacts as treatment coverage spreads; 3) actively including\n            non-governmental organization (NGO) in participatory\n            projects can increase sustainability of project activities.\n            This is especially true if NGOs continue project activities\n            after the project closes, as was the case in the LWMPP; and\n            4) local authorities need to be involved in sub-project\n            planning from the start. Otherwise the project will create\n            parallel structures to the local government that weakens the\n            government rather than strengthening it."}, "docdt": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
