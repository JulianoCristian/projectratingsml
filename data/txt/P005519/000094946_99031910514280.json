The project is the first attempt to test\n            the conclusions of the National Watershed Management Study\n            carried out to take stock of past experiences in watershed\n            management and apply the lessons learned. There are three\n            components. The first consists of soil and water\n            conservation and erosion control measures carried out with\n            the active participation of the communities concerned on\n            public, collective, and private lands. These measures\n            include 1) protecting gullies and ravines on all lands,\n            improving range lands in degraded sylvopastoral lands, and\n            revegetating badlands progressively; 2) funding\n            participative forest management with pilot operations to\n            regularize illicit settlements, reforesting, and improving\n            socio-economic infrastructure; 3) rehabilitating small-scale\n            irrigation systems; and 4) intensifying irrigated and\n            rain-fed crop production, planting fruit trees, and\n            sponsoring field demonstrations and farmers' days. The\n            second component, socio-economic infrastructure, finances\n            access roads, water supply schemes, and technical studies.\n            The third component finances four-wheel drive vehicles,\n            office furniture and equipment including computer equipment,\n            and a training program for project staff, elected\n            representatives, and local administration officials."}, "docdt": "1998-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
