About this Report

       The IndependentEvaluationGroup assesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank'swork is producing the
expected results, and second,to helpdevelop improved directions, policies,and proceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience. As part of this work, IEGWBannually assesses about25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperationsthrough field work. In selectingoperations for assessment, preferenceis given to those
that are innovative,large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requestedassessments;and those that are likely to generate
importantlessons.
       To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR),IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other
documents,interviewoperational staff, visit the borrowing country to discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.

       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval.Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers'comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System

       IEGWB'suse of multipleevaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibilityto adapt to
lending instrument,projectdesign, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additionalinformationis available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).

       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectiveswere achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency.Relevanceincludes
relevance of objectivesand relevance of design. Relevance of objectivesis the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistentwith the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategiesand corporate goals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,Operational Policies).Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacyis the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiencyis the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possibleratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,Moderately Satisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expectedoutcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).Possibleratings for Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: High
Significant,Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.

       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensuredquality at entry of the
operation and supportedeffective implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratingsfor Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower(including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensuredquality of preparation and implementation, and compliedwith covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes.The rating has two dimensions:government
performance and implementingagency(ies)performance. Possibleratings for BorrowerPerformance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, Highly

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) prepared by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) for the Lakhdar Watershed Management Pilot Project (LWMPP).

The LWMPP was approved in FY99 for a loan of US$4 million. The project implementation was
initially planned for 5 years. This time frame was reduced at government's request to 4 years, and
subsequently extended to 6 years. The project was closed in December 2004. In 2003, GoM had
requested that US$l .O million of the loan be cancelled. At the end of the project, actual loan
disbursement amounted to US$2.57 million.

The PPAR was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). The report is based on the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD), sector and economic reports, special studies, Country
Assistance Strategies (CASs), Policy Framework Papers, credit documents, review of the project
tiles, and discussions with Bank staff. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR, Report No.
32292, dated June 17,2005) was prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Region. An IEG
mission visited Morocco in September 2008 and discussed the effectiveness of the Bank's
assistance with government officials, other development organizations, beneficiaries, and
stakeholders (see Annex E). Their cooperation and assistance in the preparation of this report are
gratefully acknowledged. Special thanks go to Ms. Sabah Bencheqroun, Ms. Francoise Clottes,
Mr. Hassan Lamrani, and Ms. Laila Moudden.

The IEG PPAR mission selected representative sites for on the ground verification. Sites with
project intervention in community watershed management were compared with sites without
project intervention. Based on these field visits and interviews with officials and beneficiaries,
this PPAR supports ICR findings in all important particulars and finds it to be an accurate
portrayal of the achievements encountered during implementation. Furthermore, this report
reviews changes in the country's approach to watershed protection in order to inform an
upcoming Evaluation of World Bank Support for Water-a         major IEG evaluation that will
examine the development impact of increased attention to water resources management and water
services. In addition, this PPAR will inform a case study on Morocco's water sector.

Copies of the draft PPAR have been sent to the relevant government officials and agencies for
their review and comments. No comments were received from the borrower.


Summary

The Lakhdar Watershed Management Pilot Project (LWMPP) was developed to promote
sustainable solutions to a deteriorating natural resource and land use situation in the High Atlas
Mountains of central Morocco. These mountains receive the bulk of the rainwater that ultimately
makes its way into numerous reservoirs, or filters down into subterranean aquifers.

More than two million people, among the poorest in Morocco, live off marginal land with fragile
soils within this watershed, using agricultural practices that rely on environmentally destructive
techniques. Steady population growth has increased pressure on the land. Over-exploitation of the
natural resource base has led to soil erosion and landslides. Taken together these have caused a
nearly irreversible decline in agricultural production, and the quantities of soil and water
streaming down the hillsides dump silt in downstream river channels and water bodies, reducing
dam storage capacity and increasing the risk of flooding.

The LWMP project was approved in December 1998to support the strategy developed in the
1995National Watershed Management Plan. This plan recommended taking a participatory
approach to natural resources management, though it recognized that stakeholder support for
environmental goals could only be attained through the promotion of livelihoods. The initial
project implementation period was 5 years which was subsequently extended to 6 years (closing
in December 2004).

The overall outcome for the LWMPP is rated as satisfactory. The objectives were highly relevant
given the enormous challenges facing farmers in the mountainous areas of the Lakhdar
watershed. Project objectives were also relevant to the 1997 CAS, since watershed management
projects were included in that document, as were improvements in environmental and natural
resources management. It also supported other key CAS objectives, and a review of the 2001, and
2005 CASs which succeeded the 1997 document, reveals that the issues dealt with in the LWMPP
were of even greater relevance to the more recent documents.

With respect to its efficacy, some 14,700 people living in harsh climatic conditions in the high
Atlas mountains benefited from the project through an increase in their agricultural income,
livestock improvements, income generating activities, and improved living standards (due to the
construction of wells, irrigation systems, and access roads). The project also achieved better
protection against soil erosion by involving communities in protecting newly planted trees,
terracing, and other soil conservation measures. There were moderate shortcomings in the way
the project's financial viability was measured, in its results monitoring system, and in its inclusion
of women in the decision-making process. Risk to development outcome was assessed as
substantial and Bank and Borrower performance as satisfactory. Given that this was a pilot
project, the lack of a monitoring system to track results hampered learning as well as potential
replication or scaling up of the approach. Even though this was a pilot operation, no follow-on
operation was implemented.

:ssonsfrom the LWMPP were the following:

  Communities need to see results early. The LWMPP approach depended on active
  community involvement, but was able to deliver goods and services only after a long
  period of time. Establishing credibility with farmers long accustomed to empty
  promises requires that tangible rewards for their efforts commence as soon as
  practicable following those efforts.

  Projects with beneficiary involvement generally take a while to build up momentum.
  Designing activities to be implemented by beneficiaries using a participatory
  approach takes considerable time. Start-up should be expected to be slow, and
  allowances made during design for a realistic implementation period.

  Successful pilot efforts that are abandoned dampen expectations and make
  subsequent development efforts harder topromote. Pilot projects create high
  expectations. In this case, there is no alternative: reforestation, soil stabilization, and
  runoff control will need to take place in the high Atlas mountains. Farmers were
  expecting to build on the successful experience of the LWMPP, and not building on
  the momentum created will make it far harder to generate farmer enthusiasm the next
 time around.

 Projects need to take gender patterns of work into account. Promoting natural
  resources management with men when women collect firewood and herd the cattle is
  inefficient, to say the least. Careful targeting of the gender whose activities are most
  likely to cause natural resource degradation greatly increases the potential impact of
  consciousness-raising efforts. Even where there are deep-rooted traditions of
  excluding women from traditional community decision-making processes, outreach
  campaigns can make use of women trainers, market days, etc.

 In aproject with substantial environmental objectives, and often complex efficacy and
  efficiency treatment trade-offs, it is important to measure at least local environmental
  impacts. This data may later be modeled into broader environmental impacts as
 treatment coverage spreads.

 Actively including NGOs inparticipatory projects can increase sustainability of
 project activities. This is especially true if NGOs continue project activities after the
 project closes, as was the case in the LWMPP.

 Local authorities need to be involved in sub-project planning from the start.
 Otherwise the project will create parallel structures to the local government that
 weakens the government rather than strengthening it.

A good Monitoring and Evaluation system is always important, but it is a mustfor
pilotprojects. Projects which may be replicated at a larger scale require a
comprehensive and effective M&E system with timely, meaningful and easily
quantifiable outcome and performance indicators to guide efficient implementation
and deployment of resources. M&E measurements and findings should be transparent
and made available for use to all the parties involved, including the communities
which are affected by project decisions and actions.

1. Background and Context

1.1     The Lakhdar watershed is situated in the province of Azilal in the High Atlas (see
Map in Annex F, Figure 5 and 6). Mountains reach an elevation of 3,700 meters. Mud
huts cling precariously to the hillsides and donkeys are a common means of
transportation on the steep slopes. Mountain creeks are muddy, of a reddish brown color,
caused by the burden of silt they carry.

1.2     The 1999LWMPP was developed to promote sustainable solutions to a
deteriorating natural resource and land use situation in the mountains of central Morocco.
These mountains receive the bulk of the rainwater that ultimately makes its way into the
numerous reservoirs, or filters down into subterranean aquifers.

1.3     More than two million people, among the poorest in Morocco, live off of
marginal land with fragile soils using environmentally destructive agricultural practices.
Population growth has increased pressure on the land and led to over-exploitation, soil
erosion, water runoff, and landslides. The degradation of the natural resource base has
caused a nearly irreversible decline in agricultural production and downstream siltation of
river channels and water bodies.




2. Objectives and Design

2.1     In 1995 a National Watershed Management Study was carried out to take stock of
past experiences in watershed management and to identify the lessons learned that would
help to develop a more sustainable approach to land use and natural resource
management in mountainous areas. These lessons lie at the heart of the LWMPP project.
The project's development objective (as listed in the Project Appraisal Document [PAD])
was to test on a pilot basis participatory approaches to improve land use and natural
resource management in mountainous areas. To achieve this objective, the project
provided a package of inputs and services which were expected to lead to improved
living conditions and incomes for the local population.

2.2     According to the PAD, the components for the LWMPP and their appraised and
actual costs are as shown in Table 1. Neither project objectives nor project components
were revised.

2.3      The project took a participatory approach to natural resources management,
learning a lesson from earlier projects that followed a top-down approach and then failed
to significantly raise stakeholders' awareness of the need to preserve the en~ironment.',~

2.4      A 2001 Morocco Country Assistance Evaluation undertaken by the IEG (formerly
OED) as well as an IEG study on Rural Development -From Vision to Action (2000)
found that soil erosion continued unabated. The reviews pointed out, however, that the
Lakhdar Watershed Management Pilot project (FY99) was piloting participatory
approaches to land use and natural resource management in order to test whether this was
a more effective way to promote soil con~ervation.~




' Studies conducted with World Bank and FA0 funding during the late 1980sand 1990s also supported a
participatory approach, especially one that would provide communities with additional income in return for
actions that would preserve the environment, stop soil erosion and run-off, and reduce sedimentation in the
reservoir downstream. Notwithstanding the above, forest rangers generally perceived villagers' grazing,
land clearing and forest product-collection activities as wanton destruction that needed to be punished, and
they did not take to the new approach whole-heartedly.

effective sectoral approaches (primarily health, water, education, infrastructure, and agricultural
development) and, on the other, decentralized participative processes. The Bank's major efforts have been
directed toward the former. To a much lesser extent, it has supported local participative processes. The
Lakhdar Watershed Management Pilot Project is a pilot scheme intended to develop such processes."

2.5      For the LWMPP, total project cost was estimated at US$5.8 million. The Bank
loan represented US$4.0 million; the government and beneficiaries contribution US$1.4
million and US$0.4 million respectively. In 2003, the borrower requested a cancellation
of US$l .O million of the loan and a one-year extension of the closing date up to
December 31, 2004. At completion actual loan disbursement was only US$2.57 million,
representing 64.3 percent of the initial loan (US$4.02 million). Total project cost was
US$4 million, of which US$2.57 million was paid out of the Bank loan and US$1.45
million of the government's contribution. Beneficiaries' contribution was in-kind. In
addition, a Japanese grant for Population and Human Resources Development (PHRD) in
the amount of about US$300,000 (or JPY 34 million) was provided. It financed training
in the preparation of two Douar Development Plans (DDPs), monitoring and evaluation
(M&E), as well as a study tour to Tunisia. The undisbursed balance of about US$14,000
(or JPY 1,623,821)was canceled as of July 31, 1999.



3. Implementation

IMPLEMENTATIONEXPERIENCE

3.1      The government's 1995National Watershed Management Plan identified three
priority watersheds where people were extremely poor and, as a consequence had no
other recourse than to over-exploit and degrade the natural resources to which they had
access. Based on the Plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries
(MARDF) prepared the LWMPP with FAOICP help. In response to a request from the
Government, the World Bank fielded two multidisciplinary missions in 1997 and 1998 to
identify and appraise a project in the Lakhdar watershed. similar projects were funded in
neighboring watersheds by other donor^.^

3.2      Under the LWMPP, four rural counties were selected for intervention: Ait
M'hamed, Ait Abbes, Ouaoula, and Ait Bououlli. Within each county are many
communes, and below that there are small settlements (known locally as douars), in
which extended families live together. Of the originally estimated 40 communes, 26 were
selected, serving about 14,700people. The project area comprised 16,000 hectares, or




  For example, interventions in the Tessaout and Msoun watershed were supported by UNDP,
interventions in the Tazekka-Tefrata watershed in the province of Taza were supported by FA0 and Italy,
and interventions in the Srou watershed were funded by the German GTZ and the GEFIRIF under the
MEDA program. The MEDA Regulation is the principal instrument of economic and financial cooperation
under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. It was launched in 1996 (MEDA I) and amended in 2000
(MEDA 11). It enables the European Union (EU) to provide financial and technical assistance to the
countries in the southern Mediterranean: Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco,
the Palestinian Territory, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. Retrieved on 11/30/2008 from:

about 10percent of the Lakhdar watershed.' (Annex F, Figure 3 and 4 present two maps
of the project area.)

3.3      After Board approval, a project Planning and Monitoring Unit (PMU) was set up
with a unit head, four subject-matter specialists and six extension agents (four male and
two female animateurs). At the central level, the project was located in the MARDF with
staff assistance from the High Commission for Water, Forests, and Desertification
(HCEFLCD). In addition, the project's PMU promoted formal partnerships with other
public service providers.6

3.4      Given the participatory and demand-driven approach, Bank staff mobilized a
Japanese Population and Human Resources Development grant to simultaneously finance
sub-project preparation consultancies and to jumpstart staff training. The grant covered
the preparation of Douar Development Plans (DDPs) and basic research to help identify
target communities and feasible activities. Project staff were trained in participatory
techniques. A detailed Project Implementation Plan and manual was developed. Local
authorities in 41 villages were briefed about the project objectives and consulted about
implementation mechanisms, and village representatives to liaise with the project were
identified.

3.5      The participatory approach called for community involvement in sub-project
appraisal, planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. As project
implementation went forward, local staff found the implementation of participatory and
demand-driven activities to be a challenge, requiring mutual trust, flexibility, and timely
responses to stated preferences.

3.6      During implementation, the following difficulties arose:

    High staffturn-over: The PMU head changed three times; the four community
    organizers left after receiving extensive training (which had to be repeated when
    replacements were found).

    Weak institutional set-up: While an administrative and accounting unit was set up, it
    was staffed with only one accounting officer. A Provincial Coordinating Committee
    was established to ensure coordination between the various rural development
    activities in the province and in the project area. Although it was expected to meet at
    least once a year, it met far less frequently than planned.

    Delays: Sub-project identification was slow and planning and implementation delays
    negatively affected implementation and nearly led to the project's cancelation.

    Cumbersomeprocurementprocedures: Both the government's and the Bank's
    financial and procurement procedures were followed, which created a heavy



 According to project progress reports, "the testing phase of the pilot project showed good results, but
addressed only a small part of the watershed (26 douars). However, the global and integrated development
policy to protect dams calls for a more complete coverage of the region (35,000 ha including 100douars)."

Development (ADS), and NGOs such as the Moroccan Association for Solidarity and Development

     workload for the one budget staff member in the Project Management Unit. In
     addition, the government changed the fiscal year from June 30 to December 31,
     which negatively affected sub-project planning.

     Harsh climatic conditions: Snow in winter did not allow access to some of the project
     areas.


3.7      In the end, the project overcame many of the above-listed difficulties to some
degree. According to a FAO-published study which compared 15rural development
 intervention^,^ and in the perception of project staff and other officials consulted by the
IEG PPAR mission, the project was a successful pilot effort, establishing a replicable
model for participatory approaches to natural resources management. The following
sections will assess the degree to which the objectives described in the PAD were
actually met.




4. Outputs and Outcomes by Objectives



4.1      Relevance of proiect objectives is rated high: The objectives are highly relevant
given the changing rainfall patterns in Morocco and the enormous challenges facing
farmers in the mountainous areas of the Lakhdar watershed trying to make a living
without using up all the available natural resources at the same time. The objectives are
also relevant for communities living further downstream, since reducing the amount of
silt transported to the Hasan I reservoir will secure investments in the reservoir and make
water available for communities living in the plains.

4.2      Project objectives were also relevant to the 1997 CAS, since watershed
management projects were included in that document. The project supported the CAS-
stipulated improvements in environmental and natural resources management. It also
supported the key CAS objective of reducing poverty and closing the rural-urban gap
through improved access to basic infrastructure and job creation through increased
community participation. In addition, the project was in line with the CAS objective of
encouraging greater decentralization: it provided a vehicle for practical experimentation
at the local level. A review of the 2001, and 2005 CASs which succeeded the 1997
document, reveals that the issues dealt with in the LWMPP was of even greater relevance
to the more recent documents (see Annex B). The 2005 CAS highlights the importance of
the preservation of natural resources in the mountain ranges, and stresses the threat of
prolonged drought. Social inclusion, especially of the rural poor and especially women
and children maintains its strategic relevance. With respect to decentralization, the 2005
CAS emphasizes the importance of context.

La Strat6gie 2020 de Dheloppement Rural. Rapport Principal. Rome. The study compared projects funded
by the GoM which had inputs from various donors.

4.3      The project objectives were also highly relevant to the Rural Development
Strategy 2020, outlined in 1999.~This strategy focused on closing the urban-rural gap in
Morocco in terms of rural electrification, all-season rural roads, and access to safe
drinking water. The LWMPP contributed to this effort even though it was appraised
before the strategy became effective.

4.4      Relevance of project design is rated substantial:The project's two main design
elements were 1)taking a participatory approach to watershed management and rural
development, and 2) implementing a pilot project which could be scaled up in the future.

4.5      With respect to the approach, requiring the active participation of stakeholders,
project design was relevant. Not only was it based on years of re~earch,~it was also
congruent with the prevailing national strategy. The GoM-preparedNational Watershed
Management Plan (1995) characterizedthe province of Azilal as a priority watershed for
intervention. The Rural Development Strategy (1997-2010, produced by the GoM and the
Bank in 1997)recommended taking a participatory and decentralized approach to
watershed and natural resources management and rural development.

4.6      With respect to thepilot approach, the choice of a pilot project wasjustified
because the project was complex and involved an integrated multi-sector approach to
rural development. The ICR described the participatory approach as risky because "top-
down" approaches were then the rule. This description seems odd, given that in 1985-86,
UNDP and FA0 undertook a study on rural development in the central High Atlas and.
the province of Azilal that highlighted the importance of stakeholderbuy-in. In addition,
a 2006 evaluation of the 2020 Strategy documented the multitude of parallel experiences
with participatory approaches in the late 1990s.lo

4.7      As a pilot effort, the LWMPP was expected to be implemented in four years. This
timeframe proved unrealistic: preparation of sub-componentsusing a participatory
approach took considerabletime, and the start-up was generally slow-not                  unusual for
projects with beneficiary involvement,which generally take a while to build up
momentum. Furthermore,the target area was a place where people were not used to
stating opinions and concerns to government officials. Given that the project had to be
extended by one year, and might have benefited from a longer time horizon, planning for
a longer-term intervention from the outset would have given the beneficiaries the time to
both acquire and use new skills, which would possibly have been reflected in the
project's results.

4.8      As will be further explained in paragraph 5.1, this PPAR rates overall monitoring
and evaluation as modest. However, a results frameworkhad been prepared for the
LWMPP that linked the project objectiveto CAS goals and componentsto expected

province of Azilal that highlighted the importance of stakeholder buy-in.

outputs and the project objective. Since the PAD formulated only one objective,
indicators were provided to further define desired project results in ways amenable to
monitoring.

4.9     With respect to the results framework in the PAD, overall key performance
indicators had been defined, which described the causal chain between inputs and
expected outputs and outcomes. Information sources for monitoring and evaluation were
described and critical assumptions listed. One of the assumptions was that existing
budget procedures might cause excessive delays in the implementation of agreed
actions-and    this risk was correctly identified. Other risk factors, mostly tied to
foreseeable delays included the inaccessibility of the project area during winter, and the
need to teach participatory techniques and to gain the confidence of the villagers were not
identified. In addition, high staff turnover among the PMU and extension agents should
have been identified as risks.



EFFICACY

4.10    Achievements (by objective) for the LWMPP were as follows:

4.11    Project Development Objective: To test on apilot basisparticipatory
approaches to improve land use and natural resources management in mountainous
areas. The key performance indicators set against this very broad Project Development
Objective (from the PAD) were: (i) communityparticipation as reflected in the number of
active village committees and the extent of community participation in the investments;
(ii) improved land use, including increased incomes from crop and livestock production;
and (iii) improved natural resources management, including an increase in vegetative
cover and erosion treat-ment.This PPAR will use these indicators to better structure and
describe project results.



4.12    Indicator 1: Communityparticipation as rej'lected in the number of active village
committees and the extent of community participation in the investments;this indicator is
rated modest.

4.13    The project was largely successful in its use of participatory approaches to natural
resources management. In order to prepare the LWMPP, extension agents trained in
participatory approaches visited target communities. They organized informal meetings,
which everyone was welcome to attend. Sub-project preparation took about 35 days per
community. Conclusions were reflected in a Douar Development Plan. Extension agents
explained the project to beneficiaries, helped them to prioritize their main concerns, and
appraised what would be required in terms of investments. Subsequently, they negotiated
an agreement with the Development Committee to provide local communities with
irrigation infrastructure, access roads, and wells, in return for the right to construct
protective gabion structures in the hills to combat soil erosion. In addition, local
communities had to plant fruit trees on terraces for soil protection and agree to prevent
goats and sheep from entering newly planted forest areas. At the end of the sub-project

appraisal phase, extension agents scheduledworks and training sessions to be undertaken
the following year. Communitiescontributed from four to six percent of subprojectcost
in labor (as compared with the 10-20percent anticipated at appraisal; Annex C). At the
end of each year, communities assessedthe implementation progress in a participatory
manner. Lastly, towards the end of the project, the informal groupings were formalized
and 13 community committeeswere registered as legal entities.

4.14    In total, 26 Douar Development Plans (DDPs) were formulated and 104Project
Contracts (PCs) signed. Of these, 101PCs were completely implementedby project
closing date. It is estimatedthat the PCs benefited more than 14,700people (compared to
13,000targeted at appraisal). The 13 Local Development Associations (LDA) created
under the project were still functioningas of the 2008 PPAR mission.

4.15    Despite the considerable achievementsthat stemmed from the participatory
approach used, the followingproblems occurred:

    It took extension agents a long time to obtain the trust of the local communities, and
    to get villagers to speak their minds, especially since their relations with government
    officials had been limited to command, control, and punishment previously.

    Even so, establishing credibility was difficult. Delays between the negotiation and
    delivery of infrastructure a year later fostered doubt and insecurity. Worse,
    community priorities had often changed in the meantime and many of the
    beneficiaries that had been involved in subproject identification had moved away.

    In the beginning, communitiesprioritized irrigation systems and roads over soil
    conservation measures-a      situationthat prevailed for the first two years of the
    project. Although disbursementswere slow initially, once the communities
    understood and accepted what the project could give them-which           happened in the
    last two years of the project-disbursement picked up. Villages also came to see the
    benefits of soil conservation and reforestation as time passed and patches of
    environmental improvement became visible.

    While participation may have been very beneficial during subproject design, an over
    ambitious participation during implementation led to technical problems.
    Construction firms and engineers adhered to the wishes of the most vocal community
    members, which often resulted in suboptimaltechnical solutions.

    Local government officials were sidelinedby the participatory process, and this was
    ultimately problematic for project sustainability. This PPAR finding has also been
    made in another context by IEG: it is reflected in a recent major evaluation, The
    Effectiveness of WorldBank Supportfor Community-Based and -Driven Development
    (2005). The study found that ad hoc parallel arrangements set up to implement Bank
    projects have hindered the long-run enhancement of local government capacity.          ''
    Although two women extension agents were involved, cultural norms prevented
    women from participating in District Committees. As a result, women's voices and

Driven Development: An OED Evaluation. Washington, D.C.

    gender divisions of labor were neglected during sub-project planning, as was
    evidenced by the priority given to roads over wells, and to goats and sheep over
    chickens, for example.


4.16    Indicator 2:Improved land use, including increased incomesfrom crop and
livestock production; is rated substantial.

4.17    Increased incomes: Project effects on increased income from crop and livestock
production are difficult to estimate because of a lack of baseline data. The PAD did not
specify measurable targets or baseline or benchmarks for this outcome indicator.
Although qualitative assessments were conducted during sub-project preparation, no
quantitative summary statistics on incomes from crop and livestock production were
collected.

4.18    At project closing, no beneficiary survey and no impact evaluation was
undertaken. However, according to the ICR, the incremental net revenue per hectare was
between US$523 to US$1,233 for irrigated areas and US$166 per hectare for rainfed
areas. Activities benefitted a total of 14,700people in the community. It must be kept in
mind that people living in the project area were amongst the poorest in Morocco and
several families shared one hectare of land. The rehabilitation of 554 hectares of small-
scale irrigation schemes (against a target of 500 hectares) helped increase annual net
returns of cereals, fodder and horticultural products by at least US$500 per ha. According
to estimates in the completion report, on rainfed land, farmers who adopted improved
technical packages for cereal, fodder and vegetable crops recorded increased annual
returns of over US$160 per ha. At full maturity, the olive and almond tree plantations on
rainfed land and the apple and walnut trees on irrigated lands are expected to generate
yearly net returns from about US$600 to US$2,900 per ha. The IEG PPAR mission spoke
with beneficiaries. Informants asserted that farm income from fruit tree plantation alone
increased five fold.

4.19    The IEG PPAR mission compared a village with project intervention to one
village that had been selected for the intervention, but had decided against it. In the
village without project intervention, irrigation channels were made out of stones and
sticks (Figure I). Seepage is more than 50 percent. A small dam diverts water from the
river into the irrigation channel. During heavy rains, the dam collapses and needs to be
rebuilt.

4.20    I11the project with the intervention, a well was constructed and water was
collected in two basins for irrigation. Irrigation channels were concrete-lined, which
reduced the time of water reaching the fields from two hours to ten minutes (Figure 2).

4.21    Water is allocated according to the size of the field and every farmer has his tuni.
If a farmer abuses the system and channels more water to his fields, he has to serve a
meal for forty people. There is one farmer responsible for enforcing water allocations.
This water warden also takes care of channel maintenance. Whereas before the project
intervention, every fkrmer helped maintain the channels, farmers are now paying a fee for
channel maintenance. The IEG PPAR mission found canals functioning and irrigation
channels well maintained.

4.22    Livestock improvemeilt activities (including some 490 crossbreeding operations)
under the project helped to improve livestock fertility rates and birthweights. The 84 km
of access roads constructed under the project (against a target of 80 lull) facilitate the
supply of agricultural inputs and they make it easier to market produce, thereby
improving the users' incomes. Although not included in the PAD, many other activities
were organized; for example, income-generating activities h r women leading to the
(temporary) creation of 201 vegetable gardens.

4.23    In terms of output indicators, physical achievements were mostly satisfactory.
Rehabilitation of small irrigation schemes was 11 percent above target, and access roads
were about the same as estimated at appraisal (see Key Performance Indicators, Annex
C). The shortfalls were in water supply schemes. Out of the 40 water supply schemes
planned, only 15 water supply schemes were constructed. These schemes were to be
financed under the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Pro-ject(PAGER). According to
the ICR, this was due to lack of a formal working agreement with PAGER as well as a
failure to reach a consensus on thc criteria for selecting priority schemes.

4.24     The project was to focus especially on women, since their daily tasks made them
the ones most directly involved in natural resource depletion. During Bank supervision
missions, staff repeatedly tried to focus the PMU's attention on women's issues.12
Besides the cultural barriers that prevented women from participating in Development
Committees, making the voices of women heard was more difficult than expected.
Accordingto the PMU, the problem was that no specific component or budget allocation
had been made for the women's intervention, so that it tended to be neglected. One
example with respect to animal husbandry was the preference of women for beehives. In
the Moroccan bureaucracy bees were considered insects, not animals, and therefore no
beehives could be bought under the project. Another example was the purchase of
environmentally friendly gas stoves, which could not be purchased under existing
regulations.

4.25     Nevertheless, the project organized demonstrations of income-generating
activities for women such as vegetable gardening, sewing, weaving and knitting. A
sewing instructor was recruited by one LDA. Six literacy courses were organized for 305
villagers (265 of whom were women) and the Ministry of Health provided 21 days of
health education courses attended by 1,200women. The effectiveness of these courses is
hard to discern, however. The IEG PPAR mission saw sewing machines and knitting gear
lying idle in a newly constructed community center. Three stacks of carpets collected
dust because no system has been put in place to effectively market carpets. Of the 201
vegetable gardens established,the mission was not able to see evidence of a single one,
which makes their sustainabilityunlikely. However,NGOs, such as AADEC, involved
under the project, are continuing to work with communities, especially women.

4.26     Improved land use: Land use was improved through terracing and the planting of
fruit trees. A total of 4,844 m3of terracing walls were constructed (against a target of
1,600).In addition, 1,095ha of fruit trees were actually planted against a target of 900
hectares. The project also organized a demonstrationprogram, including information
field days with audiovisualpresentations and farmer visits to other projects. Despite
delays in preparation of the Agriculture Reference Manual and the Applied Research
Program, the lack of training for the technicians and the difficulty of accessing remote
villages,project targets were exceeded in terms of demonstrations carried out (on 103ha
compared to the targeted 44 ha). The program showed farmers how average yields on
existing crops could be increased substantiallyand introduced new varieties of wheat,
lentils, potatoes and forage. The livestock improvement program effectively
demonstratedthat crossbred animals maintained on improved feeding through forage
diversification and supplementationwith concentrates achieved noticeable gains in
fertility rates and birthweights. No data were available about farmers' uptake of new
technologies.



12Women in mountainous areas of Morocco tend to marry in their teens, which has negative effects on
their school attendance and their health condition because of the large number of children they bear. While
women are responsible for rearing children and attending to the household, they also work as agricultural
labor, herd animals, and weave carpets. Water is not easily accessible and needs to be carried over
distances between one and two hours per day. In addition, firewood and fodder to feed sheep and goats
during winter needs to be collected, and women loaded with stacks of braches, are a common feature in
these areas.

4.27     However, the IEG PPAR mission found farmersknowledgeable about how to trim
fruit trees, and it heard that four years after project closingthere was high production of
apples per tree. Trees could be seen bearing ample fruit. According to some farmers,the
benefits they most appreciated were not the infrastructure investments,but the training
sessions and extension services they received under the project.



 Indicator 3: Improved natural resources management, including increase in vegetative
cover and erosion treatment;this indicator is rated substantial.

4.28     Compared to the appraisal assumptions, physical achievementswere mostly
satisfactory. Implementationof terraces and bunds for erosion control was three times the
appraisal estimate, and fruit tree plantations were 22 percent above the appraisal target.
The survival rate ranged from over 95 percent for olive trees to about 25 percent for
almond and carob trees. According to the ICR, the main shortfalls were in sylvopastoral
land improvement (20 percent of the appraisal estimates for forests and pastures) by
project closing. The IEG mission found, however, that an additional 50 hectares of forest
were planted since project closing that had been prepared under the project. The survival
rate of trees was 100percent and the community was doing a goodjob of keeping sheep
and goats from entering the newly planted forest. This is a sign of successful awareness
raising.

4.29    Relations between forest officials and members of the community clearly
improved. The IEG PPAR mission observed that while forest rangers were welcomed in
the villages that had a project intervention,relations were tense in the village without the
intervention. The problem is that communities fear that once the governmentreplants a
forest, the community loses its customary grazing right on that land. In villages with
project intervention,beneficiariesunderstood that once forests were re-established,
grazing would be allowed once again.

4.30    Despite the low priority given to erosion control measures by the communities in
the first two project years, the project successfully created awareness such that in the last
two to three project years, demand increased and the PAD targets for investments in
erosion control were exceeded. ICR estimates of vegetative cover on sylvopastoral land
in the project area indicate an increase by 4% in the upper part of the watershed, by 16%
in the middle part where gullies and ravines are located, and by 11%in the lower part.
This can be considered as a success, given the extremely harsh conditions of the area and
the erosion of soils in the watershed.

4.31    About 50 gabion structures were constructed to stabilize topsoil and to keep it
from being washed away in heavy rains. The mission visited 18 of them and found that
they were functioninglargely as anticipated. The space behind the gabions was filled
with topsoil that had washed away from upland fields. In some villages, gabions served a
purpose not originally anticipated:they trapped water-borne plastic and other garbage. As
happens often with erosion-control structures,they have become filled, and they will
need to be raised in height if they are to continue to provide protection to the lands below.
Although they have workedjust as they were designed to do, four years after project

completion, these structures have nearly lost their original function, either because no
maintenance system had been put in place to remove garbage, or because they require
additional labor and materials.

4.32     The government's long-term strategy was to reduce silt in the Hassan 1reservoir
through the concerted effort of several pilot projects implemented in parallel and funded
by several different donors. While no statistics are availableto demonstrate any impact
from project soil conservation works, it is clear that the scale of the pilot was way too
small relative to the extent of environmentaldegradation for it ever to have been
measurable.l3 The Hassan I dam had been constructed in 1986for US$180 million. The
initial capacity of the dam was 272 million m3.Accordingto the 2004 National Report on
Water Resources in Morocco, by 2003 the Hassan 1reservoir had lost 24.9 million m3(or
9.2 percent of its volume) and was losing on average 2.5 million m3per year.'4 ~ c t u a l
siltation of the Hassan 1dam was three times the amount estimated.15Although two
priority areas, Ait Abbas and Ouaoula, were part of the project intervention area, no
reduction of siltation at the Hassan 1dam was measured. A more localized erosion
management and monitoring system is needed to monitor actual effects of these activities
on erosion and siltation rates, particularly in the 16,000ha of the Lakhdar watershed
covered by the project. The fact that the gabions trapped all the silt they were capable of
retaining offers important lessons for effective erosion management in the remaining
144,000ha of the watershed (90% of the total area) that lie outside the project area. They
should also be applied.




4.33     In terms of efficiency, project outcome is rated substantial. The cost-benefit
estimation in the PAD and the actual results calculated during the ICR preparation
process demonstratethat the agricultural investments yielded economic benefits that
exceeded what was expected. Most projects that achieve environmental improvements
produce a series of benefits that are quite difficult to quantify. This PPAR identifies a
series of second order benefits, not to criticize the analytic work that went on under the
project, but rather to suggest that the project achievementsare potentially more
significantthan the actual numbers have been able to capture.

4.34      The cost-benefit analysis conducted for the ICR quantified the economic benefits
of increased production of cereals, fodder, olives, fruits, and vegetables. These were the
benefits contemplatedin the PAD. In that document, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR)

was estimated at 17percent over 30 years, with a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$2
million equivalent at an opportunitycost of capital of 10percent. Using the same
working assumptions, the ERR at project completion was found to be 21 percent with a
NPV of US$3.3 million.16

4.35    Additional benefits that accrued from the project include reduced transportation
costs stemming from more and better-sited access roads. The project-built water supply
schemeshave health benefits (includingthe value of work/school days not missed due to
sickness, medical and pharmaceutical costs foregone, and so on) as well as direct
economic benefits stemming from commercial use of the water to produce crops and
artisan foodstuffs and beverages. The terracinglretainingwalls constructedhelp to reduce
siltation, preventing the loss of downstream river and dam water storage capacity-the
cost of such losses, not to mention potential disaster-caused damages associated with
reduced capacity are considerable. In addition, the cost-benefit analysis did not include
livestock revenues which benefited from improved fertility rates and increased
birthweights due to cross-breeding.17Thus, even though the efficiency rating of
substantial would bejustifiable on the ERR results alone, the ex post cost-benefit analysis
excluded important benefits, which are at least worthy of mention.

4.36    The community outreach effort undertaken in this project had a high up-front cost
in terms of staff costs, staff training, staff transport, etc. The longer the extension work
could be implemented (with a concomitant increase in number of families attended) the
lower the perlfamily cost of the operation. In other words, efficiency in staff cost terms
was dependent to some degree on scaling up the pilot operation. It would not be
unreasonable for an economic analysisto consider that having staff trained in
participatory methods, as was the case in this pilot operation, is a positive externality.
Expensive staff training costs would not be incurred in any follow-on operation. But the
up-front costs of the participatory approach to natural resources management selected for
this project proved to be relatively costly in the short term. US$0.8 million were spent to
educate and motivate beneficiaries in natural resources management. Another US$0.8
million was spent on training and equipping government officials. Although almost half
the project costs were spent for social purposes, had the decision been made to scale up
this effort, little of this cost would have had to be made again. Thus, while the efficiency
of this approach is suboptimal due to the abandonmentof the follow-on, the PPAR does
not take this outcome into account in determiningthe overall project efficiency for two
reasons. First, the successful demonstrationthat beneficiary participation can work in
rural Morocco will lead to other similar work in time, and that will produce a
considerableamount of additional economicbenefits. And second, the awareness raising
that has happened in the mountain communitiesregarding the importance of preserving
and restoring natural resources borders on the priceless, and it will also yield positive
economic results in the future.



l 6The main reason for the higher ERR is that the cancellation of U$1.0 million of the loan (proceeds
intended mostly for training) plus the under-disbursement of 20 percent of the loan did not adversely
impact the agricultural development activities carried out under the project and the resulting agricultural
production.
l 7The ICR noted about 490 crossbreds by the closing date, the PPAR was not able to update this number,
although anecdotally it has increased apace.

4.37    The above-described"overlooked" benefits have been stressed in this PPAR
because recent analytic work on the water sector highlights the need for increased
environmentally focused work within the context of water projects, and because more
work needs to be done Bank-wide in estimatingthe economic benefits of such work. The
approach adopted in this project was abandoned because results were slow to appear and,
in the absence of painstaking quantification of the actual benefits, the project's
achievements were widely seen to be expensive. In an increasingly water-stressedworld,
and especially in a country where most of the dams that are affordable to build already
exist, making the most environmentallyefficient use of the water that falls from the sky is
critical.

OUTCOME THE LWMPP
            OF

4.38    The outcome of the LWMPP is rated as satisfactory (Table 2). The project
successfully pilot tested approachesto improve land use and natural resource
management in mountainous areas of Morocco. This pilot project demonstratedthat
communities in Morocco's mountain areas are willing to adopt soil conservation
measures if they receive compensation-in     this case infrastructureand training in return.
However, adoption may have been wider if public awareness had been pursued more
actively, and whatever the reduction in silt transported to the Hassan 1dam downstream
might have been, it has not been measured. Anecdotally, localized changes in erosion and
sedimentationwere described by project staff and some villagers.

Overall Proiect Outcome                                      Satisfactorv



4.39    The project's objective was highly relevant given the enormous challenges facing
farmers in the mountainous areas of the Lakhdar watershed. Project objectives were also
relevant to the 1997CAS, since watershed management projects were included in that
document, as were improvements in environmental and natural resources management. It
also supported other key CAS objectives, and a review of the 2001 and 2005 CASs,
which succeeded the 1997document, reveals that the issues dealt with in the LWMPP
were of even greater relevance to the more recent documents.

4.40    With respect to its efficacy,the project increased living standards for poor
communities in harsh climatic conditions. It also achieved better protection against soil
erosion by involving communities in protecting newly planted trees, terracing, and other
soil conservation measures. There were moderate shortcomings in the way the project's
financial viability was measured, in its results monitoring system, and in its inclusion of
women in the decision-makingprocess. Given that this was a pilot project, the lack of a
monitoring system to track results hampered learning as well as potential replicating or
scaling up of the approach.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

4.41     The risk to development outcome is evaluated as significant for the following
reasons:

    The project demonstrated that participatory approaches can increase living standards
    of Morocco's rural poor. It also demonstrated that awareness can be raised about
    natural resources management and that communities' relations with government
    officials trying to preserve the environment can be improved through such
    approaches. However, although this project demonstrated that the approach can work,
     for the involved authorities with relevant decision-making authority, it proved too
     expensive to be replicated in other areas. The government and the donor community
     did not invest further in participatory natural resources management and moved to
     approaches, such as improving marketing of products by involving the private sector.
     Therefore, despite high hopes in the local ministry and among beneficiaries, the
    participatory approach to natural resources management as tested by this pilot project
     was not scaled up.

     PMU staff trained in participatory approaches are not able to use their acquired skills
    because of a lack of follow-on projects. They went back to their originating agencies
    or moved to other cities.

    Project beneficiaries do not expand gabion structures when and as needed. Therefore,
    while gabions may have trapped sediment and reduced run-off for a few years, any
    future stream of benefits stemming from these structures is unlikely.

    There is a risk that at least some of the infrastructure provided under the project may
    have a detrimental effect on natural resources management. The 2007 IEG Evaluation
    Brief on Development Actions and the Rising Incidence of Disasters showed that
    without adequate attention to extreme weather events during design, roads may
     increase run-off, siltation and even deforestation (which was actually observed by the
    PPAR missi~n).'~       A 2008 study conducted by the Water Sector Board voices similar
    concerns when it states that expansion of the road network can have as great an
     impact on watersheds as farming or herding. Road construction removes vegetation,
    leaving the area susceptible to surface erosion.l9 The purchase of sheep and cattle
    may further reduce vegetative cover on hillside^.^' And the use of terraces for the
    plantation of forest and fruit trees may have an unintended effect on water availability
    further downstream.

20 According to the IEG 2004 PPAR on Turkey, the relationship between livestock pressure and erosion
and water in such dryland areas is usually extremely complex. [...] While the decline in livestock pressure
may result over time in vegetation cover improvements, it is also possible that, at least for an interim
period, lack of livestock pressure may be a cause of either slower recovery or further deterioration. (This
would be due to lack of sometimes beneficial soil disturbance by animal hooves and due to accumulation of
smothering uneaten dry material.)

4.42    Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

4.43    Quality at entry is rated as moderately satisfactow by IEG. No QAG review was
undertaken for this project.

4.44    The Bank was responsive to the Borrower's need for assistance and fielded two
major multidisciplinary missions between identification and appraisal. It mobilized a
PHRD grant to finance project preparation and consultancies, and simultaneously to
jump-start staff training, DDP planning and basic research to help identify target
communities and feasible project activities.

4.45    The participatory approach taken to natural resources and rural development was
relevant for the mountainous areas of Morocco. However, project design should have
included a specific component to involve women, since they play an important role in
natural resource preservation (especially considering that their daily chores include
cutting down trees for firewood, herding their animals on degraded hills, etc.). Including
a subcomponent to explicitly address women's needs and awareness levels could have
had many positive impacts: facilitating the creation of appropriate administrative
structures, and making a lasting difference in the way women's issues are dealt with by
the administration, for example.

4.46    The same is true for monitoring and evaluation. According to project reports,
creating a component/disbursement category for monitoring and evaluation would have
forced project staff to focus more on monitoring and evaluation.

4.47    Quality of supervision is rated as satisfactow: Bank supervision is considered
satisfactory despite the succession of three task team leaders during the project's
implementation period. Nine Bank supervision missions were fielded, including one
which undertook a comprehensive mid-term review in 2002.

4.48    The missions correctly identified the major implementation issues and risks,
including organizational issues faced by the PMU. In addition, the missions raised
technical issues related to formulating sound DDPs, by requiring PMU staff to include
economic and financial evaluations in DDPs. Another issue, which was raised in detailed
supervision mission reports, was the need to organize self-evaluation meetings with the
communities and to implement a monitoring and evaluation system using proper outcome
and performance indicators. Furthermore, supervision missions focused PMU staff
repeatedly on including women's needs in the DDPs and on organizing events for
awareness raising and skill building.

4.49    Overall, Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory.

4.50    Government performance is rated satisfactow. Government's strong support for
the intensive planning and pre-project training activities was evident throughout the
project preparation period. Despite a number of organizational changes as well as
transfers of key project staff, the High Commission for Water, Forests and for Fighting
Desertification (HCWF) and Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries
(MARDF) supported the project well at critical moments. HCWF made scarce staff
available to the project to replace those who had left the project.

4.51    Initially proposed for five years, project duration was reduced to four years at the
Government's request. Though mitigated in part by an extension, this time-frame proved
insufficient to fully strengthen local institutional capacities and significantly measure
project impact in terms of vegetative cover and land degradation.

4.52    Implementing agency performance is rated satisfactory. The project allowed
younger staff in the administration to prove themselves, and helped in their career
development. During project implementation, extension agents lived closely with
communities. During meetings with the PMU team and extension agents, project staff
stressed repeatedly that they were proud of project achievements. It is certainly the case
that, given the training and experience project staff received under the project, they can
also be seen as project beneficiaries. Difficulties occurred, however, during the
implementation process.

4.53    The project PMU was set up with a unit head, four subject-matter specialists and
six extension agents. The PMU head changed three times during project implementation;
the four extension agents left and had to be replaced. An administrative and accounting
unit was also set up but was staffed with only one accounting officer. Thus, problems
occurred when administrative procedures the project had to follow proved complicated
and beyond the responsible person's experience. Another difficulty occurred with the
coordinating agencies, which were not used to working together. While a Provincial
Coordinating Committee was established to ensure coordination between the various
rural development activities in the province and in the project area, this agency met less
often than planned.

4.54    In addition, the project did not succeed in setting up an effective M&E system.
This prevented the PMU from efficiently managing time, resources and project data, and
from taking appropriate and timely action. This shortcoming was compensated for in
large part by staff commitment and hard work, as well as by field observations, feedback
and technical advice provided by Bank supervision missions.

5. Monitoring and Evaluation

5.1     Overall monitoring and evaluation is rated as modest.

5.2     M&E Design: The LWMPP did not set up an effective monitoring and evaluation
system. This was partly a design issue due to the fact that M&E was not an explicit
component of this project. Since the LWMPP was a pilot project, an M&E with well-
defined output and outcome indicators would have been useful. In the performance
measurement framework, output indicators have been well defined. Outcome indicators
in the LWMPP, however, were less capable of measuring progress toward the
achievement of the objective. Measuring income and expenditure levels of the local
population, as well as sedimentation levels in the Hassan 1dam, vegetation cover, and
soil erosion would have facilitated capturing project results.

5.3     M&E Implementation:No comprehensive M&E program was implemented.
There was anecdotal data, field observations and feedback from farmers encountered
during site visits. The lack of systematic quantitative data collection was somewhat
mediated by qualitative assessments, however. Additionally, the project conducted
background research for 26 DDPs, which provide valuable baseline information.
Indicators provided in the PAD were tracked on an annual basis. Supervision missions
focused the attention of PMU staff on improving the M&E system in every mission since
2000. Overall, PMU staff produced some 70 studies, including detailed socio-economic
beneficiary assessments. Participatory self-evaluation meetings were organized at the end
of each year to assess progress with implementation, and a study was undertaken, which
assesses and compares 15 similar project interventions in rural development in Morocco.
Among the projects assessed is the LWMPP. Despite the absence of an all-inclusive
monitoring and evaluation framework and in the absence of any beneficiary survey at the
end of the project, the project experience was ultimately captured in a myriad of ways.

5.4     M&E Utilization:Sincethere was no formal M&E data to use, piecemeal
information and informed staff "hunches" have guided staff actions. A better quantitative
M&E system would have probably helped to focus the PMU's attention on achieving
results more expeditiously--work planning was an issue that supervision reports bring up
repeatedly. However, meetings with beneficiaries and the collecting of output indicators
compensated to some extent for the lack of M&E.



SAFEGUARDS,FIDUCIARYCOMPLIANCE, UNINTENDEDOUTCOMES
                                           AND

5.5     The 1999Lakhdar Watershed Management Pilot Project, the LWMPP was
classified as Category "B" in terms of environmental screening as well, which was
appropriate given Morocco's and the Bank's environmental guidelines. No safeguard
issues occurred during implementation.

6. Conclusions and Lessons

6.1     This project largely achieved objectivesthat were highly relevant in 1995,and the
importance of those objectives has increased dramatically from the perspective of 2009.
The inability of one of the most ambitious networks of dams ever created to provide
sustainablewater supplies to a water-stressedcountry dramatically highlights the
importance of environmental restoration, especially given today's awareness of climate
change.

6.2     It is widely accepted that restoring the environment cannot be done without the
involvementof those that are destroying it. That is what this project achieved, after a
fraught start-up period. The project also demonstratedthat participatory approaches can
increase the living standards of Morocco's rural poor. And it proved that awareness can
be raised about natural resources management to the degree that farmers are moved to
action.

6.3     For the moment, the borrower and the Bank seem to have decided that the project
approach is not cost effective. Despite high hopes in the local ministry and among
beneficiaries, the participatory approachto natural resources management has not been
scaled up. The government and the Bank did not invest further in participatory natural
resources management and moved to other strategic approaches, such as improving
marketing of agricultural products through private sector involvement. This report argues
that this decision was short-sighted,but that without a more careful analysis of benefits
(see para 4.39, the cost effectivenessof the LWMPP approach cannot be well
determined.

6.4     The cost-benefit analysis did not considerthat preventing the dam system from
filling with silt is an extremely valuable benefit. It did not quantify the additional benefits
of forests that slow run-off after torrential rains, gabions that build fertile and well-
watered agricultural land where none had existed before, access roads that (potentially)
channel water to where it is needed and prevent it from taking more damaging routes, or
even the value of off-farm income-generatingactivities promoted under the project. The
only benefits considered in the relatively high ERR were benefits from agricultural
investments. Had all investments been included,the ERR would have been even higher.

6.5     The question this PPAR feels compelledto raise is: what other alternative to
villager involvement can improve the fragile environment in the high Atlas mountains?
There may be no other feasible approach to the work that was begun by this project.
Almost by definition, the poorer the members of a community, the lower the levels of its
leaders' technical skills and formal education. Consequently,Bank projects need to be
ready to address skills deficits (whateverthey may be) when they work with villagers. At
the outset it is likelyto be costly. Bank projects that leave infrastructure behind in poor
communities cannot assume that putting hardware into place is a contribution to
sustainabledevelopment in the absence of a functioning social structure to support it.
Projects aiming at restoring degraded environmentsneed to be able to work effectively
with poor communities until they are ready to become involved in effective change.

6.6     The Bank and its borrowers need to develop the skills they need to work with
poor communities on environmentalrestoration and to adapt to climate change. There is
no evidence that smaller, more agile organizations do this task consistentlywell. Each
pilot develops a few champions. A major challenge is to identify champions and to use
them as extension agents during scaling up. This practice, and using visits to successful
project sites, lowers costs and speeds implementation. This report concludes that further
efforts at involving farm families in soil and water conservation and environmental
restoration are warranted, and that they will ultimately prove to be cost-effective.

6.7     Lessons from the LWMPP were the following:

    Communities need to see results early. The LWMPP approach depended on active
    community involvement,but was able to deliver goods and services only after a long
    period of time. Establishing credibility with farmers long accustomed to empty
    promises requires that tangible rewards for their efforts commence as soon as
    practicable following those efforts.

    Projects with beneficiary involvement generally take a while to build up momentum.
    Designing activities to be implementedby beneficiaries using a participatory
    approach takes considerabletime. Start-up should be expected to be slow, and
    allowances made during design for a realistic implementation period.

   Successful pilot efforts that are abandoned dampen expectations and make
   subsequent development efforts harder topromote. Pilot projects create high
    expectations. In this case, there is no alternative: reforestation, soil stabilization,and
    runoff control will need to take place in the high Atlas mountains. Farmers were
    expecting to build on the successful experience of the LWMPP, and not building on
   the momentum created will make it far harder to generate farmer enthusiasm the next
   time around.

   Projects need to take gender patterns of work into account. Promoting natural
   resources management with men when women collect firewood and herd the cattle is
   inefficient, to say the least. Careful targeting of the gender whose activities are most
   likely to cause natural resource degradation greatly increases the potential impact of
   consciousness-raisingefforts. Even where there are deep-rootedtraditions of
   excluding women from traditional community decision-making processes, outreach
   campaigns can make use of women trainers, market days, etc.

   In aproject with substantial environmental objectives, and often complex efficacy and
   efficiency treatment trade-offs, it is important to measure at least local environmental
   impacts. This data may later be modeled into broader environmental impacts as
   treatment coverage spreads.

   Actively including NGOs inparticipatory projects can increase sustainability of
   project activities. This is especially true if NGOs continue project activities after the
   project closes, as was the case in the LWMPP.

Local authorities need to be involved in sub-project planningji-om the start.
Otherwise the project will create parallel structures to the local government that
weakens the government rather than strengthening it.

A good Monitoring and Evaluation system is always important, but it is a mustfor
pilotprojects. Projects which may be replicated at a larger scale require a
comprehensive and effective M&E system with timely, meaningful and easily
quantifiable outcome and performance indicators to guide efficient implementation
and deployment of resources. M&E measurements and findings should be transparent
and made available for use to all the parties involved, including the communities
which are affected by project decisions and actions.

1.         Experimentation, Trials and  The mission visited a laboratory equipped under the
           Standards Unit / Service     WRMP to test irrigation pipes and tubes imported to
           des ExpCrimentations, des    Morocco or produced in Morocco. Pipes are being put
           Essais et de la              under pressure to test their resilience. Elaborate systems
           Normalisation                were constructed to test the effectiveness of the material for
                                        drip irrigation. Morocco has a new program for drip
                                        irrigation in which farmers receive a subsidy of 60 % if
                                        they invest in drip irrigation. All material being subsidized
                                        has to be tested in this Rabat agency.

           Souss Massa RBA              Meeting with five employees of the Agency. Presentation
                                        of research and report on measures to recharge the Souss
                                        aquifer artificially. Under the WRMP, a mathematical
                                        model was developed for the Souss aquifer. It helped
                                        document the alarming yearly decline of the water table by
                                        between 1.5 and 3 meters. In response to this decline, nine
                                        weirs were constructed or improved (five of them financed
                                        under the WRMP) to artificially recharge the aquifer. The
                                        mission visited two of the weirs (see below).


           Aoulouz Dam                  The dam built in 1991, has a storage capacity of 100
                                        million m3.It was constructed to mitigate flooding and to
                                        store irrigation water for years of drought. Water from the
                                        reservoir irrigates citrus fruit and vegetable plantations
                                        further downstream. Water is released from the dam 3-4
                                        times per year in order to artificially recharge the aquifer.
                                        The date for the release is negotiated with farmer
                                        associations. When the mission visited the dam, a release
                                        had been scheduled, but was postponed because it rained.
                                        The study of the WRMP found that artificially recharging
                                        the aquifer is effective only within 80 kilometers of the
                                        dam. This is why the private sector now financed a pipe
                                        transferring water directly to the citrus plantations of Sebt-
                                        Guerdane, more than 100 kilometers from the reservoir.

4.     Talekjount Weir            Built in 2005 on an effluent of Oued Souss. Three layers of
                                  concrete quarters block the river and force the water to
                                  infiltrate the aquifer. The weir was designed to modify the
                                  path of the river and improve the aquifer recharge in lower-
                                  lying areas. The mission noticed sediment accumulated
                                  upstream of the weir, reducing its effectiveness. Officials
                                  discussed the idea of involving farmers in silt removal
                                  because it contains a high level of nutrients. However, as of
                                  2008, no maintenance action has taken place.


5.     Freija Amont Weir          Weir on the Oued Souss, renovated under the WRMP. The
                                  4 m high dam has been completely filled with silt and
                                  bushes, which reduces the effectiveness of the weir.
                                  Maintenance of the weir was not visible.

       Information system         Modern computer network was partly funded by the WB
                                  WRMP. It is composed of two systems. The first is for
                                  management (accountability, logistics, HR, and user fees)
                                  and the second for technical information and decision
                                  making. With the help of this Oracle software, water
                                  allocations can be based on actually available water
                                  resources. The mission noticed a number of staff using the
                                  system for updating information on surface and
                                  groundwater levels.


8.     Laboratory                 The mission visited the office laboratory stocked with new
                                  equipment (a UV-Visible Spectrometer, an Avanta I:Atomic
                                  Absorption Spectrometer, and a distillator) under the
                                  WRMP. The three-room lab was well equipped for
                                  chemical, physical and biological analyses. On-site
                                  measurement devices were also available. Three old kits
                                  procured under the WRMP were stored away, while five
                                  newer ones seemed to be in use.


9.     Irrigation mitigation work The mission visited the rehabilitation of a flood evacuation
                                  channel crossing the city to prevent future floods. The
                                  section visited was 800 m long, about 2 m deep and about 4
                                  m wide. The site was identified as a black spot by the
                                  flooding study funded by the WB under the WRMP. As a
                                  result of this study, flood protection works were undertaken
                                  with the agency's own funds. The agency not only
                                  addressed flooding in the city, but it protected hillsides with
                                  check dams and gabion structure to prevent torrential rains
                                  from damaging topsoil and causing flooding further
                                  downstream.


10.    Meteorological station     Simple station equipped with a pluviometer, a flow meter,

                                      35                                            Annex D


                               and a water level meter. The station was under the
                               surveillance of a ward living on-site.


11.   Illegal drilling site    The mission noticed a drilling station in the fields. Officials
                               from the basin office asked to see the driller's permission.
                               Since no such document was issued, the basin officers
                               exercised their role of policing against illegal drilling, and
                               the drilling was stopped. It was to be taken up again only
                               after the acquisition of a permit, which the agency had to
                               issue.

      Provincial Agriculture   Meeting with staff from the implementing agency under the
      Direction Office         LWMPP (extension agents, coordinators). The NGO
                               (AADEC) provides continuous support for the local
                               population, building on the achievements of the LWMPP.
                               AADEC provides some continuity, and makes project
                               achievements sustainable.


      Rural community of Ait   The mission met with seven members of Bernat's and
      M'Hamed                  Amzray's villages. These two villages benefited from the
                               LWMPP. They appreciated the new species of fruit trees
                               planted (apple production multiplied by five), the
                               improvements of the irrigation system, and the access roads
                               built. The mission visited 14 gabion structures to prevent
                               erosion and saw 50 hectares of forest replanted. Tree
                               planting had a 100percent success rate. Replanting forest
                               was one of the project outcomes, even if not funded under
                               the LWMPP. The community was sensitized not to enter
                               the forest, and the forest department was motivated to plant
                               trees in order to prevent soil erosion in the watershed.


      Rural Community of Ait   The mission visited three villages with seven members of
      Bououli - Douar          the village association, a forest officer and a local
      Association of Asamer    government official. It saw the improvement of the
                               irrigation system, three gabion structures, the water storage
                               tank, and a spring, which was framed by a concrete
                               structure.


      Rural Community of Ait   The mission met with about 10representatives of the
      Bououli - Douar          village. Villagers had participated in the initial screening
      Association of Aarous    process for the project, but decided that they did not want to
                               participate. Therefore, no infrastructure construction or
                               awareness raising took place in this village. While villagers
                               were aware of the environmental degradation in the hills,
                               they did not want forest to be planted there, because of their
                               customary right to have their animals graze in the hills. The

                                     mission also visited the local irrigation system of earthen
                                     channels and dams. A dam to store and deviate the
                                     irrigation water had been destroyed a few days earlier by
                                     floods. The whole system from the dam to the channels was
                                     poorly designed and materials used were prone to large
                                     water losses through seepage.

18.        ORMVA water and soil lab  Large and very well equipped lab for water and soil quality
                                     monitoring. The lab currently undertakes a study on soil
                                     parameters for more than 2,500 farmers to optimize the
                                     fertilizer use and gather data to feed into the information
                                     system. Two staff work full time and three have been hired
                                     for this particular mission. The farmers pay for this test.
                                     The WRMP bought 25 lab devices (verified by the mission)
                                     as well as chemicals. Most of the equipment is being used
                                     on a regular basis and well maintained.


19.        Laboratoire du Systbme    A database collects information from about 500 stations for
           &Information              water quality monitoring and about 200 for soil analysis.
           GCographique et de        Parameters on salinity, water table, boreholes, etc. are
           TkICdetection Spaciale    regularly updated. This database is being analyzed to
                                     produce regular reports for monitoring and decision
                                     making. In addition, satellite images are used to assess
                                     concrete structure in the irrigation perimeter. A law has
                                     been issued to prevent new construction in the perimeter.
                                     This GIs tool based on satellite imagery provides
