Among the lessons cited were these: 1) Local\n            community organizations must emerge and, to be viable, must\n            evolve into legal entities with some level of financial\n            autonomy. Their promotion should therefore be part of the\n            project thrusts. 2)Participation requires implementing\n            agencies staff to be trained, organized and able to explain\n            the project's objective and implementation mechanisms\n            to all the stakeholders, gain their confidence and establish\n            partnerships. Frequent staff turnover should be avoided. 3)\n            Partnerships with specialized nongovernmental organizations\n            and micro-credit agencies afford good chances for providing\n            the necessary technical and financial support for project\n            activities. 4) Early involvement and support of regional and\n            local authorities is a key to success. 5) Communities are\n            willing to participate when they see tangible benefits and\n            the possibility of generating added income from project\n            activities. Project staff should therefore put emphasis on\n            the need for natural resource conservation and management as\n            a condition for sustainable development and growth. 6)\n            Participatory projects experience slow disbursements during\n            the first year or two because of their slow take-off. They\n            subsequently have low levels of disbursements because of the\n            small size of most community investments; the limited\n            implementation capacity of emerging community organizations;\n            and the scarcity of consulting firms and enterprises to work\n            on small projects in remote rural areas.7) Land tenure\n            issues affect participant's incentives and can\n            seriously hamper implementation of any rural development project."}, "docdt": "2005-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
