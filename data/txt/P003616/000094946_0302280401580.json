The following lessons were drawn\n            from the project. A thorough geological survey for future\n            operations is suggested to be conducted, given the lower\n            reservoir instability, and excessive local ground settlement\n            in the upper reservoir, occurrences unforeseen which delayed\n            work progress. In addition, the selection of suppliers,\n            should be carefully planned, followed by a rigorous quality\n            control to avoid potential failures in high voltage\n            transformers; such assessment should be followed by\n            subsequent shop inspections during construction, and\n            installation. Nonetheless, the appropriately defined terms\n            of reference for consultants, particularly short-term\n            consultants, proved successful, which paved the way for\n            highly relevant services."}, "docdt": "2002-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
