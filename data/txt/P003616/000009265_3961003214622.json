the project are\n            to:  (a) alleviate an acute shortage of peaking power and\n            enable more efficient use of power plants in a predominantly\n            coal-fired thermal power system by transferring off-peak\n            energy to peak energy with construction of the\n            cost-effective and environmentally sound Tianhuangping\n            pumped-storage hydroelectric plant and associated\n            facilities; (b) support economic reform and provide an\n            enabling environment for attracting foreign investments and\n            promoting private sector development by improving the\n            quality of the power supply and enhancing socioeconomic\n            conditions in the densely populated East China region; (c)\n            improve load management and promote energy conservation by\n            introducing appropriate power pricing; (d) support\n            institutional development of the beneficiary by\n            strengthening its organization through an advanced\n            management and staff training program; (e) contribute to the\n            development of an improved power utility regulatory\n            framework; (f) assist in transferring new power technologies\n            for what will be the largest pumped-storage hydroelectric\n            plant in China, and in applying modern power system\n            operation optimization methods; and (g) extend technical\n            assitance in project design and implementation, and in\n            promoting prudent financial management. The project consists\n            of:  (i) construction of a pumped-storage hydroelectric\n            power plant together with upper and lower reservoirs, a\n            water conveyance system, an underground powerhouse, and a\n            switchyard; (ii) provision and installation of six 300-MW\n            reversible pump-turbine units and associated equipment;\n            (iii) erection of 500-kV transmission lines and\n            reinforcement of the existing power transmission network;\n            (iv) construction management and engineering services; (iv)\n            studies of optimal power plant operation and its output\n            pricing; and (v) strengthening of the beneficiary's\n            organization through the provision of technical assistance\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1993-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
