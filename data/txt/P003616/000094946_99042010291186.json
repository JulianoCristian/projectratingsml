During construction and\n            operation, to mitigate the effect of noise pollution, low\n            noise machines should be used and high noise facilities must\n            not be utilized at night. Main operating equipment should\n            meet sound requirements to reduce impact of noise. A closed\n            insulation screen will be installed and trees and flowers\n            will be planted to absorb noise. Dust will be reduced by\n            spraying water to earth piled up, or covering it with\n            fabric. Wastewater sewage will be treated with precipitating\n            tank and used in irrigation. Some trees will be cut down for\n            building substations, entrance, and exit roads. They will be\n            planted in other spots to balance the ecological\n            environment. To maintain agricultural ecology, destroyed\n            vegetation will be recovered immediately after construction."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
