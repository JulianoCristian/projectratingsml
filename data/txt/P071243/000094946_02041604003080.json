modest\n            institutional development impacts. Given the current\n            political situation in Peru - a new government faced with a\n            divided Congress - it is still too early to anticipate\n            long-term lessons from the project, despite a beneficial\n            participation, and project coordination (including the\n            mobilization of additional resources, and real increases in\n            efficiency, and sustainability of reforms). Therefore,\n            implementation of the project's social reforms will\n            have to overcome resistance of diverse interest groups, and\n            be heavily dependent on the leadership provided by the\n            Government; not so much so on the role of the Bank, whose\n            ability to promote national consensus may be limited.\n            Moreover, the start-up costs are likely to be particularly\n            high, but such costs should be viewed rather as an\n            investment, where governments, and international donors\n            supporting social programs, should be prepared for a lengthy\n            gestation period, willing to accept the uncertainties\n            involved. In such a context, the project appears to be an\n            instrument well adapted to the situation"}, "docdt": "2002-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
