the output of graduates; b) improve\n            equitable access (gender, location, and socio-economic); and\n            c) improve the quality of the teaching-learning process and\n            the relevance of the curriculum. There are three project\n            components. The first component finances activities to\n            support overall policy and system reform and development,\n            including new regulatory, fiscal, and accountability\n            frameworks; new pedagogical teaching methods and programs;\n            the use of information, communication, and technology in the\n            delivery and teaching of higher education; an accreditation\n            system; new or alternative sources of funding; and a\n            HIV/AIDS prevention and support program for students. The\n            second component focuses on institutional development and\n            investments, improving efficiency, academic and pedagogical\n            quality, research, and the scope of service delivery of\n            specific institutions. The third component will, on a pilot\n            basis before expanding nationally, initiate the introduction\n            and operation of a publicly run and publicly financed\n            scholarship scheme that will provide financial assistance,\n            student outreach, and academic advisory services."}, "docdt": "2002-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
