Project\n            will raise agricultural production in selected rainfed\n            areas. This will be done through: (a) investing in\n            small-scale irrigation and other productive investments; (b)\n            transferring both new and existing agricultural technologies\n            through private sector extension; (c) reducing costs of soil\n            erosion; and (d) strengthening the capacity of the executing\n            agency. The project is targeted at small farmers in the ten\n            states, chiefly in semiarid and temperate zones, with\n            rainfall less than 1,000 mm annually and where moisture\n            deficit is the main constraint to productivity. The\n            operation will have three components: (a) rural investment;\n            (b) agricultural technology transfer; and (c) institutional\n            development and training."}, "docdt": "1994-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
