While the project contributed\n            to increase the agricultural productivity in selected\n            rainfed areas, not all instruments foreseen in the\n            achievement of project objectives, were used in a balanced\n            way, thus having a negative impact in the extent of project\n            development impact. Several lessons are drawn from the\n            project. The absence of adequate technical assistance (TA)\n            for infrastructure outputs failed to support development\n            objectives, for although adequate infrastructure may be\n            enough to promote expansion of irrigation, and an increase\n            in crop yields, it does not induce changes in crop patterns,\n            and production. Not only should project design have included\n            safeguards against low demand for TA, but elements such as\n            macroeconomics, in accord with private financial support,\n            should complement on-farm investments, and technical\n            assistance. Furthermore, a comprehensive operational\n            framework should have been enforced, to ensure coordination\n            among components, particularly in light of two implementing\n            agencies controlling different components. Project\n            experience acknowledges the importance of performance\n            indicators, beneficiary participation in project design, and\n            assessment of commitments, particularly in meeting\n            counterpart funds requirements under macroeconomic instability."}, "docdt": "2000-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
