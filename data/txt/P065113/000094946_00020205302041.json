sectors, will be introduced. There are\n            two main components: 1) The protection of basic social\n            services, comprises selected on-going programs in the\n            Education, and Social Welfare Departments, largely\n            benefiting the poor. Quality improvement of basic education\n            include the provision of textbooks, and teacher manuals,\n            complemented by teacher training assistance. In addition,\n            construction, repair, and, maintenance of classrooms will be\n            implemented, and, needed equipment - desks and chairs - will\n            be supplied. Social assistance for disadvantaged groups,\n            will be provided through: a) the Comprehensive Integrated\n            Delivery of Social Services, who will provide basic needs\n            through a demand-driven approach, targeting the poorest\n            municipalities; b) the Maintenance and Operation of Centers\n            and Institutions, will focus on orphanages and centers for\n            the handicapped; while, c) the Assistance Program for\n            Distressed and Disadvantaged Populations will include\n            programs for special groups. 2) An integrated technical\n            assistance package will strengthen management capacity, and\n            information systems, developing appropriate systems, and\n            providing on-the-job training capabilities."}, "docdt": "2000-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
