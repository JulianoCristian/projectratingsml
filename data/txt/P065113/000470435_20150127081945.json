In 1998, spending on\n            education\u0097textbooks, classroom desks and chairs for\n            students, and training programs for teachers\u0097dwindled to a\n            new low. The Department of Health spent only 25 percent of\n            its budget on drugs and medicine. These developments led to\n            a serious deterioration in the quality and accessibility of\n            basic social services. The World Bank-funded Social\n            Expenditure Management Project, approved in 2000, supported\n            the government\u0092s provision of basic social services to the\n            poorest parts of the country. About 375,000 families in\n            3,700 villages have been assisted through the program. The\n            loan also helped to maintain and operate centers,\n            institutions and programs for distressed and disadvantaged\n            groups, serving about 33,000 children; 9,000 adolescents;\n            40,000 women; and 5,000 persons with disabilities."}, "docdt": "2002-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
