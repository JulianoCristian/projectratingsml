lessons about\n            the key elements for the success of a reform program. These\n            include: (1) Shared vision of institutional reforms and high\n            level commitment and strong ownership of reforms among key\n            policy makers: There was strong commitment from management\n            of the implementation agencies and ownership for the reforms\n            within the departments. This permeated to the lower levels\n            of  the department - a sign that change management was\n            taking place. (2) Strong inter-agency cooperation: Strong\n            cooperation between the oversight agencies and the\n            implementing department also helped in the success of the\n            project. Prior to project implementation, there were some\n            signs of distrust among the line departments and the\n            oversight agencies. Working together during the project\n            implementation through a joint steering committee helped\n            create an  understanding of the various constraints faced by\n            the various agencies in performing their tasks. Regular\n            meetings to discuss and solve these problems led to a\n            stronger cooperation between these agencies. It in turn\n            helped the oversight agencies identify champions for\n            government-wide reform. (3) Alignment of objectives of the\n            project with the goals of the agencies involved: In 1999,\n            the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) which is\n            responsible for managing the budget, public sector\n            compensation policy and organizational  management was\n            initiating a government-wide public expenditure management\n            improvement program at the time the project design was\n            developed. At the same time, the Commission on Audit (COA)\n            which issues accounting rules and regulation in addition to\n            conducting financial audit was beginning to conduct value\n            for money audits and working with civil society groups on\n            participatory audits. The focus of these two agencies  were\n            improvements in financial management and reporting,\n            increased accountability and efficiency in  budget\n            execution, and improved public sector performance in all\n            government agencies and departments were clearly aligned\n            with the objective of the project. (4) Civil society and\n            community involvement: Civil society and community\n            involvement through the joint monitoring of the school\n            building program, the increased role of Parent\n            Teacher's Community Associations (PTCAs) in the\n            rehabilitation of schools, the civil society monitoring of\n            the delivery of textbooks was crucial in improving civil\n            society opinions about the government processes. Prior to\n            the project, allegations of graft and corruption in\n            procurement in the social sectors had created a sense of\n            distrust among civil society. Another important lesson\n            learned is that institutional reform is a long term process\n            and needs to be accompanied by change management."}, "docdt": "2004-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
