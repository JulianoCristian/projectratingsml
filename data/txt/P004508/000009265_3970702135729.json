"The proposed project would help recovery\n            by: providing the agricultural sector with seasonal\n            production and investment credit which has been in\n            increasingly short supply in recent years; establishing an\n            appropriate institutional and policy framework to promote\n            development of a financially sound rural credit system; and\n            strengthening the capacity of rural credit institutions to\n            mobilize rural savings and improve the efficiency of farm\n            credit operations. The project would also help increase the\n            effectiveness of CB policies with regard to rural financial\n            market development. Specifically, the project would provide\n            funds for:  (a) short- and longer-term credit for the\n            agricultural sector; (b) policy-related studies and\n            preparation of a future project; and (c) training of\n            project-related staff and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
