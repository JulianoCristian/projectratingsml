strengthening of the Ministry of Health\n            (MOH) to provide restructuring of the MOH services, training\n            workshops and seminars for staff at all levels, health\n            center reconstruction and MOH office rehabilitation works,\n            furniture and medical equipment. Reforms aimed at management\n            and financial autonomy for the main hospitals of Malabo and\n            Bata are to be initiated in collaboration with French aid.\n            (ii) Health strategy development and implementation\n            establishing a management information system and a health\n            planning unit in MOH. (iii) Human resource development to\n            train health sector personnel and improve MOH's\n            technical and management capacity at all levels of the\n            health system. (iv) Strengthening of priority health\n            programs to improve MOH's operational capabilities and\n            testing of new approaches to health care delivery by\n            strengthening field work in malaria control, mother and\n            child health and family planning, sexually transmitted\n            diseases, and by providing essential generic drugs, with a\n            special focus on most vulnerable groups. The project\n            finances the rehabilitation of four rural health centers in\n            the remote rural districts of Micomiseng and Acurenam;\n            equipment for the mother and child and family clinics in\n            Malabo and Bata, and supplies of essential medical materials\n            and drugs to all these facilities.
