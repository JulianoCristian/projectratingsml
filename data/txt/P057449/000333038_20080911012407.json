follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  the process of\n            altering the structure and functioning of the public\n            administration to ultimately increase the efficacy,\n            efficiency, and transparency of the state is, by nature, an\n            arduous and long-term process. In this context, it is\n            important to fully capitalize on windows of opportunity for\n            drastic change and to 'keep going' during periods\n            when only incremental and gradual change is feasible. As\n            demonstrated by Argentina's experience since the\n            crisis, public sector modernization can also be tackled\n            gradually, in strategically chosen areas that build upon and\n            scale up early results. This implies an incremental approach\n            that envisages public sector modernization as a series of\n            carefully sequenced and targeted series of steps, seizing\n            windows of opportunity in those areas where government\n            ownership is high. The project's implementation was\n            severely affected by the unstable macroeconomic conditions\n            that prevailed in the late 1990s and eventually resulted in\n            the country's collapse in December 2001. By keeping the\n            operation alive in the aftermath of the crisis, the Bank\n            succeeded in maintaining modernization efforts on the public\n            agenda, although actual progress was initially very slow."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
