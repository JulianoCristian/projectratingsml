Following the economic crisis in 2002-2003,\n            the new administration has opted for an approach of\n            \"strategic incrementals\" in its efforts to improve\n            governance and public sector performance. This approach is\n            based on the promotion of \"islands of innovation\"\n            that provide replicable examples for the undertaking of\n            effective governance reforms. In this context, the\n            Government and the Bank agreed to a series of Action Plans\n            (for CY2004 and CY2005-2006) in order to implement the State\n            Modernization Project, thus reflecting this new incremental\n            strategy and improve overall project implementation. The\n            proposed amendment would also provide for the introduction\n            of a new component, fully consistent with the revised\n            Project Development Objective of the Loan, which consists of\n            the initiation of the second phase of the Social and Fiscal\n            National Identification System (SINTyS) program, supported\n            under an APL operation the first phase, and successfully\n            implemented under Loan 4459-AR. The proposed amendment\n            complies with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and it\n            is thus recommended to approve amending the loan agreement\n            in accordance with the terms of this document."}, "docdt": "2005-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
