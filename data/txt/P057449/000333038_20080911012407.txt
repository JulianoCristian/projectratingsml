F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

 The objective of the project is to urgently assist the Government of Argentina to contain the disruption in
 the country's social and economic infrastructure that would be caused by the failure of critical central
 government systems to process dates properly after December 31, 1999.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

 First Amendment (June 27, 2000)
 A new PDO is included: "to assist the Borrower in designing a program to modernize the public sector in
 Argentina, both at the national and provincial levels".

 Second Amendment (July 3, 2001)
 The new PDO is (a) to assist the Borrower, on an urgent basis, to prevent or minimize the disruption in
 the Borrower's social and economic infrastructure that would be caused by the failure of critical central
 government systems to process data properly after December 31, 1999 due to the Year 2000 (Y2K)
 problem; (b) to assist the Borrower in designing and implementing a program to modernize the non-
 financial public sector in Argentina at the federal level; and (c) to strengthen the institutional capacity at
 the Borrower's provincial level.

 Third Amendment (December 14, 2005)
 The objective of the Project is to implement the Borrower's strategy to strengthen public sector
 management tools to improve transparency, and civil society participation as well as increase the
 efficiency and quality of management in selected areas of public services.

some of the Key Performance Indicators were not operationalized, for which they were left open to multiple interpretations.
In addition, no baselines or targets were defined at the time for any of the Key Performance Indicators; thus, it cannot be
clearly determined whether the outcome was achieved or not. The assessment of achievement presented above reflects the
progress made in achieving the intermediate output targets under the various components.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

In the early 1990s, Argentina undertook a comprehensive program of structural adjustment and
public sector reform, breaking with decades of interventionist economic and import substitution
policies which had resulted in stagnation, hyper-inflation, and an inefficient and non-transparent
public sector. Major steps were taken to significantly reduce the size of the public sector and to
adjust its role in the economy, including a massive privatization of public enterprises, market
deregulation, decentralization of responsibility for service delivery to provincial governments,
downsizing of the public sector labor force, and the development of key management tools at the
national level, including financial management, auditing and internal controls. In addition,
considerable investments in information and communication technologies (ICTs) were made in key
government agencies, such as the tax and customs services, the central bank, and the pension
administration. As a result, Argentina's public sector became increasingly reliant on computer
systems, with most administrative and service provision functions depending on information systems
for their regular operation, for example in tax collection, pension administration, banking regulation
and supervision, public sector payrolls and the operation of water, energy, telecommunications, train
and other public services among many others.

The high reliance on computer systems generated serious concerns in Argentina and elsewhere about
the capacity of the software and chips used in computerized systems to properly handle dates after
December 31, 1999--the so-called "Y2K problem". Although the magnitude of the potential threat
was difficult to asses, it was considered to be potentially severe. The Government of Argentina
(GoA) adopted a proactive approach to review and reprogram affected systems. Given the urgency of
the task, the Government requested the Bank's support to contain the potential disruption that could
affect the country's social and economic infrastructure.

Argentina's deteriorating macroeconomic conditions made it particularly important to avert potential
disruptions in economic growth and social order that could result from Y2K-related systemic
problems and failures. Faced with an external environment characterized by high international
interest rates, low commodity prices, adverse realignment of other currencies, and a declining
confidence and limited access to international financial markets, the country's economic growth had
dropped sharply between 1997 and 1998. Moreover, the pace and intensity of economic reform had
waned during the latter part of the 1990s, resulting in a noticeable deterioration of the fiscal
accounts. After almost a decade under the leadership of President Carlos Menem, presidential
elections were scheduled for 1999, generating uncertainty in the political arena.

In response to the GoA's request, the Bank prepared the Year 2000 (Y2K) Technical Assistance
Loan, which was approved on December 17, 1998 and became effective on July 30, 1999. With
US$30.3 million in Bank financing, it supported an overall US$43.3 million project (including
counterpart funds) that sought to contain the disruption in the country's social and economic
infrastructure that would have been caused by the failure of critical central government systems to
transition into the new millennium.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The original Project Development Objective was to assist the Government of Argentina (GoA) to
urgently contain the disruption in the country's social and economic infrastructure that would be
caused by the failure of critical central government systems to process dates properly after December
31, 1999. 90



                                                   1

The key performance indicators were:
    · The estimate of the economic and social damage avoided; and
    · The number of identified critical functions able to continue operations with minimal
        disruption through June 2001 as a result of the proposed remediation.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

A. First Amendment (June 27, 2000): The Board of Executive Directors approved on a no-
objections basis an Amendment to the loan agreement authorizing the use of up to $1.2 million of the
uncommitted loan resources to support the design of a program aimed at modernizing Argentina's
public sector. This amendment was approved with the understanding that Board approval would be
sought for a Second Amendment to reprogram the remaining loan proceeds according to the newly
designed state modernization strategy. No closing date extensions were envisaged at that point.

Revised PDO: An additional PDO (PDO2) was added "to assist the Borrower in designing a
program to modernize the public sector in Argentina, both at the national and provincial levels."

Key Performance Indicators: These were not amended despite the addition of the new PDO.

Reasons and Justification: The reasons and justification for such amendment included:
    Roughly $27.8 million remained uncommitted once the Y2K transition was completed without
    any significant disruptions.
    An unanticipated result of the Y2K-related actions was the identification of serious problems in
    public sector administration (including human resources, financial management, and information
    technology) leading to poor service delivery and lack of transparency. The recently inaugurated
    administration of President Fernando de la Rua targeted state modernization as a critical national
    priority. A decree issued on January 17, 2000 created the State Modernization Secretariat under
    the Vice President of Argentina, highlighting the high priority being given to this initiative.
    The GoA requested Bank assistance for the design and implementation of a comprehensive state
    modernization strategy. The launch of a public sector reform effort early in the administration's
    tenure was deemed important by the Bank, given its high relevance to overall structural reform
    and the possibility to take advantage of the political window of opportunity provided to the new
    national administration. Such a public sector reform program could also support the attainment
    of targets in the Government's IMF-supported economic program.
    The project's restructuring was considered a superior alternative vis-à-vis the preparation of a
    new operation given available board slots and the fact that Argentina's internal administrative
    procedures for the approval of new operations were time-consuming, which could have resulted
    in costly delays and postpone access to needed resources. To assure the highest project quality
    the project's restructuring was conceived in two stages to be reviewed by the Board: the first one
    authorizing preparation of the new public sector reform strategy (i.e. First Amendment) and the
    second one authorizing the implementation of such strategy, provided that the fully prepared
    component and consequent amendment of the loan agreement were deemed satisfactory (i.e.
    Second Amendment). This two-stage approached was aimed at providing the Borrower and the
    Bank--including Board members--ample opportunity to consider the proposed use of loan funds.

B. Second Amendment (July 3, 2001): The Board approved on a no-objection basis a Second
Amendment authorizing the use of the remaining uncommitted loan proceeds (US$26.6 million) to
support the implementation of the comprehensive public sector reform program designed under the
First Amendment. In addition, the name of the project was changed to "State Modernization Project"




                                                  2

to reflect the revised focus of the project. The closing date was extended from December 31, 2001 to
December 31, 2003.4

Revised PDOs: PDO2 was modified and an additional PDO (PDO3) was included. The amended
PDOs read as follows: (i) to assist the Borrower on an urgent basis to prevent or minimize the
disruption in the Borrower's social and economic infrastructure that would be caused by the failure
of critical central government systems to process data properly after December 31, 1999 due to the
Y2K Problem; (ii) to assist the Borrower in designing and implementing a program to modernize the
non-financial public sector in Argentina both at the national and provincial levels; and (iii) to
strengthen the institutional capacity at the Borrower's provincial level.

Key Performance Indicators: The following Impact/Outcome Indicators were identified to reflect the
impact of the operation with respect to the revised PDOs:
    · Tax revenue increased by 0.25 percent of GDP annually in 2002, 2003, and 2004 over year
         2000 baseline;
    · Average period between retirement and receipt of social security payments reduced by 50
         percent by the end of 2003;
    · Education Ministry restructured by the end of 2002;
    · New procurement system functioning by mid-2003;
    · Personnel register covering all central government employees functioning by mid-2003;
    · At least 15 agencies operating by 2003 at levels of performance agreed with Chief of
         Cabinet Office under Annual Performance Agreements and Citizens' Charter Program.

Reasons and Justification: In accordance with the two-stage reprogramming strategy outlined and
approved by the Board under the First Amendment, the Second Amendment reprogrammed the
project to support the implementation of a public sector modernization program that was reportedly a
high priority for the GoA. Given the importance and complexity of the reprogramming, an annex
was prepared in the format of a regular Project Appraisal Document (PAD) to facilitate the review of
the new state modernization components by Bank management and the Board.

C. Third Amendment (December 14, 2005): The Board approved on a no-objections basis a Third
Amendment that revised the project's public sector modernization strategy to reflect the more
incremental approach adopted by the new national authorities after the 2001-2002 crisis. In addition,
the Third Amendment authorized the reallocation of US$8 million to support the continuing
implementation of the Social and Fiscal National Identification System (SINTyS) program (see Box
1 for an overview of SINTyS). The remaining uncommitted funds (US$1 million) remained
unallocated at the Government's request.

         Box 1. Overview of Argentina's Social and Fiscal National Identification System (SINTyS)
 Argentina's Social and Fiscal National Identification System (Sistema de Identificación Nacional Tributario y
 Social - SINTyS) was created in 1998 to foster the systematic exchange of fiscal and social information
 across databases at the national, provincial and municipal levels of government. Through the development
 of a shared information exchange network, SINTyS will support the real-time, online exchange and
 crosschecking of fiscal and social information between the databases of individual agencies. The
 development of SINTyS received the Bank's support under an Adaptable Program Loan (APL No. 4459-AR),
 which was approved in April 1999.

 The implementation of SINTyS was conceived in three stages: Demonstration, Expansion, and
 Consolidation. Phase I ­ Demonstration effectively demonstrated the overall feasibility of the SINTyS'
 concept and the potential transparency, efficiency and financial gains resulting from the systematic


4   Closing dates were subsequently extended three additional times, to December 2004, December 2006, and December
2007, respectively.

 exchange of information across government agencies. This phase was supported under Loan 4459-AR
 (US$10 million), which closed on 31 December 2005. Phase II ­ Expansion envisions SINTyS' further
 expansion as additional government agencies at the national and sub-national level are incorporated into the
 system. Finally, Phase III ­ Consolidation will focus on ensuring SINTyS' permanent institutionalization
 within Argentina's public sector.

 SINTyS is guided by the following operating principles: i) every institution owns its information, and is
 responsible for its life-cycle management and for defining the access rights to its information; ii) SINTyS is a
 broker of information in that it provides the normative, organizational framework for the stewardship of the
 methods and mechanisms for information interchange among the participating agencies; and iii) SINTyS will
 ensure that participating agencies regulate access to information.


Revised PDOs: Previous PDOs were replaced by a single, overarching PDO: to implement the
Borrower's strategy to strengthen public sector management tools to improve transparency and civil
society participation as well as increase the efficiency and quality of management in selected areas of
public services.

Key Performance indicators: A new set of Impact/Outcome Indicators was defined under the Third
Amendment (see Annexes 1 and 1-A, Implementation Letter, Third Amendment to the Loan
Agreement):

    · Assessments of internal and external performances and the users' perception indicate a
        substantial improvement of public management and service delivery in selected areas.
    · Access to information and reporting on operation in selected areas is substantially improved.
    · The use of e-government tools is expanding throughout the national public administration
        (NPA).
    · The new procurement system is operating throughout the NPA.
    · Improvements of human resources management are in operation throughout the NPA.
    · Common consistent processes in place for registering people, legal entities and assets.
    · People and legal entities identified with a single, unique key.
    · Availability of information on family relationships.
    · Availability of information for eligibility for social services and fiscal obligations.

Reasons and Justification: The rationale underlying this amendment was as follows:
    Of the US$30.3 million of the original loan proceeds, only US$10.2 million had been disbursed
    by end 2004, resulting in roughly $20.1 million uncommitted loan proceeds.
    Slow disbursements and poor project performance between 2002 and 2004 were attributed
    mainly to the impact of the 2001-2002 crisis rather than to lack of interest in public sector
    modernization. In fact, the new authorities had manifested their interest in public sector
    modernization and had managed to make modest progress in the implementation of some project
    components despite the severe fiscal constraints that ensued in the aftermath of the 2001-2002
    crisis. The authorities, however, privileged an incremental strategy focusing on the
    modernization of selected agencies and key management tools rather than the comprehensive
    reform program envisioned under the Second Amendment. Due to its reduced scope and the
    impact generated by the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, the implementation costs of this
    incremental modernization strategy were estimated at US$11.1 million, resulting in roughly
    US$9 million uncommitted loan proceeds.
    The limited resources under the 2004-2005 CAS envelope, including under the Bank's internal
    work program agreement, resulted in strong competition for IBRD financing among alternative
    projects. Thus, rather than canceling the remaining US$9 million, the Bank team opted for
    introducing a new component to support the continuing implementation of the SINTyS program,
    which was consistent with the revised PDO of strengthening public sector management tools.
    The first stage in the implementation of SINTyS (Phase I ­ Demonstration) had been


                                                       4

     successfully implemented under an APL operation (Loan 4459-AR). While the Bank and GoA
     had placed a high priority on the implementation of the Phase II ­ Expansion, resources were not
     available to finance its implementation, either through government financing or under the US$2
     billion CAS envelope, which was fully committed. Thus, including the implementation of the
     initial stages of Phase II of SINTyS as a new component under Loan 4423-AR served to
     overcome the financial bottleneck existing at the time.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project's target beneficiaries at appraisal were the citizens receiving benefits from selected
national agencies as well as civil servants and other government employees. As secondary
beneficiaries the project identified the private sector and the sub-national public administrations.
These beneficiaries remained largely unchanged under the various amendments.

implementation of the new management model in three key agencies (i.e. ANSES, AFIP and the Ministry of
Education), consolidating the systemic reforms supported under Component E.

at the provincial level through the Federal Council on Public Administration (Consejo Federal de la Función
Pública - CFFP),
Third Amendment (December 14, 2005)

Project components were revised as follows:

D - Streamlining the Macro-Structure of the National Government: This component was cancelled, as the
new administration's strategy toward public sector modernization focused on an incremental approach rather
than on the comprehensive approach that was reflected by the Second Amendment.

H - Social and Fiscal National Identification System (SINTyS) ­ Phase II (US$ 8 million): This component
was added to support the first stages of implementation of SINTyS' Phase II (Expansion), aimed at
consolidating the achievements made during Phase I (Demonstration) as well as strengthening formal exchange
mechanisms and expanding its coverage, mainly at the provincial level.


1.7 Other significant changes
As detailed earlier, the project changed dramatically over its life span. Through three amendments to
the original loan agreement, all of which were approved by the Board of Directors, changes were
introduced to the project's PDOs and its title, individual components were both added and
eliminated, loan resources were reallocated to support changing priorities, and even self-standing
operations (i.e. SINTyS) were merged into this operation. Four closing date extensions resulted in an
overall project life span of over nine years, from the original closing date of December 2001 to
December 2003, December 2004, December 2006 and December 2007, respectively (see Table 3 ­
Timeline of Events).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Quality at Entry (QAE): Moderately Unsatisfactory. This ICR considers the operation's overall
QAE rating to be Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating summarizes the QAE not only of the
original project design but that of each of the three amendments as well. Individual ratings for
quality at entry are discussed below:

Original Project Design: Moderately Satisfactory. The project provided support to a problem that, at
the time, was considered to be relevant and deserving urgent attention. The Bank reacted quickly,
preparing an operation in only five months (the first Bank mission took place in May 1998 and
negotiations were conducted in November of the same year). As shown on Table 2, the proposed
operation was also consistent with the 1997-2000 CAS. The Bank team designed an intervention
strategy that effectively incorporated key elements of the strategies that were being developed by the
most advanced economies, including: (i) the need to identify and prioritize critical systems; (ii) the
decentralized elaboration of diagnoses; (iii) a phased approach to mitigating possible damages; (iv)
the development of awareness campaigns to promote precautionary measures; and (v) the need to
establish contingency provisions, as an up-front assessment of the problem dimension was almost
impossible. However, the unpredictable, intangible nature of the Y2K problem resulted in: i) an
overly flexible approach; ii) a weak M&E framework; and iii) the over-dimensioning of the
operation. In addition, substantial risks were largely underestimated, such as the very limited
authority of the Project Implementation Unit and the limitations of the proposed decentralized
implementation model in which individual agencies were responsible for the actual implementation
of preventive and remedial measures.

                                                               enhancing governance (i.e. 2004-2005 CAS
                                                               Objective iii).

First Amendment: Moderately Satisfactory. As shown on Table 2, by supporting a newly opened
window of opportunity for state modernization efforts, the First Amendment directly supported the
1997-2000 CAS objective of improving the performance and institutional capacity of government
(CAS Objective ii). The strategy to amend an existing operation rather than preparing a new one
allowed the Bank to react swiftly to capitalize on a newly open window of opportunity to promote
public sector reform, which, in turn, was expected to help the GoA attain the targets under the
economic program agreed upon with the IMF. It also gave the Bank the opportunity to provide
support to the incoming de la Rua administration in its efforts to address deteriorating
macroeconomic conditions. The two-stage reprogramming strategy put forward under the First
Amendment provided the opportunity for the Bank to assess the soundness of the modernization
program to be prepared although, of course, it resulted in less scrutiny and quality control that
normal project identification procedures would have produced.

Second Amendment: Unsatisfactory. The state modernization program presented under the Second
Amendment was the result of full-fledged project preparation efforts. Given the importance and
complexity of the reprogramming that was being proposed under this amendment--which was
indeed equivalent to the preparation of a new operation--an annex was prepared in the format of a
regular Project Appraisal Document (PAD). This annex reflected an internally consistent technical
design that supported a comprehensive state modernization program through well-developed project
components and activities and results framework. Likewise, as shown on Table 2, by supporting state
modernization efforts, the proposed amendment directly supported the 2001-2004 CAS objective of
improving the performance of the state (CAS Objective ii). However, the Bank team failed to
properly assess two key risks: limited political support and the impact of unfavorable
macroeconomic conditions, which made the implementation of such an ambitious and
comprehensive state modernization program highly unlikely at that time. In this regard, it is



                                                         7

important to note that Argentina's Vice President, who was the political champion behind the state
reform agenda, resigned in October 2000, just three months after the First Amendment was
introduced. Strong political support was a condition sine qua non for the feasibility of such reform
program and, after the departure of its main proponent, the proposed state modernization agenda was
doomed to failure regardless of its technical soundness. In addition, macroeconomic and political
conditions were deteriorating rapidly, thus creating an environment that was not conducive to the
implementation of a comprehensive modernization agenda. This deterioration must have been
apparent by July 2000, when the Second Amendment was approved and fully obvious by mid-
December, when it was finally signed by the GoA, just days before the country's collapse.

Third Amendment: Moderately Satisfactory. By providing continuing support for modernization
efforts, with an added emphasis on promoting the systematic exchange of information between
agencies at the three levels of government, the Third Amendment directly supported the 2004-2005
CAS objective of enhancing governance (CAS Objective iii).

    State Modernization Components: As mentioned earlier, this amendment sought to align the
operation's formal framework (i.e. PDOs, project components and financial needs) with the state
modernization strategy that had guided project implementation--albeit implicitly--from 2003
onward, after the Kirchner administration took office. In response to the new authorities' interest in
revitalizing the project, the Bank team had worked closely with the Chief of Cabinet in the
evaluation of the strengths, weaknesses and lessons learned under the implementation of the
preceding sector modernization strategy and in the development of a revised modernization strategy
to reflect the priorities of the new administration. The revised strategy adopted a less ambitious
approach, favoring an incremental implementation strategy that focused on the implementation of
horizontal reforms to enhance transparency, accountability and service delivery. Also, as discussed
below, the overall modernization strategy lacked focus, dispersing resources among an excessively
large number of initiatives and government agencies. The Results Framework was modified in line
with the newly adopted strategy. However, some of the Key Outcome Indicators were too vague and
no baselines or targets were defined at the time of the amendment. While a large number of
indicators were identified for each of the components, the emphasis was on outputs and activities. As
a result, the overall Result Framework was not conducive to measuring the impact of the operation.
    SINTyS Component: A thorough effort went into the preparation of Component H, including an
assessment of SINTyS' feasibility based on the implementation results of Phase I ­ Demonstration,
an assessment of readiness to enter Phase II ­ Expansion, and the design of the implementation
strategy of such phase, in particular SINTyS' expansion at the provincial level. Project components
and activities were designed to fully support the implementation of Phase II, together with a
supporting Results Framework. In addition, a detailed OP was developed for the period 2005-2006.
No baselines or targets were defined for the Key Outcome Indicators, which weakened their ability
to measure the operations' impact. Although the PDOs of the state modernization program and
SINTyS were internally consistent, the addition of Component H was an add-on to the operation.
Component H maintained full independence during its implementation, including its own
implementation arrangements, an independent Project Coordination Unit under the National Council
for Coordination of Social Policies (Consejo Nacional de Políticas Sociales ­ CNPS), as well as a
different Bank supervision team. These implementation arrangements were undoubtedly the best
alternative, given that the two areas of intervention were self-standing as a result of their history and
institutional insertion. Moreover, there was no intention on the part of authorities to merge them into
a single umbrella.

2.2      Implementation

The implementation of this operation offers a good illustration of "marginal incrementalism."                        7

Rather than responding to the ideal "rational" model, in which project goals and objectives are
clearly defined ex-ante and supported by individual components, a robust monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) framework, and a well-defined implementation strategy, this operation was the result of
successive adjustments made over time to respond to the changing priorities of the successive
administrations and the challenges posed by a particularly difficult implementation environment. In
addition, several factors, both within and outside the Government's control, negatively affected
project implementation, including a highly unfavorable macroeconomic and political environment,
uneven political support, overly ambitious PDOs, and uneven implementation capacity.                              The
situation was reversed after 2003, which allowed for renewed momentum in project implementation
as well as for substantial project achievements.

Factors outside the Control of the Government or Implementing Agency

Political and macroeconomic instability: While it can be argued whether the country's unstable
political and macroeconomic environment in the late 1990s was beyond or subject to the control of
the government, it is clear that it was a highly negative factor affecting implementation. Unstable
macroeconomic conditions overshadowed other priorities of the politically weak de la Rua
administration, such as state modernization. In addition, tight budgetary conditions resulted in
reduced allocation of counterpart funds, which slowed down project implementation during 2000 and
2001. The economy finally collapsed in December 2001, unleashing one of the deepest economic,
institutional and political crises affecting the country in its recent history. In 2001 and 2002, output
collapsed by 20 percent, poverty reached above 57 percent of the population, and unemployment
reached 24 percent, with huge job losses in both the formal and informal sectors. Key social
indicators, such as infant mortality, also deteriorated substantially for the first time in 30 years. Not
surprisingly, the crisis also affected the project, bringing it to a stall for almost two years due to the
need to address other urgent priorities, severe shortage of counterpart funds, rapid turnover of senior
public officials (the Chief of Cabinet and key staff changed three times in less than six months) and
rapid turnover of PIU staff.


Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

Changing government priorities and uneven political support: During the lifespan of the project,
there were significant differences in the prevailing views toward state modernization. The Menem
administration (1989-1999) had implemented a drastic public sector reform aimed at reducing the
role of the public sector in the economy and downsizing the national government. In this context,
the Y2K TAL was aimed at addressing the specific Y2K problem rather than at tackling
inefficiencies in the country's ITC systems. Alternatively, the de la Rua administration (1989-2001)
adopted a state modernization strategy aimed at reinventing government. Under the political
leadership of the Vice President, the new state modernization strategy that was supported under the
First and Second Amendments aimed to overhaul Argentina's public sector in a comprehensive
manner. Political support for this ambitious state modernization program virtually vanished after the
Vice President resigned in protest against a corruption scandal in October 2000. The economic,
political and social upheaval that ensued in the aftermath of the country's collapse in December 2001
created an impasse in the modernization efforts until the end of 2003. Although clearly not its top
priority vis-à-vis addressing the urgent social needs that had emerged after the crisis, the incoming
Kirchner administration (2003-2007) revived the state modernization efforts. While maintaining
many of the core lines of action, it significantly scaled down the scope of the previous strategy,
focusing on a more incremental approach that prioritized areas where ownership existed and could
contribute to generate demonstration effects elsewhere. This revised strategy was formally
incorporated in the operation through the Third Amendment.8



8   The recently approved follow-up operation--State Modernization II Project--also maintains the same core lines
of action.


                                                         10

Delays in political decision-making: Slow political decision-making and cumbersome administrative
procedures resulted in extended periods of inactivity and contributed to the slowing down of project
execution. For example, in 1999, the lack of authorization from the Chief of Cabinet's Office to
disburse loan proceeds impeded the implementation of many rescue and remediation projects
(generating a disbursement lag of 84 percent).9 Delays in the enactment of laws and the passage and
adoption of decrees, norms and administrative resolutions also slowed down implementation,
affecting the timely achievement of key results--this was the case, for instance, in the enactment of
the digital signature legislation and the norms and regulations of the E-procurement Law. Likewise,
the time that elapsed between the Board's and the GoA's approval of each of the three amendments
generated serious obstacles. As an illustration, the Third Amendment was not signed into
effectiveness by the GoA for five months after Board approval. This delay prevented SINTYS from
setting in motion a $6.0 million international bidding process, which introduced significant delays in
the implementation timetable and eventually required extending once again the project's closing
date. These delays were, at least partially, the result of insufficient political support from top national
authorities.

Unfocused state modernization efforts: As mentioned earlier, there was a serious mismatch between
the ambitious scope of the state modernization program developed under the de la Rua
administration and the political support it mustered, particularly from mid-2000 onward. In addition,
the modernization program--and the project itself--suffered from excessive dispersion due to the
large number of areas of intervention and participating agencies. As a result, the project supported
many highly specific interventions that had only a limited impact and that could not be replicated in
other institutions rather than focusing on key horizontal tools, systems and methodologies with a
potentially wide impact across many institutions. Some examples of isolated actions are the
digitalization efforts in the Ministry of Justice, the design of a physical assets management system
under the leadership of the Chief of Cabinet's Office, and the development of the Education Cost
Observatories.

SINTyS Component: As mentioned earlier, the decision to include the SINTyS program in this
project was based on the lack of available financing under the 2004-2005 CAS to support the
continuing implementation of SINTyS, which was considered a priority both for the GoA and the
Bank. While the decision to include SINTyS in this operation succeeded in overcoming the financial
bottleneck, it offered only a partial solution to the Government's needs. Specifically, the delays in
preparing, approving and declaring the amendment effective generated important disruptions in the
execution of the SINTyS program. In turn, the delays in the implementation of SINTyS also affected
negatively the implementation of this operation, by requiring a fourth extension to the closing date.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control

Uneven implementation capacity: The Borrower's implementation capacity was at times weak,
particularly during the initial stages of implementation. Specifically, the original Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) and its technical support arm (the so-called Y2K Executing Unit ­
Y2KEU) lacked the necessary authority to effectively implement a project of such innovative and
complex nature. The Y2KEU was only responsible for establishing the regulatory framework and
technical guidelines to assist national public agencies on Y2K issues. The responsibility for
implementing preventive and remedial measures remained with individual government agencies. The
weak technical and institutional capacity of many government agencies became a serious bottleneck
in project implementation, resulting in an extremely difficult and slow implementation process and
an inability to effectively address the needs of individual agencies.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The design of the operation's M&E system exhibited significant weaknesses for the original project
design as well as subsequent amendments. While some of the original shortcomings were overcome
during implementation, particularly in relation to the achievement of project outputs and
implementation progress, the weaknesses in the operation's M&E design poses additional challenges
to the evaluation of the operation's impact.

(a) M&E Design:
     Original Project: As mentioned earlier, the inability to identify at the outset which systems
would require adaptation to deal with the Y2K transition imposed serious difficulties to the design of
an effective M&E system at appraisal. It was anticipated that each subproject implementation plan
would include a set of monitoring indicators to assess impact.
     First and Second Amendments: The Second Amendment included a fully developed Results
Framework that distinguished between outcome and output indicators. However, of the five impact
indicators that were proposed, only one (i.e. period between retirement and receipt of first social
security payment reduced by 50 percent by 2003) was truly impact-oriented. The remaining ones
were more output-oriented and had less capacity to capture actual impact (i.e., Education Ministry
restructured by end 2002; procurement system functioning by mid-2003; register for central
government employees functioning by mid-2003) or insufficiently isolated the impact of the project
(i.e. annual tax increases of 0.25 percent of GDP).
     Third Amendment: The modification of the state modernization program and the addition of the
SINTyS component were supported with a new Results Framework. However, some of the Key
Performance Indicators were not clearly identified as needed at the operational level, leaving them
open to multiple interpretations. In addition, no baselines or targets were defined at the time for any
of the Key Outcome Indicators, making ex-post evaluation more difficult. As in the case of the M&E
for the Second Amendment, the M&E system overly emphasized broadly defined outputs (i.e. ten
strategic plans being implemented) rather than their impact.

(b) M&E Implementation: During implementation, particularly from 2004 onward, M&E was
supported by the preparation of detailed operational plans that established specific results for
individual project activities as well as progress indicators to monitor project implementation on a
semi-annual basis. Information on key project outputs was regularly collected as part of the Bank's
supervision efforts, which proved to be very helpful in tracking project progress in each of the areas.
Data collection relied heavily on meetings and reports by different counterparts as well as the
elaboration of special reports by the PIU, which, in turn, utilized data reported by the different
agencies and/or offices. From 2005 onward, particular attention was given to M&E, with intensive
discussions between the Bank and the counterparts on a greater results-focus of the loan, the
identification and tracking of new indicators, and an enhanced monitoring of each of the areas under
the loan, as well as project management. From 2006, this included further M&E and the assessment
of the project's progress and impact as part of the preparation activities of the new operation.

(c) M&E Utilization: In some cases, the data collected to generate project indicators was not
integrated into the operations and management of individual government agencies. In many cases,
participating agencies developed spreadsheets to comply with Bank project supervision requirements
that were however not sufficiently used in their own decision-making processes. Having identified
this weakness, both the Bank team and the PIU were extremely careful in designing the Results and
Monitoring framework for the follow-up operation with a greater emphasis on results and a results-
culture, focusing on strengthening existing M&E systems and integrating them with the ones of
individual government agencies.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: No safeguard policies were triggered by the Project.

Financial Management: Audits were conducted every year by Argentina's highest auditing
institution, the General Auditing Office (Auditoría General de la Nación - AGN). Auditors' opinions
were unqualified for the management of the Special Account throughout the life of the loan.
Although some observations were made in relation to the management of the Project's Accounts,
they referred mainly to inconsistencies in accounting criteria and did not point to any substantive
issues.

Financial management performance was rated Satisfactory by the Bank's supervision team. As
mentioned earlier, the lack of timely counterpart funds affected project implementation before,
during, and after the 2001-2002 crisis. This issue went beyond this particular operation and affected
the entire Bank portfolio. While this shortcoming was largely addressed from 2003 onward, the lack
of timely counterpart funds was also observed in 2007, when the loan proceeds were used to
temporarily finance the local share of project expenditures. In addition, the Borrower failed to submit
all the necessary expenditure documentation before the end of the original grace period.

Procurement: There were no significant deviations from the Bank's standard procurement procedures
throughout the life of the loan. A persistent difficulty, however, was the high reliance on individual
consultants, which amounted to more than 400 in June 2005. The large number of individual
consultants, which were dispersed across different ministries and agencies, resulted in a large PIU as
well as overly complex management and supervision procedures. In 2006, a plan was implemented
that reduced the number of individual consultants working in state modernization activities by 40
percent, of which 88 percent were converted into permanent public sector positions. An independent
assessment was carried out by an international management consulting firm in 2007 to examine the
selection, performance, and supervision of consultants and no irregularities were found (except for a
few minor formal areas for improvement). On this basis, for this loan as well as for the follow-up
loan, an agreement was reached and a plan developed to improve the selection, performance and
supervision of consultants, enhance training and knowledge transfer to government employees, and
ensure greater project sustainability. This agreement was later replicated in other Bank loans.
Likewise, efforts to reduce the number of individual consultants have been undertaken under
SINTyS, including financing an increasingly larger share of individual consultants with counterpart
funds.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Two follow-up operations will continue to support the PDO of this operation. Specifically, the State
Modernization II Project (Loan No. 7449-AR) was approved in May 2007 and declared effective in
February 2008. The State Modernization II Loan provides continuous support to most of the public
sector management areas under this loan and has been designed on the basis of its lessons learned. It
has received an overall Quality at Entry Assessment rating of Satisfactory by the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG).10 The Bank is also currently preparing the second and third phases of SINTyS' APL
(Loan No. 4459-AR) to provide support for SINTyS' consolidation and institutionalization. In this
regard, it is important to note that in early 2006, the State Modernization Directorate was created for
the management of the State Modernization Loan, signaling the heightened importance of the state
modernization agenda and an effort towards the institutionalization of the project. Likewise, in
December 2007, SINTyS Project Unit was transformed into a National Directorate, signaling the



10   QAG Assessment Date: 09/06/2007. The assessment focused on quality at entry, which was rated as Satisfactory
and also focused on the quality of the technical assistance/training design, which was ranked as Highly Satisfactory.



                                                              13

importance being assigned to it by national authorities and its increasing insertion within Argentina's
public sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project's objectives continue to be fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
in Argentina. Specifically, by supporting the implementation of the GoA's strategy to strengthen
public sector management tools to improve transparency and civil society participation as well as
increase the efficiency and quality of management in selected areas, the project fully supports the
2006-2008 CAS objective of enhancing governance.11

The modernization efforts supported under this operation also continue to be a top priority of
Argentinean authorities, as denoted by their request for continuing Bank assistance under two
follow-up operations: the Second State Modernization Project (Loan No. 7449-AR) that was
approved in May 2007, and the Second SINTyS Project that has already been negotiated and
submitted to the Board for its approval.

3.2.       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Prior to tackling the project's assessment, it is important to underscore the difficulties and
complexities of evaluating the impact of an operation that has undergone several drastic changes and
is, as a result, quite convoluted. The Harmonized Evaluation Criteria for ICR and IEG Evaluations
and the new ICR guidelines issued in August 2006 explicitly address the challenge of assessing the
outcome of projects with formally revised objectives. In line with these ICR guidelines, the Overall
Project Performance for this operation is a weighted average of achievements against both the
original and revised project objectives. Specifically, the project's specifics are being assessed
against the following PDOs: i) original PDO; ii) the consolidated PDOs of both the First and Second
Amendment, as the two amendments are part of the same two-pronged project restructuring strategy;
and iii) the PDOs for the Third Amendment. All but one of the components that were introduced
under the Second Amendment continued throughout the life of the project. These components are
discussed under the Third Amendment, since the corresponding outcomes reflect the changes in the
overall modernization strategy that was formally adopted under the Third Amendment.12 Figure 1
illustrates the methodology being utilized for the overall project assessment, showing under which
period the various components are being evaluated. It should be highlighted that the complexity of
this particular project evaluation is compounded not only by the three amendments, but also by the
broad PDOs and the outcome rather than outcomes indicators agreed as well, made even more
challenging by the difficulty of assessing project progress in the context of a very difficult operating
environment in the country.




11   The 2005-2006 CAS support three main pillars: i) sustained economic growth with equity; ii) social
inclusion; and iii) governance (Report No.: 34015-AR, May 4, 2006).
12   It is important to note that, in some cases, specific outcomes were agreed under the 2004-2005 Operational Plan and
that substantial implementation progress took place during those years.

Original PDO ­ Moderately Satisfactory

To assist urgently the Borrower to prevent or minimize the disruption in the Borrower's social and
economic infrastructure that could be caused by the failure of critical central government systems
to process data properly after December 31, 1999 due to the so-called "Y2K Problem."

Argentina's social and economic infrastructure was not disrupted when the country transitioned into
the new millennium. Disruptions in the central government were minimal and Argentina by and
large was untouched by the Y2K threat.

It could be argued that the smooth Y2K transition was the result of the GoA's proactive actions and
the support it received under this operation, including the 127 remediation action plans that were
formulated under the project. However, several factors suggest that the operation may have had a
more modest role:

     As mentioned above, the project's original design lacked a robust Results Framework and there
     was no systematic follow-up of the project's key performance indicators.
     Project disbursements were very limited. Only US$2.5 million were disbursed for Y2K
     activities, of which US$2.2 million were for prevention and support activities; no disbursements
     were done for remediation activities.
     As of December 21, 1999, just days before the Y2K transition, the operation was rated
     Unsatisfactory, both in terms of its PDO achievement and its implementation.




                                                                 15

     The fact that countries where very little was spent on tackling the Y2K threat (like Italy and
     Korea) fared just as well as those who spent a lot (the UK and the US) has generated debate on
     whether the absence of computer failures was the result of the preparation undertaken or whether
     the significance of the problem had been overstated.

First and Second Amendment PDOs ­ Moderately Unsatisfactory13

(i) Same as original PDO;
(ii) to assist the Borrower in designing and implementing a program to modernize the non-
financial public sector in Argentina both at the national and provincial levels; and
(iii) to strengthen the institutional capacity at the Borrower's provincial level.

The achievement of PDOs outlined under the First and Second Amendments is deemed moderately
unsatisfactory. While a sound and comprehensive state modernization program was designed as
envisioned under the First Amendment, it was not implemented as originally conceived. As
discussed above, without the political backing of its champion, Argentina's Vice President, the
implementation of a comprehensive state modernization program such as the one being proposed
became virtually unfeasible. While important enabling legislation and administrative norms were
passed during this period (i.e. on procurement and digital signature, which were enacted in 2001),
modest progress was done in the implementation of cross-cutting "horizontal" reforms during 2000
and 2001. Likewise, the operation had no long lasting impact at the provincial level during this
period. The modernization of two key government agencies--i.e., the tax and social security
agencies--are an exception. Together with the Ministry of Education, the Federal Tax
Administration (Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos ­ AFIP) and the National Social
Security Administration (Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social ­ ANSES) were targeted
for the implementation of "vertical" reforms under the state modernization program. While reform
efforts were erratic before the crisis, these two agencies were swiftly transformed in its aftermath as
a result of strong political will on the part of the new authorities and targeted Bank support.

As shown in Table 4, the Key Performance Indicators corresponding to these PDOs reflect the
operation's performance in 2000 and 2003. In particular, the three first Indicators indicate that
vertical reforms were successful in two of the three targeted key agencies (i.e. the tax and social
security agencies), but they can only partially be attributed to this loan. The remaining three
indicators show that whatever modest progress had been achieved in the development of horizontal
management tools before the crisis was reversed in its aftermath.

13   The PDO of the First Amendment was to provide support for the design of the state modernization strategy, while the
Second Amendment expanded this objective to also implement the newly designed strategy, including the strengthening of
provincial governments. As these two Amendments were conceived as part of a two-pronged restructuring strategy, their
PDOs are consolidated for the assessment of the project objectives. Moreover, it seems unwarranted to assess the
attainment of a PDO focusing only on the design of a reform strategy, as it would artificially increase the overall project
rating.
14   Net tax revenues (not including customs taxes or social security) as a percentage of GDP was 13.4 percent in 2000. It
amounted to 11.49 percent, 13.93 percent, and 17.26 percent in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively.
15   According to data reported by ANSES' Strategic Planning and Control Units, time elapsed between retirement and
receipt of social security payments was reduced from 80 to 63 days for the public system, and from 225 to 91 days for the
private option between 2001 and 2005.

At least 15 agencies operating by 2003 at levels of performance agreed

The cumulative achievements of individual components that remained unchanged in focus until the
end of the project is discussed under the Third Amendment, as they largely reflect the incremental
state modernization strategy that was implemented from 2004 onward and formally adopted under
the Third Amendment. However, the assessment of achievements of three components is pertinent
to the context of the First and Second Amendment, for which it is discussed below.

Component C - Modernization of the Public Sector: Moderately Satisfactory. This component
supported the design of a program to modernize the non-financial public sector in Argentina, both at
the national and provincial levels (i.e. it corresponded to Component D introduced under the First
Amendment). Decree 1003/01, issued on January 29, 2001 established an outline of a National
Modernization Plan for the non-financial public sector. The proposed program constituted a
significant departure from previous public sector reform efforts in Argentina, which had largely
focused on downsizing and "de-inventing" the state, or on narrowly targeted improvements in
specific operations. At the national level in particular, reform efforts had focused on selected reforms
within individual government agencies rather than on cross-cutting institutional processes that affect
all agencies of the public sector. Consequently, the successes achieved had been hindered by
systemic problems facing the public sector as a whole. Furthermore, efforts in one agency without
appropriate attention to the links and dependence on partner stakeholders further restricted positive
impacts.
     In contrast, the proposed modernization strategy focused on reinventing the government in the
sense of broadly strengthening management systems and the service orientation of public
administration. It put forward an intensive and integrated approach to modernization that focused on
both vertical and horizontal reforms. In terms of the vertical reforms, the proposed modernization
program supported a comprehensive set of actions supporting short- to medium-term reforms in
priority agencies as a way of maximizing tangible impacts on fiscal performance. In terms of
horizontal reforms, the project introduced changes in inputs and incentive frameworks, including
fiscal incentives. It also identified key management tools that could have a wide impact throughout
the national public sector. It also sought to actively promote state modernization efforts at the
provincial level. As discussed earlier, the program was overly ambitious, particularly considering the
country's overall conditions at the time. Although it was never implemented as envisioned, it helped
pave the way for future reform efforts. The more modest modernization strategy that was
implemented from the end of 2003 onward built upon some of the elements of this strategy, as does
the State Modernization II project that has been recently approved.

Component D - Streamlining the Macro-Structure of the National Government: Unsatisfactory.
This component supported the comprehensive overhaul of Argentina's non-financial national public
sector to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of administrative procedures and service provision
at the national level. Several preparatory activities were conducted, including assessments of
alternative organizational structures, as well as awareness and dissemination campaigns aimed at
broadening support among key stakeholders. However, these reforms lacked the needed support, as
policy makers realized that across-the-board organizational reforms were difficult to implement in
the pre- and post-crisis environment. Although the conceptual model that emerged from these
background activities helped guide subsequent modernization efforts, the objective of overhauling



                                                       17

the macro-structure of the national government was abandoned and a gradual approach to
strengthening "islands" of modernization was adopted instead. This component was subsequently
cancelled under the Third Amendment.

Component F - Reform of Selected Public Agencies and Decentralized Entities: Moderately
Satisfactory. While the indicators referring to increased tax collections and the time reduction for
processing of pensions may appear to suggest that the achievements in the performance of AFIP and
ANSES are a result of the actions supported under this operation, their impact is more modest.
Improved tax collections during 2003 and 2004 reflect Argentina's post-crisis economic recovery.
They also reflect the fact that AFIP became an autonomous institution (ente autárquico) in 2002 and
that new legislation was passed in 2003 providing for improved mechanisms to reduce tax non-
compliance, including steeper sanctions. Likewise, ANSES' enhanced performance was the result of
the efforts of a reform-minded administration that took office in January 2002, setting in motion a
wave of cultural and institutional transformation. While the tools developed under the operation,
such as management by results and Citizens' Charter Programs, were indeed incorporated into the
ANSES' modernization efforts, they were minor complements to the vision and the commitment of
ANSES' authorities and the Bank support received under ANSES I TAL (Technical Assistance Loan
No. 4131-AR), which focused specifically on the modernization of this key agency. Conversely, no
substantial progress was made in the modernization of the Ministry of Education due to institutional
instability and a high turnover of authorities.

PDOs Third Amendment ­ Moderately Satisfactory

To implement the Borrower's strategy to strengthen public sector management tools to improve
transparency and civil society participation as well as increase the efficiency and quality of
management in selected areas of public services.

Achievement of this PDO is deemed moderately satisfactory. While the operation effectively
supported the GoA's efforts to strengthen public sector management tools, the overall gains in
transparency and civil society participation, efficiency, and quality of management in the targeted
areas have been only moderate (see Table 5. Key Performance Indicators). The moderate
achievements, in turn, reflect the gradual or incremental strategy adopted by the GoA, in which
progress was achieved on multiple fronts, but without the forcefulness needed to engender structural
transformation. This is particularly true in areas in which modernization efforts were met with
significant resistance, such as procurement and human resources management. Progress has been
made in the context and space provided by respective government commitment. Thus, it is not
surprising that, although the enabling legislation is in place, progress has been modest--albeit, of
course, very valuable--in these two areas and, as a result, gains in efficiency and transparency are
still far from reaching their full potential. Likewise, it is difficult to assess the overall impact of the
strategic plans and other management-by-results tools that were supported under the operation, and
there are no indications that these tools have attained the critical mass and degree of institutional
insertion needed to truly create a results-based culture and enhance transparency and efficiency
throughout Argentina's public sector. There are, however, two notable exceptions. Substantial
progress has been made in e-government, in terms of advancing the overall legal framework,
envisioning and setting in motion the implementation of a comprehensive strategy, and developing
sound technical tools aimed at improving transparency and efficiency of government agencies and
their delivery of services. Two agencies, the national Information Technology Office (Oficina
Nacional de Tecnología de la Información ­ ONTI) and SINTyS, have been responsible for the
achievements in e-government. These two agencies have collaborated in some areas and
complemented their efforts in other areas, fostering the adoption of ICT tools by agencies at the
national and provincial levels, which, in turn, have obtained clear gains in efficiency and
transparency. Although more reduced in its scope, the Citizens' Charter Program is another

exception, as it has been widely adopted by national agencies that interact with the public and is now
valuable management tool in key service-delivery institutions, such as ANSES.

On the other hand, it needs to be strongly considered that given the broad PDO and the output-rather
than outcome-oriented indicators, and the progress made with the project despite a very difficult
overall operating environment, project achievements can be ranked as strong, so a more positive
ranking could also be considered.

                                                  the M&E systems, this is due in part to the fact that the M&E
                                                  systems are still in the early stage of implementation.

                                                  permanent civilian employees under the central administration.
                                                  N.A.: There are 16 government agencies and programs that use

(*) While the Third Amendment presented a full-fledged set of intermediate output indicators for the various components,
some of the Key Performance Indicators were not identified at an operational level, leaving the, open to multiple
interpretations. In addition, no baselines or targets were defined at the time for any of the Key Performance Indicators; thus, it
cannot be clearly determined whether the outcome was achieved or not. The assessment of achievements presented above
reflects the progress made in achieving the intermediate output targets under the various components.

Improvements in Transparency
Human Resources Management
     The national public employment office (ONEP) now reviews all contracts of public sector consultants with
     salaries over Arg.$2,000 a month to ensure the candidate is qualified for the job.
     The merit-based career system for SINAPA has been strengthened. SINAPA is the most important
     human resources regime, covering over 20 percent of all civilian employees within the central
     administration.
     The ONEP, in conjunction with ONTI, has developed a Central Civil Servants Registry (SIREPEVA),
     which covers all SINAPA employees. The registry is available on the government's intranet for
     consultation and continuous updating by public official.
     Together with ONEP's registry of contracted employees, which is near completion, the two personnel
     registries mentioned above (SIREPEVA and SINAPA) cover approximately 19 percent of all employees
     (civilian and armed forces) in the central administration (10 and 9 percent, respectively). As a result,
     employment statistics for the central administration have improved.17
     Progress has been made in bringing individual contracts in line with the principles of the civil service law,
     including: i) ONEP's review of all contracts with salaries over Arg.$2,000 a month to ensure the candidate
     is qualified for the job, and ii) the transfer of 15,000 contracted employees to a regime that imposes salary
     ceilings, but also gives them additional benefits.
E-Government
     The Digital Signature (Law N° 25.506), which was enacted in December 2001, establishes the obligation
     of the national government to implement this technology within a period of five years.18 Approximately 85
     percent of the supporting ITC platform has been developed. Implementation has begun on a pilot basis.
     Efforts to digitalize key social and fiscal information have substantially increased the quality and
     availability of data on: family relationships, vital facts (birth, marriage, death, and family relationships),
     student population, registration of deeds, and registration of juridical persons.
Procurement
     A new procurement law (Law N° 1.023) was enacted in 2001 that incorporates higher standards of
     transparency and an emphasis on competitive procedures for the national government. However, the
     failure to issue all supporting regulations has limited the potential impact of this legislation.
     The National Procurement Office (ONC) has developed a procurement portal that has almost 3 million
     annual hits (http:www.argentinacompra.gov.ar).
     An e-procurement system (SECOP) is being implemented for purchases up to Arg.$10,000 in 4 pilot
     agencies (8 procurement units) within the central administration--equivalent to only 5 percent of the
     national administration.
     A registry of suppliers has been created, with approximately 18,000 suppliers, as well as a list of
     reference prices.
Improvements in civil society participation
Citizens' Charter Programs
     As of 2007, 50 agencies, representing 90 percent of agencies in the national government that have
     interaction with the public, have implemented Citizens' Charters, making available to the public (in print
     and through the Internet) their mission and responsibilities, citizens' rights, complaint and appeals
     procedures, as well as specific annual objectives of the agency. Citizens' feedback on the performance of
     these agencies is systematically collected through scorecards, surveys, hot lines, focus groups and
     others instruments. In the case of ANSES, for example, Citizens' performance scores are formally
     incorporated into the agency's M&E system.


16   Note that several of the achievements detailed in Table 6 were agreed under the 2004-2005 Operational Plan and
substantial progress towards their achievement was made during those years. To avoid unnecessary repetitions, however,
and because the changes in the overall modernization strategy reflected in these Operational Plans were only formally
adopted under the Third Amendment, they are reported here.
17   The National Government's central administration was composed of approximately 266,000 employees in 2006, of
which approximately 241,000 are permanent employees (equivalent to 91 percent) and 25,000 are individual consultants
(equivalent to 9 percent). There are approximately 26,000 employees under SINAPA's regime, representing 10 percent of
total permanent employees within the central administration.
18   The digital signature is vital to ensure transparency in e-government applications, as it enhances security in
internal communications by guaranteeing the identity of the signer and the integrity of electronic messages.

Administrative Procedures
     International Organization of Standardization (ISO) norms have been adopted for 13 procedures
     (compared to a target of 10) as a way to improve quality and efficiency.
     The new government portal also hosts an electronic directory of government procedures (the so-called
     "Portal de Trámites"), which includes over 750 procedures (trámites) within the central administration, 50
     of which can be processed electronically (compared to a target of 400 procedures, and 10 electronic
     ones).19
E-Government
     The development of a new government portal (http:www.argentina.gov.ar), which provides general
     information about the country and the national public administration as well as information particularly
     targeted to citizens, businesses, and foreigners (information for foreigners is also available in English).
Procurement
     Advances have been made in publicizing procurement processes on the Internet, especially the calls for
     bids, better accessibility to bidding documents, and notification of the final awards. However, only 5
     percent of procurement plans are currently being adequately published each year.
Improvements in efficiency
E-Government
     The creation of ONTI in 2002 constituted a major cornerstone in the development of e-government in
     Argentina, as it has provided a new systemic view for e-government development.
     Under ONTI's sponsorship, a forum for IT personnel has been established to promote internal knowledge
     sharing and collaboration.
     SINTyS has established itself as an effective broker of information within Argentina's public sector,
     promoting the exchange of information across government agencies at the national and provincial levels.
     There are approximately 200 government entities currently participating in SINTyS, including 24 entities
     at the national level (incl. AFIP, ANSES and RENAPER), 177 entities at the provincial level, and 11
     entities at the municipal level.
     SINTyS has supported the development of normalized data-exchange procedures to be used by
     participating entities. SINTyS and ONTI have jointly defined standards for the most commonly used 30
     data categories--i.e., name, address, date of birth, gender, etc.--that are expected to soon be adopted
     as national standards.
     Improvements in quality and availability of key social information have rendered benefits of approximately
     US$57 million during 2006 and 2007, arising from the detection of ineligible beneficiaries in social
     programs at both national and provincial levels.
     Improvements in quality and availability of key fiscal information have rendered benefits of over US$5.4
     million between 2006 and 2007, arising from reduced tax non-compliance, including the detection of tax
     fraud, arrears and evasion at both the national and provincial levels.
     Individual agencies have also benefited from increased efficiency and other savings as a result of their
     participating in SINTyS. For example, prior to the creation of SINTyS, ANSES had set up a country-wide
     network to collect data on deaths, as payments of social securities extended several months after the
     death of beneficiaries, resulting in tantamount loses. ANSES now relies on SINTyS to obtain this
     information, and is moving toward real-time data exchange interconnection with provincial registries
     through the SINTyS network to improve even further its information on vital facts.
     A new response unit has been created to centralize and coordinate efforts within the national level to
     manage security attacks or potential breaches to the computer systems of national agencies.
Improvements in quality of management

Management by Results
     As of 2007, 29 agencies had received support under the project to implement results-based management
     tools, including Annual Performance Agreements (APAs) as well as results-based budgeting, operational
     manuals, process reengineering, and organizational streamlining.20 However, unless performance is
     systematically monitored by the CCO and linked to financial, budgetary and other incentives as originally
     conceived, these tools will only have a limited impact on management performance.



19   Http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/tramites/.
20   Annual Performance Agreements (APAs) were the instruments used when the state modernization efforts
just started. Only three APAs, however, were signed during the pre-crisis period. After the crisis, emphasis was
placed on other results-based management tools, including results-based budgeting, operational manuals, process
reengineering, and organizational streamlining.

A summary of the achievements under the individual components is discussed below (please, see
Annex 2 for a detailed description of outcomes):

Component E ­ Creation of a New Public Management Model: Moderately Satisfactory.
While it can be discussed if the understanding of the new public management model under the
project is similar to that promoted under that terminology in some anglophone countries, significant
progress has been made in the modernization of key horizontal systems in public management areas
under the responsibility of the Chief of Cabinet Office. This, in turn, has contributed toward
moderate improvements in transparency, efficiency and quality in public sector management.
Specific achievements include: (i) the development of a national e-government plan and relevant
tools, such as the government portal and the digital signature; (ii) strengthening of procurement
tools, such as the development of an e-procurement system and publication of calls for bids; (iii)
improvement in human resource management, such as the partial harmonization of selected public
employment regimes and the implementation of personnel registries; and (iv) design and
implementation of accountability mechanisms, such as the Annual Agreement Plans and Citizens'
Charter (Cartas Compromiso). Achievements under each of the sub-component are described below:

E.1.    Management by Results and Citizens' Charter Programs21 ­ Partially Achieved. This
subcomponent sought to increase accountability of government agencies by supporting: (i) the
preparation and implementation of internal agency reform programs in up to 20 agencies; (ii) the
implementation of Annual Program Agreements (APAs) subscribed between individual agencies and
the Chief of Cabinet Office (CCO), outlying explicit financial and physical targets to be used in their
annual performance evaluations; and (iii) the design and implementation of a program of Citizens'
Charter, making available to the public (in print and through the Internet) the agency's mission and
responsibilities, citizens' rights, complaint and appeals procedures, as well as specific annual
objectives of the agency.
Some of the project's achievements in this area include:
    Demand for technical assistance from the implementing agency (Oficina Nacional de Innovación
    en la Gestión - ONIG) has increased steadily over the past years. ONIG has identified 93 best
    practices in management and service delivery among participating agencies for future
    replication, including quality certification (for example, ISO norms), the redesign, digitalization
    and automation of procedures, and improvements in service delivery centers. In addition,
    strategic plans have been developed or updated for 27 national agencies with the operation's
    support, amply exceeding the original target of 20 agencies. No systematic assessment has been
    conducted, however, of the actual impact of these plans in terms of efficiency and transparency.
    Impact evaluations are planned under the Second State Modernization Project.
    Annual Performance Agreements: Decree 103 (2001), which established the legal framework for
    the New Public Management Model, introduced Annual Performance Agreements (Acuerdos
    Programa) as results-based agreements built on strategic planning, budget allocation, operational
    plans, and fiscal incentives. In particular, APAs promoted efficiency gains by linking them to a
    system of incentives in which participating entities received 75 percent of the budget savings
    resulting from their efficiency gains and could use them at their discretion for organizational
    upgrades and salary increases. The financial incentives vanished with the 2001- 2002 crisis, and
    non-financial mechanisms were subsequently devised to reward good institutional performance.
    As of 2007, 29 agencies had received support under the project to implement results-based
    instruments, including results-based budgeting, operational manuals, process reengineering, and
    organizational streamlining. However, with the exception of AFIP and ANSES, the actual level
    of implementation of these instruments and their related outcome are not clear.                          Unless


21  Throughout the life span of the project, the terms "Citizen Compact" and "Citizens' Charter Program" were used as
synonyms.

    performance is systematically monitored by the CCO and linked to budgetary incentives as
    originally conceived, these tools will only have an isolated impact on enhancing management..
    Citizens' Charter Programs: As of 2007, Citizens' Charter Programs (Cartas Compromiso) have
    been implemented in 50 agencies, representing 90 percent of service-delivery agencies in the
    national government. The Citizens' Charters are a consensus-building and monitoring tool aimed
    at making explicit the mission, responsibilities and expected performance of individual agencies
    and submit them to the citizenry for overseeing. As part of the implementation of Citizens'
    Charters, the Chief of Cabinet Office, the agency authorities and employees agree upon specific
    performance and service delivery standards, which are then outlined in the agency's Citizens'
    Charter. Citizens' feedback on the achievement of standards is systematically collected through
    scorecards, surveys, hot lines, and others instruments. User surveys and focus groups in the
    participating agencies show improved service delivery in 80 percent of the cases.22 In this regard,
    it is important to note that ONIG and the PIU were quite proactive in 2006 and 2007, conducting
    assessment activities that exceeded the original targets and, thus, contributing greatly to the
    successful implementation of this tool. Citizens' Charters are now a core management tool in
    key service-delivery institutions, including ANSES. The design of their methodology, its limited
    participatory nature, their M&E and the specific performance improvements linked to the
    Citizens' Charters however still point to further room for improvement both in their design and
    implementation.

E.2.     Human Resources Management ­ Partially Achieved. This sub-component supported the
development of a more integrated human resources management system as outlined in the Civil
Service Law (Law No. 25,164 ­ 1999), which emphasized merit appointments and promotions for
permanent staff, separation of permanent from short-term and political appointments, equitable
treatment for the same work, and the right to join and be represented by unions in collective
negotiations. Specific activities included under this subcomponent included: (i) drafting and
enactment of internal regulations for the civil service legislation; (ii) preparation of new regulations
and procedures controlling the re-employment of separated or retired public employees; (iii) creation
of a personnel register, (iv) studies on personnel recruitment, career development, and salary
structure; and (v) piloting of the new human resources system in selected agencies.

The economic crisis of 2000-2001 provided little opportunity to advance with the organizational and
legal framework developed in the late 1990s. Hiring was frozen, salaries were reduced by 13 percent,
and a regime of voluntary retirement was introduced. These measures, together with the difficult
economic conditions prevailing in the aftermath of the crisis, made public sector employees even
more resistant to change. Once the worst of the crisis was over, the government revived efforts to
strengthen central oversight and standardization of human resource policy, and to enhance the
capacity of the National Public Employment Office (Oficina Nacional de Empleo Público ­ ONEP).
As a result, progress has been made in: i) the design of framework laws regulating public
employment and collective contracts; ii) the gradual reduction of the number of separate labor
regimes and bringing them into closer compliance with framework legislation; and iii) the
improvement of labor statistics for the public sector through the development of electronic registries.
Specific achievements under this sub-component are summarized on Table 6 and detailed in Annex
2. :

E.3. Training ­ Partially Achieved.        This sub-component sought to strengthen the ability of
National Institute of Public Administration (Instituto Nacional de Administración Pública - INAP),
which is the principal training agency for the national executive branch to, among others, increase its
ability to work with individual agencies to link their training budgets to their annual work program

and identified needs and develop stronger evaluation programs. In 2006, however, there was a shift
in the training strategy supported under the operation, departing from a comprehensive reform of the
INAP and its training strategy to a focus on flexible training opportunities for full-time public
employees based on the combination of electronic courses (e-learning) and informal networks of
support and tutors. More than 20 e-learning courses have been developed, addressing the specific
training needs of government agencies, including electoral committees (mesas electorales), financial
administration, e-government, Citizens' Charters, conflict resolution, and tourism. A total of 6,150
public employees have been trained using e-courses by 2007 (compared to a target of 2,000). The
high quality of these courses has been underscored by the Latin American Center of Public
Administration for Development (Centro Latinoamericano de Administración para el Desarrollo -
CLAD). The operation has also financed training in areas such as human resources management and
procurement, often in conjunction with the INAP.

E.4.     E-Government ­ Achieved. This sub-component supported a comprehensive effort to
develop and implement an information and communications technologies (ICT) strategy. The
implementation of this sub-component was particularly successful. E-government became the central
tool to foster transparency, efficiency, and civil society participation in the provision of public
services and consequently, central to the achievement of the operation's objective. The impact of this
sub-component has been substantial both at the institutional and operational levels, as it helped
develop a solid legal and institutional framework for e-government and it also helped advance state-
of-the-art tools to support the further expansion of e-government applications, including the
digitalization of the administrative circuits.
    The main achievements of the State Modernization Project are a new focus on institutional
    coordination for e-government with the establishment of ONTI as the national coordination
    office and the development of national plans to improve information quality and systems
    integration, including the National Plan for Electronic Government, security framework, digital
    signature, and data standards. The achievements under this component, summarized in Table 6
    and detailed in Annex 2, have been substantial.

E.5.     Administrative Procedures ­Achieved. This sub-component sought to systematically
streamline administrative procedures throughout the national administration. Specific achievements
include:
    The new government portal also hosts an electronic directory of government procedures (the so-
    called "Portal de Trámites"), which includes over 750 procedures (trámites) within the central
    administration, 50 of which can be processed electronically.23 This achievement amply exceeds
    the original target of 400 procedures, and 10 electronic ones. Based on the information provided
    by individual government agencies, the portal describes in detail the steps and requirements
    associated with all government services procedures. The largest number of requests corresponds
    to the application for and renewal of passports and national identification documents. It is
    important to note, however, that the consolidation or simplification of procedures, which could
    result in substantial streamlining and offer a potential for significant time and cost reductions
    (not envisaged under the loan) is still pending.
    Efforts to streamline administrative procedures focused mainly on supporting the efforts of
    individual agencies to adopt ISO norms (i.e. the Quality Management Standard developed by the
    International Organization of Standardization - ISO) as a way to improve the quality and
    efficiency of 13 procedures, many of them focusing on attention to the public. ANSES is one of
    the agencies that have adopted ISO norms to enhance their customer service processes. In
    particular, ANSES has obtained ISO 9001:2000 accreditation for two of its call centers and for
    the quality customer service procedures implemented in all its field offices.

     E.6. Procurement ­ Partially Achieved. This sub-component aimed to support: (i) the
     preparation of detailed regulations for implementing and enforcing a new national procurement
     law expected to be presented to the Congress in the near future; (ii) the implementation of a
     public sector procurement information system; and (iii) the employment of staff training in the
     new procurement rules and procedures. Significant progress toward the strengthening of the
     country's procurement has been achieved, including the passage of important new legislation,
     the strengthening of the National Procurement Office (Oficina Nacional de Contrataciones -
     ONC), the implementation of a procurement portal (www.argentinacompra.gov.ar) and the
     partial implementation of an e-procurement system (Sistema Electrónico de Contrataciones
     Públicas - SECOP). However, achievements under this component fell short of the original
     expectations, as the failure to issue supporting implementing regulations, documents and
     guidance has limited the potential impact of this legislation. Moreover, it is important to note
     that public works, which represents the bulk of public procurement, is not under the orbit of the
     ONC. Thus, in line with what was agreed under this operation, the improvements in procurement
     are limited to a relative small share of all procurement operations. Specific achievements in this
     area are summarized in Table 6 and detailed in Annex 2.

Component F- Reform of Selected Programs in Key Public Agencies and Decentralized Entities:
Moderately Satisfactory. As discussed earlier, the original focus of this component was on the
modernization of three key government agencies: AFIP, ANSES and the Ministry of Education.
While AFIP and ANSES did indeed undergo a swift process of reform as a result of the strong
political will of these agencies' authorities and Bank support under operations targeting the two
agencies, no significant progress was achieved in the Ministry of Education. Under the Third
Amendment, the focus of this component shifted to the implementation of agency-specific reforms
(i.e., "vertical" reforms) in the education and justice sectors as well as in ANSES, the National
Social Services Institute for Retirees and Pensioners (Instituto Nacional de Servicios Sociales para
Retirados y Jubilados - PAMI), and the Property Registry (RENAPER). The Chief of Cabinet
Office, however, subsequently cancelled activities focusing on ANSES, PAMI, and the Property
Registry and focused instead on the development of Education Observatories in the Ministry of
Education and Community Justice Centers (Casas de Justicia) as well as on the implementation of
various other initiatives in other agencies. Even though the activities supported under this component
succeeded in achieving tangible improvements in the various participating agencies, its focus was
overly dispersed and many of the improvements were limited in scope. The main achievements
under this component are described below:

F.1. M&E System for Policy Analysis and Assessment by the CCO ­ Partially Achieved. This sub-
component supported the development and initial stages of implementation of a monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system for the Chief of Cabinet Office, the so-called "System of Government
Indicators" (Sistema de Indicadores de Gobierno - SIG), aimed at assessing the efficacy, efficiency
and impact of public policies. To implement SIG, the Under-secretariat of Budget Coordination and
Evaluation was established at the CCO in 2003. By 2007, a prototype for the deployment of SIG at
the agency level has been tested in the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Justice, the Undersecretary
of Emergencies of the City of Buenos Aires, the National Senate, and the National Statistics Agency
(Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos - INDEC).24 In addition, the operation supported the
development of an impact-evaluation methodology, including over 400 indicators, which was
successfully piloted at the Ministry of Social Development. More than 100 public officials have been
trained in the use of SIG.



24   Agreements for the implementation of the SIG in municipal governments have also been signed with the Ministry of
the Interior.



                                                        25

While the Ministry of Economy and Production (Ministerio de Economía y Producción ­ MECON)
and other ministries have developed their own M&E programs, these systems are largely self-
contained and are not systematically used as inputs in resource allocation decisions. To address these
shortcomings and with the support of the existing legal framework that grants the CCO far-reaching
powers,25 the SIG has been conceived as a first step in the construction of an integrated, government-
wide monitoring panel (Tablero de Control) aimed at systematically monitoring the pace of
implementation and impact of key government policies at the national and sub-national level.
Accomplishing such an ambitious vision, however, would require overcoming difficult challenges,
including: providing the right set of incentives for individual agencies to provide sound information
aimed at policy coordination and public expenditure efficiency, consolidating the role of the CCO in
budget allocation decisions, and fully integrating the SIG into the budgetary cycle. So far, the
achievements made under this sub-component constitute the initial steps toward the implementation
of the SIG, which is also being supported under the State Modernization II Project.

F.2. Public Expenditure Assessment Methodology ­ Partially Achieved. This sub-component
supported the design and implementation of a public expenditure assessment methodology aimed at
evaluating the efficacy of expenditures of key public programs. With a view to meeting public
expenditure and resource allocation concerns, the CCO created the External Financing Directorate
(Dirección Nacional de Programas y Proyectos con Financiamiento Externo - DINAPPFE),
responsible for developing a consistent set of criteria and control mechanisms to be applied to
externally financed projects (i.e. mostly projects with multilateral financing). While an expenditure
assessment methodology has been developed, it has become evident that its implementation would
enhance efficiency in the use of multilateral funds at the expense of adopting more cumbersome
project approval and implementation procedures. Questions remain, however, on the long-term
soundness of debt management and the contribution of these tools and methodologies to more
transparent and streamlined public financial management.

F.3 Assets Management System for the Chief of Cabinet Office - Partially Achieved. This sub-
component supported the design and implementation of a physical assets management system.
Traditionally a function of public financial management, the CCO chose to strengthen the
administration of public physical assets given the weaknesses of the legal and institutional
frameworks and, consequently, the absence of sound mechanisms to adequately manage them.26
Some progress has been made, including: i) a diagnosis has been conducted and the costs of
mismanagement have been quantified; ii) an Asset Management Module has been piloted in three
public entities (i.e. the highway administration, the treasury, and the former state airline); and iii)
performance measurements have been formulated for the use of resources, such as water and energy;
and iv) preliminary inventories of physical assets have been conducted. In addition, the CCO has
adopted a participatory approach, creating an inter-agency task force to formulate a new asset
management modernization strategy and potentially be responsible for its implementation. However,
the incentive framework needed to streamline the management of assets is still unclear and the
design of an assets management system is still at a very early stage despite several years of support
under this operation.



25   Article 100 of the Constitution, the Law of Fiscal Transparency No. 25.152, and several decrees assign specific roles
to the CCO, including coordination of the national administration and its public policies; participation in the processes for
the preparation and modification of the public budget; control and evaluation of public programs linked to the national
policies; and preparation and approval of results-based agreements to be executed by public institutions. The Financial
Administration Law allows the Chief of Cabinet to reassign the budget as long as it does not top the existing annual
ceilings.
26   The legal and institutional framework of public assets management is very fragmented, as responsibilities for asset
management remain within different government agencies and no particular agency has the overall coordination, policy,
enforcement or monitoring capacity.



                                                           26

F.4. Community Justice Centers (Casas de Justicia) - Achieved. This sub-component sought to
support the implementation of the so-called Community Justice Centers (Casas de Justicia), which
are community information centers aimed at providing assistance and disseminating information on
constitutional rights, judicial processes, and access to public services to the more vulnerable sectors
of the population, thus addressing gaps in access to information and services due to socio-economic
status. Under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice, these Community Justice Centers are
implemented jointly with municipal governments and non-government organizations in areas which
are particularly afflicted by poverty and/or very remote. Results so far have been highly encouraging,
in line with the performance targets that were defined ex ante, for example in terms of the number of
services requested; the time elapsed until a response was given; the number of beneficiaries that were
directed to specific legal, administrative or social services; and customer satisfaction. In addition, the
methodology used has been highly innovative and effective. Since the original five Community
Justice Centers were first implemented in 2005, new demands have surfaced as the success of this
initiative became apparent. By providing seed money, the operation successfully supported the
demonstration potential of an innovative initiative. The Ministry of Justice and/or the corresponding
municipal governments have absorbed the five centers into their operations. Questions remain,
however, over the extent to which this system can be replicated and scaled up.

F.5. Strengthening of the Justice General Inspectorate - Achieved. This sub-component sought to
improve the administrative processes used to communicate information on companies' balances and
shareholder meetings to increase the transparency in the reporting of such information. The Justice
General Inspectorate (Inspección General de Justicia - IGJ),27 the agency responsible for this
function, had limited oversight capacity due, primarily, to the relative obsolescence of its
management tools. The lack of technical capacity of the IGJ had important negative consequences,
as the lack of updated and complete information on the establishment and closure of corporations,
their chapters, balances, reports from shareholder meetings, and rosters of shareholders affected the
ability of other institutions to perform their judiciary, regulatory and oversight duties.

Under the operation, the IGJ received support to upgrade its ICT systems to digitalize documents and
facilitate data exchange and communication. In addition, a new streamlined process has been
implemented in conjunction with AFIP to incorporate the tax identification code (Clave Única de
Identificación Tributaria - CUIT) for both corporations and individuals. As a result of these actions,
the oversight capacity of IGJ has been notably enhanced. Cooperation of the IGJ with different parts
of the judicial system has also become more efficient, as judicial requests are now processed within
the established 15-day deadline. To further strengthen transparency and ensure financial
sustainability, the IGJ has established a Help Desk that provides non-restricted information to
individuals on a fee-basis. An additional unintended outcome has been the use of up-to-date
corporation data in money laundering detection.

Component G - Promoting Provincial Government Reform:                       Moderately Satisfactory. This
component supported institutional capacity building for provincial governments through a small,
targeted program linked to the Federal Council on Public Administration (Consejo Federal de la
Función Pública - CFFP), a group chaired by the Chief of Cabinet and comprised of all provincial
governors. Although the CFFP was created in 1992, its mission was redefined under the de la Rua
administration to serve as an information clearing house and forum for discussions on public
administration between the national and provincial governments. Likewise, the scope of these
discussions was substantially expanded to include other state modernization topics aside from those
that had traditionally been at the center of the national-provincial dialogue, such as financial
management systems.


27  The Justice General Inspectorate depends from the Ministry of Justice.



                                                         27

The project has contributed to fostering a policy dialogue between the CCO and the provinces on
state modernization, including e-government, the modernization of horizontal public management
tools, capacity building, and the dissemination of best practices. By the end of 2007, working
agreements had been signed with 23 provinces28 to support the transfer of legal and regulatory
frameworks, as well as tools and methodologies implemented at the national level to provincial
governments. Some specific examples include e-government plans, digital signature, as well as the
adoption of quality standards, such as the ISO standards. However, the role of the CFFP is still weak,
in part due to its limited institutional and coordination capacity. Likewise, the implementation and
impact of these working agreements still remain to be evaluated.

Component H ­ SINTyS: Satisfactory. By facilitating the systematic interchange of social and fiscal
information among participating agencies, SINTyS has contributed to improving the completeness,
accuracy and reliability of agency data through cross-validation. These improvements in data quality
and availability have, in turn, served to enhance the targeting of social programs and reduce tax non-
compliance. It is estimated that the investments under this component have resulted in benefits of
over US$60 million from reduced tax non-compliance and enhanced targeting of social programs.29
The achievements under this component have been substantial, as summarized below:

H.1. Improvement of Social Services ­ Achieved. This sub-component aimed to improve the
targeting and delivery of social services in Argentina through improved identification of individuals
and relationships. Activities supported under this sub-component included: i) the exchange of
information among agencies at the national and provincial levels responsible for the delivery of
social programs and services; and ii) the digitalization of information in those organisms that are
responsible for generating key social data: provincial civil registries and registries of students.
Activities in this sub-component have contributed to enhance the quality and availability of key
social information, including population without health coverage, vital facts (i.e. birth, marriage,
divorce, children, and death), family relationships, and the identification of minors (i.e. less than 18
years of age) and their educational history. In turn, enhanced social information has resulted in
benefits of approximately US$57 million during 2006 and 2007, arising from the detection of
ineligible beneficiaries in social programs at both national and provincial levels. As shown in Annex
2, the achievements under this sub-component have exceeded the original targets, except in the
digitalization of student registries.

H.2. Improving Fiscal Efficiency ­ Partially Achieved. This sub-component aimed to decrease tax
non-compliance by facilitating the interchange of fiscal information among participating agencies
and improving the completeness, accuracy and quality of fiscal data. Activities supported under this
sub-component included: i) the exchange of information among tax agencies at the national and
provincial levels; and ii) the digitalization of information in those organisms that are responsible for
generating key fiscal data: provincial registries of juridical persons (Registros de Personas Jurídicas)
and provincial registries of deeds (Registros de la Propiedad). Activities in this sub-component have
contributed to enhance the quality and availability of key fiscal information; including the
identification of legal persons (i.e. corporations, limited liability companies, cooperatives, etc.) as


28  The original targets were 8, 12, and 16 provinces by the end of 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively.
29  SINTyS has implemented a rather sophisticated M&E system by which, each time they perform an information
exchange for a government agency, they request the agency's feedback in terms of the benefits it has obtained from it.
Moreover, the next time the agency requests a comparable information exchange, SINTyS staff verifies whether the
problems detected in the previous exchange have been eliminated. If the discrepancies still remain (for example, a
beneficiary of a particular social program whom SINTyS data identified as non-eligible but still remains on the list of
beneficiaries, SINTyS requests clarification from the agency. In this way, SINTyS has been able to refine the quality of
information and the methodology used for information exchanges. In addition, through this two-pronged M&E system, it
has also succeeded in attaining a reasonably accurate measurement of the actual benefits resulting from each information
exchange.



                                                           28

well as their constitution, dissolution, mergers, and registry of authorities; deed and ownership
information (i.e. deed registration, proprietor, and inhibitions); and the development of a virtual
inter-jurisdictional registry of property owners and deeds inhibitions (Red Inter.-jurisdiccional de
Inhibiciones y Titulares de Dominio). In turn, enhanced fiscal information has resulted in benefits of
approximately US$5.4 million between 2006 and 2007 from reduced tax non-compliance, including
the detection of tax fraud, arrears and evasion at both the national and provincial levels. As shown in
Annex 2, output under this sub-component exceeded two of the original four targets. Overall, the
impact of SINTyS in improving fiscal efficiency has been limited by the reluctance of tax agencies at
the national and provincial levels to share their information, which is protected by law, the so-called
"tax secret" (secreto fiscal).

H.3. Technological Framework and Infrastructure ­ Achieved. This sub-component supported the
design and implementation of a technological framework, including a normative framework and an
ICT platform, to support the exchange of information among government entities. SINTyS has
served as a facilitator and coordinator, ensuring that all government entities share their databases
using compatible protocols, format and homologation methodology. Specific outputs under this sub-
component include:
    The design of SINTyS' interconnection model, including its technological platform, has been
    completed and successfully tested. Hardware, software and exchange links to be adopted by
    SINTyS will be selected based on the experience gathered under this operation.
    SINTyS has supported the development of normalized procedures to be used by participating
    entities. SINTyS effectively integrates approximately 500 individual databases using uniform
    standards.
    Six of the 13 SINTyS provincial field offices (SPFOs) are inter-connected online, which is the
    next stage for SINTyS' decentralization.
    A Technical Board (mesa técnica) with representatives from AFIP, ANSES and RENAPER30
    has been established to help build consensus among the major players at the national level on
    key technical issues.
    Support has been provided for the development and implementation of service-oriented
    applications such as the "One-Stop Institutional Window" (Ventanilla Única de Organismos -
    VUO), of which six have been deployed at different government agencies, including PAMI.
    SINTyS and ONTI have jointly defined standards for the most commonly used 30 data
    categories--i.e. name, address, date of birth, gender, etc.--that are expected to soon be adopted
    as national standards.

H. 4. Organizational, Institutional and Legal Framework ­ Achieved. This sub-component
supported the development and implementation of SINTyS' organizational and institutional
framework at the national and provincial levels. Substantial progress has been achieved under this
component, including:
        SINTyS has established itself as an effective broker of information within Argentina's public
        sector, promoting the exchange of information across government agencies at the national
        and provincial levels. There are approximately 200 government entities currently
        participating in SINTyS, including 24 entities at the national level (including AFIP, ANSES
        and RENAPER), 177 entities at the provincial level, and 11 entities at the municipal level.
        SINTyS has formalized agreements or is working jointly with several federal councils
        (consejos federales), including those gathering information from health insurers, housing
        institutes and property registers from all provincial jurisdictions.
        SINTyS has also set in motion its expansion process at the sub-national level to
        progressively incorporate provincial and municipal governments. Currently, all 24 provincial

                                                          29

         jurisdictions have already subscribed to agreements formalizing their incorporation to
         SINTyS, of which 13 have established SINTyS provincial field offices (SPFOs).
         In addition, there have been significant advances toward the permanent institutionalization
         of SINTyS within Argentina's public sector. A mayor step was taken in December 2007,
         when SINTyS was established as a National Directorate under the National Coordination
         Council for Social Policies (Consejo Nacional de Coordinación de Políticas Sociales ­
         CNCPS), reflecting the national authorities' commitment toward the permanent
         institutionalization of SINTyS within Argentina's public sector.

H.5. Security Framework ­ Achieved.                This sub-component supported the design and
implementation of the necessary physical, virtual and procedural security prevention tools to ensure
the highest level of data privacy and confidentiality at all levels of business processes and
information exchange with adequate controls for protecting the confidentiality of the information
being accessed. Activities under this sub-component are particularly important to ensure that
constitutional guarantees for the provisions of privacy and confidentiality of individual information
are preserved and protected under SINTyS. Specific achievements include:
    SINTyS now has in place a security team familiar with the national and regional security
    frameworks and international security best practices.
    A common security framework has been developed for all the sub-components and physical
    infrastructure of the project and physical infrastructure protection is gradually being
    implemented in all SINTyS locations and hardware connected to the network.
    The design of the legal framework has been assessed, in particular privacy of information and
    confidentiality measures. Specifically, Argentina's Habeas Data Law (Law No. 25.326) provides
    an adequate legal framework for the protection of private information at the national level. There
    is a close working relationship between SINTyS and the National Directorate of Personal Data
    (Dirección Nacional de Protección de Datos Personales - DNPDP).
    SINTyS has actively collaborated with the DNPDP to define access rights to information for
    individual agencies--the so-called roles and profiles (Roles y Perfiles). In addition, a system is
    in place within SINTyS to grant access to information to individual agencies according to the
    roles and profiles defined jointly with the DNPDP.
    Basic security processes and procedures are in place, including encryption, and physical control
    environments have been defined and are being implemented. An implementation plan has been
    defined.
    SINTyS has been granted registration authority for ONTI's certification of digital signature
    certification to, in turn, adopt digital signature for its communications (Disposition No. 55/2007
    ­ UCP-CNPS).

3.3 Efficiency

Not applicable - Neither NPV nor ERR was estimated at appraisal. While measures of cost and
financial efficiency were calculated as part of the preparation of the Second Amendment, they are
not considered relevant as they are based primarily on the expected increases in tax collection
resulting from the reform of AFIP, which, as discussed earlier, was only tangentially affected by this
operation. Despite the above, it is important to note that the investments under this operation are
expected to have high yield returns. While strict calculations of efficiency are not feasible for the
majority of activities in the project, it is estimated that the investments under Component H -
SINTyS have resulted in over US$60 million in benefits by reducing tax non-compliance and
enhancing the targeting of social programs, compared to US$8 million in IBRD financing under this
operation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The operation's overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory. As shown in Table 8, this
rating is based on the weighted average of the achievement of PDOs as: (i) originally designed; and
as restructured under: ii) the First and Second Amendments; and (iii) the Third Amendment.
Achievement of the original PDO is considered moderately satisfactory, since, although no
disruptions were caused by the Y2K problem, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship between
this outcome and the operation. As noted earlier, the First and Second Amendments are evaluated
together as they were part of a two-pronged restructuring strategy. The achievement of the
corresponding PDOs is considered moderately unsatisfactory, since little sustainable progress was
made tin the implementation of the ambitious state modernization program of the de la Rua
administration as a result of the unstable macroeconomic conditions and the uneven political support.
Three positive outcomes, however, emerged from this period: (i) the state modernization program
that was designed at the time provided a sound footprint for the modernization efforts that have been


                                                     31

pursued later on; (ii) the passage of key legislation that provided the legal framework for subsequent
reforms in procurement and e-government; and (iii) the management tools supported under this
operation were incorporated into the comprehensive modernization efforts undertaken by AFIP and
ANSES in the aftermath of the 2001-2002 crisis. Finally, the achievement of the PDO corresponding
to the Third Amendment is considered moderately satisfactory, as considerable progress was made in
the implementation of key public sector management tools, including SINTyS, which have been
gradually incorporated into Argentina's public sector, improving the efficiency, quality and overall
governance not only at the national level but also among provinces. However, the wide scope of the
modernization efforts together with the more incremental implementation strategy adopted by the
GoA during this period have resulted in valuable, although scattered impacts. More importantly, the
progress in procurement and human resources management, which offers great potential for gains in
transparency and efficiency, falls short of original expectations.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: Through the promotion of effective
public sector management, the operation has had a positive impact on poor and vulnerable groups.
Specific achievements in this area include improved access to information through e-government
mechanisms, improved targeting of social programs through improved M&E; implementation of
social accountability mechanisms to give "voice" to citizens to hold the state accountable; and
provision of value-added services through a more effective institutional framework, including better
information for decision- and policy-making and for program planning. In addition, the operation has
supported interventions with a particularly high impact on the poor and vulnerable sectors of the
population. For example, the adoption of ISO standards for the services provided by ANSES' field
offices has benefited the elderly, resulting in significant reductions in waiting time, provision of
adequate seating, and other important service improvements. Another intervention with a particularly
significant impact on gender and social development issues was the design and implementation of
Community Justice Centers, community information centers targeting the poorest segments of the
population, particularly women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening: The project has made substantial progress in modernizing
key horizontal management tools. As a result, it has drawn policy makers' attention to the potential

31  Disbursements at the time of restructuring are based on amounts reported in the supporting Memorandums to the
Presidents. Discrepancies with disbursements listed on Table G might arise from funds that had been transferred to the
project's Special Account but were not actually committed.



                                                          32

benefits of further strengthening public management. The operation's institutional impact can be
summarized as follows:
   Citizens' Charter Programs: The implementation of Citizens' Charter (Cartas Compromiso)
   constitutes a robust step toward the development of social accountability mechanisms.
   Human Resources Management: The diversity in terms of labor regimes (i.e. selection
   mechanisms and criteria, benefits, salaries, and career systems) within Argentina's public sector
   workforce has several negative impacts aside from inequity, including adding substantial
   complexity to the rationalization of human resources and efforts to link pay to performance, and
   workforce placement according to organizational needs. Thus, the partial harmonization of
   selected public employment regimes attained under this operation is an important step toward the
   improvement of the quality of public sector performance and a more equitable and satisfactory
   treatment to the entire government workforce. In addition, the creation of an electronic registry
   for SINAPA employees and another one for consultants has resulted in a substantial
   improvement in the statistics on the public workforce.
   E-government: At the macro level, the national plans are improving the level of information
   quality needed to support an efficient and transparent government and to strengthen policies
   toward citizen participation through more efficient and transactional government services. The
   national portal developed by the ONTI, for example, provides important information on services
   and governance processes with pilots on transactional services that will allow the citizen to
   initiate, track, and finalize a request online. This portal includes the Proceedings Guide, which
   aims at helping citizens to access updated standardized information on the services and
   proceedings provided by national government agencies. As a result of the continuous work of the
   ONTI on improving the e-government environment, public sector modernization in Argentina is
   moving towards a more integrative, reliable, widespread, and secure governance.
   By facilitating the systematic interchange of social and fiscal information among participating
   agencies, SINTyS has contributed to the enhancement of social programs and to the reduction of
   tax non-compliance. With SINTyS support, agencies are now better equipped to detect, among
   others, incompatibilities regarding the assignation of social benefits, overlaps in health coverage,
   employment status, thus providing the necessary elements to determine beneficiary eligibility. In
   the case of pensions and retirement benefits, SINTyS has permitted the early detection of
   deceased beneficiaries, stopping payments upon their death. Likewise, systematic exchange of
   fiscal information across national and provincial registries, including property, income, and tax
   information, has been vital to detect tax non-compliance, ultimately contributing to increasing
   efficiency, transparency and equity in tax administration at the national and provincial levels.
   Finally, SINTyS is becoming a valuable input in policy formulation and in the design of new
   social programs, particularly those under the CNCPS.
   Procurement: The consistent use of a good electronic information system by a growing number
   of government procuring entities using a single portal will lay the groundwork for important
   efficiency gains and lower prices and transaction costs for government procurement through
   increased competition, reduction in processing time, and streamlined procedures. It would also
   facilitate the ability of existing or new firms, especially small and medium-size enterprises that
   are not currently doing much business with the government, to successfully offer their goods and
   services, and eventually works, if the law is expanded to cover all aspects of procurement.
   State Modernization at the Subnational Level:         Several provinces have also identified e-
   government as the collaborative environment to deliver the objectives under the Public
   Administration Management Program and under the Fiscal Responsibility Law and to promote
   replicability and scalability of systems. While only agencies at the national level are required to
   comply with ONTI's national plans, provincial governments are increasingly adopting them
   voluntarily, including enacting e-government decrees similar to the ones at the national level and
   establishing an e-government coordinator figure to improve integration, coordinate information
   flow and quality, and reduce costs incurred by maintaining several different standards. The



                                                  33

    provinces of Mendoza, Cordoba, Salta, and Santa Fe are among the provinces exhibiting greater
    public sector integration as a result of their adoption of e-government.
    The improvement of information quality at the national and sub-national levels has also
    benefited from the coordination of the National Fiscal and Social Identification System
    (SINTyS) with the ONTI and the use of the National Plan for E-Government. When the project
    began in 1998 with the aim of improving information quality in social and fiscal programs by
    establishing an institutionalized information exchange system at the national, provincial, and
    municipal levels, national standards were poor and not enforced. Today, as a result of providing
    data standards and a security framework to national and provincial data exchange nodes based on
    a common ICT platform, information quality has improved substantially, in particular in the
    social and fiscal sectors.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: There were several valuable­albeit unintended--
outcomes that resulted from this operation, including: i) maintaining alive the policy dialogue on
state modernization between the authorities and the Bank in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis alive; ii)
strengthening civic engagement, particularly through the implementation of the e-government
application to facilitate the interaction between government and citizens; iii) increasing the
awareness of the need for state modernization among top government officials and civil servants
through debates, pilot programs and training that were conducted in several line ministries, as well
as highly visible national and international conferences; iv) strengthening the coordination role of the
CCO vis-à-vis other institutions; v) expanding the scope of the modernization efforts to also address
the needs of the private sector; and vi) most importantly, under the Third Amendment, to put the
state modernization issues higher on the agenda, through high-level conferences, seminars,
publications, and a deepened dialogue with stakeholders etc. This area of intervention was added in
2006 in response to the GoA's new emphasis on supporting private sector development. Seed money
was allocated to the formulation of strategic plans and programs, thus strengthening the recently
established investment promotion agency (Prosper-Ar).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Several factors suggest that the progress made under this operation is likely to be sustained,
including:

    Enabling legal framework: The legal framework provided by laws and decrees on digital
    signature, e-government, human resources management and procurement, among others, makes
    the sustainability of project outcomes more likely, as it provides the normative framework to
    move forward with development and implementation of these public sector management tools.
    Substantial advances in institutionalization: The recent upgrade in rank of the Office of
    Undersecretary of Public Management to Secretariat provides greater institutional weight to the
    modernization efforts supported under this operation. Likewise, the creation of the State
    Modernization National Directorate in 2005 and the SINTyS National Directorate in 2007
    constitute important steps in the institutionalization of the state modernization efforts. The
    creation of these agencies as permanent entities within Argentina's public sector also denotes
    strong support for the modernization efforts on the part of Argentinean authorities.
    Maturity in the modernization efforts: Unlike in 2001, when modernization efforts were still
    incipient, the modernization program is now more mature. Specifically, key actors such as the
    Secretariat of Public Management as well as ONTI, SINTyS and other actors in the
    modernization agenda, are widely respected at the national and provincial levels of government,
    as they have gained a reputation as credible brokers by playing a neutral, technical advisory role



                                                    34

    in supporting reforms and institutional strengthening that can be difficult to implement.
    Likewise, the management tools developed and implemented under the project have yielded
    tangible results when applied by individual agencies and are now intrinsic tools in their daily
    operations. Finally, the incremental, results-based strategy adopted by the GoA in the last stage
    of project implementation has proved to be effective in gradually advancing modernization
    efforts across a highly diverse universe of government agencies at the national- and sub-national
    level.
    Continuing Bank support: The Second State Modernization project (Loan N. 7449-AR) will
    consolidate and expand the achievements in the different cross-cutting public sector management
    areas (M&E, e-government, procurement, human resources management and citizen-centered
    accountability) as well as strengthen the Chief of Cabinet Office's strategy, organizational
    structure and coordination capacities to ensure the full institutionalization and consolidation of
    the different management tools implemented under this operation. Likewise, the Second SINTyS
    Project will continue to provide support to the expansion and consolidation of SINTyS, focusing
    particularly on ensuring the development of sound governance, data quality, technological and
    security frameworks.
    Transfer of tools to individual agencies: In those areas that will not be supported under the
    follow-up operations, such as Community Justice Centers, institutional support to the IGJ, and
    the Education Cost Observatories, transition arrangements have been implemented during 2006
    and 2007 to ensure that the capacities, methodologies and tools developed under the operation
    were fully transferred to the corresponding authorities. In the case of the Community Justice
    Centers, three out of four pilots are now in the hands of the corresponding municipalities, which
    run them autonomously. The system developed for the IGJ has been incorporated into the
    agencies' current procedures.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The performance of the Bank's team responsible for assisting the Borrower in identifying, preparing
and appraising the operation and the subsequent amendments is deemed Moderately Unsatisfactory.
While the Bank's team correctly identified valid areas of intervention (i.e. addressing the Y2K
problem) and windows of opportunity (i.e. the GoA's decision to tackle state modernization in a
comprehensive manner in 2000 and in a more incremental one in 2003), it also underestimated key
risks that severely undermined the feasibility of the actions being supported under the operation. The
more critical risk assessment failures, which are discussed in detailed in Section 2.1 ­ Quality at
Entry, can be summarized as follows: i) failure to identify inadequate implementation arrangements
for addressing the Y2K problem, including lack of authority of the PIU and the weak implementation
capacity of some government agencies; ii) failure to properly assess the impact of the departure of
the Vice President in 2000, who championed the state modernization program; and iii) failure to
assess the impact of the rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic and political environment on the state
modernization program in 2001.

(b)     Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the Bank's supervision for this operation is deemed Satisfactory. Aide Memoirs, Back-to-
Office reports and Project and Implementation Status Reports (PSRs and ISRs) demonstrate a close
supervision, in which the Bank's team maintained a close working relationship with the PIU and



                                                   35

from 2005, with SINTyS' PEU as well. However, performance and progress monitoring, including
the use of key indicators was weak, particularly during the first phase of implementation (Y2K
program) and after the Second Amendment. As mentioned above, the operation's Results
Framework was mainly based on output indicators, which provided a good roadmap with milestones
that helped monitoring project progress but, at the same time, were insufficient to assess the
operation's impact. This weakness was reverted to the extent possible during the last two years of
project implementation by, among other actions, identifying additional indicators, developing a new
project M&E system in conjunction with the PIU and other counterparts, and working together with
the counterparts in the individual agencies to ensure greater M&E and a greater focus on results, as
well as greater project institutionalization and sustainability.

Factors beyond the Bank's influence made supervision efforts particularly difficult, including: i) high
turnover, both at the highest levels of government, professional staff and at the PIU; ii) changing
government priorities; and iii) extended periods of inactivity or slow implementation. During the
more difficult times, particularly in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis, the Bank's supervision focused
mainly on maintaining the state modernization efforts alive.

Since the last Amendment, in line with the joint responsibility at the government level, two task
managers have shared responsibility for project supervision (one for the State Modernization
Components and one for Component H - SINTyS). This separation of tasks worked out well, as it
provided full independence to the two implementing government agencies and allowed for close
supervision by specialized Bank staff in each substantive area.

During the last two years of implementation, the Bank's teams focused on deepening client
engagement and identifying further opportunities for state modernization by actively promoting
dialogue with key government actors at the national level through bringing in best practices, key
international experts, conferences and seminars and visits to Washington, as well as expanding the
demand for state modernization reform at the CCO and in other government institutions by
deepening the dialogue on existing areas and new agenda-setting on additional areas. In the case of
both State Modernization and SINTyS, the dialogue was also promoted at the subnational levels. In
addition, policy dialogue was deepened by exposing key government actors to cutting-edge
international experience through study tours (i.e. a study tour to Chile to study their M&E system,
one to Korea to learn from its e-government system, and another one to Spain, Belgium and Latvia to
learn from their information exchange systems) and conferences (i.e. two International State
Modernization Seminars that were attended by key actors from different countries, including former
Presidents, academics and senior public sector officials). These efforts set the groundwork for the
development of two robust follow-up operations (i.e., State Modernization II and SINTyS II). In this
regard, it is worth mentioning that the Quality at Entry Assessment for the State Modernization II
specifically highlighted the quality of the operation's technical analysis. Finally, as mentioned
before, the Bank deepened the dialogue with government to incorporate a greater focus on results,
and help build greater project sustainability and institutionalization.

(c) Justification for Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall Bank's Performance is deemed Moderately Satisfactory for the reasons stated above and the
following considerations:

It is worth noting that the Bank effectively integrated this project with other operations in the Bank's
portfolio, creating positive synergies within the portfolio and contributing to their mutual
strengthening. Specifically, the following operations were closely related to this operation in terms of
either their focus or mutually reinforcing support: ANSES TAL I & II (Loans No. 4131-AR 7318-
AR), SINTyS operation (Loan No. 4459-AR), FOSIP TAL (Loan No. 3958-AR), Governance 21
(appraised but not yet presented to the Board), the First and Second Provincial Development Loans



                                                   36

(Loans No. 3280-AR and 3877-AR) and the First Structural Adjustment Loan (Loan No. 7075-AR;
SAL-I). Approved in 2001, the SAL-I was particularly important, as it helped individual government
agencies, such as ANSES, maintain focus on state modernization during the 2001-2002 period and
prevent the reversal of the progress made so far during a period of utmost political and economic
upheaval.

    The Bank favored flexibility over orthodoxy when it: i) drastically restructured the operation to
support the state modernization agenda of the de la Rua administration; and ii) incorporated the
SINTyS component to overcome the tight availability of financing under the 2004-2005 CAS
envelope. In this context, it is important to bring attention to the particularly challenging country
conditions and the fact that both actions were approved by the Board.

    While the decision not to cancel the operation in 2002 can be debatable, it is clear that
maintaining the operation alive served to continue dialogue with mid-level government officials
during a period when other channels of communication between the Bank and the GoA were closed.
Eventually, this decision served to ensure the continuity of state modernization efforts, albeit with a
more reduced scope.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The government's performance and commitment has been highly uneven. As discussed above, while
some administrations provided reasonable support to the Project, other administrations were largely
indifferent toward its implementation. Even during periods of reported political support, the
Government exhibited little agility in its internal approval procedures, which generated unnecessary
delays in the implementation process.

While the 2002 State Modernization Program correctly diagnosed the main weaknesses of
Argentina's public sector and devised the conceptual blueprint for the modernization program, it is
important to stress that the merits for the progress achieved in the areas of state modernization under
the operation have to be attributed primarily to efforts done from 2003 onward. Likewise, SINTyS
authorities have demonstrated their unwavering support for Component H since its inclusion in this
operation.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the performance of the two implementing agencies (i.e. the one responsible for state
modernization components housed in the Chief of Cabinet Office and the one responsible for
Component H ­ SINTyS located under the CNCPS) is rated satisfactory.

    State Modernization Components: Satisfactory. As mentioned earlier, during the Y2K phase, the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) lacked the mandate and the political power needed to adequately
implement the project. The PIU was substantially strengthened later on, exhibiting sound technical
capacity during the preparation of the State Modernization Program in 2000. The State
Modernization Secretary, which was then responsible for the operation, recruited top-notch
professionals, both within the country and abroad to support the design of the state modernization
program. For example, the main "architect" of the state modernization reform program had been also
one of the architects of Argentina's financial administration system (Sistema Integrado de
Información Financiera ­ SIDIF), which was implemented during the 1990s. Support was also
received from top international experts from Chile, New Zeeland and the USA, including one of the
advisors to U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Not surprisingly, the PIU's technical soundness was unable



                                                   37

to compensate for the loss of political support that occurred in mid-2000 with the resignation of Vice
President Alvarez. Performance deteriorated sharply in the years after the crisis (2002-2003), when
project implementation was virtually stalled. From the end of 2003 until project closing, the PIU was
once again staffed with capable and dedicated professionals. Its strong performance during the last
three years of the project constituted a drastic turn-around in project management, which, in turn,
was a key factor in ensuring the turn-around of the operation itself. The PIU has fulfilled its
responsibilities, including monitoring the execution and evaluation of project activities, keeping
records of all procurement operations, ensuring compliance with Bank guidelines, monitoring
compliance with legal covenants, maintaining records for all activities, preparing and submitting
progress reports to the Bank and collaborating with the preparation of this ICR. Moreover, to ensure
that the preparation of the Second State Modernization Project fully capitalized on the achievements
and lessons learned under this operation, the PIU fully collaborated with the Bank team by
incorporating additional indicators and activities. The permanency of some key PIU staff throughout
the life of the project was an important factor ensuring a minimum level of continuity despite the
frequent changes in administrations. The assessment of an independent audit showed that hiring
practices and performance of individual consultants under the operation had been satisfactory. An
important institutional advancement was the creation of the State Modernization Project Directorate
in 2005. Housed under the Chief of Cabinet Office, it is responsible for coordinating the
implementation of state modernization efforts. Since then, the PIU has been fully integrated within
the Directorate.

     Component H ­ SINTyS: Satisfactory. The SINTyS Project Executing Unit is composed of a
group of top-notch professionals, with sound expertise not only in ICT but also in the structure of
Argentina's public sector and the wide array of social programs and fiscal entities operating at the
three levels of government (i.e. national, provincial, and municipal). They have been a key element
in the success of SINTyS' expansion, not only among agencies at the national level but also at the
provincial level. Their proactive and cooperative approach has been key in overcoming institutional
barriers and resistance on the part of other government agencies.

(c) Justification for Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory on account of the erratic
behavior on the part of the Borrower over the life of the project. Once again, it is important to point
out that overall Borrower's performance from 2003 onward has been critical to the operation's
success, as the political support for the modernization efforts was rekindled, the factors threatening
the success of the project were successfully addressed, and project implementation took renewed
momentum. Likewise, in the case of SINTyS, the Borrower has exhibited both consistent political
support and sound technical and institutional capacity, which accounted for the successful
implementation of Component H.

6. Lessons Learned

Lessons of general application

Context matters:        The project's implementation was severely affected by the unstable
macroeconomic conditions that prevailed in the late 1990s and eventually resulted in the country's
collapse in December 2001. By keeping the operation alive in the aftermath of the crisis, the Bank
succeeded in maintaining modernization efforts on the public agenda, although actual progress was
initially very slow.

The objective of state modernization: State modernization is not an objective in itself but a means to
help the state to carry out its functions, primarily in service delivery and facilitation of private sector



                                                    38

development. It is, therefore, important to combine state modernization efforts aiming at improving
the inner workings of the state with efforts to improve areas that are also relevant to individual
citizens and businesses, such as enhanced provision of services and actions aimed at private sector
development and investment promotion. Likewise, it is important to balance fiscal and qualitative
impacts.

The pace of reform: The process of altering the structure and functioning of the public
administration to ultimately increase the efficacy, efficiency, and transparency of the state is, by
nature, an arduous and long-term process. In this context, it is important to fully capitalize on
windows of opportunity for drastic change and to "keep going" during periods when only
incremental and gradual change is feasible. As demonstrated by Argentina's experience since the
crisis, public sector modernization can also be tackled gradually, in strategically chosen areas that
build upon and scale up early results. This implies an incremental approach that envisages public
sector modernization as a series of carefully sequenced and targeted series of steps, seizing windows
of opportunity in those areas where government ownership is high.

The importance of being strategic: Although, as discussed above, this operation has demonstrated
the merits of supporting gradual, incremental state modernization efforts, it also calls attention to the
need to be strategic, focusing resources on those areas with the greatest potential impact. Otherwise,
there is the danger of dissipating efforts and making the implementation process overly complex.

Legislation is not enough: The experience under this operation indicates that the existence and even
passage of enabling legal and institutional frameworks does not ensure actual state modernization.
Although Decree 103/2001 provided a solid foundation to much needed public sector reforms, it was
unable to overcome the resistance and intrinsic difficulties of implementing them. Only after the
2001 crisis drastically changed the system of incentives due to, among other factors, the severity of
fiscal conditions, it became possible to move forward on the arduous and long path of state
modernization.

Balancing "vertical" and "horizontal" reforms: The successful reforms of ANSES and AFIP
indicate that reform-minded leadership is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of
"vertical" reforms that profoundly transform individual agencies. However, there is also a need for
"horizontal" reforms with a cross-cutting impact throughout the public sector. There are areas of
public sector modernization that specifically call for horizontal reforms, including: a) the
modernization of government-wide systems, like financial administration, procurement, and human
resources management; b) when there is a need to establish "rules of the games" to guide the efforts
of individual agencies to ultimately minimize inefficiencies and maximize synergies, such as in the
case e-government; and c) the development of management tools that can be applied by individual
agencies across the public sector to ultimately capitalize on the potential for horizontal fertilization
and economies of scale.

Entry-points for state modernization: It is important to identify and expand "entry points" to build
up consensus for broader reform. As shown by this operation, such consensus can be increased
through the combination of both "supply-side" reforms, such as institutional and capacity
strengthening, and "demand-induced" reforms, through engagement with civil society and the private
sector. Likewise, entry-points for state modernization do not necessarily have to be of a fiscal nature,
and can be more oriented towards improved service-delivery, greater trust in government and other
areas.




                                                  39

Capitalize on the potential of ICT tools: Information and communication technology (ICT) can
effectively improve public management, service delivery, as well as enhance effectiveness of
poverty reduction programs and tax evasion.

Project-specific lessons

Pragmatic client engagement: As illustrated by this operation, it can be very challenging to strike a
balance between what is technically best and what is politically feasible. To maintain and deepen
client engagement, the Bank may agree to technically less ambitious but politically more feasible
interventions with the understanding that such a pragmatic approach can impact closely the policy
dialogue over the short and long term. One of the trade-offs here might also be a greater focus on
outputs than on outcomes in light of the existing government commitment on new areas, rather than
not supporting certain areas at all.

Trade-offs typical of public sector TALs: As illustrated by this operation, public sector technical
assistance operations are often confronted with a trade-off between, on the one hand, ensuring a solid
project design that allows for clear ex-post evaluation (standard project paradigm) and the desire, on
the other hand, to stay closely engaged with the client as the state modernization agenda evolves, as
it often does, in a non-linear, stop-and-go manner. Privileging the latter almost inevitably leads to a
complex end-product that is not well suited for traditional ex-post evaluation. While there is no
simple answer to this tradeoff, it is important to take into account when evaluating the impact of
operations of these characteristics.

Modernization of subnational governments: This operation has demonstrated alternative ways to
transfer the institutional and technical know-how developed at the national level. It has done so
through direct institutional support but also by demonstration, as illustrated by the voluntary
adoption of national standards and legislation by provincial governments.

Proactive Client Engagement: Engagement rather than disengagement can often be more effective
in producing the desired changes. As shown by the ongoing project, demand for the greater reforms
can be induced by pro-active engagement, such as by sharing international practices and fostering
continuous dialogue among stakeholders on key issues, helping build coalitions of change.

Coordination is vital: The substantial achievements in the area of e-government have been possible
to the cooperation and coordination exhibited by ONTI and SINTyS. In particular, the SINTyS'
infrastructure platform responds to ONTI's E-Government plan and the corresponding
interoperability and security frameworks. In addition, ONTI and SINTyS have collaborated in the
development of data standards, as this is an area in which their responsibilities overlap.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies (see Annex 7 for the full text of the GoA's comments)
The GoA has provided its comments, summarizing its views with respect to both the operation and
the ICR. With respect to the operation, the GoA stresses the importance that it has had in all stages of
implementation in: i) averting Y2K disruptions as originally designed; ii) providing a conceptual
framework for state modernization under Amendments 1 & 2, despite the fact that the proposed
modernization strategy overly emphasized fiscal issues; and iii) most significantly, advancing toward
state modernization in areas that are key priorities for the GoA under Amendment 3. With respect to
the ICR, the GoA suggested higher rating regarding the ICR's rating of Moderately Satisfactory for
the operation's overall performance, which, in turn, is based on ratings Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, and Moderately Satisfactory for the periods before, during, and after the
First and Second Amendments, respectively. Instead, the GoA considers that an overall rating of



                                                   40

Satisfactory more appropriately reflects the operation's achievement, based on ratings of Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory and Highly satisfactory for the periods mentioned above. In
addition, the GoA expresses its views on some of the analysis presented by the ICR in terms of the
overall achievement of objectives and observations regarding, among others, the lack of focus in the
reform efforts and delays in the presentation of procurement documentation after the operation's
closing. The full-text comments submitted by the GoA are included in Annex 7.

F. Reform of Selected Programs in Key Public Agencies and Decentralized Entities (2001-2003)
  Reform roadmap for ANSES completed by May 2002. Management tools developed under the operation
  (Citizens' Charter, Annual Performance Agreements, streamlining of administrative procedures) were tested
  in ANSES and eventually became core management tools within the agency.
  Similarly, the operation served to support reform efforts within AFIP through technical support for the
  development of strategic plan and the implementation of management tools.
  Although technical assistance was provided to the Ministry of Education, no significant outcome was
  achieved, except the implementation of Cost Observatories for the systematic comparison of education-
  related costs across provinces.

G. Promoting Provincial Government Reform
  Outputs for this component are detailed under the Third Amendment.
Third Amendment ­ Continuing and Additional Components

E. Creation of a New Public Management Model

E. 1. Management by Results and Citizens' Charter Programs(CCP)
  Introduced a results-based management culture in key institutions with 29 public agencies with active
  strategic plans linked to their budget allocation and operational plans.
  Strategic plans were developed or updated for 27 national agencies.
  Conducted management assessments in five key agencies in order to define future institutional reform needs.
  Provided improved information for decision-making through information systems for ex-ante and ex-post
  evaluation.
  Citizens' Charters are implemented in 50 agencies, representing 90 percent of service-delivery agencies in
  the national government. More than 100 quality standards have been established for about 900 products and
  services covered under the CCP.         User surveys and focus groups in the participating agencies show
  improved service delivery in 80 percent of the cases.
  Twelve agencies have adopted Citizens' Report Cards to systematically collect feedback from users based on
  their perception of the quality level of the services received. Another 35 agencies have implemented call
  centers or other mechanisms to receive users' complaints.
   Five provincial governments sought support to replicate Citizens' Charters in 10 provincial agencies in 2007.
  Establishment of the Under-Secretariat of Budget Coordination and Evaluation at the CCO in 2003, exercising
  functions of coordination, evaluation, and monitoring of the national strategic policies.

E. 2. Human Resources Management
  The public employment framework law (Law No. 25,164) was enacted in 1999, but it lacked the
  corresponding regulatory and administrative framework, as the corresponding implementing decree, which



                                                        43

  was signed on the last day of the Menem administration (December 9, 1999), was subsequently repealed
  under the de la Rua administration. This legislation is now regulated by Decree 1421 of August 2002, and
  administrative resolution SGP No. 48/02, which establishes new rules for fixed-term contracts.
  Work has begun on developing a uniform job classification and salary scheme for gradual application across
  the central administration. A new collective agreement, sanctioned by Decree 214/06 signals the intent to
  unify 12 of the 34 labor regimes, and a schedule for negotiations through 2011 has been set up.
  The Public Employment Office (ONEP) has nearly completed a registry of all contracted employees. In
  addition, progress has also been made in bringing the system of individual contracts in line with the principles
  of the civil service law. Progress include ONEP's review of all contracts with salaries over Arg.$2,000 a month
  to ensure the candidate is qualified for the job, and the transfer of 15,000 contracted employees to a regime
  that imposes salary ceilings, but also gives them additional benefits (Decrees 1421, 707/2005 and
  2031/2006). The remaining 20 percent (under Decree 1184) generally hold shorter term but better paying
  appointments for highly technical work. The previous system of "transitory" status, is gradually being faced
  out.
  The merit-based career system for National System of Administrative Professionals (Sistema Nacional de
  Profesión Administrativa ­ SINAPA) has been strengthened. As SINAPA is the most important human
  resources regime, covering over 20 percent of civilian employees within the central administration, this
  represents a significant step toward the creation of a single, merit-based civil service system.
  The ONEP, in conjunction with ONTI, has developed a Central Civil Servants Registry (Sistema de Registro
  de Personal y Evaluaciones - SIREPEVA), which covers all SINAPA employees. The registry is available on
  the government's intranet for consultation and continuous updating by public official. This constitutes an
  important step toward the development of a single database and standardized personnel files for all national
  public employees.
  Statistics on the public workforce have improved in coverage and quality as the result of these two electronic
  personnel registries. Together, these two registries cover approximately 19 percent of all employees (civilian
  and armed forces) within the central administration, as SINAPA and contracted employees represent
  approximately 10 and 9 percent, respectively.
  Strengthened the merit-based career system SINAPA, including the creation of a Central Civil Servants
  Registry (SIREPEVA), covering SINAPA employees that represent over 20 percent of national Government
  employees. Registry available on the Web for consultation and continuous updating.

E. 3. Training
  More than 20 e-learning courses have been developed, addressing the specific training needs of government
  agencies, including electoral committees (mesas electorales), financial administration, e-government,
  Citizens' Charters, conflict resolution, and tourism.
  A total of 6,150 public employees have been trained using e-courses by 2007 (compared to a target of 2,000).

E. 4. E-Government
  The creation of the National Information Technology Office (Oficina Nacional de Tecnología de la Información
  - ONTI) in 2002 constituted a major cornerstone in the development of e-government in Argentina, as it has
  provided a new systemic view for e-government development.
  The development and implementation of a National E-Government Plan that provides a common policy
  framework for e-government and ICT development and integration in the public administration. This Plan is
  based on findings of an assessment of the use of ICTs at the national level carried out by the ONTI.
  The development of a new government portal (http:www.argentina.gov.ar), which provides general
  information about the country and the national public administration and its structure, as well as information
  particularly targeted to citizens, businesses, and foreigners (information for foreigners is available in English).
  The Digital Signature (Law N° 25.506), which was enacted in December 2001, establishes the obligation of
  the national Government to implement this technology within five years and apply it to all the laws, decrees
  administrative decisions, resolutions and rulings from the national public sector. The digital signature is vital
  for the further digitalization of administrative procedures, as it enhances security in internal communications
  by guarantying the identity of the signer and the integrity of the message.32 ONTI is the designated technical
  administrative body responsible for granting the licenses to the certificate service providers and supervising
  its activities. The Registration Authority has been delegated to the respective jurisdictions. In addition,
  several pilot applications for digital signature have been implemented in the Ministry of Economy and
  Production, the Judicial Power, and the General Justice Inspection Office.


32   A digital signature is a set of data associated to a digital message that guarantees the identity of the signer and the
integrity of the message. A digital signature does not imply to assure the confidentiality of the message; a document
digitally signed can be visualized by other people, the same as when it is signed holographically. A digital signature is an
instrument with technical and legal characteristics. This means that there are technical procedures that allow the creation
and verification of digital signatures and there are regulatory documents that support the legal value that such signatures
have.



                                                             44

  A response unit was created that centralizes and coordinates the government efforts to manage security
  attacks or potential breaches.
  A forum for IT personnel was launched to promote internal knowledge sharing and collaboration.

E. 5. Administrative Procedures
  The new government portal also hosts an electronic directory of government procedures (the so-called "Portal
  de Trámites"), which includes over 750 procedures (trámites) within the central administration, 50 of which
  can be processed electronically. This achievement amply exceeds the original target of 400 procedures, and
  10 electronic ones. Based on the information provided by individual government agencies, the portal
  describes in detail the steps and requirements associated with all government services procedures. The
  largest number of inquires corresponds to passport and national identification documents applications and
  renewals.
  Efforts to streamline administrative procedures focused mainly on supporting the efforts of individual agencies
  to adopt ISO norms (i.e., the Quality Management Standard developed by the International Organization of
  Standardization - ISO) as a way to improve the quality and efficiency of 13 procedures, many of them
  focusing on attention to the public. ANSES is one of the agencies that have adopted ISO norms to enhance
  their customer service processes. In particular, ANSES has obtained ISO 9001:2000 accreditations for two of
  its call centers and for the quality customer service procedures implemented in all its field offices.

E. 6. Procurement
  Support was provided for the design of a new procurement law (Law No. 1.023), which was enacted in 2001.
  It incorporates higher standards of transparency and an emphasis on competitive procedures for the national
  government. The failure to issue a sound set of supporting implementing regulations, documents and
  guidance has limited the potential impact of this legislation. The law does not cover public works
  The National Procurement Office (Oficina Nacional de Contrataciones - ONC) has developed a procurement
  portal (http:www.argentinacompra.gov.ar) and an e-procurement system (Sistema Electrónico de
  Contrataciones Públicas - SECOP) for small purchases below US$3,000. SECOP was recently launched
  through a presidential decree and ONC expects that, once tested, it can be extended to apply to larger size
  purchase in several stages. Furthermore, the government is taking significant steps to integrate SECOP with
  other public sector management systems, most notably the country's integrated financial administration
  system. By the end of 2007 the procurement portal had received the sizeable amount of 1.1 million visits.
  Despite the progress made so far, however, SECOP is only being used by roughly 5 percent of the national
  administration.
  A registry of suppliers has been created, with approximately 18,000 suppliers and a list of reference prices--
  some of these reference prices, which are established by the National Contracting Office, only have
  informational value. Part of the documentation required from vendors is held by other agencies (e.g., AFIP);
  obligatory use of lists of standard prices (precios testigos) determined by SIGEN.
  Advances have been made in standardizing procurement documents and publicizing procurement processes
  on the Internet, especially the announcement of proposed procurement opportunities, better accessibility to
  bidding documents, and notification of the final awards. However, only 5 percent of procurement plans are
  currently being advertised publicly per year.

F. Reform of Selected Programs in Key Agencies & Decentralized Entities (2004-2007)

F. 1&2. Monitoring and Evaluation Systems
  Developed and tested prototype of a control panel in the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security
  for M&E of plans, programs, and projects.
  By the end of 2007 SIG prototypes had also been implemented in the Ministry of Justice, the Undersecretary
  of Emergencies of the City of Buenos Aires, and partially at the National Senate and the National Statistics
  Entity (INDEC).
  Developed a new methodology for impact evaluation at the Ministry of Social Development.
  Agreements for implementation of SIG in municipal governments were signed with the Ministry of the Interior.


F. 3. Design System for Public Physical Assets
  Asset Management "Module" was designed.
  Analyzed legal, technical, institutional, financial, and economic variables and the interactions in asset
  management framework.
  Conducted initial inventory of public physical assets.
  Tested application of system in selected entities.

F. 4. Community Justice Centers
  Four Community Justice Centers established, operating with agreed upon standards.
  Sustainability of the Justice Hall Model assessed.

F.5. Strengthening of the Justice General Inspectorate
  Re-engineered processes to transfer corporations' financial information.
  Scanned and digitalized accumulated stock.

G. Promoting Provincial Government Reform
  Organized seminars and conferences with representatives of different provinces to facilitate knowledge
  sharing and promote the dissemination of best practices
  Assisted in the implementation of different management tools (Citizens' charters, procedures guide, etc) in
  several provinces.
  By end of 2007 working agreements had been signed with 23 provinces to transfer technical skills, raise
  awareness on public management tools, and continue to work on the basis of a province-specific agenda.

H. SYNTyS

H. 1. Improvement of Social Services
  Benefits from this sub-component are estimated at approximately US$57 million during 2006 and 2007,
  arising from the detection of ineligible beneficiaries in social programs at both national and provincial levels.
  As of November 2007, 99 percent of the population without coverage was properly identified, compared to an
  original target of 95 percent. By contributing to enhance data quality and identification of population without
  health coverage, SINTyS has contributed to the identification of individuals with double coverage as well as
  the formulation of social programs expanding health coverage among the more vulnerable sectors of the
  population.
  The digitalization of civil registries has contributed toward enhancing the quality of information on vital facts
  for the population (i.e. birth, marriage, divorce, children, and death), which is not only for the accurate
  identification of individuals per se but also of their family relationships, which often constitute the basis for the
  granting of social benefits. So far, efforts have focused on 13 provincial civil registries (compared to an
  original target of four registries), resulting in the identification of family relationships for 3 million individuals
  (equivalent to approximately 9 million family relationships).
  SINTyS has provided support to the Ministry of Science and Technology in its efforts to develop computerized
  information systems on the student population, the so-called Single Student File (Legajo Único de Alumnos ­
  LUA), within each provincial jurisdiction, thus filling a serious void regarding the identification of minors (i.e.
  less than 18 years of age) and their educational history. Likewise, SINTyS data is being used by the CNCPS
  as an input in the design of social programs. So far, LUA systems have been already developed in 14
  provinces, resulting in the registry of more than 4.3 million students (equivalent to 43 percent of the country's
  student population compared to an original target of 55 percent).

H. 2. Improving Fiscal Efficiency
  Benefits in the fiscal component resulting from reducing tax non-compliance, including the detection of tax
  fraud, arrears and evasion, have amounted to approximately US$5.4 million between 2006 and 2007.
  The majority of provincial registries of juridical persons (e.g., corporations, limited liability companies,
  cooperatives, etc.) do not have their data available in electronic form. This situation makes it difficult to
  identify juridical persons in an accurate and timely manner and access key information regarding their
  operation, such as their constitution, dissolution, mergers, and registry of authorities. So far, efforts to
  "virtually consolidate" these registries have focused on 6 provinces. Electronic information is currently
  available for approximately 41 percent of the overall universe of juridical persons, compared to an original
  target of 45 percent.
  Provincial registries of deeds are highly uneven in terms of their modernization efforts, with some provinces
  utilizing state-of-the-art computerized systems while others still have fully manual systems. The adoption of
  modern technologies in these registries is key not only for improving the functioning of the registries
  themselves but also for enhancing the linkages between provincial property registries, cadastre systems and
  tax administration systems, which are vital for property tax collection. So far, efforts to "virtually consolidate"
  these registries have focused on 10 provinces. Deed and ownership information (i.e. deed registration,
  proprietor, and inhibitions) is currently available in electronic form for approximately 61 percent of all
  residential properties in the country based on the 2001 census, compared to an initial target of 65 percent.
  Concomitantly, SINTyS has also supported efforts to develop a virtual inter-jurisdictional registry of property
  owners and deeds inhibitions (Red Inter-jurisdiccional de Inhibiciones y Titulares de Dominio) to, among other
  benefits, facilitate the application of commercial justice.
  SINTyS has supported the efforts of the National Securities Commission (Comisión Nacional de Valores ­
  CNV) to incorporate the tax ID code (CUIT) to all financial fiduciaries. As a result, 100 percent of all financial
  fiduciaries have been identified with the corresponding CUIT, compared to an original target of 80 percent.
  As a result of the exchange of information under SINTyS, 90,000 physical and legal entities are now identified
  with the corresponding CUIT, compared to the initial target of 7,000 entities.




                                                           46

H. 3. Technological Framework and Infrastructure
  The design of SINTyS' interconnection model, including its technological platform, has been completed and
  successfully tested. Hardware, software and exchange links to be adopted by SINTyS will be selected based
  on the experience gathered under this operation.
  SINTyS has supported the development of normalized procedures to be used by participating entities.
  SINTyS effectively integrates approximately 500 individual databases using uniform standards.
  Six (compared to an original target of eight) of the 13 SINTyS provincial field offices (SPFOs) are inter-
  connected online, which is the next stage for SINTyS' decentralization.
  A Technical Board (mesa técnica) with representatives from AFIP, ANSES and RENAPER33 has been
  established to help build consensus among the major players at the national level on key technical issues.
  Support has been provided for the development and implementation of service-oriented applications such as
  the "One-Stop Institutional Window" (Ventanilla Única de Organismos - VUO), of which six (compared to a
  target of four) have been deployed in different government agencies, including PAMI.
  SINTyS and ONTI have jointly defined standards for the most commonly used 30 data categories--i.e., name,
  address, date of birth, gender, etc.--that are expected to soon be adopted as national standards.

H. 4. Organizational, Institutional and Legal Framework
  SINTyS has established itself as an effective broker of information within Argentina's public sector, promoting
  the exchange of information across government agencies at the national and provincial levels. There are
  approximately 200 government entities currently participating in SINTyS, including 24 entities at the national
  level (incl. AFIP, ANSES and RENAPER), 177 entities at the provincial level, and 11 entities at the municipal
  level.
  SINTyS has formalized agreements or is working jointly with several federal councils (consejos federales),
  including those gathering information from health insurers, housing institutes and property registers from all
  provincial jurisdictions.
  SINTyS has also set in motion its expansion process at the sub-national level to progressively incorporate
  provincial and municipal governments. Currently, all 24 provincial jurisdictions have already subscribed to
  agreements formalizing their incorporation to SINTyS, of which 13 have established SINTyS provincial filed
  offices (SPFOs).
  In addition, there have been significant advances toward the permanent institutionalization of SINTyS within
  Argentina's public sector. A mayor step was taken in December 2007, when SINTyS was established as a
  National Directorate under the National Coordination Council for Social Policies (Consejo Nacional de
  Coordinación de Políticas Sociales ­ CNCPS), reflecting the national authorities' commitment toward the
  permanent institutionalization of SINTyS within Argentina's public sector.

H. 5. Security Framework
  SINTyS now has in place a security team familiar with the national and regional security frameworks and
  international security best practices.
  A common security framework has been developed for all the sub-components and physical infrastructure of
  the project and physical infrastructure protection is gradually being implemented in all SINTyS locations and
  hardware connected to the network.
  The design of the legal framework has been assessed, in particular privacy of information and confidentiality
  measures. Specifically, Argentina's Habeas Data Law (Law No. 25.326) provides an adequate legal
  framework for the protection of private information at the national level. There is a close working relationship
  between SINTyS and the National Directorate of Personal Data Protection (Dirección Nacional de Protección
  de Datos Personales - DNPDP).
  SINTyS has actively collaborated with the DNPDP to define access rights to information from individual
  agencies--the so-called roles and profiles (Roles y Perfiles). In addition, a system is in place within SINTyS to
  grant access to information to individual agencies according to the roles and profiles defined jointly with the
  DNPDP.
  Basic security processes and procedures are in place, including encryption, and physical control
  environments have been defined and are being implemented. An implementation plan has been defined.
  SINTyS has been granted registration authority for ONTI's certification of digital signature certification to, in
  turn, adopt digital signature for its communications (Disposition No. 55/2007 ­ UCP-CNPS).

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Se considera correcta la distinción en etapas del Proyecto entre las versiones "Original", "Primera y
Segunda Enmiendas", y "Tercera Enmienda". Representan cambios importantes en los objetivos y
prioridades de la ejecución, que fueron en cada caso propuestos por el Gobierno y acordados con el
Banco.
Sobre el diseño y la preparación.
Proyecto Original: aunque se comparte la evaluación de "Moderadamente Satisfactorio", vale
resaltar que el Gobierno Argentino sostuvo desde el comienzo que la amenaza del Y2K constituía un
fenómeno de incertidumbre y de riesgos por tanto no medibles, lo que fue confirmado por los
estudios ejecutados en el marco del Proyecto. Se acordó con el Banco no vincular la ejecución a un
inventario previamente definido de intervenciones, de modo que el monto del préstamo surgió de un
juicio prudencial según los elementos disponibles en el momento. El mencionado "sobre-
dimensionamiento" resultó entonces de la escasa magnitud de la amenaza -tal como fue revelada por
la realidad y confirmada internacionalmente-, y no de un error de estimación que ni el Gobierno ni el
Banco estaban en condiciones de realizar.
El diseño de los subprogramas individuales era parte de la ejecución general, y se estableció en
consecuencia un comité específico de aprobación para cada requerimiento de los diferentes
Organismos de la Administración Nacional. Ello no suponía "excesos de flexibilidad" ni debilidad
en la supervisión, sino que reflejaba ajustadamente la mecánica de ejecución acordada, y permitió
realizar las tareas que el Gobierno consideró prioritarias.
Primera y Segunda Enmiendas: en este caso la evaluación del ICR se desdobla, calificando la
preparación de la Primera Enmienda como "Moderadamente Satisfactoria" y la de la Segunda
Enmienda como "Insatisfactoria". El Banco atribuye los defectos en el diseño, en especial de la
Segunda Enmienda, a la inadecuada consideración de la falta de apoyo político a las reformas
planteadas, y de las condiciones macroeconómicas desfavorables en que se encontraba el país. Vale
resaltar que ambos aspectos se encuentran vinculados: las reformas de los años 1990 sufrían un
creciente desprestigio político y ciudadano debido en gran medida a la prolongada recesión que se
atravesaba desde 1998 y a su marcado impacto sobre las tasas de desempleo y pobreza (inéditas en la
historia reciente del país).
A juicio del Gobierno Argentino, sin embargo, el defecto principal proviene de su diseño interno: se
trataba de un intento de modernización y reforma extraordinariamente comprensivo, concebido como
un proceso técnico "de arriba hacia abajo", cuya concreción sólo dependía en apariencia de la
decisión superior de ejecutarlo. Más aún, la Segunda Enmienda pretendía contribuir a la obtención
de las metas fiscales contenidas en un acuerdo entre el Gobierno y el FMI.
La experiencia demostró que la modernización del Estado constituye un proceso institucional, en el
cual los impactos fiscales se ubican en un segundo orden de prioridad. Exige una aproximación
gradual y el desarrollo de consensos sólo obtenibles a través de una conducción con una marcada
visión política. Dicha experiencia fue precisamente recogida en la Tercera Enmienda.
Tercera Enmienda: el ICR expresa adecuadamente la intención de recoger en la Tercera Enmienda
las lecciones aprendidas y la revisión de la estrategia de modernización decidida por la
administración del Presidente Kirchner desde 2003. Afirma sin embargo que, aún cuando se
estableció un Plan Operativo con metas de ejecución semestrales para cada actividad, la Enmienda
no incluyó una revisión profunda de la Estructura de Resultados previstos para el Proyecto, "lo que
resultó en una batería extensa y no jerárquica de indicadores de avance". Ello es inexacto, ya que no
sólo el Objetivo de Desarrollo fue modificado significativamente ­formalizando la estrategia gradual
y progresiva impulsada por el Gobierno-, sino que los indicadores de avance de cada Componente
fueron revisados y modificados intensivamente, tal como consta en el texto de la Enmienda
convenida.
Los juicios favorables presentados con respecto a la preparación del Componente H. SINTyS ­
"componentes y actividades diseñados para apoyar perfectamente la implementación de la Fase II del

Programa, junto con una robusta estructura de resultados" y "un Plan Operativo detallado
desarrollado para el período 2005-2006"- son plenamente aplicables a los Componentes de
Modernización del Estado. A juicio del Gobierno, en consecuencia, la calificación del diseño de la
Tercera Enmienda debería ser "Altamente Satisfactoria".
Sobre la implementación.
El texto del ICR resalta adecuadamente el impacto negativo de la inestabilidad política y económica
sufrida por el país a fines de los años 1990, y categoriza dichos elementos como factores fuera del
control del Gobierno y de la UCP. Sin embargo adjudica al Gobierno cambios en sus prioridades y
un apoyo político desparejo hacia el Proyecto como elementos bajo su control. En realidad se trata de
consecuencias del mismo fenómeno de inestabilidad general, y son igualmente ajenos a la voluntad
del Gobierno. Las urgencias sociales determinaban un necesario cambio de prioridades que no sienta
precedente alguno con respecto al compromiso y la voluntad del Gobierno referidos al programa de
Modernización del Estado. También resultan una explicación muy clara de las demoras en los
desembolsos, en medio de una súbita y enorme crisis fiscal. Felizmente, dichos problemas fueron
rápidamente superados, tanto desde el ángulo macroeconómico como desde el punto de vista de la
ejecución del Proyecto.
También se menciona como un aspecto negativo de implementación que el Proyecto presentaba una
excesiva dispersión en el número de áreas y agencias en que debía intervenir, con acciones
demasiado específicas y de limitado impacto, citando algunas actividades comprendidas en la
Tercera Enmienda dentro del Componente F. Modernización de Áreas Seleccionadas de la
Administración Pública Nacional. En otras partes del documento se alude a que algunas de las metas
establecidas resultaban escasamente relevantes para el programa de modernización emprendido.
El Gobierno Argentino no comparte en absoluto dicho criterio, de lo que se dejó constancia en la
preparación de la nueva Operación en ejecución desde 2008. Ello se fundamenta en dos dimensiones
principales:
La Segunda Enmienda, caracterizada por una visión puramente técnica ­y marcadamente fiscalista-
del proceso de modernización, se focalizó en intervenciones horizontales orientadas a promover la
eficiencia de toda la Administración, con independencia de las características particulares de las
políticas sectoriales involucradas; esto es, desentendiéndose de la eficacia con que debían lograrse
las prioridades estratégicas del plan de gobierno. Para el Gobierno Argentino, en cambio, la
modernización del Estado es un proceso político multivariado, en el cual -además de la debida
consideración de los aspectos presupuestarios- la primera prioridad consiste en la obtención de los
logros esperados por la ciudadanía en toda la gama de políticas a ejecutar. El perfeccionamiento de
los sistemas de apoyo particulares requeridos por algunos programas prioritarios forma parte
indudablemente de los esfuerzos de modernización emprendidos por el Gobierno.
El fortalecimiento de las capacidades de la Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros para conducir la
estrategia de Modernización del Estado se incorporó decididamente desde 2003 entre los principales
objetivos a obtener. En dicho marco, la posibilidad de asistir de modo particularizado a los diversos
Organismos responsables de determinadas políticas y servicios constituye una herramienta de
especial relevancia, totalmente consistente con el Componente en que se desarrollaron (F.
Modernización de Áreas Seleccionadas de la Administración Pública Nacional). La relevancia de
dichas acciones se encontraba plenamente respaldada por la prioridad asignada por el Sr. Jefe de
Gabinete de Ministros a los programas sectoriales asistidos.
Sobre el Monitoreo y la Evaluación, su diseño y utilización.
Se afirma nuevamente que la Tercera Enmienda no comprendió una revisión de la estructura de
resultados de los Componentes vinculados a la Modernización del Estado. Se adjuntan anexos con
las estructuras de indicadores de la Segunda y la Tercera Enmiendas, para permitir una
comprobación directa de la profundidad de los cambios introducidos en los indicadores de ejecución,
tanto de los Objetivos de Desarrollo como de los diversos Componentes.
El fortalecimiento de los mecanismos de monitoreo de la ejecución sustantiva constituyó uno de los
principales objetivos en el marco de los cambios estratégicos decididos por el Gobierno,



                                                  51

inmediatamente después de la crisis económica y política sufrida por el país. Entre otros elementos,
ello condujo a la creación de la Coordinación Técnica de la UCP, responsable del diseño detallado,
seguimiento y evaluación de diversos indicadores de avance de la ejecución del Proyecto.
También se afirma que las agencias participantes preparaban de modo burocrático informaciones
sobre los indicadores de avance, dirigidas a la supervisión del Proyecto pero no vinculadas con sus
propios procesos de decisión. Debe resaltarse que en todos los casos la asistencia brindada por el
Proyecto se encontraba directamente relacionada con resultados principales de la gestión de cada
Organismo seleccionado (compromisos de calidad en la atención a los clientes-ciudadanos, medición
de expectativas y satisfacción ciudadana, conformación de registros de personal, perfeccionamiento
de la normativa laboral en el Sector Público, desarrollo del Sistema Nacional de Compras
Electrónicas, establecimiento de la infraestructura nacional de Firma Digital, transformación
tecnológica de los registros de sociedades comerciales de la Inspección General de Justicia, acceso a
información estandarizada sobre costos educativos provinciales por parte del Ministerio de
Educación de la Nación, etc.).
Sobre aspectos fiduciarios.
Respecto a la observación de la falta de cumplimiento temporal de la contraparte, el Gobierno
expresa que cumplió a lo largo de la ejecución con la contraparte convenida en los acuerdos del
Préstamo. Año tras año se pudo verificar dicho cumplimiento en la presentación de los Estados
Contables, no habiéndose incurrido en ningún caso en la realización de inversiones no elegibles, ni
teniendo observación alguna de la Auditoria al respecto.
Con relación a la demora en el envío de la documentación luego del vencimiento del periodo de
gracia (30 de Abril de 2008), el Gobierno considera que no existió incumplimiento debido a que se
recibió una notificación fechada el 1º de noviembre -firmada por el Director para Argentina, Chile,
Paraguay y Uruguay-, en la cuál se fijaba dicha fecha como último plazo para la realización de pagos
por bienes y servicios devengados hasta el 31 de Diciembre. Este plazo no puede coincidir de ningún
modo con el de presentación final de la documentación, ya que claramente se trata de procedimientos
secuenciales que no pueden vencer en una misma fecha. De hecho, este argumento fue reconocido
por el Banco, otorgándose un nuevo periodo de gracia para la presentación de dicha documentación
final hasta el 30 de Junio.
Sobre la obtención de los Impactos y Resultados.
El Gobierno Argentino no entiende razonable una consideración literal del grado de obtención de los
Objetivos de Desarrollo de la Segunda Enmienda. Ello se debe principalmente a los defectos de
diseño expuestos más arriba en el apartado 3., cuyas características convertían en materialmente
inalcanzables a los objetivos propuestos, por razones eminentemente técnicas vinculadas a la
naturaleza misma del proceso de modernización estatal. Esta apreciación alcanza especialmente al
Componente D. Macroestructura del Gobierno, cuya ejecución resultó manifiestamente inviable
desde sus inicios: no existió un defecto de logros, sino una mala definición de metas. Debe
destacarse el hecho de que dos de los seis PDOs establecidos hayan registrado un avance
considerable, a pesar de las debilidades de preparación y diseño comentadas.
Además, en cuanto a los logros intermedios de los demás Componentes, el Gobierno reconoce que la
Segunda Enmienda resultó determinante en el lanzamiento de reformas horizontales de gran
importancia ­continuadas en la Tercera Enmienda y en el nuevo Proyecto de Modernización del
Estado II-, como la firma de las primeras Cartas Compromiso con el Ciudadano con diversos
Organismos, el tratamiento de la Ley de Firma Digital, las primeras modificaciones en la normativa
nacional de contrataciones, y el inicio del desarrollo del sistema de compras on-line que culminaría
luego en el SECOP y el portal Argentina Compra (www.argentinacompra.gov.ar).
En consecuencia, a diferencia de su preparación y diseño, el Gobierno Argentino considera a los
logros de la etapa correspondiente a la Primera y Segunda Enmiendas como "Moderadamente
Satisfactorios".




                                                  52

En cuanto a la Tercera Enmienda, el Gobierno Argentino considera que al Componente F.
Modernización de Áreas Seleccionadas de la Administración Pública Nacional le corresponde una
evaluación de "Altamente Satisfactorio":
En primer lugar porque considera que los resultados correspondientes a los Subcomponentes
Monitoreo y Evaluación y Sistema de Gestión de Activos Físicos fueron plenamente obtenidos según
el alcance comprometido en los acuerdos convenidos. No se encontraba previsto su establecimiento
y funcionamiento pleno, sino una serie de pilotos que permitieran el desarrollo de las herramientas
técnicas necesarias. Ello fue logrado en ambos casos, y las actividades realizadas habilitaron un
mayor compromiso institucional contemplado en el Proyecto de Modernización del Estado II.
Las actividades desarrolladas no suponían reformas "limitadas en su alcance" o "dispersión" alguna
en el enfoque de la estrategia, sino prioridades cuidadosamente seleccionadas tanto por su impacto
propio en el marco de las políticas sectoriales que apoyaban, como en los aspectos institucionales
con el desarrollo de las capacidades institucionales de la Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros que
fueron mencionados más arriba.
El Gobierno Argentino considera que la introducción de los criterios mencionados en los apartados
anteriores supone una evaluación de la Tercera Enmienda como "Altamente Satisfactoria", y ello
conduce -según el procedimiento de asignación de puntajes presentado en la Tabla 5.- a una
evaluación global de los Resultados e Impactos del Proyecto como "Satisfactorios".
El Gobierno desea expresar además su disconformidad con algunas consideraciones puntuales
vertidas en el ICR cuestionando "la racionalidad de la reasignación de recursos y la proliferación de
programas no presupuestarios que disminuyen el control", así como resaltando "las cuestiones
pendientes relativas a la corrección de largo plazo en la administración global de la deuda". Tanto las
facultades del Sr. Jefe de Gabinete de Ministros para la reasignación de partidas presupuestarias
como la habilitación de fondos fiduciarios para el financiamiento de proyectos prioritarios del
Gobierno Nacional obedecen a legislación emanada del Congreso Nacional que se ajusta plenamente
al orden jurídico establecido por la Constitución Argentina. Su cuestionamiento en este documento
resulta extemporáneo e inadmisible.
Sobre la estimación de riesgos en el Impacto de desarrollo.
El Gobierno Argentino desea enfatizar su plena coincidencia con el apoyo del Banco a la estrategia
de aproximación incremental y el efecto demostrativo de los "proyectos campeones" para el éxito
general del programa de modernización. Este enfoque fue introducido en la Tercera Enmienda al ser
presentado por el Gobierno como una de las principales lecciones aprendidas luego de las
dificultades experimentadas en la ejecución de la Segunda Enmienda. El Gobierno comparte también
el criterio de que la asistencia técnica central junto a una implementación descentralizada constituyen
una importante garantía de sustentabilidad del Proyecto.
Sobre la evaluación del desempeño del Gobierno.
Se insiste una vez más en afirmar que el compromiso del Gobierno ha sido desparejo a lo largo del
Proyecto, confundiendo reducciones en la ejecución provocadas por una crisis económica e
institucional sin precedentes en el país, con una supuesta falta de apoyo político. Por otra parte, el
Gobierno propuso y acordó con el Banco una modificación significativa en la estrategia general del
programa de modernización, que demostró su oportunidad y eficacia y que se encuentra en línea con
los cambios operados en estos años en la visión académica y la experiencia internacional (se puede
decir que la visión del Gobierno Argentino fue precursora en la transformación de los paradigmas
originales). Tampoco puede considerarse a este proceso de aprendizaje como una "disminución de
apoyo" al programa de modernización de la Administración Pública en Argentina, que se ha
establecido progresivamente como una auténtica política de Estado.
El desempeño del Gobierno, sosteniendo y profundizando el programa de Modernización del Estado,
a pesar de urgencias institucionales y sociales extraordinarias, sólo puede calificarse como
"Satisfactorio".
Conclusiones
Desde el punto de vista de los objetivos públicos en juego, el Gobierno Argentino considera que:



                                                     53

La primera etapa, "Proyecto Original", contribuyó -dentro de los escenarios posibles y anticipados- a
la prevención de los daños a los sistemas informáticos nacionales, en riesgo como consecuencia de la
amenaza denominada Y2K.
La "Primera y Segunda Enmiendas" adolecieron de defectos en su diseño técnico y en su estrategia
de implementación, de los cuales tanto el Banco como el Gobierno capitalizaron posteriormente
experiencias relevantes. A pesar de estos factores y de la notable crisis económica y política sufrida
al inicio de su ejecución, esta etapa contribuyó significativamente a introducir y establecer al
programa de reforma y modernización estatal como una herramienta relevante en una gestión
democrática de gobierno, con consecuencias perdurables en adelante.
La Tercera Enmienda supuso un relanzamiento significativo del Proyecto, estableciendo a la
modernización estatal como una política nacional durante la administración del Presidente Kirchner,
fortaleciendo acertadamente a la Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros como sede institucional
protagónica de dicha política, y permitiendo su profundización con la preparación y negociación del
proyecto de Modernización del Estado II, Préstamo 7449-AR, en ejecución desde 2008.
A juicio del Gobierno Argentino, el balance final para el conjunto del Proyecto, sobre la base del
apoyo recibido a sus prioridades y políticas nacionales, es "Satisfactorio".
El Gobierno desea reconocer la dedicación, el esfuerzo de recopilación de antecedentes y el enfoque
positivo de los redactores del ICR.
