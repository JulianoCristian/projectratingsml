voice of the\n            poor in public decision making, and, making local\n            governments more responsive to the needs of the poor through\n            increased cooperation with community organizations, through\n            the provision of funds to community based organizations, and\n            local governments for the provision of services to the urban\n            poor. As a highly decentralized, and community-based demand\n            driven project, it will support a large number of small\n            subproject investments, mainly in urban areas, while the\n            participatory nature of this project, should guarantee that\n            people affected by project implementation will be involved\n            in the decision making process. The design of the project\n            therefore ensures the participation, and inclusion of all\n            groups, including indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities,\n            and, recognizes that isolated vulnerable people form a group\n            that merits specific support. This Indigenous Peoples Plan\n            (IPP) ensures that such groups do benefit from the project,\n            and seeks to avoid, or minimize as possible, adverse effects\n            on isolated and vulnerable people. Facilitator training\n            shall provide the tools and mechanisms on how to organize,\n            and work with vulnerable groups, including the ability to\n            communicate in the appropriate language. It is expected a\n            full participation, and awareness of their rights and\n            responsibilities, in order to voice their needs. Monitoring\n            criteria and grievance mechanisms will be established, to\n            ensure compliance with this framework, and responsiveness\n            should conflict occur, respectively."}, "docdt": "2004-03-01T11:26:00Z"}
