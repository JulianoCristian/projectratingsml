 SYNOPSIS

   The World Bank Group, and IBRD in particular, has for many years supported Indonesia’s efforts to trans-
   form its economy and improve the lives of its poorest people. Through a range of financial and technical
   programs, IBRD has helped Indonesians enjoy greater access to clean water and sanitation, endure far
   less red tape to start a business, rebuild after disasters, protect their natural resources and fight corruption.
