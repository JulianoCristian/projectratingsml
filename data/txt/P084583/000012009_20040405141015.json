to the\n            urban poor, by supporting community organizations in voicing\n            their needs, and sharing in public decision making, while\n            making local governments more responsive to the needs of the\n            poor, through increased cooperation with community\n            organizations, through the provision of funds to community\n            based organizations and local governments, for the provision\n            of services to the urban poor. Subproject proposals shall\n            minimize land, and asset acquisition (as well as involuntary\n            displacement), through a participatory process. Displace\n            persons will be assisted in improving their livelihoods, and\n            standards of living, or at least restore them to pre-project\n            implementation levels. Loss of land in urban areas will be\n            replaced at market values of land of equal size and use,\n            with similar or improved public infrastructure facilities\n            and services, plus the cost of any registration an/or\n            transfer fees. Loss of agricultural land will likewise be\n            replaced at market value of land of equal productive\n            potential or use, located in the vicinity of the affected\n            land, plus the cost of land preparation to levels similar to\n            those of lost land, plus the cost of registration and\n            transfer taxes. Housing and other structure losses, shall be\n            compensated at market costs of materials for either total,\n            or partial replacement of affected structure, plus any costs\n            such as labor, contractor's fees, etc. Other assistance\n            includes assistance for income restoration, in the form of\n            training as needed; to start or develop small businesses;\n            access to credit, and, moving assistance during the\n            transition period."}, "docdt": "2004-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
