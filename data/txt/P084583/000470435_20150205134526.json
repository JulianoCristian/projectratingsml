At\n            the moment, housing needs are being met by NGOs, Government\n            and bi-lateral projects. As part of this effort, the Multi\n            Donor Fund project is helping to provide 5,000 new houses\n            and rehabilitate 8,500 more in villages and urban\n            neighborhoods and provide grants for basic community\n            infrastructure. The price per house under this project is\n            about US$4,000, compared to an average of more than US$6,000\n            for houses provided by NGOs and bilateral donors. Yet,\n            villagers are choosing these houses on the grounds that they\n            control the process. However, unit prices will need to be\n            adjusted shortly to take into consideration local inflation.\n            The project objective is to rebuild and repair houses in 188\n            villages and urban neighborhoods through community-driven\n            processes. The project works through the World Bank\u0092s\n            community-driven Urban Poverty Project that establishes\n            elected community development boards. The project provides\n            grants to communities and for basic infrastructure. The\n            infrastructure grants component has just been stocked up to\n            meet the reconstruction needs in supported villages. One of\n            few housing projects that focuses on repair as well as reconstruction."}, "docdt": "2006-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
