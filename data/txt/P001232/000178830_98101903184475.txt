INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPLNY LIMITED
FOR A HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $23.0 million to
the Tana River Development Company Limited (TRDC) writh the guarantee of
the Republic of Kenya.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank's association with the future development of electric
power in Kenya began nearly five years ago when ar, economic mission to
East Africa suggested that Kenya and Uganda might both derive important
economies by exploiting the opportunity offered by an existing trans-
mission line for the interchange of power between the two countries.   The
mission's recommendations as to the studies required was taken up by the
two governments, which established a joint commission chaired by Lord Hin-
ton, an independent expert recommended by the Bank. The Bank took part
in the work of the commission as an observer. In 1969 the two countries
reached an agreement in principle that the Kamburu hydroelectric project
in Kenya, which is the second phase of the Seven Forks hydroelectric
development on the Tana River, should be the first development to be
undertaken.
3.        In September 1969, the Government of Kenya requested the Bank to
help in financing the Kamburu project, and early in 1970, Sweden agreed
in principle to consider joint financing. A nission, in which the staff
of the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) took part,
appraised the project in Kenya in April 1970. Before the appraisal could
be completed the Government and the Bank had to work out and reach agree-
ment on a number of organizational questions, which are discussed further
in PART IV.
4.        Negotiations for the proposed loan and Swedish credit took place
in Washington in mid-March 1971.  The Kenya delegation consisted of Mr. S.
Ogembo, Permanent Secretary, M%1inistry of Power and Communications; Mr. A.L.
arap Ngeny, Under Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning;
Mr. J. Gecau, Chairman, Tana River Development Company Ltd. (TRDC), East
African Power and Lighting Company Ltd. (EAP&L) and Kenya Power Company Ltd.
(OPC); Mr. R. Webb, Chief Accountant, EAP&L; Mr. S. Wambaa, Assistant
Secretary, TRDC and KPC; and Mr. J. Silvester, Counsel, *EAP&L, TRDC and
NPC. The Kingdom of Sweden was represented by Messrs. Ohlund, Aastrup,
Cedergren and Kvarnbeck of the Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA).

PART II - CURRENIT AND PROSPECTIV3 OPERATIONS
5.        The proposed loan would be the sixth Bank loan to Kenya.   The
first two loans were made before Independence and are guaranteed by the
United Kingdom. In addition, Kenya has received eleven IDA credits. A
summiary statement of these loans and credits as of April 30, 1971 is pro-
vided in Annex 1 to this report. Kenya is also guarantor,jointly and
severally with Tanzania and Uganda, of the six Bank loans for common serv-
ices in East Africa (see Annex 2). The first of these loans is also
guaranteed by the United Kingdom.
6.        The problems encountered in the execution of agricultural projects
in Kenya were dealt with in some detail in my Report and Recommendation on
the loan to the City Council of Nairobi (No. P-872 of November 4, 1970).
Some progress can now be recorded.
7.        The Smallholder Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 105 KE),
which had been seriously delayed by problems in recruiting and retaining
satisfactory management and staff, is now gaining momentum. The bulk of
the funds provided under the credit have now been cormitted, but it would
require about eighteen months beyond the present Closing Date of June 30,
1971 to complete the corresponding disbursements. The Government has sub-
mitted a request for an extension, which is currently under examination
by a mission reviewing the progress of the project.
8.        Total commitments and disbursements under the Livestock Develop-
ment Project (Credit No. 129 KE) are still far from satisfactory.   However,
the rate of commitment of funds to individual ranchers has latterly been
improving and loans to commercial ranchers are now expected to be promoted
vigorously. The project continues to be under close supervision.
9.        The Association has recently approved an accelerated planting
program under the Second Tea Development Project (Credit No. 119 KE) for
which the Kenya Tea Development Authority expects to utilize the credit
funds.
10.       The Second Highway Project (Credit Nlo. 120 KE) is on schedule.
The Third Highway Project (Loan No. 639 KE) is getting under way satis-
factorily. The Nairobi Water Supply Project (Loan No. 714 IKE) and the
Highway Maintenance Project (Credit No. 224 KE) were declared effective
in late ivarch 1971.
11.       Other lending under active consideration is a Fourth Highway
Project, which has been recently appraised, and the Nairobi Airport Devel-
opment Project, the studies for which are currently being carried out by
consultants. At the more preliminary stage of consideration are possible
lending for financing industry through a development finance company and
infrastructure for tourism.



PART III - DESCRIPTION OF 'LIE PROPOSED LOAN
12.       BORROWIER:              Tana River Development Company Ltd. (TRDC)
GUARANTOR:              The Republic of Kenya
A-IOUNT:                US$23.0 million in various currencies
PURPOSE:                To assist in financing the second phase
of the Seven Forks hydroelectric devel-
opment on the Tana River at Kamburu
ANORTIZATION:           In 25 years, including a 33-year period
of grace, through semiannual install-
ments beginning July 1, 1975 and ending
July 1, 1996
INTEREST RATE:          71'4 per annum
CONIVIITMENT CHARGE:    3/4 of 1% per annum

estimated at between 13 and 20 percent.
13.       The proposed Swedish credit of $6 million equivalent to the
Republic of Kenya will be on IDA terms. The Government would relend the
proceeds of the Swedish credit to TRDC on terms similar to those of the
proposed Bank loan.
PART IV - THE STRUCTURE OF THE PGCIiER I1DUSTRY
14.       The principal problem in working out the proposed loan for the
Kamburu project arose from the fact that, over the course of time, the
structure of the power industry in Kenya has become somewhat complex and,
moreover, is in the process of change. The main power company is the
East African Power and Lighting Company Ltd. (EAP&L), w}hich was incorpo-
rated in Kenya in 1922 as a private company operating throughout East
Africa, but since 1964 has confined its operations to Kenya after its
Uganda and Tanzania undertakings were bought out by the respective govern-
ments. EAP&L owns and operates all thermal plants in Kenya as well as a
number of small hydroelectric installations. It is the sole distributor
of the power produced in its own plants and power bought from twlo associ-
ated' companies, the Kenya Power Company Ltd. (KPC), established in 1955,
to own and operate the transmission line from the Otien Falls hydroelectric
station in Uganda, and the Tana River Development Company Ltd. (TRDC), set
up in 1964, to undertake hydroelectric development on the Tana River.



- h -
TRDC already owns and operates the Kindaruma power station downstream from
Kamburu. The two   ssociated companies have only a nominal share capital
and their investments are wholly debt-financed. EAP&L staffs and manages
KPC and TRDC and coordinates all power operations in Kenya. EAP&L purchases
power from them under long-term contracts at prices calculated to cover
precisely their actual operating expenses and debt service.
15.       The Kenya Government has been a shareholder from the beginning
in both KPC and TRDC. The Government has now acquired sole ownership of
TRDC and proposes to acquire sole ownership of KPC, in which it has already
effective control. The Government also recently acquired control over
EAP&L through the purchase in the open market of over 51% of the out-
standing voting stock and proposes to buy up further shares as they become
available. The Kenya power industry is thus in transition from private to
public ownership and control, but the corporate structure remains unchanged.
The Kenya Government recognizes that this structure is cumbersome and is
anxious to consolidate and rationalize it. To do so calls first for a
careful study of the financial, legal and organizational problems that
would be involved. Account has also to be taken of the obligations of
the existing companies to shareholders and to creditors under various
security arrangements. The Kenya Government intends to obtain expert
advice in working out the reorganization of the power industry and has
undertaken to consult the Bank on the measures to be adopted.
16.       To avert a power shortage in Kenya, the Kamburu station must be
commissioned by mid-1974 and construction therefore undertaken without
delay. However desirable it might be to complete the reorganization before
undertaking a major new investment, there is not time enough to do so
satisfactorily. The Bank is thus faced with the need to work out an interim
solution that will fit into the existing arrangements with a minimum of
modification and not itself be a further obstacle to a rational reorgani-
zation. The proposed solution is for the Bank to lend to TRDC, which is
already publicly owned, and to obtain from EAP&L the contractual under-
takings (see paragraphs 23 to 25 below) necessary to take account of the
fact that at the present time EAP&L will have to provide the local funds
required for the project, as well as the management and staff, and will
sell the power to be produced. In these circumstances TRDC is an accept-
able borrower for the proposed loan.
PART V - THE PROJECT
17.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Kamburu Hydroelectric Project"
(No. PU-70) is attached. The project, which would meet the demand for
electric power in Kenya up to 1976, comprises: (a) a hydroelectric power
station with an initial capacity of 60MW and provision for one more 30MW
unit when needed; (b) a 220kV transmission line of about 105 km from
Kamburu to Nairobi to link with the national grid; (c) a 132kV trans-
mission line of about 15 km to connect Kamburu with TRDC's existing
Kindaruma power station; and (d) necessary consulting services.



- 5 -
18.       The cost of the project, excluding interest during construction,
is estimated at $37.5 million. The foreign exchange component is $26.1
million (70%). Sweden will provide a credit of $6 million towards meeting
the foreign exchange costs.  The proposed Bank loan of $23 million to
TRDC would cover the balance of the foreign exchange costs, $20.1 million,
and interest on the Bank loan during construction, estimated at $2.9 mil-
lion. The local currency expenditures, amounting to $11.4 million, would
be financed from internally generated funds of EAP&L to be made available
to TRDC.
19.       EAP&L will provide the $11.4 million to TRDC in two ways.   First,
for the construction period of the project EAP&L has undertaken to pay a
surcharge on the present level of its contractual payments under its bulk
supply contract with TRDC, estimated at this time as being sufficient to
increase TRDC's cash flow by approximately $2.4 million, which TRDC will
apply to the local cost financing of the project. To complete TRDC's
financing plan, EAP&L will make a loan to TRDC presently estimated at
about $9.0 million. This loan will be for 25 years, including 31 years
of grace at 9% interest. The actual division of the $11.4 million to be
provided by EAP&L to TRDC as between surcharge and loan will be acjusted
during the construction period in such a way that the rate of return on
average net fixed assets in service earned by EAP&L and by the two bulk
supply companies, taken together, will be approximately equal. In addition,
since the solvency of TRDC is dependent entirely on the level of payments
from EAP&L, the Bank would need to be satisfied, as a condition of effec-
tiveness of the proposed Bank loan, that the bulk supply agreement between
them provides that EAP&L's payments for purchases from TRDC will be suf-
ficient to cover TRDC's costs defined to include debt service as well as
operating costs.
20.       The growth of electricity consumption in Kenya during the period
1964-70 has kept pace with growth of the economy. Annual growth of elec-
tricity consumptlon ranged from 2% to 12.2% and averag;ed 7.1% p.a. during
this period. The Nairobi area and the coastal region including INombasa
account for 85% of total consumption. The future rate of growth, taking
into account all known major industrial and cormiercial developments, is
projected at 9% p.a., but the economic justificaUion of the project is not
very sensitive to the assumed growth rate. The most likely internal
financial rate of return is around 16%, ranging from 13% to 20%, on various
combinations of assumptions about future costs and revenues.
21.       The project is the least cost method of meeting the projected
load growth, the most likely value for the equalizing discount rate com-
pared with the alternative investment in thermal development being about
11%, ranging from 9% to 13%, on various combinations of assumptions. The
economic analysis has also taken account of possible abstraction of water
upstream of the proposed project for irrigation development in the Upper
Tana area, the irrigation potential for wihich is considerable. Kenya's
current plans do not envisage a major irrigation development in the near
future, and indeed such development may not be justified at an early date
in view of the possible alternative opportunities for less capital-intensive



- 6 -
dry farming development. Nevertheless, for purposes of analysis, the
economics of the proposed project were tested under assumptions of rapid
irrigation development starting in 1973. Even on these unlikely assump-
tions the economics of the proposed project were found not to be greatly
affected.
22.       The dependence of TRDC on EAP&L for funds, management and staff
makes it necessary for the Bank to obtain certain assurances directly from
EAP&L that would normally be given by the borrower. In addition, certain
assurances are required from the Government covering the entire industry.
23.       To ensure that EAP&L, as the only source of revenue for the
power industry, remains in a satisfactory financial position, EAP&L has
undertaken to earn a rate of return on net operating assets of not less
than 9.5% for the years 1972, 1973 and 1974 and 8g thereafter.  The
Government has provided assurances that it will permit EAP&L to earn
such a return.
24.       Government and the three power companies have provided assurances
that the companies will not incur further debt without the Bank's prior
approval, unless the combined cash earnings before depreciation of the
three companies for the 12 months period prior to incurrence of such debt
are at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service of all the companies,
including the debt to be incurred.
25.       EAP&L and TGDC have agreed to enter into a revised Mvanagement
Agreement, which would provide for the additional services required by
TUDC to carry out the project. Entering into such a revised agreement
acceptable to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness. EAP&L has further
agreed to consult the Bank on any future appointments to the positions of
the General Manager, the Chief Engineers in charge of Generation and
Planning and the Chief Accountant.
26.       The procurement of goods and the letting of civil works contracts
would be in accordance with the Bank's normal international bidding pro-
cedures. Disbursements would be made against actual foreign exchange
costs of imported goods and services and the foreign exchange component
of civil works contracts. TPUC has requested that the Bank agree to
reimburse the foreign exchange costs of consultant services incurred
after January 1, 1970. The consultants retained are acceptable to the
Bank, and the loan includes retroactive financing of about $600,000 for
their fees and reimbursable expenses.
27.       Experience with the existing Kindaruma power station situated
19 kilometers downstream from Kamburu, and the findings of a reconnaissance
of the Kamburu area carried out by an expert commissioned by the Bank,
indicate that the proposed project is unlikely to cause major ecol-
ogical problems. On the other hand, there may be a change in land use
patterns resulting from movement of population attracted into the project



-7-

area which might need to be controlled. Representatives of Kenya, Sweden
and the Bank are discussing a study, which would evaluate the impact of
changing land use patterns. Sweden has indicated its willingness to
finance such a study, the findings of which are expected to help the
Government evolve criteria for controlling land use in this and other
areas.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AMD AUTHORITY
28.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and TRDC, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Kenya and the Bank, the draft
Joint Financing Agreement between the Republic of Kenya, the Kingdom of
Sweden, the Bank, TRDC and EAP&L, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. An Administrative
Letter from the Bank and IDA to the Kingdom of Sweden, which is the basic
agreement governing all joint financing operations undertaken by the Bank
and IDA with the Kingdom of Sweden, was distributed to the Executive
Directors in connection with Loan No. 605 ET (R69-82-L).
29.       The above-mentioned draft agreements contain the covenants
usually found in the Bank's agreements for power projects and projects
jointly financed by the Bank and the Kingdom of Sweden. The draft Joint
Financing AgTeement provides for the disbursement of the Bank loan and Swed-
ish crecit &no, the methods and procedures for procurement of goods and
services and, because of the special position of EAP&L discussed in
paragraph 22 above, also contains specific covenants by EAP&L,as well as
Kenya and TRDC, designed to ensure the effective carrying out of the
project.
PART VII - THE ECONOMY
30.       An economic report entitled "Economic Development Prospects in
Kenya" (Report No. AE-6a, in two parts) was distributed on October 31,
1969. An Economic and Preinvestment Studies Mission visited Kenya in
October/November 1970, and its report will be distributed to the Executive
Directors in the near future.
31.       The 1969 economic report analyzed the Government's 1970-74
Development Plan and found it to be realistic and generally well conceived.
The most recent mission found that a good start has been made in imple-
menting the Plan, and that by the end of 1970 economic growth was approxi-
mately in line with the Plan target, despite a rather poor agricultural
season in 1969. The 1970/71 budget was consistent with the public expend-
iture goals set by the Plan, but supplementary budgets which have since
been approved may result in their being exceeded. Capital formation in



- 8 -
Kenya since 1964 has been expanded by an average of 16% a year. About
90% of gross investment has been financed by domestic savings, although
the economy's resource gap is projected to widen as the development
effort builds up.
32.       A significant development of the past year has been a cautious
move by the Government to acquire control of certain key sectors of the
economy. The acquisition of majority shareholdings in the EAP&L Company
has been noted in paragraph 15above. The Government has also acquired a
substantial share in the oil refinery at Mombasa and is seeking to acquire
substantial shares in a number of other companies, notably the major
commercial banks. A feature of this development is that shares have so
far been acquired either through purchases on the open market or with the
willing agreement of the private owners; this has had a reassuring effect
on the private investor.
33.       Kenya has in the past received a large amount of external as-
sistance, generally on favorable terms. On the basis of its generally
sound policies and plans for the future, Kenya will continue to require
and merit substantial external assistance for a long time. At the end
of 1969, Kenya's total external debt (including its nominal one-third
share of the East African Community's debt) stood at $441 million, and
the annual cost of servicing this debt was $26 million. Debt service
payments in 1969 absorbed 6.8% of foreign exchange earnings during the
year. In view of its low per capita income and the limited prospects for
its major export commodities, it is desirable that Kenya should obtain
the major proportion of external assistance on concessional terms.
However, since its debt service ratio is still low, Kenya can undertake
a moderate amount of borrowing on conventional terms.
34.       A basic data sheet is attached as Annex 3.
PART VIII - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEM4ENT
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IX - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
