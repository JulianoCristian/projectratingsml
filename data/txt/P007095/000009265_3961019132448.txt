MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Ecuador
Power Sector Improvement Proiect (Loan 2713-EC)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Ecuador: Power Sector Improvement
project (Loan 2713-EC, approved in FY86) prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office, with Part II prepared by the Borrower.
This US$8.5 million loan to INECEL, Ecuador's state-owned power utility, was to contribute to
improved sector efficiency by financing a series of institution-building activities (including studies in the
areas of organizational structure, management information systems, system planning and operation and
tariffs, as well as managerial and technical training). Project implementation was substantially delayed
(by about four years) as a result of procurement problems and of an initial lack of commitment on the part
of both the Government and INECEL; the latter was amplified by the several changes in Government which
took place between 1986 and 1993. It is only in 1992 that implementation started in earnest, after the
scope of one of the main studies was changed to support the new Government's strategy to consider the
unbundling of, and greater private sector participation in, the power sector.
In spite of this positive development --the impact of which it is still too early to assess-- and given
the lack of detailed information provided in the PCR regarding the actual impact of the other technical
assistance activities, the outcome of the project is rated as marginally satisfactory and its sustainability as
uncertain. Institutional development is considered modest. Both Borrower and Bank performance are
considered unsatisfactory given weak Government ownership and insufficient Bank supervision during
most of the project's implementation period. The PCR lacks sufficient information (for example, on
efficiency indicators) to assess the impact of key activities funded by the loan.
The project may be audited in the future.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR
POWER SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2713-EC)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Power Sector Improvement
Project in Ecuador, for which Loan 2713-EC in the amount of US$8.5 million was approved on
June 3, 1986, signed on June 4, 1987, and became effective on August 19, 1987. The Loan was
closed on December 31, 1993 (the original loan closing date was June 30,1990). US$6.76 million
was disbursed and US$1.74 million was canceled.
Parts I and III of this PCR were prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy
Division, Country Department III, Latin America and Caribbean Region. This report is based on
an examination of the Loan Agreement, Supervision Reports, Project Correspondence, Financial
Statements, and Audit Reports. In addition, interviews were conducted during the final
supervision mission with personnel in the Project Coordinating Unit and personnel involved in the
various components. Part II of the PCR was prepared by the Government of Ecuador.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR
POWER SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2713-EC)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.    While Ecuador began the 1970s as one of the least developed Latin American countries,
the discovery, and exploitation, of significant oil reserves, and subsequent hikes in world prices of
oil, placed Ecuador firmly among the middle-income countries of the hemisphere by the end of the
decade. Resources generated from oil exploitation were, in general, used to improve priority
infrastructure needed for development, including power generation. Simultaneously, the
Government's role in the economy grew: total public expenditures rose from 24 percent of GDP
in 1973 to 47 percent in 1987. Government subsidies to urban consumers, fuel and electricity
users also grew in importance, and low internal energy prices created distortions in consumption
and investment patterns.
Objectives
ii.    The Power Sector Improvement Project was designed to improve the efficiency of the
sector by assisting the Government's main power company Instituto Ecuatoriano de
Electrificaci6n (INECEL) in areas where it faced the most pressing problems viz: inadequate
institutional structure, poor management information systems, planning and programming, and
personnel training at all levels. The project was expected to help establish an enhanced dialogue
between the Bank and the power sector authorities which could possibly lead to a greater Bank
role in the sector.
Implementation Experience
iii.   The time necessary to organize and manage the initial stages of the Project took
considerably longer than expected. There was a delay of one year between Board approval and
Loan signature, and it took a further two months to declare the loan effective. There was a three
and a half year delay in completing the Project. This was due to: (a) complex administrative
procedures to approve procurement and consultant contracts; (b) difficulties in preparing bid
documents in accordance with Bank Guidelines; and (c) managerial problems in implementing the
institutional improvement programs. Nevertheless, the three crucial studies; Institutional Reform,
Electricity Tariffs, and Power System operations, were completed, and delivered before the Loan
was closed.



- iii -
Sustainability
iv.    The Project is expected to have a strong impact on the future power sector. The
Institutional Reform Study, performed by the consortium Empresa Nacional de Electriflcaci6n,
S.A. (ENDESA), Spain, and Price Waterhouse, Ecuador, included: (a) a draft electricity law
based on the power sector development model agreed with the Government in May 1993; and (b)
a proposal for re-structuring INECEL and the distribution companies. The new Electricity Law
was sent to Congress in June 1994. This new law redefines the role of the State in the sector,
clearly separating its policy/regulatory functions from its role as owner of power public utilities.
The law would lead to a re-structuring of INECEL into several power generating corporations,
one power transmission enterprise, and a few electrical distribution companies. The Government
plans to phase out its involvement in commercial activities in the sector and promote the
participation of private investors in the power business.
v.    If the proposals in the Electricity Tariff Study are adopted in the new Electricity Law, they
will lead to an important rationalization in the power market with electricity tariffs based on multi
levels e.g. producer/transmitter; producer/distributor; producerAarge block customers;
transmitter/distributor; distributor/retail customers.
Findings and Lessons Learned
vi.    Close supervision and timely intervention are required to avoid delays during the initial
stages of implementation. The Governments complex procedures to approve procurement and
consultant contracts must be ameliorated by firm insistence in applying the Bank's procedures.
Too often, the executing agencies tried to impose the Government's procurement procedures in
spite of clear language in the Loan Agreement establishing that the Bank's guidelines on
procurement must prevail. Continuity of service for the Government officers, and senior
employees of INECEL responsible for coordination and management of the Project is vital. The
large number of management and Ministerial changes during the life of the Project slowed
activities and prejudiced the efficiency of project operations.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Project Identity
Project Name:            Power Sector Improvement Project
Loan Number:             2713-EC
Regional Unit:           Latin America and Caribbean Region
Country Department III
Country:                 Ecuador
Sector:                  Power
B.    Background
1.          After the discovery of oil in 1972, Ecuador's economy changed dramatically.
Two-thirds of 1970 export revenues were from agriculture; by 1980, nearly two-thirds were from
petroleum and only a quarter was from traditional agriculture crops. Resources generated from
oil exploitation were, in general, used to improve priority physical infrastructure needed for
development. An important beneficiary of Ecuador's oil boom was the national power company
Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificaci6n (INECEL), which suddenly had access to abundant
resources. This resulted in INECEL consolidating its control over regional utilities and becoming
itself a generation and transmission enterprise. Additionally, INECEL started building its own
large hydro-power plants. As a result, there was a complete switch-over from isolated thermal
plants to hydro plants with an interconnected transmission system covering the country's main
consuming centers. 1NECEL has become the major supplier of bulk power and has majority
control of 16 of the 17 regional power distribution companies.
2.          The degree of electrification in Ecuador is 75 %, above the average of 70% for
Latin American countries. The generation installed capacity is 1692 MW, of which 1300 MW is
hydro and 392 MW thermal plants. There is an interconnected national grid of 230 kV, which
connects the hydro-power plants with major consumption centers of Quito and Guayaquil. Gross
generation has increased 7.7% p.a. during the last decade, but energy sales proceeds have only
increased 6.6% yearly because power losses increased more rapidly. Distribution companies have
on average losses of 21%, which result from old installations, and illegal consumption.



- 2 -
3.           The sector is not well organized. The main issues are: (a) subsidized tariffs
resulting from a highly politicized price policy; (b) inadequate financial resources to support
investment; (c) lack of independent roles of the State in the power sector as regulator and
operator; and (d) lack of autonomy and accountability of the power utilities. During the last
decade, the sector's finances deteriorated due to low electricity prices that only covered sector
operating and maintenance expenses. Government intervention and financial constraints have
reduced the efficiency and productivity of the sector. INECEL is subject to bureaucratic controls
and restrictions from the Secretariat of Development, the office of the Controller General and the
General Procurement office. Although INECEL's subsidiaries are structured as corporations and
are not subject to these controls, INECEL's control over them is slight due to the lack of expertise
of INECEL's representatives on their boards.
4.           The need for a Bank-financed project was identified during a June 1985 mission.
The Power Sector Improvement Project was then developed by INECEL with the help of Bank
Staff.
C.    Project objectives and Description
5.           The Project's principal objectives were to improve the efficiency of the sector by
assisting INECEL in those areas where it was facing the most pressing problems, viz: inadequate
institutional structure; poor management information systems; inadequate tariff structure;
inefficiencies in power system operation, planning and programming; and personnel training at all
levels. The Project was expected to help establish an enhanced dialogue between the Bank and
the power sector authorities which would lead to a greater Bank role in the sector:
6.           The Project consisted of:
Part A:
Strengthening the Borrower's institutional structure by (i) carrying out an analysis
of the power sector in the context of the overall energy sector for the purpose of identifying the
changes required in the Borrower's institutional structure for more efficient coordination within
these sectors and with Ministerio de Energia y Minas (MEM); (ii) carrying out an emergency plan
aimed at improving the Borrower's organization and information systems; (iii) the implementation
of the Borrower's restructuring plan; and (iv) acquisitions and installation of personal computers
and office machines.
Part B:
Carrying out studies aimed at providing a basis for tariff change decisions and
reviewing the structure and level of current tariffs.



-3-
Part C:
Carrying out a study to review and optimize the power system operations and its
adequacy for the management of the present and future configuration and National Interconnected
System (NIS); and the acquisition of metering and simulating equipment.
Part D:
Elaboration of a training plan for the Borrower on the basis of the Master
Electrification Plan. Training of the Borrower's personnel in: (a) management development and
information systems; (b) tariff methodology; (c) power system operation planning and
programming; (d) power system maintenance. Upgrading of the Borrower's training facilities.
D.   Project Design and organization
7.          The Project was identified in June 1985, approved by the Board one year later, and
became effective more than another year later, in August 1987. There was a three and one half
year delay in completing the Project, which evolved through three different administrations with
varying ideologies, different economic programs, as well as a changing base of political support.
8.          There were four extensions of the closing date; three each of one year from June
30, 1990 and one of six months from June 30, 1993. These extensions did not lead to any cost
overruns. They were necessary to allow the consultants time to complete the required studies and
in the case of the Institutional Reform Study, the extension of the closing date permitted the Bank
to amplify the Terms of Reference of the study to conform with the Bank's policy paper "World
Bank Role in the Electric Power Sector". This resulted in the consultants preparing a draft
Electricity Law and a proposal for the restructuring of INECEL.
E.    Project Implementation
9.          The time necessary to organize and manage the initial stages of the Project took
considerably longer than expected. No disbursements were made until 1989, and by the end of
that year, when the Project was expected to be completed, only US$500,000, less than six percent
of the total Loan, had been disbursed. The three and a half year delay in completing the Project
was due to: (a) difficulties in preparing bid documents in accordance with Bank Guidelines; and
(b) complex administrative procedures to approve procurement and consultant contracts. There
are features of Ecuador's procurement legislation that are incompatible with Bank Guidelines, and
this generated a good deal of discussions and consultations even though the Controller General
accepts that individual Bank loan covenants take precedence over Ecuador's legislation.
10.         All of this led to disbursements being extremely slow: only 9% of the total at the
end of the third year, and less than 20% at the end of the 5th year. The final 2 years of the Project
saw 78% of all expenditures. Nevertheless, the 3 crucial studies; Institutional Reform, Electricity
Tariffs, and Power System operations, were completed and delivered before the Loan was closed.

F.    Results
1I.          The Project has produced two very important studies; the Institutional Reform
Study, and the Tariff Study. The former included a draft Electricity Law and a proposal for the
re-structuring of INECEL, and the latter included proposals which will lead to an important
rationalization in the power market electricity tariffs. These studies are expected to have far
reaching legislative consequences leading towards the implementation of a modem framework in
the power sector. This could usefully serve as a precursor to large scale privatization, particularly
in the distribution companies. The Project also led to 321 employees of INECEL receiving
advanced training courses both domestically and overseas.
G.    Sustainability
12.          The Project is expected to have a strong impact on the power sector. The
Institutional Reform Study, performed by the consortium ENDESA, Spain, and Price
Waterhouse, Ecuador, included: (a) a draft electricity law based on the power sector development
model agreed with the Government in May 1993; and (b) a proposal for restructuring INECEL
and the distribution companies. The new Electricity Law was sent to Congress in June 1994.
This new law redefines the role of the State in the sector, clearly separating its policy/regulatory
functions from its role as owner of power public utilities. According to the proposed law, a
national Electricity Board would be created to define electricity policy and supervise the functions
of the regulatory body, and would allow the private sector participation in the sector. Once
approved, the law will lead to a re-structuring of INECEL into several power generating
corporations, one power transmission enterprise, and a few electrical distribution companies. The
Government plans to phase out its involvement in commercial activities in the sector and promote
the participation of private investors in the power business. During this process, electricity tariffs
would be rationalized and existing subsidies reviewed and reduced. Plans have been initiated with
the support of the Bank through the Technical Assistance Loan for Public Enterprise Reform,
(which was approved in December 1994) to implement the activities required to incorporate
INECEL, merge the distribution companies, and prepare the legal rules and procedures that will
regulate the sector. The Government intends to divest its majority holding in all power
distribution companies by early 1996.
13.         If the proposals in the Electricity Tariff Study are adopted in the new Electricity
Law, they will lead to an important rationalization in the power market with electricity tariffs
based on multi levels e.g. producer/transmitter; producer/distributor; transmitter/distributor;
distributor/retail customers.
H.   Assessment by Component
Part A: Strengthening of the Borrower's Institutional Structure
14.          This component was changed during the execution of the Project. The
Government was only lukewarm in support of the emergency plan aimed at improving the



- 5 -
borrower's organization and information systems (Part A;(ii) of Schedule 2 of the Loan
Agreement), and the Controller General's office withheld approval of the consultant's contract for
such a long period that the component was finally dropped and replaced by a program to
inventory and revalue the Borrower's assets. This was successfully concluded and was an
important factor in improving financial reporting and will serve INECEL well.
15.         The other components of Part A: Schedule 2, (including the MIS portion of A (ii)),
were completed, and included the very important drafting of the proposed Power Sector Law,
now in the Congress for approval.
Part B: Tariff Study
16.         This study was completed early in the Project, and was used in the tariff
adjustment of 1989. It will be used in conjunction with the proposed Power Sector Law to
establish the tariffs if and when the new Sector Law is passed.
Part C: Power Sector operation Study
17.         This component of the Project suffered the most delays because of the
aforementioned INECEL insistence on following the national procedures in obtaining clearances
from the offices of the Controller General, the Attorney General, and the National Secretariat of
Information and Technology in spite of constant reminders from the Bank that these procedures
were not necessary under the terms of the Loan Agreement.
I 8.        In addition, INECEL took considerable time to appoint a Project Manager due to
a dispute between the directorates concerned.
Part D: Training
19.         This component of the Project was very successful, with 321 employees
participating in the courses held both within Ecuador and overseas.
I.    Bank and Borrower Performance
20.         A major problem initially was the lack of commitment by the Borrower. This was
demonstrated by the following facts: it took 14 months for the Project to become effective after
receiving Bank approval; no disbursements were made for two years; by the time of the original
closing date less than 10% of the loan had been disbursed; and the closing date of the loan had to
be extended four times for the Project to be completed.
21.         At every turn the Project was delayed by the Borrower's insistence on
supplementing the Bank's procurement procedures with the Ecuadorian Government's



- 6 -
procurement procedures. These required a myriad of clearances from Agencies which by and
large did not understand the objectives of the Project, and delayed it for unconscionable periods.
22.         The Bank was less than forceful in pushing the Project along. The procurement
delays should have been tackled more vigorously in the very beginning with the Bank insisting on
the Guidelines being the sole criteria, and refusing to accept the need to obtain clearances from
multiple agencies not involved in the Project and ignorant of the objectives. In this connection
there was a larger than usual turn-over of Bank personnel engaged in the supervision of the
Project. No less than 12 high level staff members were involved over the life of the Project.
Project supervision was uneven. Seven staff members were involved in supervision in FY88 for a
total of 23.3 staff weeks, when no disbursements had yet occurred. Supervision staff weeks
declined steadily over FY'89, 90, and 91, to 10.7, 6.2, and 3.4 staff weeks, when disbursements
were US$500,000, US$300,000, and US$400,000 respectively. Supervision in FY'92 rose to 6.6
staff weeks, but disbursements rose only marginally to US$460,000. FY'93 was a banner year
with 22.9 staff weeks of supervision and US$3.09 million of disbursements; and in FY'94, the final
year of the Project, supervision was 5.6 staff weeks and disbursements were US$2.02 million.
J.    Lessons Learned
23.         Close supervision and timely intervention are required to avoid delays during the
initial stages of implementation. The complex administrative and legal procedures to approve
procurement and consultants contracts must be avoided by firm insistence in applying the Bank's
procedures as outlined in the Loan documents. Too often, the executing agencies try to impose
the Government's procurement procedures in spite of clear language in the Loan Agreement
establishing that the Bank's guidelines on procurement must prevail. Continuity of service for the
Government officers, and senior employees of INECEL responsible for coordination and
management of the Project is vital. This was particularly evident during this Project, which
evolved through three different administrations with varying ideologies, different economic
programs, as well as a changing political base of support. The large number of management and
Ministerial changes during the life of the Project slowed activities and prejudiced the efficiency of
Project operations.
K.   Consulting Services
24.         The consultants hired under the Loan performed well. The draft Electricity Law
(now before Congress), the proposal for the re-structuring of INECEL, and the Tariff study,
under the Institutional Reform component of the Project, are likely to have a far reaching policy
and legislative impact.
L.    Project Documentation and Data
25.         The documentation of disbursement data for the Project is detailed and
comprehensive. The BTO's and 590's are somewhat less available due to the files having been



- 7 -
switched between various Task Managers and between various departments over the long life of
the Project.
26.         The main documents for Project execution were the Loan Agreement and the
President's Report. No Staff Appraisal Report was prepared.

POWER SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2713-EC)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.   The Bank's Performance During Project Implementation
1.                 From the moment the Loan Agreement was signed, the Bank was
constantly concerned about progress on the various studies to be carried out under the
four programs that made up the project, and also about the quality of the consultants to be
hired, which would determine the results of these studies. The hiring of the consultants
was done in accordance with the guidelines established by the Bank.
2.          Similarly, in the case of the procurement of the equipment required for the
programs in question, the Bank also issued its statement of no objection to the procurement of the
items in question; in both cases it was aware of and approved all the procedures prior to the
signing of the contract, without reservation, which complied with the International Guidelines
issued by the Bank, with which member countries must comply.
3.          With respect to the execution of the studies, Bank missions constantly visited the
offices where the various programs were being managed, reviewed the findings of the studies
conducted by the consultants and made their comments prior to approval by INECEL.
Institutional Development
4.          The delay in obtaining the report from the office of the Controller hampered the
hiring of the consulting firm, as planned in this program, and it also resulted in a change in the
price compared to the bid originally offered when the international bidding invitation was issued.
5.          The Bank subsequently gave priority to the execution of the power sector
restructuring studies and the inventories and reevaluations of assets in operation in that sector,
facilitating their execution by means of consulting contracts handled through UNDP.
Power Sector Operations Study
6.          The participation of the Lending Agency (World Bank) helped in accomplishing
the objectives initially set, i.e. the procurement of the basic equipment planned, and also the hiring



- 9 -
of several consultants. Attention should be drawn here to the fact that this made it possible to
make good use of the funds originally allocated, thereby making it possible to significantly reduce
the cost of consulting services and to invest in the procurement of specialized equipment and in
training.
7.          It should be pointed out, however, that at the various stages of project
implementation and in the implementation of the OSPE Program, in particular, one factor that
sometimes interfered with the continuity of the procedures, which in some cases were already
under way and in other cases were about to begin, was the turnover of Bank officials responsible
for monitoring the project. This meant having to explain the progress of the Project including the
contracting to the new staff in charge, not to mention having to comply with new demands and
render further explanations.
Tariffs
8.          The Bank's acceptance of the selection of the General Consultant for the Tariff
Study Program had a positive effect on the project, since it made it possible for the objectives and
scope of the studies to be carried out to be defined in detail, along with the terms of reference for
selecting the specific consultants.
9.          The Bank staff who came on the missions gave every assistance to the work that
was being carried out, which helped to maintain good progress on the activities relating to the
Tariff Program.
Training
10.         The Bank gave every assistance with the hiring of consultants, the procurement of
equipment and the organization of training courses, including those performed abroad, but mostly
with those held in Ecuador.
11.         It should be pointed out that additional funds were allocated for the procurement
of technical training equipment and for the holding of training courses in Ecuador with the
participation of international organizations and Instituto Centro Americano de Administraci6n de
Empresas (INCAE).
B.    INECEL's Performance at the Various Stages of the Project
12.         INECEL was in continuous negotiations with the Bank and the various levels of
the National Government with a view to obtaining signature of the Loan Agreement, which was
eventually signed in June 1987.
13.         During project implementation there was a delay in forming the Executing Units
for the four programs that made up the project and in the approval of plans for the hiring of



- 10 -
consultants and procurement of equipment, this being attributable to the diversity of legislation
with which these activities were required to comply. This also resulted in the postponement of
the hiring of the individual consultants.
Institutional Development
14.          With respect to the hiring of the consulting firm for the studies planned in this
program, it was not possible to implement this because of the late receipt of the required approval
from the Controller General and because of the high price of the single bid received for the
execution of these studies.
15.         In this program the Bank authorized the hiring of the individual consultant who
prepared the management information system plan for INECEL.
16.          Priority was subsequently given to the power sector restructuring studies and the
inventory review/revaluation of the assets involved in the operation of INECEL and 17 power
companies; these studies were contracted through UJNDP.
Power Sector Operations Study
17.          Progress on the project was slow and difficult throughout its various stages, and
this, in turn, at times delayed the progress of procedures at the various operating levels. These
interruptions were largely responsible for the significant time overrun and impacted on the total
cost of the program.
18.          The foregoing situation is primarily due to the system of excessive legal controls
and regulations requiring that prior approval be obtained from the office of the Controller
General, the office of the Attorney General and the National Secretariat of Information
Technology. This meant that the negotiations took much longer than expected, which created
problems with representatives of the commercial companies and resulted in amendments to the
terms of the contract, causing an increase in the total contract cost.
19.          Consequently, with respect to Procurement, it was not possible to include BID #
OSPE-03-91, covering equipment, instruments and accessories for electrical and mechanical tests
and metering, and instrumentation for maintaining and operating the
Ecuadorian power system for approximately US$680,000, in financing under the IBRD
Loan 2713-EC; as well as the 90% balance of the Contract with COINTEC for the
procurement of precision equipment.
20.          The implementation of all the studies and technical applications that were part of
the basic objectives for improving the electric power system is under way.
21.          A lesson that should definitely be learned and kept in mind for future programs or
projects is that it is essential that the various institutional authorities responsible for decision-



making facilitate the execution of activities in order to achieve the best possible results in keeping
with the goals and objectives, creating an environment that is conducive to the various levels of
action being executed on time and thereby ensuring that actual project costs can be kept as close
as possible to the estimates.
Tariffs
22.          The performance of the Directorate of Studies and Tariff Control, as the agency
responsible for the Tariff Studies Program, was in accordance with the plans drawn up and also in
keeping with the specifications established by the Bank at the start and during implementation of
the program.
23.          Once the studies were completed, the Government decided to adopt new tariff
levels starting in January 1989 and the methodology will be used in future tariff changes.
24.          The decision to do the work with INECEL's technical staff and with the ad hoc
assistance of foreign consultants was a wise one because it made it possible for all the information
on the subject to remain within INECEL. This was obviously achieved, taking a longer time than
originally allowed for the study, despite the legal and administrative restrictions currently in effect
in Ecuador, which limited flexibility in the hiring of consultants and resulted in the delay in the use
of the loan proceeds. In the absence of the metering equipment which it was impossible to
procure in time because of the restrictions mentioned, the load curve study was carried out using
more simple and approximate methods and criteria; work is still continuing on the process for
obtaining information from the field in order to confirm the findings obtained using the
methodology indicated.
Training
25.         It is essential that the organizational structure of the project, together with levels
of management and decision-making be defined and approved at the very start of project
implementation in order to save time.
26.          Greater flexibility is needed at the decision-making levels, given the fact that a lot
of time was spent on approving standards and procedures.
27.          More detailed information should also be provided on the internal and external
procedures required for obtaining reports, securing approvals and completing
financial/administrative formalities.

C.   Relationship Between the Bank and the Borrower at the Various Stages of Project
Implementation.
28.         Constant contact was maintained between the Project Coordination Unit, Program
Chiefs and the various Bank representatives who visited Ecuador when necessary or on their
normal scheduled mnissions.
29.         This contact included the exchange of information with a view to securing the
Bank's prior authorization for the procedures involved in the hiring of consulting firms, individual
consultants and for the various purchases of equipment and also information on the amount of the
proceeds of the loan actually used.
Institutional Development
30.         Relations between INECEL and the Bank were satisfactory and made it possible to
prioritize certain studies included in this program in order to accomplish the objectives by utilizing
the finds allocated in the loan.
Power Sector operations Study
31.         Throughout the various stages of the project there was coordination with respect
to the various aspects of project implementation.
Tariffs
32.         Relations between INECEL and the Bank were always cordial and thanks to the
continuous exchange of opinions it was possible to solve and simplify several problems which
would otherwise have been drawn out and even complicated the process.
33.         The justifications presented were always based on valid arguments and technical
analyses, which gradually gave the Bank sufficient confidence to speed up decision-making.
Training
34.         Optimal relations. The Bank provided the support needed in response to the
justifications submitted.
D.   Performance of the Consultants and other International Agencies Involved in
Project Implementation.
35.         INECEL was assisted by consulting firms and individual consultants, who helped
to carry out and complete the studies originally planned, along with others that were determined



- 13 -
necessary, in the course of Project implementation, by INECEL, the Ecuadorian Government and
the Bank. The exception to this was the Institutional Development Program which was
unsuccessful in obtaining the consultants' services originally planned because of delays in
obtaining approval from the office of the Controller and because of the high bid of the only firm
that responded to the bidding invitation.
Institutional Development
36.         Priority was given to the power sector restructuring studies and the inventory
review and revaluation of the assets of INECEL and 17 power companies.
37.         The consultants who were hired for this program and who completely fulfilled their
contractual obligations with respect to the studies included in the contract, were the following:
38.         Mr. Julian Castro: Drafting of the Information Systems Plan for INECEL, which
was sent to the National Directorate of Information Technology of SENDA for approval.
39.         ENDESA DE ESPANZA - PRICE WATERHOUSE: Drafting of the Power Sector
Law.
40.         COOPERS & LYBRAND Y ASOCIADOS: Inventory review and revaluation of
power sector assets.
41.         The latter two were hired through UNDP, the work on the drafting of the new
Power Sector Law having been completed and forwarded to the National Congress for their
information and approval.
Power Sector operations Study
42.         This aspect of the program was carried out in accordance with the guidelines
previously set forth in the document entitled, "Terms of reference for the hiring of consultants".
43.         In the case of the Systems Engineering module, the studies and surveys for
collecting data to identify information systems needs within DOSNI were carried out on the basis
of the very latest concepts and technologies.
44.         In the case of the operation module, certain mathematical models used in the
operational planning of generation resources were revised in order to develop a set of updated
technical tools. New mathematical models were prepared, which took account of the new
topology of the national system (closure of the transmission ring), thereby paving the way for
optimizing generation resources.
45.         In the case of the exploitation module [m6dulo de explotaci6n], diagnostic
analyses were carried out and a decision was made as to which pieces of test equipment were



- 14 -
needed, on the basis of the needs of the various technical sectors, existing stocks and procurement
planned through other programs.
46.         The search/selection of experts was successfully carried out and the program
performed by them, in each case, met expectations and provided the staff of DOSNI and INECEL
with gain valuable experience.
Tariffs
47.         The consultants selected to carry out the Tariff Study Program lived up to
expectations.
48.         The General Consultant for the program (Mr. Hernan Campero Lecaros) was the
generator of the entire process and the one who planned the activities to be undertaken. He was
also the consultant to establish the marginal generation costs.
49.         The marginal costs consultant, i.e. Dr. Fernando Lecaros, was in charge of the
studies on transmission and distribution costs and was also responsible for defining the tariff
structure.
50.         The consultants for the load curve and the metering equipment, i.e. Dr. Alessandro
Barghini and Mr. Henrique Ferreira, respectively, performed as expected.
51.         The tariff consultant, Mr. Ruben Vergara Solar, worked on the proposal for the
new tariff structure of 1989.
Training
52.         Two approaches were used where the training of consultants were
concerned:
(a) One involved the use of an institution similar to INECEL, i.e.
ELECTROBRAS, on the basis of a special agreement, which
yielded better results and lower costs.
(b) The second involved the hiring of specialists under the guarantee
of international organizations such as CINTERFOR, which
offered good experience for the purpose.
