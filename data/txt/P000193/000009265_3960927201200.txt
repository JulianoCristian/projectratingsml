JIDORANDUN AND RECOHMEIDATIOI OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIOR&L DEVEWPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SERVICES SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 25.1 million (US$33.1 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit, which would
include a quick disbursing component of SDR 7.04 million (Us$9.3 million),
vould be on standard IDA terms and 40 years maturity and would help finance
the reorganization of agricultural services in Burundi. Parallel financing
would be provided by France and the European Development Fund (US$0.4 million)
and Belgium (US$0.8 million) for technical assistance.
2.       Tragic events shook Burundi in August 1988.  A mission visited
Burundi in October to assess the situation and its likely evolution. It
concluded that the current Government approach -- working toward
reconciliation and building national unity -- represents the best hope of
peacefully resolving the long standing etonic issues which have affected the
country. The return in December of refugees who fled Burundi in August is a
positive sign. The Association's assistance to Burundi will continue
supporting Government's efforts to ensure that the benefits of economic
development accrue to all Burundians. This proposed agricultural services
sector project is an important etep in this long-term strategy.
3.       Background.  Agriculture employs over 90S of Burundi's 5 million
inhabitants and provides 50S of GDP and 902 of foreign exchange earnings, 801
of whi2h from coffee exports. Population density in Burundi is very high (180
per km+) and average farm size is only 0.7 ha. So far, Burundian farmers have
been able to incresse food production in line with population growth estimated
at 32 per year by taking Into cultivation previously unused lands, by adapting
their farming system to schieve increasingly higher cropping intensities, and
by shifting from cereals and legumes to higher yielding tuber crops. This
has, thus far, minimized the use of cash inputs, but it has also meant that
crop yields per acre have not notably increased end nutritional status has
deteriorated. Agricultural services are largely ineffective, generally
employing inadequate research and extension methods. Until recently,
agricultural research has been guided more by academic requisites than by
farmers' needs. Extension has suffered from the lack of relevant technical
packages, especially for foodcrops and, as a result, extension services have
too often been limited to ensuring compliance with Government decreed national
objectives in a top-down approach. In addition, extension efforts are diluted
by a heavy burden of unrelated non-extension duties. The use of agricultural
inputs is limited to improved seeds, some fertilizer, pesticides and tools.
The existing seed production and distribution system is chaotiz and few of the
improved" seeds outperform traditional varieties under actual farming
conditions. Problems encountered on the institutional side have been
fourfold. First, the creation and subsequent expansion of Regional
Development Companies (RDCs) to implement area-based integrated rural



- 2 -
development projects caused confusion as to the role of the central ministries
and, to some extent, led to dual services. Secondly, the integrated vocation
of RDCs led them to take on varied activities including social services,
construction work and commercial activities and to compete with the private
sector in some of these activities. The high cost of RDC operations
increasingly led to questions of financial sustainability. Third, both
extension and research services have been top down, taking insufficient
account of farmer requirements and failing to learn from progressive farmer
initiatives. A more participatory attitude would not only result in
efficiency gains, but would also help to lessen social tensions. Fourth,
separate financing of RDC counterpart expenditures through earmarked resources
(i.e., the coffee pricing system) led to unaccountability of resource use,
difficulties in sectoral investment planning and programming and, in some
instances, wasteful allocation of scarce Government resources and a growing
level of subsidies.
The Sectoral Adiustment Program
4.       The Government adopted on June 28, 1988 a new Agricultural and
Livestock Sectoral Policy which addressed the above-mentioned issues. The
sectoral policy builds on the Government's statement on agricultural policies
attached to the Second Structural Adjustment Program approved by the Executive
Directors in June 1988. The proposed operation would assist the Government in
implementing two key components of its agricultural sector policy: (i) reform
of the national input policy through the gradual elimination of subsidies and
the unification of the fiscal policy on inputs; (ii) the restructuring of
Buyenzi and Kirimiro RDCs through: transfer of extension activities to MOAL's
services, phasing out and progressive transfer of RDCs input production,
marketing, and other commercial activities to the private sector and
cooperatives; and (iii) reform of agricultural staff's salary structure.
These policy reforms would be supported by a quick disbursing component to be
disbursed in two tranches (see para. 9).
Rationale for IDA Involvement
5.       The project is part of IDA's strategy to support the GOB's structural
adjustment program. It addresses key policy measures in the agricultural
sector and would complement the agricultural sector component of the Second
Structural Adjustment Program as well as actions undertaken by the Muyinga
Agricultural Development Project. It will be a follow-up to three ongoing IDA
projects: Ngozi III, Kirimiro and Technical Assistance III. IDA's involvement
in the design of Integrated Rural Development projects was instrumental in the
creation and development of existing RDCs as implementing agencies of the
Ngozi and Kirimiro projects. IDA's involvement in adopting the lessons
learned from operating the RDCs since their creation is therefore equally
essential. The project would be the first step of a long term structural
adjustment of the agricultural sector which would focus ons (i) transfer of
agriculture investments to the private sector; (ii) close monitoring of the
cost/benefit ratio of agricultural services, rural development infrastructure
and land protection; (iii) concentration of budgetary resources on public
service activities (extension, research); and (iv) divestiture of commercial
activities (input supply, marketing). The proposed project would apply these
principles to the reorganization of Buyenzi and Kirimiro RDCs and would be
complemented by a CoffeelExport Crops Project currently under preparation.

Proiect Obiectives
6.       The purpose of this hybrid operation is to deepen the adjustment
process in the agricultural sector. The policy-based component would promote
the involvement of the private sector and cooperatives in sustainable
agricultural input delivery through the gradual suppression of subsidies, and
improve efficiency while reducing the financial costs of agricultural services
through the reorganization of their delivery system (switch from area
development companies to a national service). It would also support a reform
of the salary structure of the agricultural staff.  The investment component
would : (i) develop MQAL's analytical and long term progravming and budgeting
capability, and sector management capacity; (ii) design and establish a
national extension system based on the training and visit printiple capable of
responding to farmers' needs and constraints and of developing rechnologies
adapted to various ecological and farming systems; (iii) strengthen
agricultural research on fertilization and pest control; and (iv) rehabilitate
the cooperative movement and promote the development of savings and credit
cooperatives (COOPECs).
Proiect Description
7.       The project would be a hybrid operation consisting of a quick
disbursing component supporting the adjustment program and an investment
component. The investment component would include:
(a)   Strengthenin. of MOAL's central services throughs
(i) support MOAL's rlanning Directorate; (ii) creation of a
Financial and Administrative Unit; and (iii) strengthening the
recently created General Directorate for extension;
(b)   Strengthening of agriculture research throught
(i) Strengthening of the phytosanitary control service In
ISABU; (ii) Support to a National Fertilizer Research Program;
(iii) preparation of a program to reorient agricultural
research;
(c)   Reorganization and strengthenint of regional agricultural
services through: (i) Reorganization and Strengthening of
Extension services in S provinces under Buyensi and Kirimiro
RDCs; (ii) carrying out, with the support of ISABU a program
of adaptive and on-farm research in the five provinces;
(ii) carrying out a staff training program;
(iv) strengthening livestock services in Buyenzi and Kirimiro;
and (v) support to land protection and development;
(d)   Management of Buvenzi and Kirimiro RDCs' reorganization
through: (i) strengthening RDCs' promotion activities; and
(ii) monitoring and evaluation.
(e) Promotion of Communal Development and of Rural Youth
enwloyment through pilot programs in Ngozi and Muramvya
provinces.



- 4 -
(f) Strenathening of the Cooperative Movement through:
(A) support to HRDH's Cooperative Department in the promotion
of an w-Atonomous cocoperative movement; (ii) support to Savings
and Credit Cooperatives (COOPEC);
8.       The project, to be carried out over 5 years, provides funds for civil
works, vehicles, furniture and equipment; training and studies; technical
assistance; and incremental operating costs. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$40.0 million with a foreign exchange component of US$29.3
million (73Z). A breakdown of c>ats and the financing plan are shown In
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and a
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events a-d the status of Bank Group operations In Burundi are given in
Schedules C and D. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7557-BU dated April 26, 1989 has been distributed separately.
Agreed Actions
9.       The Government has agreed on the followings  (a) establishing and
staffing a Financial and Administrative Unit in MOAL by credit effectiveness;
(b) submitting a study on RDC garage operation by April 1991; (c) returning
the responsibility of services activities from the RDCa to MOAL's General
Directorate for Extension before December 1992 while at the same time
reinforcing budget control at the central level; (d) Implementing a cost
recovery mechanism for livestock inputs before January 1992; (e) including
operating costs of the provincial services in the agricultural sector public
expenditure program, with total financing by January 1995; and
(f) eliminating, in steps, fertilizer subsidies by June 1991. Tranche release
conditions for the policy component are as follows: First Tranche:
(i) submission of satisfactory financing plan for 1989 and 1990 for the
Buyenzi and Kirimiro RDCs; (ii) increase by 25X of the consumer price for
fertilizer sold by Buyenzi and Kirimiro RDCs; (iv) establishment of a
Fertilizer Policy Committee; Second Tranche: (i) design of a national program
on seed production and marketing; (ii) implementation of the tranwfer of
administrative and financial responsibility of RDC extension staff In at least
one province in each RDC; (iii) the design of a national regulation on
pesticide usage; (iv) adoption of the 1990-1993 public expenditure program for
the agricultural sector; (v) starting to implement the results of a study on
the salary structure of MOAL's staff by August 1990.
Benefits
10.      The project is expected to improve the living conditions and the
nutritional situation in five provinces inhabited by about 35Z of Burundi's
population through better linkages between extension and research. The needs
of the growing number of small marginal farms, of young farmers (school
leavers) and of women farmers would receive special attention. The
reorganization of Government's interventions in the agricultural sector would
improve the cost-effectiveness of public expenditures and reduce public
expenditures for agricultural services by about 162. It would improve the
quality of sectoral programs and creato favorable conditions for a growing
involvement of the private sector and cooperatives in commercial activities.
The rate of return on fertilizer promotion, rice development and pest control
has been estimated at 19X.



Risks
11.     At the country level, the major risks are those  inherent In opening
up a heretofore tightly controlled society. The Government's determination to
build national unity, and the support of these efforts by the international
counuluity, should help minimize these risks.  At the project level, the major
risks are those derived from the scarcity of qualified Surundian staff. To
minimize this risk, the project would rely on an intensive training program,
support from consultants, linked with a local technical assistance program,
and on the involvement of NGOs. Another unknown would be the willingnesJ of
the private sector and cooperatives to accept the risks associated with Input
distribution and food crop processing and marketing. The project's phased
approach in assuming these marketing risks has been designed to facilitate
private sector participation.
Recoemendation
12.      I am satisfied that the project would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Credit.
