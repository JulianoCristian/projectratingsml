      addresses two main goals of the Government's new\n            agricultural sector policy: improvement of\n            cost-effectiveness of public expenditures in the\n            agricultural sector and improvement of nutritional standards\n            and incomes in rural areas. The project is a hybrid\n            operation composed of a policy component and an investment\n            component. The policy component focuses on: (i) reforming\n            the agricultural input policy; (ii) reorganization of\n            Buyenzi and Kirimiro Regional Development Companies (RDC);\n            and (iii) reforming the salary structure of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Livestock (MOAL) staff. The investment\n            component comprises: (i) strengthening of MOAL's\n            central services; (ii) strengthening agricultural research;\n            (iii) strengthening through reorganization of regional\n            agricultural services; (iv) management of RDC\n            reorganization; (v) promotion of community development and\n            rural youth employment; and (vi) strengthening of the\n            cooperative movement."}, "docdt": "1989-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
