MEMORANDUM AND RECOOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reco=endation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Ecuador for US$84.0 million equivalent.
The proposed loan, which would be repayable in 20 yea-s, including five years
of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, would help finance a
rural development project in twelve areas of the cou=7ry.
2.    Backaround.  Agriculture is a key sector of Ecuador's economy.  It
provides about 95% of the national food supply and generates approximately 522
of foreign exchange earnings. Throughout the 1970., agriculture suffered from
over-valuation of the local currency, controlled food prices and subsidized
food imports, all of which acted as disincentives to agricultural producers
many of whom were unable to adopt cost-reducing technology. As a result,
during 1970-1983 the agricultural sector grew at an average of only 2Z p.a.
compared to 7.21 p.a. for total GDP, and the sector's share .f GDP fell from
25Z in 1970 to about 131 in 1983. Policy reforms during the 1980. have
ancouraged agricultural production to grow more rapidly, averaging 9.51 p.a.
from 1983 to 1987, compared to 1.6Z p.a. for total GDP, which increased the
sectoral share of GDP to about 172 in 1987.
3.    Because agricultural production is labor-intensive, the sector is very
Important to national employment, especially for the poor. Despite high
rural-to-urban migration, the agricultural sector still employs about half of
Ecuador's economically active population. With rural incomes much below urban
levels and underemployment in rural areas about 50 of available labor,
agricultural growth and improved productivity are essential to expand
employment and enhance the incomes of Ecuador's poor.
4.    Until the early 1960's, Ecuador's agricultural sector consisted almost
exclusively of large farms (latifundial. With land reform laws approved in
1964 and 1970, a land redistribution process was initiated, benefiting
approximately 70,000 families that by 1980 had received about 600,000 ha.
Nonetheless, according to the last agricultural census carried out in 1974,
85.31 of the farms had less than 20 ha and occupied only about 18.3S of the
total land. At the other extreme, farms larger than 20 ha represented 14.71
of the total number and occupied 81.41 of the land. Although there are no
recent income studies in Ecuador, UNICEF estimates that 611 of total families
and 782 of rural families currently live below the "critical poverty" level
(defined as household income being less than the valus of the basic
consumption basket, according to the National Statistics Institute-INEC). The
existence of more than 3.5 million people living under such conditions in the
rural sector in a country with a iser csnta Income above US$1,000 is a clear
signal of unequal access to productive resources. Other indicators
(nutrition, housing, employment, mortality, education, etc.) also show that
poverty is ridespread in the rural sector.
5.    In recent years, Bank lending to agriculture has focused on three
areass (a) policy reforms in pricing, trade and credit; (b) provision of
investment credit; and (c) an area-specific attack on rural poverty.
Liberalization of agricultural trade and marketing, pursued through the
Agricultural Sector Loan (Loan 2626-EC), has not beet fully achieved, but good



- 4 -
(d) increase employment and incomes of the rural population by improving basic
lnfrastructure (irrigation, roads, marketing) and boosting productivity;
(e) promote grassroots involvement of rural comumities and groups of
boneficiaries, giving special emphais to rural  wmen; (f) foster a better use
and conservation of natural resources; and (8) strengthen beneficiareies'
organitAtion. and NGOs.
9.    Prolect DeVCwitlit9. The proposed project would be the first phase of
a longer-term Nsaional Rural Development Program. All of its components have
been conceived as pilot operations for ev,ntual application at the national
level. The selection of 12 areas for the first phase was based on the studies
carried out by tBS (para. 7). Selection criteria have included% (a) the
degree of rural poverty, measured by annual oor-souta inacome, number and
percentage of small farms, rate of infant and adult mortality, malnutrition
and population growth; (b) presence and participation of small farmers'
organizations; (c) actual and potential land use; (d) previous rural
devolopment activitiest and (a) presence of governmental and non-goverrmental
institutions in the area.
10.   The project would cover a total area of about  630,000 ha and would
affect approximAtely 33,000 families (170,000 people) directly and about
55,000 families (375,000 people) indirectly. It would include the following
activities: (a) completion and rehabilitation of six irrigation schemes, two
flood control schemes, and 43 existing water courses, all of which would
provide irrigation for an incremental area of about 26,000 ha; (b) improvement
of adaptive research and extension services for validation and transfer of
technology to small farmers and promotion of forestation; (c) expansion and
rehabilitation of marketing facilities at the regional and local levels;
(d) improvement of approximately 700 km of existing feeder roads and
construction of about 100 km of new rural roads; (e) construction of small
reservoirs to supply water for domestic and productive uses to about 22,000
people; (f) land tenure regularization and titling covering about 110,000 ha
and 10,000 farms; (g) establishment of a comwunity development fund (FODECO)
to help finance local projects supporting technology transfer and to promote
mall-scale rural enterprises to be operated by small farmers;
(h) establishment and operation of an environmental unit within SSDR to
monitor the environmental impact of the project and help coordinate its
implementation; (i) training of beneficiaries and project staff; (j) project
coordination and management; sad (k) a comprehensive technical assistance
component to support implementation of all compouents and strengthening
overall coordination.
11.   The project would promote participation of beneficiaries' organizations
at all levels (including women's groups) and would strengthen their technical
and managerial ability to identify and implement rural development activities.
The project would also improve farmers' access to production and marketing
credit through land titling, technical assistance and farm planning. Similar
credit assistance to small farmers is already being given successfully in the
ongoing ED projects in the country, where recovery rates are almost 100%. A
significant amount of project investment would be carried out by the
beneficiaries to support on-farm and community development activities. This
investment would be financed either through the formal credit system or by the
beneficiaries' own resources.
12.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$112.7 million
equivalent (excluding taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of
US$36.3 million (32S). The proposed loan of US$84.0 million would finance
about 75Z of total project costs, while US$28.7 million (25X) would be



provided by COS and the direct beneficiaries. Bligible expenditures from
November 17, 1990 to the date of loan signing are proposed for retroactive
finaning from the loan, up to a maximum equivalent to US$7.5 million (about
92 of the total loan amount), to allow for the Initiation of key civil works
(Irrigation schemes and rural roads) using funds currently being made
available by GOE. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule S. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Ecuador are given
in Schedules C and D. A map is also attached showing the location of project
areas. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9437-tC dated June 10, 1991, is also
attached.
130   MBS, through its Undersecretariat for Rural Development (SSDR), would
be responsible for overall project implementation and coordination, relying on
specialized public end private executing agencies. These agencies are:
(a) the Ministry of Agriculture (NAG) for rural extension services; (b) the
National Institute for Agricultural Research (IIIAP) for generation and
validation of technology; (c) the Ecuadorian Institute for Hydraulic Resources
(INERHI), the Andean Center for Popular Action (CAAP), and the Brethren and
Unida Foundation (FBU) for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation and
flood control schemes; (d) the Ecuadorian Institute for Land Reform and
Settlement (IERAC) for the land regularization and titling component; (e) the
National Development Bank (BNF) for the credit aspects; and (f) the Hydraulic
Resources Council of the Jipijapa and Pajin cantons (JRH) for the water
harvesting component. Also provincial and municipal governments, local NGOs
and beneficiaries' organizations would be involved in implementing some
activities. A detailed analysis of all executing agencies has identified
institutional linkages, tasks, skills and capacity gaps. This analysis has
provided the basis for designing a comprehensive set of institutional
development activities to support project implementation as described in
para. 10, items (i) - (k), above.
14.   To enhance project coordination, a Movitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit
has been created within SSDR. This unit would monitor progress in reaching
established targets, based on verifiable, time-bound, key indicators for all
components. The M&E unit would coordinate its activities with other units of
SSDR (and through SSDR with other executing agencies) allowing early
identification of implementation problems and appropriate actions to solve
them. Semi-annual reports, with data on physical and financial progress,
would be prepared by this nnit and submitted to all participating agencies and
to the Bank. An Annual Periormantee Review would be carried out between the
Bank and GOE with the objective of discussing the methodology and contents of
the annual work plan (POA), as well as measures and actions required to
increase effectiveness in project implementation.
15.   AQreed Actions.  Before effectiveness, the Borrower would meet the
following conditions: (a) MBS would sign operating agreements with major
executing agencies (INIAP, INERNI, IERAC, BNP, and JRB); (b) MBS would
complete the establishment of the M&E system, based on a list of key
indicators accepted by the Bank; and (c) MBS would present a plan to
establish, operate and manage the FODECO, based on regulations accepted by the
Bank.
16.   Environmental Asoets.  The project has been classified as category B,
since it does not include activities expected to produce any negative
environmental impact. However, HBS has carried out a comprehensive



environmental Impact study, with technical assistance from local as well as
International consultants, covering all *reae and components. This study has
been conducted in coll4boTation with other public agencies and NGOO active in
this field. The study was reviewed at appraisal and its main conclusions
integrated Into the design of the project. The project would support the
establishment of a special Environmental Unit inside SEDR, Unidad del Medlo
Ambient- (UNA), which would be in charge of: (a) execution of specific
environmental studies# (b) preparation of guidelines for the implementation of
the project according to sound environmental practices; (c) follow-up and
assessment of the environmental impacts of the projects and (d) training staff
and beneficiaries to increase their ability to deal with environmental iseues.
17.   Beneflts.  The main benefits from the project would be tot (a) increase
and diversify agricultutral production, raising productivity and net ferm
incomes. At full development, the area cropped by direct beneficiaries would
be about 117,000 ha (321 higher than without project), including more than
26,000 ha under irrigation with cropping intensities between 1.5 and 2.0.
This would provide an increase in average net farm income of approximately
1502 over the level without the project; (b) raise incomes in the rural sector
by incressing value-added through processing and marketing, reducing unit
costs of transportation and increasing employment by promoting small-scale
sustainable enterprises at the community and village levels; (c) prevent
significant losses in output, destruction of private and public property and
curtailment of commercial activities through flood control protection; (d)
supply water for domestic use to about 22,000 people, improving sanitation and
standards of living; and (e) strengthen and consolidate the institutional
framework for rural development, promoting active participation of
beneficiaries' organizations and NGOo, and enhancing technicall/managerial
capacity of the public and private sectors to implement these activities. The
rate of return to the project has been estimated at 151.
18.   Prolect Risks.  (a) Manaxegbil_tZ.  Rural development is an inherently
complex task and will always carry with it significant management risks. The
lessons of previous RD projects in Ecuador in this respect have been taken
into account in the design of the project, which seeks to reduce the risk of
overcentralization and to focus on components which have a clear productive
purpose. The implementation strategy combines s centralized definition of
objectives, management end M&E within the MBS with a decentralized execution
iucluding public and private organizations (NGO's and farmers' organizations),
many of which are already operating in the selected areas. This approach
would allow for much greater flexibility than in the past, according to the
ability, experience and motivation of individual agencies, and it would
promote intensive participation of beneficiaries at all levels.
(b) Sustainabilitv. The conception and preparation of this project have
benefitted from a high degree of com itment and competence in the MBS and in
the staff of the SSDR. Obviously, there is a risk that this level of
commitment may not be sustained throughout the implementation period.
However, the best assurance of sustainability is again in the design of the
project itself, as described in parss. 9 to 14 above. Beneficiary
participation in design and preparation has already ensured strong political
momentum at the grassroots and, to a great extent, has immunized the project
against possibly disruptive political changes in the central administration.
The project has already touched a large number of rural communities and has
raised expectations in many more. It is very unlikely that a new
administration would see any political advantage in reversing the momentum
which has already been created.



19.   k*eoggnde. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
vith the Articles of Agreement of the Bank end recommand that the xzcgtutiv
Directors approve the proposed loan.
