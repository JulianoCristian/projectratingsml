sustainability unlikely, and institutional development\n            impacts negligible. Although overall, the bank performance\n            is rated as satisfactory, the performance by the borrower is\n            assessed as highly unsatisfactory, given the loss of\n            government commitment by subsequent administrations,\n            aggravated by difficulties in obtaining counterpart funds,\n            and the often politically motivated appointments of key\n            managers. Lessons address: 1) beneficiary participation as\n            an essential feature in the identification, planning, and\n            implementation process, to ensure the financing of\n            sustainable investments; 2) the complex nature of rural\n            development projects (which few developing countries have\n            managerial capacities for integrated solutions), suggests\n            simplified demand driven models as most likely to succeed;\n            3) the continuing ownership of project objectives, and\n            strategies by stakeholders, as a prerequisite for a\n            project's success; 4) the erroneous assumption that\n            surplus labor, through community maintenance arrangements\n            for rural roads, and infrastructure works will assure\n            success, should be replaced by identifying viable incentives\n            to gain stakeholders' participation; 5) reliability on\n            appropriate indicators, agreed during appraisal for\n            effective monitoring of project impacts, should be in place,\n            to evaluate specific issues, i.e., technology adoption, and\n            stakeholder commitment, designed to assist problem solving,\n            and project impact assessment; and, 6) substantial risks due\n            to political or economic instability, identified at\n            appraisal as endangering the project's primary\n            objective, could be mitigated by shortening the\n            implementation period, and, project design should seek to\n            insulate project management from political interference, to\n            avoid unnecessary management, and staff turnover."}, "docdt": "2001-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
