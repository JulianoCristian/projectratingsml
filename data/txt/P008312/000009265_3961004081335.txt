MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA
FOR THE PRIVATE INVESma2ENT AND EXPORT FINANCE PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Bulgaria for US$55
w4'lon equivalent.  The proposed loan would be a single currency loan (SCL)
in US dollars at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based interest rate for U.S. dollar
SCLs, with 17 years' maturity, including a four-year grace period, and would
help finance the Private Investment and Export Finance Project.
2.          Country and Sectoral Background.  The Government of Bulgaria has
recognized the key role that the private and export sectors must play in the
transformation of the economy from a centrally-planned to a market-oriented
system. The failure of state enterprise under the old regime to create wealth
for the country has pointed to the need to encourage private enterprise and to
privatize state enterprises.  The heavy dependence of the econoay on trade
with the former CMEA block and the small size of the domestic market have
required that new markets be found for Bulgarian exports. Thus, among the
first measures taken by the government in the transition process were
initiatives to create an environment conducive to private enterprise, and
reforms to liberalize trade. A program to privatize state enterprises has
also commenced.
3.          The government has opened-up the economy to private enterprise of
all forms, and has started the long-term task of creating a supportive
environment. Since 1989, the number of registered private companies has grown
dramatically from 14,000 to almost 260,000 in 1992. Estimates indicate that
over 145,000 firms are currently active, employing some 490,000 people on a
permanent basis and perhaps an even larger number of temporary workers. So
far, the private sector has been concentrated in the service, transportation
and trade sectors, with the remainder in light manufacturing and construction
activities.
4.          The policy framework for exporting activities has also been
substantially liberalized. The state monopoly on trade was dismantled and
trade restrictions were relaxed, allowing most exports and imports to be
undertaken on the basis of customs declarations and unifying and simplifying
the tariff regime. Exchange restrictions on current account transactions were
eliminated and the daily exchange rate was allowed to float to reflect total
demand and supply of foreign exchange. In 1992, export receipts reached
US$4.3 billion, representing an increase of 131 over the value recorded in
1991. More significant is the increase in the share of exports to non-CMEA
markets from 441 in 1991 to 63X in 1992.
5.          The legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the
privatization of state enterprises has been put in place. A privatization
agency has been created to oversee the privatization program. The
privatization agency and line ministries have prepared their privatization
programs for 1992 and 1993. After a slow start, implementation of these
programs has gained momentum as evidenced by the auctioning of several
enterprises and the scheduling of future auctions. The direct sale of several
medium and large enterprises is also being actively pursued.



- 2 -
6.          While a prouising start has been made in promoting private
investments and exports, and in privatizing state enterprises, progress in
reforming the state financial and enterprise sectors has been slower than
needed to restructure the economy and return it to growth. The government
continues to be committed to rapid privatization and restructuring (including
liquidation) of state-owned banks and enterprises, but progress has been
hampered by a concern to assure the fairness of the process. This has made
the government very cautious and deliberate in selecting implementation
procedurea. The country also suffers from inadequate implementation capacity.
7.          Rationale for Bank InvMolvement.  The government's reform strategy
for the financial and enterprise sectors lies on three cornerstones. First,
new wealth creation is to be generated by She private sector. This entails
the promotion of efficient private enterprise and a wholesale privatization of
state enterprises. Second, loss-making in the state sector has to be
eliminated as quickly as possible to release resources for private sector
growth. This involves the liquidation of non-viable state enterprises and the
restructuring of state enterprises that are deemed necessary to remain in
state ownership as public utilities or for reasons of national interest.
Third, a healthy, efficient and market-oriented financial sector has to be
developed quickly to provide the debt and equity capital needed by the private
sector. I'his includes the establishment of an adequate regulatory and
supervisory framework for financial institutions, the promotion of efficient
and sound banks and capital market institutions and markets, interest rate
liberalization and the restructuring and privatization of state banks. The
implementation of this program has been started with the support of the on-
going Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL).
8.           The proposed project would lead to a full-scale implementation of
the goverrment's financial and enterprise sector adjustment program by
supporting the initial stages of implementation. It would promote the
development of the private sector by supporting private enterprises,
privatized state enterprises and private exporters. It would also support the
initial stages of banking sector reform by helping to institutionalize
satisfactory prudential regulations and bank supervision, strengthening
individual banks and encouraging the restructuring and privatization of
consolidated state banks. By supporting aspects of the program that would
generate output, exports and employment, and some government revenues, the
proposed project would facilitate the implementation of those aspects of
reform that involve a contraction of economic activities and unemployment, and
budgetary outlays.
9.          Proiect Objectives.  Pursuant to this assistance strategy, the
proposed project would provide financial and technical assistance to the
private sector to encourage a strong supply response to the reforms already
undertaken and to enable them to undertake efficient investments and export
transactions. Specifically, the proposed project would have three key
objectives: a) to promote private sector growth through the establishment of
private enterprises, the privatization of state enterprises and the expansion
of private sector exports; b) to assist in developing a sound and efficient
banking system by helping build an adequate regulatory and supervisory
capacity, strengthening the capabilities of individual banks and encouraging
the restructuring and privatization of state banks; and c) to expand exports
to revive production capacities idled by the collapse of the CMEA market.



- 3 -
10.         Project Contoents. To achiave the above objectives, the proposed
project would have three major components: a) investment credits for the
private sector for the financing of viable projects, including the preparation
of project feasibility studies (US$32 million equivalent); b) export credits
for private exporters for financially and economically profitable export
transactions (US$20 million equivalent); and c) technical assistance (TA) for
participating financial intermediaries to build capacity for project appraisal
and supervision and strengthen general banking functions (US$3 million
equivalent). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan is shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bulgaria are
given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11712-BUL, dated May 17, 1993, is being distributed
separately.
11.        Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreements with the
Government were reached on th( following:
(a)   Loan Covenants. The Government would reconfirm its commitment
that there would be no subsidized lending to industry and that
general lending policies would be reviewed regularly with the
Bank.
(b)   Conditions of Loan Effectiveness. The following would be
conditions of Loan effectiveness:
(i)  The Government would sign Subsidiary Loan
Agreements, satisfactory to the Bank,
with, at least, two eligible PFIs;
(ii) The boards of directors of these PFIs
would adopt Policy and Corporate Strategy
Statements, acceptable to the Bank; and
(iii) BNB would issue new prudential regulations
for banks, satisfactory to the Bank.
(c)    Condition of Disbursement. For the export credit component, BNB
would establish an export finance facility, satisfactory to the
Bank, to revolve export credits for a period of three years from
loan effectiveness.
12.         Enviromental Aspects. All subborrowers under the investment
credit component of the project would be required to comply with environmental
protection regulations of the country, acceptable to the Bank. In appraising
subprojects, the PFIs would ensure that subborrowers have received clearance
from the relevant regulatory agencies regarding the environmental impact of
their investments. Subborrowers would be required to submit evidence of
clearance as part of standard subloan processing. During subproject
implementation, the PFIs would review compliance with environmental
regulations and requirements of subprojects in the course of normal subproject
supervision. The PFIs would report and coordinate regularly with the
envirormental regulators to help monitor compliance. This approach to



-4-
environmental protection by the PFIs is reflected in their policy and
corporate strategy statements agreed with the Bank.
13.         Project Benefits and Risks.  The project is an investment
operation that would support implementation of the reforms for private sector
development and the privatization of state enterprises, and in banking and
trade policy. It would help to build healthy and effieient financial
intermediaries and a market-based investment and export.-financing mechanism.
By helping the participating financial institutions develop expertise in
project lending, it would improve project selection and promote more efficient
investments. By assisting entrepreneurs in preparing their investment
subprojects it would improve the use of capital. It would support the
expansion of viable private enterprises and generate an estimated 15,000 new
full-time jobs in 2,000 enterprises. It would help realize some US$80 million
of new exports annually, helping redirect some of the capacities idled by the
collapse of the former CMEA markets to new markets.
14.         The main project risk stems from institutional weakness.  Private
banks are new and small, and are still learnit.g to handle traditional
commercial banking functions. Project financing would be an added element of
risk for them. Technical assistance and close supervision would be provided
to control this risk. Private enterprises are small, undercapitalized and
have short track records. Mortality rates could be high. Assistance to
private enterprises in preparing investment subprojects, and an improved
ability by the participating financial intermediaries to discriminate credit
risks would be provided to mitigate these risks. Risks associated with
macroeconomic and political instability are also present. These could
translate into project risks if investments and exports are adversely
affected, and volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates result in
problem loans for banks. Through the on-going SAL, and in coordination with
the IMF, the Bank has an active macroeconomic policy dialogue with the
government. Providing U.S. dollar SCL terms for this Loan would reduce
currency risk for sub-borrowers since their revenues are expected to be mainly
in U.S. dollars. The LIBOR interest rate basis is suitable for the export
finance component, but may introduce interest rate risk for sub-borrowers
under the investment credit component. On balance, however, the benefit of
reduced currency exposure is expected to outweigh the interest rate risk.
15.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the loan.
