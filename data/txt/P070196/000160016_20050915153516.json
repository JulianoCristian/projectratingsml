This report discusses strategies for achieving\n            this aim. The indigenous people of Gabon are identified as\n            the Babongo, Bakoya, Baka, Barimba, Bagama, Bakouyi, and\n            Akoa - the pygmies. The risks resulting from this project\n            which threaten to impact thee people include: loss of\n            control over traditional land, becoming even more\n            marginalized in society; disintegration of the decentralized\n            system of administration, less assistance received from\n            government services, fewer capacities to defend their legal\n            rights, dependency on other ethnic groups, loss of cultural\n            and social identity. To offset these potential risks, the\n            plan will establish equal legal opportunities, technical\n            opportunities, financial opportunities, organizational\n            opportunities, and cultural opportunities. Among the\n            activities planned are putting in place capacity and\n            structure, providing ID cards, recognizing the settlements\n            as villages equal to other settlements, establishing\n            community forests, recognizing and protecting the land use\n            areas of indigenous people, announcing a national policy on\n            illegal immigrants, enabling the indigenous to actively\n            participate in natural resource management, improving\n            intercultural communication, improving research to provide\n            baseline information, ensuring indigenous people receive a\n            fair share of the redistribution of forest revenue,\n            facilitating forest-related decision-making,   and\n            establishing a participatory monitoring and evaluation system."}, "docdt": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
