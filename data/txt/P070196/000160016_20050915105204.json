The most significant potentially negative\n            environmental impacts include overexploitation of non-wood\n            forest products by installing badly controlled channels;\n            increased solid waste and liquid effluents leading to\n            increased river and aquifer pollution from industrial\n            chemicals; uncontrolled forestry logging triggering losses\n            of income leading to increased poaching, urban migration,\n            and social conflicts; reduced biodiversity in freshwater\n            ecosystems, possibly causing extinction of some species;\n            uncontrolled exploitation of some aquatic species; and\n            development of tourist activities incompatible with\n            biodiversity conservation. Key social issues include crop\n            destruction caused by wild animals; loss of access to land\n            and traditional fishing grounds; loss of income\n            opportunities; and uncertainty concerning the legal status\n            of immigrants working in the sector. Measures to reduce\n            these risks are as follows: Reinforce CENAP (the national\n            environmental protection agency) to strengthen its role in\n            controlling and analyzing pollution, especially regarding\n            standards and laboratory protocols; monitor forest permits\n            and reinforce the regulatory and legal framework; and\n            provide training in protected areas management, solid waste\n            and liquid effluent management, regulatory enforcement, and\n            forest management."}, "docdt": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
