Their access to resources will\n            most probably be reduced. This combination resettlement\n            process framework and resettlement policy framework\n            addresses these problems and outlines mitigations. The\n            report identifies the people to be affected (PAPs) and\n            assesses their specific needs and interests with the aim of\n            restoring their livelihoods. While the report does not yet\n            determine whether the project must restore villages, along\n            with providing land as compensation. To minimize impacts and\n            reduce costs, it may be possible to reform the laws to allow\n            human activities in the national parks unless villages\n            prefer establishing new sites outside the park. PAPs whose\n            livelihoods are entirely based on the park will also be\n            provided new income opportunities that are non-land-based\n            and guarantee the incomes they had in the pre-park\n            situation. People whose livelihoods are only partly based on\n            the park will be provided the capacities and infrastructure\n            to increase the marketing of their products, and the use and\n            maintenance of protection measures against the growing\n            animal population in the park, such as community hunting\n            zones. Those people who have only traditional rights to park\n            and protected area resources may be given cash based\n            compensation together with some capacity building to invest\n            this. Indigenous people, who depend on park or protected\n            area resources will be allowed free access as much as\n            possible, including a special right of the Baka people to\n            hunt elephants under park supervision. The Baka will also be\n            offered social services for free in exchange for a ban on\n            commercial hunting on protected species or large scale hunting."}, "docdt": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
