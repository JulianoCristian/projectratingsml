Some\n            lessons learned included: the NRM-DPL operation is one of\n            the few DPLs where Sectoral Investment Lending (SIL) related\n            elements were maintained. While in the context of this\n            operation, it turned out to be a relevant solution, as\n            indicated by the Borrower-, it has generated important\n            delays and confusions. It is thus not recommended to\n            replicate such 'hybrid' instrument in other\n            operations. Governmental reform programs are broad by\n            definition. The design phase of a development policy\n            operation aims at targeting a set of reforms within the\n            overall reform program of the Government in a given sector.\n            It is very important that both parties share the same\n            understanding of the reforms to be implemented under the\n            policy lending as well as the associated prior actions and\n            triggers: indicators need to be well-specified, agreed\n            up-front with the Borrower, and closely monitored by both\n            the Borrower and the Bank during implementation (the policy\n            matrix proved to be a useful tool). Any change during\n            implementation needs to be jointly discussed and agreed\n            upon. When other critical issues emerge during the course of\n            the operation, those should not be included as new prior\n            actions or triggers (as was the case for the Forest Fund in\n            the NRM-DPL operation) but should rather be part of the\n            broader policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
