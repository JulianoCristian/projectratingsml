Loan aims to improve the\n            efficiency of natural resources management in Gabon, to\n            increase its impact on poverty alleviation, to protect the\n            environment, and to reduce the country's dependence on\n            declining oil resources. It covers renewable natural\n            resources-forests, fisheries, biodiversity and\n            environment-as well as the country's mining (mostly\n            manganese) and oil sectors. With regard to forest,\n            fisheries, biodiversity and environment, the proposed loan\n            will support the reform agenda set forth in the May 2004\n            letter of Sector Policy which will be implemented through\n            the national multi-donor Forest, Fisheries, Biodiversity and\n            Environment Sector Program (FESP). The proposed loan will\n            also support Gabon's participation in the Extractive\n            Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) for oil and mining\n            revenues, and it will lay the foundation for broader reforms\n            in the mining sector. Policies supported by the proposed\n            loan focus on enhancing transparency, accountability and law\n            enforcement, on improving the business climate, on ensuring\n            equitable sharing of revenues, and on protecting the\n            resource-base and natural ecosystems."}, "docdt": "2005-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
