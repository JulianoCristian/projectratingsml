                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the operation is to support the Government's efforts to improve transparency, governance and law enforcement for natural resource
                         management. In synergy with other development partners, the DPL will support the implementation of Gabon's PSFE program and EITI initiative. The DPL
                         covers four policy areas: (1) forest; (2) biodiversity-environment; (3) fisheries; and (4) mining-oil. With regard to forest and biodiversity, the DPL will capitalize
                         on the recent wave of reforms to ensure that they take hold and are deepened. With regard to fisheries, mining and oil, it will help open the door for similar
                         reform process that is starting to emerge. It will support the implementation of the EITI in the oil and mining sector. This operation will help improve the
                         investment climate by leveling the playing field and providing clear rules of the game in favor of more socially and environmentally responsible investors. By
                         linking lending to the implementation of reforms, this operation will strengthen the voice of reformers within government and civil society, and increase their
                         capacity to overcome inertia and resistance from vested interests. Using the Government's budget procedures, the proposed operation will also pilot reforms in
                         financial management system.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This Development Policy Loan (DPL) was declared effective on May 29, 2007. The 1st tranche (4.1 million Euros) was disbursed in May 2008. The closing date (initially on
                         December 31, 2008) was first extended to December 31, 2009 and a second extension was given last December for 18 additional months bringing the closing date to June 30, 2011.
                         Generally major progress has been made in the DPL Components and most of the triggers for sectoral Policy areas (i) Forestry, (ii) Environment, (iii) Fisheries and (iv) Mining can
                         already be considered "completed". The final report of the financial audit of the expenditure under the 1st tranche has been transmitted to the Bank and reviewed by the Bank and
                         judged satisfactory.

                         Description
                         This DPL was declared effective on May 29, 2007 after key policy issues were resolved, amongst which (a) cancellation of non-compliant logging permits, (b) disclosure of updated
                         lists of logging, fishing and mining permits, (c) the removal of the SNBG monopoly, and (d) the revision of the draft law on the proposed forest fund. However, the disbursement of
                         the 1st tranch was subject to the proper inscription of the credits within the national Finance Law (based on agreed-upon work programs). The DPL credits were not included in the
                         2007 Finance Law and because of delays, it was decided to include them in the 2008 Finance Law rather than to revise the 2007 Finance Law. The 2008 Finance Law is planned to
                         be adopted and promulgated before December 31. The disbursement of the 1st tranch should intervene soon after the promulgation of the 2008 Finance Law.
