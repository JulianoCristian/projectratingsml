   mid-eighties and comprises mainly the second phase of the\n            San Carlos hydro power development. (The first phase is\n            being financed partly by Loan 1583-CO.) The project\n            includes: (a) San Carlos II: construction and erection of a\n            second penstock, four turbine-alternators and transformer\n            groups totalling 620 MW, and ancillary equipment and works;\n            (b) Calderas: construction of a 15 m high rock-fill dam on\n            the Calderas River, inlet and discharge tunnels,and a\n            surface power station with an 18 MW generating unit; (c)\n            construction to two 230-kV transmission lines, between San\n            Carlos and Medellin (90 km) and between Esmeralda and Yuma\n            (200 km), and expansion of the various terminal substations;\n            (d) consultant services for engineering, civil works and\n            supervision; (e) a study of dispatch aspects of the\n            interconnected system, as well as related training; and (f)\n            a study of ISA's manpower and training requirements,\n            and an associated training program."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
