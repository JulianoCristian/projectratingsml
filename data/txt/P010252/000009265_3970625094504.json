The system will be\n            expanded by:  (a) re-equipping existing vocational training\n            centers and introducing additional programs; (b) developing\n            new vocational training centers in rural areas; and (c)\n            strengthening the existing provincial apprenticeship system\n            to expand in-plant training programs.  The quality will be\n            improved by:  (a) expanding the National Training\n            Development Institute to provide instructor training; and\n            (b) further strengthening the management and project\n            implementation capacity of the National and Provincial\n            Training Boards.
