The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been partially successful,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was negligible.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            public sector interventions in the training sector should\n            essentially be catalytic in nature to create a participative\n            environment where training providers and employers work in\n            tandem. Second, policymakers and planners need a greater\n            understanding of the dynamics of job creation and\n            job-related training. Third, the informal sector\n            complemented by enterprise-based training will continue to\n            remain a major source of trained manpower in Pakistan for a\n            long time. Fourth, the expansion of the training sector\n            should not be governed by compulsions of social demand for\n            vocational training opportunities but instead by the\n            imperatives of economic demand. Fifth, multi-sectoral policy\n            setting and coordinating bodies entrusted with a normative\n            charter but without legislated empowerment have little\n            potential of coming to life. Sixth, recurrent operation\n            budgets are likely to remain short-funded in the short and\n            medium terms. Finally, the full benefits of mid-term\n            restructuring of a project can accrue only if sufficient\n            time is allowed for the restructured components to develop\n            institutional strength."}, "docdt": "1997-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
