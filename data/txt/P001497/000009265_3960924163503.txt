MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Madagascar
Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1016-MAG) and
Tsimiroro Heavy Oil Exploration Proiect (Credit 1298-MAG)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report
on Madagascar - Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1016-MAG) and
Tsimiroro Heavy Oil Exploration Project (Credit 1298-MAG)" prepared by the Africa
Regional Office with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The overall objective of both projects was to improve Madagascar's
energy self-reliance. The avenues supported by the Bank (petroleum exploration
and oil shale tests) were inherently risky; no petroleum was found and the
expected heavy oil proved not to be commercial.
Nevertheless, the projects achieved the technical objectives of
attracting foreign oil companies (over US$350 million expended on exploration),
and of testing the feasibility of producing heavy oil, respectively.              In
addition, the projects contributed to the adoption and later revision of the
Petroleum Code, the financing of an energy planning study, the purchase of
equipment (mainly transportation), construction of office and storage buildings,
and training. Accordingly, the outcome of both projects is rated as satisfactory
their institutional impact as substantial and their sustainability as likely.
While acknowledging the good relations experienced with IDA, the
borrower's contribution to the PCR notes the lack of familiarity with IDA
procedures of the implementation agency and the skill mix discontinuities of IDA
supervision. An audit is planned.

(Credit 1016-MAG)
TSIMIRORO HEAVY OIL EXPLORATION PROJECT
(Credit 1298-MAG)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project in Madagascar, for which Credit 1016-MAG in the
amount of US$12.5 million equivalent was approved on June 6. 1980; and for
the Tsimiroro Heavy Oil Exploration Project also in Madagascar for which
Credit 1298-MAG in the amount of US$11.5 million equivalent was approved on
November 16, 1982. Credit 1016-MAG was closed on December 31, 1985 following
two extensions.   It was almost fully disbursed (an undisbursed amount of
US$99,701.34 was cancelled).   The closing date of Credit  1298-MAG was
extended for three years successively up to December 31, 1989 by which time
the Credit was fully disbursed.
This PCR covers both credits:  1016-MAG and 1298-MAG.   It was
prepared by the Technical Department, Industry and Energy Operations Division
of the Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III),
and the Borrower submitted a Project Completion Report for Credit 1016-HAG
(Part II), and supplied additional data for the preparation of the present
report. The borrower also presented its comments on the implementation of
the Credit 1298-MAG which are attached to this report as Annex 1.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report and the Credit and Project Agreements; on information
obtained during project supervision and from the President's and Supervision
reports; from correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal
Bank memoranda.

2.        Backfround
2.01      With a population of 8.3 million and a Gross National Product (GNP)
per capita estimated at US$250 in 1978, Madagascar was one of the poorest
countries in the world. The real GNP had not increased since 1975. Mada-
gascar is predominantly an agricultural country, and when these projects were
designed, it was estimated that 852 of its population lived in rural areas
with a per capita income of US$120 per annum.
2.02      Energy consumption reflects the economic status of the country.
It was estimated at 142 kg of oil equivalent in 1978, and had grown by less
than 2X per annum throughout the 1970s. There was heavy reliance on tradi-
tional fuels, primarily wood and charcoal, which met nearly two thirds of
requirements. Petroleum imports, amounting to US$53 million, or 152 of total
imports in 1978, accounted for about 30I of total energy consumption. The
remainder was provided by hydropower and bagasse (3% each) and coal (1x).
2.03      Madagascar's  energy  resources  are potentially  important,  but
essentially undeveloped. Deposits of lignite, steam coal, and radioactive
minerals were known in various parts of the country. There is a considerable
hydro potential which was estimated at about 3,500 MW.   Forests covering
about 125,000 km2 are the major energy source, but their indiscriminate use
was already leading to rapid deforestation in some areas. No hydrocarbons
were produced, although exploration wells drilled in the past encountered oil
and gas shows, and there are deposits of heavy oil (Tsimiroro) and bituminous
sandstones (Bemolanga).
2.04      OMNIS was established on November 12, 1975 to take charge of
economically strategic industries.  It has among its responsibilities the
exploration for and development of bituminous sandstones, and heavy and light
oil. Its petroleum staff was thin, since only one geologist had sufficient



knowledge  and  practical  experience  to  be  considored  a  competent
oxplorationist  by  industry  standards.   Purthermore,  OMNIS  had  little
capability for geophysical interpretation.  The Goversment policy was to
strengthen the technical capacity of OMCIS, which would initially require the
assistance of exploration consultants.
3.   Project DescriDtion
3.01      OMNIS' strategy in oil exploration was to promote the resumption
of drilling for oil in the shortest period possible. It was seeking partners
willing to undertake exploration in Madagascar.  However, before entering
into negotiations with oil companies, OMNIS needed to: (i) improve its
knowledge of the hydrocarbon potential of the prospective portion of the
Malagasy basins; and (ii) prepare a new petroleum legislation to replace the
1962 Petroleum Code, which was outdated. Furthermore. OMRIS was interested
in an investigation of the Tsimiroro deposits to assess whether they could be
economically tapped to supply the Malagasy market.
3.02       OMNIS requested IDA's financial and technical assistance, in order
to put into practice this petroleum policy.   IDA estimated that OHNIS
approach was basically sound, and agreed with its request.  Furthermore,
since the review of the energy sector brought out several issues, such as:
(i) coordination of energy policy; (ii) lack of policy analysis capability;
(iii) pricing policy; and (iv) investment priorities, an energy planning
component was included in the project.
3.03      The project was thus aimed at supporting the Government's efforts
to develop a domestic supply of hydrocarbons and improve planning of the
energy sector. It included:
(a) Consultants' assistance to OCNIS in the field of: (i) preparation
of presentation documents on areas to be offered for exploration
by foreign companies; (ii) preparation of an adequate legislative
and contractual framework for foreign oil companies to carry out
petroleum exploration in association with OCNIS; (iii) supervision
of OMNIS' prepared seismic work; (iv) interpretation of existing
basins or newly acquired data base; (v) assessment of the Tsimiroro
heavy oil deposit. This component would include special studies
(reprocessing  of  seismic  lines,  geochemical  analysis  and
interpretation of Landeat imagery) as well as the purchase of the
necessary equipment.
(b) A 12-month program of onshore reconnaissance seismic work. This
seismic program was expected to provide useful data on one or more
areas previously poorly known, which is one of the principal
requirements for attracting foreign oil company exploration.
(c) An engineering study of the Tsimiroro heavy oil deposit.
(d) An energy planning study, aimed at enabling the Government to: (i)
analyze priority issues of energy policies; (ii) establish the



analytical framework for comprehensive energy sector planning; and
(iii) create a national energy planning capability.
(e)  Training of OMNIS professionals  in all petroleum exploration
related matters.
3.04      Since it was the first project of the kind to have been ever
financed by IDA, its preparation was particularly cautious.   Before the
Credit could be negotiated, Omnis was requested to: (i) prepare a modern
petroleum exploration legislation; and (ii) carry out a preliminary
assessment of the Tsimiroro heavy oil field potential. The proposed project
was identified during an IDA mission to Madagascar in March 1979, and
appraised in November 1979. Approval by the Board took place on May 6. 1980,
and the Credit became effective on August 20, 1980.
4.   Prolect Implementation
A.   First Round of Petroleum Exploration Promotion
4.01      During the project preparation, OMNIS requested an advance of
US$350,000 under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), in order to assist
it in preparing: (i) a modern petroleum legal framework; (ii) a preliminary
assessment report regarding the hydrocarbon potential of the most promising
areas; and (iii) a preliminary evaluation of the Tsimiroro heavy oil deposit
potential. This PPF was granted on January 11, 1980.
4.02      In January, 1980, OMNIS retained the services of a legal consulting
company from Frances in order to assist it in preparing the petroleum
legislation. However, most of the recommendations which contributed to shape
up the Petroleum Code and the fiscal regime emanated from the World Bank.
The draft Petroleum Code was approved by the Council of Ministers on May 20,
1980, and by the People's National Assembly on June 6, 1980.
4.03      The code proposed a "Joint Venture" type of arrangement between
OMNIS and foreign companies, with OMNIS holding a majority share, carried
through exploration. The companies owed a royalty (to be defined in each
agreement), corporate income tax (45X). and supplementary payments depending
on the rate of return achieved. This code was considered by the Bank to give
an adequate legal framework for foreign companies to undertake petroleum
exploration activities. The supplementary tax raised however many questions
from  the  oil  companies.    Their main  concern was  the  risk  that  the
supplementary tax could prevent them from getting credit for their tax
payments in Madagascar against their US tax liabilities.   OMNIS had to
request the services of the law offices Groom and Noorberg, which produced an
opinion reassuring the oil companies on the subject.
4.04       In January,  1980, OMNIS commissioned a petroleum exploration
consulting company, from Switzerland, to prepare a comprehensive technical
report evaluating the petroleum potential of the Morondava and the Majunga
basins, which served as the basis for the first international call for bids.



One of the main conclusions of the consultant's report was the delimitation
and the classification of areas of interest in Madagascar sedimentary basins.
4.05      The first call for bids for petroleum exploration in Madagascar was
issued on July 1, 1980 in the specialized international petroleum and
financial press.   The closing date of the bid was December, 1980.   The
technical documentation was issued free of charge to all the companies that
expressed interest in submitting bids on the blocks open for bidding. Since
OMNIS had not been entirely satisfied with the services of the initially
contracted French legal consultant, it retained two other legal consulting
firms, both from Great Britain, in order to assist it in the negotiations
with the oil companies.
4.06      As a result of this call for bids, four major companies entered
into negotiations with OMNIS, which resulted in the signing of Association
and Participation agreements. Three contracts covered areas located in the
Morondava basin: Mobil signed on December 4, 1981, a contract covering 36,000
km2 offshore; on December 9, 1981, Occidental entered in a contract covering
21,000 km2 onshore.  On July 24, 1982, Amoco obtained an acreage covering
22,650 km2 onshore. On April 27, 1982, AGIP entered in a contract covering
22,400 km2 in the Majunga basin onshore and offshore.  It should be noted
that, as a result of the flexible approach adopted by OMNIS in assigning
blocks, the areas finally awarded to the companies did not coincide in their
entirety with those for which bids had been invited.
4.07      Since the Morombe region had not been taken by oil companies, OMNIS
decided to carry out in that area the seismic survey which was included in
the work program of the project. The area had been previously covered by
very coarse grid seismic surveys which in fact showed structural indications.
Cutting the previous grid to a tighter one was expected to show further
structural conditions which would encourage oil companies to look favorably
on the area.   Following a call for bid, widely distributed among the
geophysical industry, the implementation of this survey was entrusted to
Geophysical Services International (GSI). The GSI crew started the survey in
mid June 1982. GSI completed the seismic program on November 12, 1982 after
shooting 819 kms of seismic lines.   The quality of the acquired data
deteriorated from the eastern portion of the area westward, where there is
the thicker section of sediments. These unfavorable results were inadequate
to arouse the interest of the oil industry. The total cost of the seismic
survey   (including  processing  and  interpreting  acquired  data)  was
US$4,276,091, against a forecast cost of US$6 million.
4.08      Encouraged by the results of the first call for bids, and in order
to further increase the exploration activities in Madagascar, OMNIS carried
out other studies in still open areas. These investigations included: (i)
stratigraphic analysis of core and cutting samples; and (ii) a Landsat
imagery study, which was implemented by the American company Hunting. The
results were integrated later on in a synthesis geological report, which was
presented to the oil industry in a second round of petroleum exploration
promotion.



- 5 -
4.09       OMNIS was  assisted  in  these  activities  by  the  same  Swiss
exploration consulting company which had been initially contracted by the
national agency (see paragraph 4.04 above).  Actually, OMNIS retained the
services of the same company until 1986, when it appeared necessary to have
a renewed opinion on the hydrocarbon potential of Madagascar.   In the
meantime, the consulting company also assisted OMNIS in: (i) negotiating the
contractual commitments with oil companies; (ii) monitoring the activities of
oil companies; (iii) defining the work program of the agency exploration
staff; (iv) implementing this work program; and (v) the training of the
technical staff in exploration activities.   During the same period, the
consulting company assigned a resident exploration advisor to OMNIS head-
quarters in Antananarivo. Furthermore, other specialists of the same company
were assigned on a temporary basis in Antananarivo, according to the type of
work, such as seismic interpretation, field study or monitoring of drilling
activities, currently on the agenda of OMNIS technical team.
4.10      Following the signature of their contracts (see paragraph 4.06
above), the oil companies carried out a significant exploration effort.
After conducting geophysical surveys, Mobil drilled one well which bottomed
out at a depth of 13,137 feet, after having encountered a few traces of
hydrocarbons.   After completing the interpretation of the geological and
geophysical surveys conducted on its permit area, Amoco drilled five wells
which reached 14,700, 7.825, 12.500, 12,814 feet respectively. Some of these
wells encountered bituminous impregnations in the Karroo formation.   A
significant oil show was observed in the Upper Cretaceous in the Manambolo
well.  Occidental drilled two wells, which were abandoned respectively at
depths of 15,317 feet and 9,444 feet. Both wells found oil and gas shows.
On the other hand, Agip, in spite of having undertaken a significant seismic
acquisition program, did not find any drillable structure either offshore or
onshore.
4.11      The results of the data acquired during this exploration round
have: (i) further demonstrated the structural and sedimentological complexity
of the Malagasy sedimentary basins; (ii) provided some useful clues to
decipher the local geological intricacies; and (iii) confirmed the
hydrocarbon potential of these basins.   These results contributed to the
success of the second round of petroleum exploration promotion, which took
place in November, 1988.
B. Tsimiroro Heavy Oil Exploration
4.12      In order to carry out a preliminary appraisal of the Original
Recoverable Oil In Place (OROIP) in the Tsimiroro heavy oil deposit, financed
under the Project Preparation Facility advance granted by IDA, OMNIS
contracted the Canadian company D and S. The company started work in April
1980, and issued their report in November of the same year. Based on the
available data from previous work in the area, the consultant calculated that
the in-place reserves at Taimiroro are in the order of 9 billion barrels.
The D and S group also suggested a supplementary exploratory program before
deciding whether or not to commit on a pilot plant. This recommended work
program included: (i) the drilling of 10 additional exploratory wells in the



Tsimiroro area; (ii) laboratory work to better define the reservoir
properties and reservoir fluid; (iii) conducting production testing under
primary depletion to determine well productivities; (iv) performing detailed
studies based on new data obtained from above; and (v) based on above data
and studies, making recomendations regarding the pilot project and the
com ercial production strategy for Taimiroro accumulation. The cost of this
program was evaluated by D and S at US$12 million.
4.13      While D and S were preparing the above-mentioned work program, in
early 1981, OMNIS asked IDA to join with the European Investment Bank (EIB)
in financing the study of a bitumen extraction process for the Bemolonga tar
sands deposit. Considerable work financed by EIB had already been done on
the geology of the area and on extraction processes. Since the project was
estimated by IDA specialists to be worth carrying out, and that, if
successful, it could lead to a joint exploitation with the Tsimiroro heavy
oil field, in September 1981. IDA agreed with OMNIS' request. With the IDA
Board's agreement, an amount of US$500,000 was reallocated from the
engineering study of the Tsimiroro deposit to finance jointly with EIB the
feasibility study of a bitumen extraction process of the Bemolonga
accumulation. OMNIS hired the Italian company INGECO to carry out the study.
The consultants submitted their draft final report by September 1982.  In
addition, EIB was financing a study of the mining and crushing phase which
was completed at the same time. The studies showed that the forecast cost of
development were too high to make any development program com ercial.
4.14      Since the work program on the Tsimiroro heavy oil field as
recommended by its consultants could not be financed under the Credit 1016-
MAG, OMNIS attempted to attract oil companies to 3oivt exploitation of the
Taimiroro deposit with the Government.  OMNIS sent to that effect bidding
documents to 89 international companies. The response to this call for bids
was negative.  The reason most frequently cited by the international oil
companies was that the amount of pertinent data provided was inadequate to
enable them to reach a reasonable decision.
4.15      OMNIS then turned to IDA. to request its financial assistance for
the implementation of the program. IDA's specialists estimated that the oil
industry attitude did not invalidate the project, since it was showing that
the data base was insufficient, and that further positive data were to be
established prior to getting the oil industry interested in the development
of the field. Furthermore, IDA estimated that it made sense from a national
point of view for the Government of Madagascar to complete this program
rapidly in order to attract needed oil company participation in pilot
production project.
4.16      IDA therefore agreed with OMNIS'  request.   The corresponding
project (Credit 1298) was appraised during visits of OMNIS representatives to
Washington. from September 28 to October 7, 1981. Negotiations were held in
Washington on September 16 and 17. 1982. The Credit was approved by IDA's
Board on November 16, 1982, signed on December 3, 1982, and declared
effective on January 21. 1983. The Credit amount was US$11.5 million. The
OPEC fund had agreed to cofinance the project, by providing SDR 3.2 million.



4.17      Beside the financing of the work program carried out on Taimiroro
deposit, this second petroleum project included the continuation of IDA's
assistance for training of OMNIS' professionals.
4.18      OMNIS entrusted the implementation of the data acquisition to D and
S, with the understanding that D and S would subcontract the drilling
activities, the laboratory studies, and the seismic surveys.   Upon the
evaluation of proposals received from five international companies in both
cases, OMNIS awarded the drilling contract to the American company Bawden,
and the laboratory analyses to Core Laboratories of the US.
4.19      The implementation of the work program was characterized by: (i)
the scarcity and the complexity of heavy oil accumulations, which became more
and more evident as the drilling was progressing; and (ii) the lower than
anticipated cost of the program, due to the speed of drilling and the
decrease in prices in the drilling industry. Funds were thus available to
finance supplementary work which was made necessary by the above mentioned
complexity of the area. As a result, the work program was carried out during
successive phases.
(a) Bawden started the drilling campaign in July 1983, and drilled
eight wells, of a total depth of 3,281m. Laboratory test results
indicated that the oil bearing Amboloando sandstone had favorable
reservoir characteristics for oil recovery by steam injection.
However, all of the wells drilled in 1983 were dry without any
significant oil saturation.
(b) In June 1984. IDA approved a supplementary program proposed by
ONNIS to drill four additional coreholes to evaluate the oil
potential in an area where previously drilled wells had encountered
oil saturated sandstones.  The coreholes, with a total depth of
822m, established three small areas of irregular oil saturation.
One of the wells was tested: after 91 hours of swabbing, 4.2
barrels of 13 to 15% API oil and 437 barrels of water were
recovered.
(c)  In May  1985, OMNIS and IDA agreed with  the recommendations
presented by D and S. consisting of a supplementary work program
including: (i) a 100 km seismic survey; and (ii) drilling of nine
exploration or delineation coreholes.   The seismic survey was
implemented by the Compagnie G6n6rale de G6ophysique (CGG). The
nine wells, which totaled 2,622m, were located according to the
interpretation of the resulting seismic data. The results of all
but one of the wells was negative.
4.20      The D and S group issued in February 1987 their final report.
Conclusions are that the heavy oil deposits in the Tsimiroro area are the
remnants of a very large oil accumulation, progressively destroyed by: (i)
tectonic activity; (ii) flushing and invasion of meteoric waters; and (iii)
biodegradation  of  oil.    Based  on  the  current  geological,  reservoir
engineering and economic analysis of the area, D and S recommended that no



- 8 -
more exploratory drilling be done in the Taimiroro area, but that the west
flank of the main horst, for the same Amboloando sandstone objective, and the
structural crest of the structure, for the deeper Isalo objective, were worth
being reviewed and studied to identify prospective structures.   However,
since out of 19 wells located according to the recommendations of the
consultant and drilled under his control, only 4 encountered isolated heavy
oil accumulations, and none had given any significant production upon
testing, IDA estimated that the objective of the Credit, namely the appraisal
of the Tsimiroro heavy oil accumulation, if negatively, had been reached, and
decided not to finance any further work on the Taimiroro deposit.
4.21      OMNIS  is presently  trying  to  attract  oil  companies  to  the
exploitation of the small accumulations shown by the results of the D and S
exploration program, and the exploration of the areas recommended by the
consultant. So far, their efforts have not met with any success.
4.22      By the time the Tsimiroro heavy oil study was over, on one hand,
the oil companies participating in the exploration of the country were losing
interest, and on the other hand, significant available funds remained under
the Credit.  OMNIS requested the IDA in September 1986 to allocate these
remaining funds to finance a new round of petroleum exploration promotion, in
an effort to rekindle the interest of the oil industry in the exploration of
the Malagasy basins.
C.   Second Round of Exploration Promotion
4.23      IDA agreed with OMNIS' request.  The period for a promotion to the
oil industry of the Malagasy basins could not however have been more
unfavorably selected, since three companies out of four had recently pulled
out of the country, and the fourth one was on the point of following suit.
In order to reverse this decreasing interest of the oil industry for
exploring the Malagasy basins, it was necessary to set up a refined and
tailored work program, to be carried out before undertaking any promotional
effort.  It was also necessary to adapt the petroleum legislation and the
model contract to the current status of the oil industry, both in Madagascar
and worldwide.
4.24      This preliminary work program was discussed with OMNIS, and further
talked over with the two companies which had recently performed the most
important exploration program in the country, AMOCO and Occidental Petroleum.
Once the specialists of both companies had confirmed that the proposed work
program addressed in their views the most crucial issues of local petroleum
exploration, both OMNIS and IDA endorsed this program.
4.25      This work program included:
(a) a geochemical synthesis of the western Malagasy basins, aimed
at assessing the hydrocarbon generation potential of the
different existing source rocks, and at estimating the
generated hydrocarbon migration paths;



- 9 -
(b) seismic reinterpretation and reprocessing targeted to: (i)
obtaining a better knowledge of some structural and/or
stratigraphic entrapment mechanism; and (ii) providing the oil
companies with a technical methodology to explore the
presented conceptual plays;
(c) aeromagnetometry acquisition in the southern part of the
Majanga basin, in order to assess the sediment thickness and
the main structural characteristics of that area;
(d) integration of previously existing and newly acquired data in
a petroleum geology synthesis report; and,
(e) presentation of this report in petroleum exploration seminars.
4.26       OMNIS  decided  to  contract  separately:  (i)  the  exploration
consulting company which would be in charge of preparing the promotion; (ii)
a resident exploration adviser; and (iii) a petroleum legal consultant. Upon
the evaluation of the proposals presented by five international consulting
companies, the first contract was awarded to BEICIP, of France, in May 1987.
Following a similar selection process, OMNIS contracted an exploration
consultant, from Great Britain, and a legal consultant from the US.
4.27      The  implementation  of  the  aeromagnetometric  survey  over  the
southern part of the Majunga basin was entrusted to the company Aeroservice,
of the US, for an amount of US$315,000.  The acquisition and processing
quality was controlled by the firm Zietz and associates, of the US. Zietz
was also required to prepare an independant interpretation of the acquired
field data. The 23.000 line kilometre survey was carried out between June 24
and July 31, 1987. The results of the survey were reliable and indicated
some areas of potential interest.
4.28      The company Western Atlas International was chosen by OMNIS to
reprocess approximately 290 km of land data (Morondava basin) and 105 km of
marine data (Santa Maria basin).  In the Morondava basin, coherent energy
beneath the top of the Karroo unconformity, which was not perceived on the
previously processed section. was seen on the reprocessed section, with
indications of dip. In the Santa Maria basin, the section above the acoustic
basement was considerably improved in terms of seismic character and seismic
facies  definition.   This  should  enable  lithological prediction  to be
attempted from the data. Furthermore, Western's examination of previously
interpreted data showed many faults with apparent rollover into the faults,
and shallow structures which did not appear on the previous maps. However,
very little coherent energy could be seen below the previously established
acoustic basement.
4.29      During the implementation of this work program, it appeared further
necessary to have a SPOT Image imagery study on the so-called "Karroo
Corridor"  carried out.   SPOT Image is a new  imagery technique, which
provides, in case of clear weather, much more detailed and accurate data than
any other presently existing satellite imagery technique.  The price is in



- 10 -
proportion to this exclusivity. The contract for acquiring and interpreting
imagery data was awarded for US$150.000, to an association between the French
Bureau des Recherches G6ologiques et Nini4res (BRGM) and SPOT Image, which is
the holder of the satellite image acquisition process patent. The study was
supported by a field ground truth survey, implemented in July. 1988.  The
study led to: (i) a more accurate mapping of the "Karroo corridor"; and (ii)
the outlining of some structural leads.
4.30      BEICIP integrated previously available and newly acquired data in
a geological synthesis report covering all western Malagasy sedimentary
basins. An initial draft report was submitted in June 1988, and discussed
thoroughly with OMNIS and IDA.   The report was eventually ready to be
presented to the oil industry in November, 1988.
4.31      In the meantime, OMNIS had revised the Petroleum code by opening
the possibility to oil companies to choose between the previous contractual
regime, and a newly inserted service type contract, directly inspired from
the Brazilian and Ecuadorian "risk contract".   Within this regime, the
dicovered hydrocarbons  belong  fully to the Government.   However,  oil
companies: (i) may recover their exploration and development expenses from
the production revenues; (ii) obtain a share of the remaining amount of these
revenues as a retribution for their services; and (iii) owe a royalty.
4.32      BEICIP's report, together with the new Petroleum code was presented
to the oil industry during two promotion seminars, held respectively in
London and in Houston, on November 7 and 11, 1988.  The response of the
industry was quite favorable since: (i) AMOCO decided to enter in the seventh
year of their contract, which implied the drilling of an exploration well;
(ii) Shell entered into three different contracts, covering one area in the
"Karroo Corridor", with a one well coummitment. and two contractual blocks
located both in the Majanga basin, with a one well commitment for the
southern one, and a seismic option for the northern one; and (iii) BHP, of
Australia, signed a contract for an offshore area in front of the Saint-Andr6
Cape, with a one well co itment. Both newcomers, Shell and BHP, opted for
the "service contract" regime.
4.33      OMNIS took the necessary measures to make sure that the exploration
activities of the oil companies, such as the implementation of a seismic
survey, would have no detrimental effect on the forest located in protected
areas where these activities would take place.
4.34      Under PCIAC financing, and following the petroleum exploration
seminars which were held in November, 1988, a third seminar was organized in
Calgary, Canada.  Furthermore, in October 1899. OMNIS visited a few oil
companies in Texas, in order to rekindle their previously indicated interest.
Up to this date, none of these supplementary promotional efforts were
successful.
4.35      In order to assist OMNIS in appraising the oil show observed in the
Manambolo AMOCO well, IDA financed: (i) a reinterpretation of the wireline
logging previously registered in the well, which was implemented by the



- 11 -
Schlumberger company; and (ii) a seismic stratigraphical study carried out by
Western on a few seismic lines surrounding the well.   Schlumberger's
interpretation of the wireline logging showed a ten meter thick oil
impregnated sand of Cretaceous age.   The seismic stratigraphical inter-
pretation indicated that the corresponding sands seem to be discontinuous,
and appear to thicken eastward from the vell.
4.36      During the implementation of the work program carried out under
IDA's credits. PCIAC financed two offshore seismic surveys totaling about
3,970 line-km over the south and northwest offshore Malagasy basins.
Furthermore, also under PCIAC financing, OMNIS drilled an exploratory well
under a sole risk clause within AMOCO's contract area.   This well was
located over a seismic anomaly west of the Manambolo well.   The well
discovered a yet unappraised, but most probably limited, dry gas
accumulation.
D.   Other Components of the Proiects
Energv Planning Study
4.37        In July. 1980, OCNIS selected Motor Colombus, of Switzerland,
from four international competitors, to implement the energy planning study.
The contract was signed on July 5, for an amount of US$225,000. The study
was started in September 1980. Motor Colombus submitted a first draft of
their report in September 1981, and the final draft in April, 1982.
Considering the difficulties encountered in getting basic data from the
different agencies involved in the energy sector, Motor Colombus did a good
job in gathering valuable information, and made reasonable recommendations.
However, the report suffered from a lack of analytical focus, and the
recommendations were too vague to be easily put into practice. In order to
complete and update the data base, and to obtain precisely stated
recommendations, it was decided that the IDA's specialists would carry out by
themselves an energy assessment study.  The resulting report (Madagascar:
Issues and Options in the Energy Sector) was published in January 1987. It
will rest with a new energy project to assist the Government in applying the
appropriate recommendations.
Equipment
4.38      During the course of the first project under review (CR.1016-MAG),
IDA recognized that OMNIS' needs in equipment were greater than anticipated
at the time of appraisal. Furthermore, the activities of the oil companies
generated a great quantity of technical documents which needed to be
appropriately stored, and the OCNIS office building required rehabilitation
in order to offer more propitious and healthy working conditions to the
agency's geologists and geophysicists. On the other hand, the seismic survey
was completed far below budget estimates (see paragraph 4.07 above).  IDA
agreed, on June 3, 1985, to a reallocation of funds, resulting in an increase
of the amount allocated to the procuremant of vehicles and equipment, from
US$150,000 to US$1,040,000. During the course of the second project under
review (Cr. 1298-MAG), IDA agreed to have US$310,000 allocated from the



- 12 -
remaining funds under the Credit for procurement of field and office
equipment, and US$185,000 for the erection and the internal equipment of a
core storage building. The procurement of the needed equipment was entrusted
to the OMNIS Swiss exploration consultant, who performed this task in
accordance with guidelines. When the contract with this consulting company
was cancelled, the procurement of the necesary equipment was entrusted to the
French import-export company SEGA.
4.39      Summarizing,  the  above mentioned  financing  for procuring  of
equipment and office and storage building resulted in:
(a)  the existence of an adequate office building for OMNIS staff, and
the construction of a fully equipped documents storage building,
a laboratory building and a core storage building, and
(b) providing OMNIS with: (i) field equipment such as Jeep-type
vehicles,  camping  equipment.  gravimeters;   (ii)   laboratory
equipment, for very complete geochemical and stratigraphical
analyses; and (iii) office equipment such as a microcomputer (model
IBM-PC. AT), a photocopying machine, a word processor.
4.40      The laboratory equipment is used by OMNIS for carrying out: (i)
early geochemical analyses of well samples collected by oil companies; (ii)
geochemical analyses of field samples collected by OMNIS own geologists; and
(iii) stratigraphical determinations.   OMNIS is also planning to commer-
cialize its laboratory analysis capacity, through services rendered to local
industries, such as soap factories.
Training
4.41      Technical training of OMNIS professionals was an important and
successful component of both projects. The training programs were provided
through different sources:
(a) IDA financed training programs for a total amount of more than
US$500,000. These programs were carefully designed and beneficial
to the entire OMNIS staff.  They covered all petroleum exploration
related activities.   OMNIS professionals  attended courses  in
universities or "grandes 6coles" (Institut Frangais du P6trole,
Polytechnicum of Zurich,...). in different countries (the US,
Canada, France, Switzerland), for periods ranging from one to nine
months. The programs financed by IDA were organized in such a way
that they would be coherent with the training provided by oil
companies.   Furthermore,  French accounting consultants visited
Antananarivo in 1985, in order to organize a training session for
OMNIS accountants in auditing the exploration expenses by oil
companies.
(b) All of the petroleum agreements signed by OMNIS include a training
component for ONIS staff, the cost of this training to be borne
entirely by the foreign associate and thus not included in the
joint expenses. In terms of man-months, this training program was



- 13 -
about half of the one financed by IDA. However, this on-the-job
training complemented appropriately the theoretical courses
provided under IDA financing.
(c) All of the contracts signed by OMNIS with consultants and
contractors include a training component. In the highest degree,
the exploration advisors assigned to Antananarivo by the Swiss
consulting company, to assist OMNIS' professionals for the
implementation of their different tasks, were also involved in
their day-to-day training. Other firms also assisted in training
OMNIS staff in their respective specialties, such as Motor Colombus
in energy planning, Aeroservice in the use of potential methods in
petroleum exploration. etc...
4.42      The results  obtained  from the  technical  training program  as
described above were very positive. While at the start of the project, OMNIS
technical staff was very thin, the present staff is on the contrary qualified
and experienced and capable of carrying out most of the exploration
activities included in their work program. Two observations should be made
on the subject:
(a)  within  a  possible  new  energy  project,  the  exploration
consulting services provided to OMNIS should be streamlined
in order to be adapted to present OMNIS technical
qualifications in petroleum exploration related activities;
(b)  the  age  of  OMNIS  trained  and  experienced  exploration
professionals is now in the range of the 40's. The experience
acquired by seasoned staff is not transmitted to younger
professionals. Whether the consequences may not be presently
perceived, they might be serious within the next few years,
if the Government does not promptly take the appropriate
measures to address the issue.
OMNIS Reorganization
4.43      In November 1984, OMNIS requested the consulting company Arthur D.
Little to implement an institutional study of the agency, which would
recommend an organizational structure. Upon the completion of the study, the
OMNIS organigram was modified as follows: (i) two executive positions were
created as "assistant to the general manager"; and (ii) the previous staff
structure was broken down into five Directorates, among which was the newly
created Directorate of Hydrocarbons.  Other Directorates are: Finance and
Administration, Technical and Logistical Support, Personnel and Human
Relations, Atomic Energy. This reorganization resulted in a more flexible
and efficient management of OMNIS' exploration activities.
Seismic Tapes Storage
4.44      During the implementation of the work program defined under the
Credit 1016-MAG, OMNIS requested IDA's assistance for storing under
appropriate conditions magnetic seismic tapes acquired during surveys carried



- 14 -
out in Madagascar. Upon IDA's agreement, it was decided to store the tapes
in Geodata premises in Houston, Texas. The contract was signed on October 14.
1985. for a total amount of US$140,565, and for a period of five years. In
September 1989, it was agreed to finance under the Credit 1298-HAG a two-year
extension of the contract with Geodata.
5.   Comments on the Implementation of the Prolects
Financial aspects
5.01      In September 1981, IDA agreed to cofinance with the European
Investment Bank (EIB), a feasibility study of oil extraction from the
Bemolonga tar sands. Under this agreement, IDA financed about one third of
the study cost of US$1,650,000, i.e. US$500,000. No financing problem was
experienced during this cooperation with EIB.
5.02      The Tsimiroro Project was cofinanced by OPEC.   The OPEC Loan
Agreement (CR. P 310) was signed on January 19, 1983, and declared effective
on March 31, 1983. On March 1, 1983, it was agreed that IDA would be the
Loan administrator on behalf of OPEC. The OPEC Loan amount was US$5 million.
Until the suimmer of 1985, there was no financing issue. However, at that
time, because of Government's arrears regarding other credits, OPEC suspended
its disbursements. On an exceptional basis, the OPEC Fund agreed on October
14, 1985, to IDA financing 100% of consulting services essential for the
progress of the Tsimiroro heavy oil exploration promotion, specifically
excluding however from this agreement the drilling program on Tsimiroro and
the training program of OMNIS staff. This resulted in the presentation to
IDA of many claims from contractors regarding partial payments of their
invoices. This issue was not resolved, until OPEC, having been reimbursed by
the Government for all of their arrears, reinstated their disbursements in
November 1988. By that time, an undisbursed amount of US$2,007,010 remained
under the OPEC Loan. OPEC agreed to finance within the limits of this amount
a work program presented by OMNIS, including the acquisition of approximately
200 km of seismic lines in the Serinam Manambolo area, and consulting
services for negotiating with the oil companies, and monitoring their
exploration  activities.    IDA  agreed  to  continue  to  administer  the
implementation of this work program.   In order to have this work program
completed, OPEC granted a one-year extension until January 31, 1990, of the
final date of the Loan.
Costs and disbursements
5.03      Tables  including  the  Bank's  disbursements  by  categories,
successively for the two projects, as compared with the corresponding amounts
allocated in the Credits, are presented in the Part 3, paragraph 4a, of this
report. The most striking observation regarding these disbursements tables
is the important increase between planned and actual expenditures for
consulting services (from US$2,750,000 to US$4,727,500 under the category 1
of the Credit 1016-MAG) and for equipment (from an aggregate US$150,000 to
US$1,722,647 for both of the projects under review). The rationale for these
increases is dealt with in the paragraph 5.04 below.



- 15 -
Variances Between Planned and Actual Prolect Implementation
5.04      The  implementation  of  the projects was marked  out by three
amendments to the Development Credit Agreements, and a significant
reallocation of funds. The variances were:
(a) in a telex dated September 21, 1981, IDA agreed to amend the first
of the two Credit Agreements (Cr. 1016-MAG) to include, for an
amount of US$500,000, the cofinancing of the feasibility study of
the development of the Bemolonga tar sands.   Since the first
mention in the files of this new component of the project appears
on January 12. 1981, and the EIB project was already well prepared
at that time, it is probable that this cofinancing could have been
initially included in the IDA Credit.  However, as indicated in
paragraph 4.13 above, the study resulted in useful information for
the Government.
(b)  In 1983, IDA agreed with 0MNIS to utilize a significant portion of
the remaining available funds under the Credit 1016-MAG to increase
the amounts allocated for consulting services. These services were
aimed  at  assisting  the  OMNIS  exploration  team  for  the
interpretation of the numerous data, in particular seismic data,
coming from the exploration activities of the oil companies.
However, the transfer of funds to the corresponding category was
not formalized at the time through an official reallocation of
funds.
(c) As was mentioned in paragraph 5.02 above, a reallocation of funds
under the Credit 1016-MAG was made in June 1985. Since the seismic
survey was completed well below the budget, the remaining funds
under the corresponding category were reallocated: (i) to refill
the categories which had been overdrawn as mentioned in category
(b) above; and (ii) to finance further consulting services,
training, and equipment. The Credit 1016-MAG was the first of its
kind, which may account for the under-estimation of the forecast
costs under the corresponding categories.
(d) On December 11, 1987, IDA agreed to amend the Credit 1298-HAG, and
allocate the remaining funds under the Credit to finance: (i) a new
round of petroleum exploration promotion, for SDR 2,335,000; and
(ii) equipment for an amount of SDR 540,000. These new components
could not have been foreseen when the project was started, and the
success of this new round of exploration promotion was indicated
in paragraph 4.32 above.
(e) Finally, the Credit 1298-MAG was amended once more on June 27,
1989, in order to include the erection of a core storage building.
The accumulation of well samples which resulted from the drilling
activities of the oil companies made it necessary to have an
appropriate building to store and handle these samples.



- 16 -
5.05      IDA granted two one-year extensions for the Credit 1016, and three
for the Credit 1298-MAG. The fundamental reason for these extensions is that
it is hardly possible to prepare a petroleum exploration promotion, (which
may require the acquisition of supplementary data), the negotiations with
petroleum exploration contracts with oil companies, and the monitoring of the
exploration activities of these   companies, within a three-year period.
Since the Bank's assistance extends to the whole cycle of these activities,
projects of this nature should be assigned, from the start, a four to five
year period.
Audits
5.06      OMNIS' Financial Statements, as requested by the terms of the
Credit  Agreement,    were  prepared  by  a  private  independent  Malagasy
accounting company.   The reports were always delivered on time.   OMNIS
accounting procedures are functioning quite satisfactorily, and its accounts
were always presented in a readily usable format.
Performance of the Borrower
5.07      OMNIS staff made substantial progress in technical and managerial
areas throughout project implementation, and the agency's professionals
derived a maximum profit from the training program provided under the Credit.
OMNIS's counterpart staff for the implementation of the Credit was always
satisfactory, and was regularly improved during the projects' life.  OMNIS's
relations with the oil companies were always good.   The dynamism of the
agency in carrying out its work program was constant.  However, OMNIS did not
always  organize the  flow of information between the different parties
involved in the project.  This goes for different exploration consultants
working for OMNIS on the same project and with the same objectives, and may
also explain how EIB and IDA mutually did not know about the negotiations
which they were carrying out most probably simultaneously and for similar
projects.
Performance of the Bank
5.08      Considering that it was a pioneering operation in the field of
petroleum exploration promotion, IDA made an excellent job in preparing and
appraising a project which met all of its objectives.  Throughout project
implementation the training program of OMNIS professionals was structured to
take into account: (i) the technical progress made by OMNIS staff; (ii) the
on-the-job training provided by the oil companies; and (iii) the agency's
work program. During the project's life the Bank maintained good relations
with OMNIS professionals.  However, IDA was less effective in supervising the
energy study implemented under the Credit 1016-MAG by the Swiss consultant,
which should have been more strongly urged to deliver a good and readily
usable final product.



- 17 -
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
5.09      All of the consultants and the contractors were selected by OMNIS
in close accordance with IDA's guidelines. They all performed good work, in
accordance with the international industry practice.   The first  legal
consultants contracted by OMNIS did not however meet the expectations of the
agency; the consultant's work probably suffered from time constraints, and
its professionals could not follow the pace imposed by OMNIS's management.
On the other hand, the consultants involved in the second round of
exploration promotion, carried out from 1986 to 1988, did a brilliant job,
and contributed significantly to the success of this promotion.
6.   Conclusion
6.01      The recommendations derived from the analysis of both projects were
recorded in the appraisal summary. The recommendations of general relevance
are summarized in the following paragraph. The recommendations addressing
more specific issues regarding the country will be given in the last
paragraph.
6.02      The recommendations of general relevance are:
(a) the experience of both projects under review shows that any country
endowed with a sedimentary basin may have, at a small cost or at
no cost at all, the hydrocarbon potential of this basin appraised.
(b) A given Government work program designed to prepare a petroleum
exploration promotion should be targeted at defining exploration
plays, at participating in outlining exploration leads, but never
at defining exploration prospects.
(c) This work program should be, if it is at all possible, discussed
with oil companies having a previous experience in the exploration
of the country.
(d) The petroleum legislation of a given country, together with all its
relevant annexes, should be periodically reviewed in order to be
adapted to a fast evolving petroleum world environment.
(e) Since the necessary time period to assist a Government in: (i)
organizing a petroleum exploration promotion; (ii) negotiating
exploration contracts with oil companies; and (iii) monitoring the
exploration activities of these companies, is always longer than
three years, the minimum period for this type of project should be
accordingly extended.
6.03      The recommendations with a specific relevance to Madagascar are:
(a) a particular vigilance should be exercised by the Government and
IDA in putting into practice the recommendations resulting from the
different energy planning studies implemented in the past.



- 18 -
(b) Among the components of a possible new energy project, the
consultancy services provided to OMNIS should be streamlined in
accordance with the technical and managerial progresses made by the
OMNIS professionals.
(c) OMNIS should be encouraged to hire young professionals to fill up
the ranks left empty by the aging of the trained professionals, who
could transmit their experience and knowledge to these staff.
(d) The very success of the last petroleum exploration promotion
creates for OMNIS further needs in assistance for monitoring the
drilling activities of the oil companies, and supervising the
geological control of the wells.  It is recommended to include the
financing of such an assistance in a possible new energy project.

(CREDIT 1016-MAG)
TSIMIRORO HEAVY OIL EXPLORATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1298-MAG)
PART II:   PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.   Performance of the Borrower
1.01    The period between the date of signature of the Credit Agreement and
the effectiveness date was four months in the case of 1016-HAG and one-and-a-
half  months  for  1298-MAG.      In  the  general  context  of  government
administration, such short implementation periods are noteworthy.
1.02      Requests to the Bank for time extensions and reallocations of funds
can be explained firstly by a lack of experience on the part of OMNIS in the
complex field of petroleum exploration, and secondly by unexpected changes in
the areas requiring exploration during the course of the project.
1.03      Although initially untrained, the OMNIS staff was able to draw the
maximum benefit offered by training, seminars, contacts with consultants and
other foreign professionals, documentation, trips, etc., to build up its
capacity and to acquire a degree of expertise acceptable at international
levels.   The experience of the Tsimiroro site laboratory -- gained in
cooperation with Core Laboratories -- has demonstrated that, with even a
minimum  of  appropriate  assistance,  OMNIS  is  capable  of  performing
satisfactorily.
1.04      The international oil industry has received an extremely favorable
impression of OMNIS because its responses were generally prompt, and it
unfailingly fulfilled its commitments to its partners.
2.   Bank Performance
2.01      OMNIS has always appreciated the helpful views and advice supplied
by  the  Bank.    Such  advice  was  invaluable  during  project  execution,
particularly in preparing for the negotiations/discussions with OMNIS's
partners and consultants, and in preparing contract terms.
2.02      Long delays sometimes occurred in the payment of suppliers' bills.
Similarly, the Bank's consultation procedures for the finalization of
contracts, for the selection of a contractor, or for the placing of orders,
appear to be rather cumbersome, sometimes delaying the work schedule.



- 20 -
3.   Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.01      The performance of OMNIS consultants was not always satisfactory
during the initial period of the Credit. This could be explained by a lack
of experience on the part of OMNIS, which was unable to set up an efficient
system for supervising and monitoring the consultants.  This problem was,
however, solved, and consultants hired during the second period were, for the
most part, excellent. They also provided extremely good public relations for
OMNIS abroad.
3.02      Relations  between  OMNIS  and  the  Bank  were  excellent,  and
contributed to the completion of the project in spite of all the necessary
amendments to, and reallocations of, the Credits.
3.03      However, OMNIS would like to see an improvement in future appraisal
and supervision missions by the Bank: each of these should include both the
staff responsible for the financial and economic side of the project, and the
staff  responsible  for  the technical  side.   This would make both the
preparation of these missions and the implementation of their recommendations
more effective.

(c) Observations:
gi)     Through a telex Dated January 21, 1983, IDA informed
OMNIS that the Credit 1298-MAG had become effective on
the same day.  However, the effectiveness of the Credit
was tied with the signature of the OPEC Loan 310 P, which
occurred on March 01, 1983. This is the reason why many
documents in the files indicate March 01, 1983, as the
effective date of IDA Credit.
(ii)     The beginning of the Credit negotiations was delayed by
the search of a private company to participate to the
appraisal of the Tsimiroro heavy oil field deposit.

acquired data
Observations
Most of the tasks included in the Credit work program was implemented on
schedule, when not before schedule.   The only actions which were started
behind schedule concerned the Credit 1016-HAG, and were:
(i)     the reconnaissance seismic survey, which was delayed
waiting on the results of the call for bid to oil
companies; and
(ii)     the signature of the first petroleum exploration contract
with an oil company, which took longer to negotiate than
had been forecast.

Observation: The categories 4 to 6 above did not exist among the original
components of the Credit 1298-HAG. They were introduced through an amendment
to the project dated December 11, 1987, upon a request from OMIS to use the
remaining funds of the Credit to finance a second round of exploration
promotion and certain equipment for OHNIS. The corresponding work program
was not cofinanced by the OPEC Fund.

Comments:      As far as jobs created are concerned, the onshore exploration
activities of the oil companies generate a numerous, for provisory
employment. In 1985, during the peak of their activities, the oil companies
were employing 474 Halagasy Nationals.  Furthermore, the implementation of
the work program of oil companies resulted in local expenses, which are
difficult to assess, but are significant, in terms of hotels and food supply,
transportation, transit, real estate, etc...
B. Economic Impact
Any commercial hydrocarbon discovery resulting from the present
exploration activities carried out by the the oil companies would have a
significant impact on the macroeconomics development of the country.

Comments:
(a)  all of the missions were well timed and successful.  This is the
reason why they all received a grade 1.
(b) The rhythm of the supervision missions to Madagascar slackened
from 1893 on, from 2 to 4, to 1 to 2 missions a year, which may
have contributed to the loosening of Bank's control on the
consultants' work program (see Part 2, paragraph 2.01 above).

INTRODUCTION
The Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar, conscious
of the crucial role played by energy in a nation's development process,
continues to promote the exploration and development of petroleum in
Madagascar.
For a second time, the Government applied for financial assistance
from the International Development Association for the implementation of the
Tsimiroro Heavy Oil Exploration Project.
The Project Agreement, and a Credit Agreement in the mount of
US$11.5 million, were signed by the two parties on November 16. 1982.
In this report, OMNIS seeks to evaluate its performance and that
of the Bank during the execution of the Credit, and to asseas the quality of
the relationship thus established with the Bank.

Annex I
Pate 3 of 6
1.   General Comments
The  overall results  of the project were  satisfactory.   Its
principal tangible benefits are the following:
(a) The preparation and enactment of legislation and a fiscal regime
to govern petroleum operations, together with basic contractual
conditions, have lent credibility, in the eyes of the international
oil industry, to the activities undertaken by the Malagasy
Government in promoting and developing hydrocarbon exploration.
(b) The binding agreements between the major oil companies and OHNIS
have allowed the Malagasy Government to improve the monitoring of
operations, and to centralize all pertinent data.
(c) Much more is now known about the sedimentary basins in Madagascar.
following the studies and work carried out either by OMNIS itself
or by its partners.
(d) Cooperation with the international oil industry has increased the
level of national expertise in hydrocarbons.
(e) OMNIS has acquired the basic equipment necessary for its
activities.
(f)  The training received by OMNIS staff provides Madagascar with
certain specialized areas of expertise.
(g) Petroleum exploration activities in Madagascar have generated a
substantial number of employment opportunities in generally
isolated areas.
2.   ProsDects for Tsimiroro heavy oil
(a) Although no major commercial deposits were discovered, the
Amboloando formation is still promising owing to the prescence of
several structures to the west and south of the tectonic horst.
In addition, the western side of the horst offers potential for
lighter oil, while to the north-west of T01, the existence of
several closures was also noted.

Annex 1
Page 4 of 6
(b) To the east of the horst, and in the Amboloando formation, an area
of high oil saturation was identified.   Moreover,  an extremely
large area north of T01 shows signs of being a favorable reservoir,
although it has not yet been properly explored.
(c) The Isalo 1 formation, and particularly the crest of the structure,
which is less faulted and less subject to the inflow of meteoric
water, constitutes a prime target for future work.
(d) OMNIS does not believe that Tsimiroro should be abandoned. Results
obtained to date from work already carried out mean that the
exploration strategy in this area can be readjusted and targets
more clearly identified.
This will guide future OMNIS activities in promoting the heavy oil
project.
3.   Prospects for the Bemolanga tar sands
(a) Work and studies undertaken at Bemolanga have revealed the
existence of 595 million tons of tar sands. This can be extracted
by open pit mining, and contains 5.7Z - 6.1Z bitumen. This is the
only hydrocarbon deposit in Madagascar with proven -- and
calculated -- reserves.
(b) Following studies carried out by INGECO in 1981/82, more advanced
processes have been tested on the Bemolanga tar sands.   These
include the TACIUK and RTR processes.
Results have shown a better technical extraction feasibility, but
the level of investment and production costs remain prohibitive in
the present economic situation.
(c)  OMNIS is planning to test a new technique for extracting tar sands
involving the on-site cutting of impregnated formations. If this
method proves satisfactory, it will have the advantage of
minimizing damage to the environment, and will reduce production
costs.
(d) OMNIS is constantly on the lookout for partners for the project.
4.   Prospects for petroleum exploration
(a) Encouraged by the success of previous promotion campaigns, OMNIS
intends to maintain the plan on which they were based, i.e.:
-    acquisition and updating by OMNIS of basic data;



- 40 -
Annex 1
Page 5 of 6
-    presentation of the necessary documentation to the companies.
However, one innovation will be the organization of a geological
visit to the areas in question.   This will be offered to all
companies wishing to submit bids.
(b)  While 81,000 km2 are already covered by existing agreements,
approximately 256,000 km2 with potential hydrocarbon deposits have
yet to be promoted. This illustrates how much work still remains
for OMNIS to accomplish.
5.   Performance of the Borrower
The period between the date of signature of the Credit Agreement
and the effectiveness date was four months in the case of 1016-MAG
and one-and-a-half months for 1298-MAG. In the general context of
government administration, such short implementation periods are
noteworthy.
6.        Requests to the Bank for time extensions and reallocations of funds
can be explained firstly by a lack of experience on the part of
OMNIS in the complex field of petroleum exploration, and secondly
by unexpected changes in the areas requiring exploration during the
course of the project.
7.        Although initially untrained, the OMNIS staff was able to draw the
maximum benefit offered by training, seminars, contacts with
consultants and other foreign professionals, documentation, trips,
etc., to build up its capacity and to acquire a degree of expertise
acceptable  at  international  levels.    The  experience  of  the
Tsimiroro site laboratory -- gained in cooperation with Core
Laboratories -- has demonstrated that, with even a minimum of
appropriate   assistance,   OMNIS   is   capable   of   performing
satisfactorily.
8.        The international oil industry has received an extremely favorable
impression of OMNIS because its responses were generally prompt,
and it unfailingly fulfilled its commitments to its partners.
Bank Performance
9.        OMNIS has always appreciated the helpful views and advice supplied
by the Bank. Such advice was invaluable during project execution,
particularly in preparing for the negotiations/discussions with
OMNIS's partners and consultants, and in preparing contract terms.



- 41 -
Annex 1
Page 6 of 6
10.       Long delays sometimes occurred in the payment of suppliers' bills.
Similarly, the Bank's consultation procedures for the finalization
of contracts, for the selection of a contractor, or for the placing
of orders, appear to be rather cumbersome, sometimes delaying the
work schedule.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
11.       The performance of OMNIS consultants was not always satisfactory
during the initial period of the Credit. This could be explained
by a lack of experience on the part of OMNIS, which was unable to
set up an efficient system for supervising and monitoring the
consultants. This problem was, however, solved, and consultants
hired during the second period were, for the most part, excellent.
They also provided extremely good public  relations  for OMNIS
abroad.
Relations Between the Bank and the Borrower
12.       Relations  between  OMNIS  and  the  Bank  were  excellent,  and
contributed to the completion of the project in spite of all the
necessary amendments to, and reallocations of, the Credits.
13.       However, ONIS would like to see an improvement in future appraisal
and supervision missions by the Bank: each of these should include
both the staff responsible for the financial and economic side of
the project, and the staff responsible for the technical side.
This would make both the preparation of these missions and the
implementation of their recommendations more effective.
