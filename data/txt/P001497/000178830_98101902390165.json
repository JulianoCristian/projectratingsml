Its main components include: (a) exploration of the\n            Tsimiroro heavy oil deposit through a 10-well exploratory\n            drilling program to determine the characteristics of the\n            deposit; (b) engineering study of a pilot plant at Tsimiroro\n            for testing production of the heavy oil under enhanced\n            recovery techniques, such as steam flooding; (c) feasibility\n            study of upgrading the heavy oil recovered from Tsimiroro,\n            including selection of an appropriate upgrading process; and\n            (d) training abroad of about 12 professionals for about six\n            months each."}, "docdt": "1982-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
