The changes address challenges resulting from\n            unrealistic project development objectives and complex\n            project design, which were the result of an attempt to\n            combine emergency response to improve delivery of basic\n            urban services in KM with long term capacity development\n            goals in a difficult country and sector environment. Changes\n            are also required to address significant cost overruns and a\n            subsequent funding gap. The restructuring will modify the\n            project's development objectives to focus on improving\n            delivery of basic urban service, reduce project scope, and\n            scale back project outcomes. The project restructuring will\n            be accompanied by a second one-year extension of credit\n            closing date from March 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011, to\n            enable completion of the area upgrading works as per the\n            restructured project."}, "docdt": "2010-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
