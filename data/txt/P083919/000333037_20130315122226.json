{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Kabul Urban\n            Reconstruction Project for Afghanistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project design for post-conflict reconstruction should be\n            kept simple and oriented towards the immediate and urgent\n            reconstruction needs. Projects in post-conflict environments\n            must either include higher contingency costs than is normal\n            or set aside about 20% of the funds as unallocated funds, as\n            post-conflict environments are uncertain and volatile.\n            Capacity constraints in both the public sector and the\n            private sector in post-conflict environments are\n            considerable. Bank support delivered as emergency operations\n            within in a compressed time schedule usually will not allow\n            time for effective capacity building activities to be\n            delivered before projects are effective. The presence of a\n            field-based task-team leader (TTL) is of utmost importance\n            in contexts such as Afghanistan. In conflict countries with\n            significant capacity constraints, the presence of\n            country-based TTL to provide intensive implementation\n            support is crucial for timely achievement of project results."}, "docdt": "2013-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
