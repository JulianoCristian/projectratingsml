of the Emergency Urban\n            Reconstruction Project is to improve urban management and\n            the delivery of urban services, and shelter in Kabul\n            Municipality. This will be achieved by supporting the\n            integration of selected neighborhoods into the urban fabric\n            of the capital city by carrying out reconstruction and\n            rehabilitation of urban services. Activities under the\n            project should not entail significant negative environmental\n            and social impacts, provided they are designed and\n            implemented with due consideration of environmental and\n            social issues. Construction activities may cause limited,\n            temporary, and localized negative impacts that can be\n            mitigated through the implementation of an appropriate\n            social and environmental plan. Adverse impacts may arise due\n            to depletion or degradation of natural resources such as\n            stone, earth, water, etc. used for housing and urban\n            infrastructure construction. Social and environmental\n            management in Afghanistan is suffering from critical\n            capacity constraints, the mitigation and management is key\n            to the rehabilitation and development of neighborhoods.\n            Mitigation measures include good engineering design. New\n            borewells should be drilled in urban areas as it would\n            further deteriorate the quantity and quality of groundwater.\n            Where water cannot be supplied through the network, the\n            project will assess feasible alternative/temporary options\n            on a case-to-case basis. Local ecology will be considered on\n            a case-by-case basis. Co-ordination with the line\n            departments, other stakeholders such as NGOs must begin in\n            the design phase itself. Social and environmental mitigation\n            should be built into the project agreement. The natural\n            landscape should be preserved to the extent possible by\n            conducting operations in a manner that will prevent\n            unnecessary destruction or scarring of natural surroundings.\n            Wastewater must not enter streams without settling ponds,\n            filters or other process."}, "docdt": "2003-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
