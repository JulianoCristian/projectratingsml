(i) 
in respect of the Special Account "A", an amount equivalent to 
$4,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited 
into the Special Account "A" pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Annex; provided, however, that, unless the Association shall

amount equivalent to $2,400,000, until the aggregate amount of 
withdrawals from the Credit Account of amounts allocated to the 
Special Account’s "A" Eligible Categories, plus the total amount 
of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions in 
respect of amounts allocated to said Categories, shall equal or 
Page  16
exceed the equivalent of SDR 5,540,000; and

Withdrawals of a Special Account’s Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish said Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Special Account’s Authorized Allocation, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Association a request or requests for deposit into said 
Special Account of an amount or amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed said 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of each such request, the Association shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into said Special 
Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
For replenishment of said Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Association requests for deposit into said Special Account at such intervals as 
the Association shall specify. Prior to or at the time of each such request, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Association the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to Parts B.3 or C.3 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement, as the case may be, for 
the payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the basis 
of each such request, the Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from 
the Credit Account and deposit into said Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence 
to have been paid out of said Special Account for Eligible Expenditures. Each such 
deposit into said Special Account shall be withdrawn by the Association from the 
Credit Account under one or more of said Special Account’s Eligible Categories.
3.
The Association shall not be required to make further deposits into a Special 
Account, once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to said Special 
Account’s Eligible Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions in respect of expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit 
allocated to said Categories, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of said 
Special Account’s Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit 
Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to said Categories 
shall follow such procedures as the Association shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that 
the Association shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit 
in said Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making 
payments for Eligible Expenditures.
Annex B to SCHEDULE 1

1.
Except as the Association may otherwise specify by notice to the Borrower, all

amount so requested; and (b) the amount which the Association has determined, based on 
the Project Management Report accompanying said application, is required to be 
deposited in order to finance Eligible Expenditures during the six-month period 
following the date of such report; provided, however, that the amount so deposited,

Page  17
the Special Account "A" and $1,020,000 in respect of the Special Account "B".
