frameworks for the road sub-sector. Project\n            components include: 1) road reconstruction, rehabilitation,\n            and improvement, covering sections of the main Central\n            America corridor, roads connecting neighboring countries,\n            and roads located in the southwestern region of the country,\n            known as the \"natural corridor\". In addition, the\n            Santa Rita-Yoro road, the most severely damaged road by\n            Hurricane Mitch, will be reconstructed, to include\n            replacement of four bridges, retaining walls, and river\n            channels. Improvements include sections connecting the\n            central part of the country, and the most southern section,\n            referred to as the Central Highway; 2) rural roads and\n            bridges, involving rehabilitation of high priority rural\n            roads, complementing USAID financing in several Departments\n            of the country. Environmental mitigation will address part\n            of the works; 3) a pilot project on road maintenance, partly\n            financed by participating local communities through the\n            formation of micro-enterprises, established with\n            consultants' assistance; 4) consultant services, and\n            technical assistance to supervise works, and strengthen the\n            Planning Directorate, and the Road Fund organization; and,\n            5) a limited amount of goods, such as equipment, vehicles,\n            and computers."}, "docdt": "2000-10-13T00:00:00Z"}
