The mitigation plan stipulates: 1)\n            Solid wastes shall not be incinerated, instead should be\n            disposed of at selected sites in accordance with standard\n            regulations, and oil spills will be similarly stored, and\n            disposed of at selected sites. Additionally, equipment, and\n            vehicles will be subjected to preventive maintenance to\n            minimize both air, and noise pollution. 2) Surfaces should\n            be permanently humidified, and the use of equipment covers\n            will be available as needed. 3) Civil works along rivers\n            should adjust to the natural water flows, with no wastewater\n            drainage allowed on natural waters, and, dredging should\n            avoid depletion of underground water-flows. Latrines or\n            septic tanks should be installed as needed. 4) Vegetative\n            propagation will be restituted following civil works, and\n            flora and fauna habitats will be avoided as possible.\n            Socioeconomic aspects will be addressed in the Resettlement\n            Action Plan."}, "docdt": "2000-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
