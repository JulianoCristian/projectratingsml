Some lessons\n            learned included: An externally managed Project Coordination\n            Unit (PCU) can help increase efficiency in project\n            implementation. Road maintenance by micro-enterprises can be\n            an efficient management strategy and can also contribute to\n            social development and poverty reduction. In order for road\n            maintenance funding objectives to be met, there needs to be\n            in place a sound policy and institutional framework\n            supported flexibly by actions to be taken during\n            implementation. Management of environmental and social\n            safeguards needs to be integrated into project\n            implementation and both Borrower and the Bank need to be\n            flexible in the allocation of time and resources to this matter."}, "docdt": "2007-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
