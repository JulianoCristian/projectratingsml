Sector Adjustment\n            Credit (EdSAC II) in Ghana.  The project was one of a series\n            of Bank operations supporting the overall reform and\n            rehabilitation of Ghana's education sector. The main\n            objectives of the project were to help the Government: (a)\n            complete the restructuring of the school system to a 12-year\n            cycle; (b) extend the reform to senior secondary education\n            by simplifying the curriculum, introducing more practical\n            content into it, and replenishing necessary basic materials\n            and supplies; (c) consolidate the basic education reforms so\n            that primary and JSS leavers acquire the cognitive skills\n            needed to take advantage of education offered at higher\n            levels; and (d) ensure the financial sustainability of the\n            new system. The performance of both the Borrower andBank was\n            satisfactory throughout the preparation and implementation\n            of the project. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the capacity of the Ministry of Education and Ghana\n            Education Service to plan, implement and monitor progress of\n            the reform program needs to be strengthened significantly in\n            order for key components of the program to be carried out in\n            a timely manner so that their impact could contribute to the\n            development of appropriate responses; (ii) reforms of such\n            magnitude would require establishing intermediate targets\n            for phased implementation. (iii) learning outcomes are\n            unlikely to improve significantly without substantial\n            improvement in the system of rewards and punishments for\n            performance within which teachers operate in Ghana. Finally,\n            one significant problem with adjustment lending is that\n            conditions, once put in place, can be relatively easily\n            undone once all tranches have been released. Other ongoing\n            projects included the Community Secondary Schools\n            Construction Project, Literacy and Functional Skills\n            Project, Tertiary Education Project and Primary School\n            Development Project. In addition, the Vocational Skills and\n            Informal Sector Support Project was approved in 1995 and a\n            Basic Education Program was in the initial stages of preparation."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
