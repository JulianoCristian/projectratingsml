       Credit is designed to support the ongoing education sector\n            reform program, initiated by the Government of Ghana in\n            1986.  Thus far the program has made significant progress in\n            addressing three main objectives : a) improving pedagogic\n            effectiveness; b) making education financing more efficient\n            and equitable; and c) ensuring that the reformed system can\n            be sustained using national resources.  The project will :\n            1) extend the reform to the senior secondary level,\n            introducing more practical content into the curriculum; 2)\n            consolidate the reforms initiated at the basic education\n            level so that primary and junior secondary school leavers\n            acquire the cognitive skills needed to take advantage of the\n            education offered at higher levels; and 3) ensuring the\n            financial sustainability of the new system now being put\n            into place."}, "docdt": "1990-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
