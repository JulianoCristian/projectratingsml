This Environmental\n            Management Plan (EMP) will support, and improve the quality\n            of the project, ensuring stakeholders' participation,\n            namely that of the environment protection authority, and of\n            local communities, and, strengthening the capacity to\n            address environmental responsiveness under disaster\n            circumstances. Mitigating measures address: 1) institutional\n            issues, modifying emergency procedures, through technical\n            assistance, and training, to integrate environmental\n            protection in the design, and implementation of emergency\n            programs; 2) technical infrastructure, and housing\n            rehabilitation, assessing new sites - including landscaping,\n            and re-vegetation -, and, auditing drainage, and wastewater\n            treatment plants, for rehabilitation, or construction of new\n            wastewater facilities; and, 3) social infrastructures, to\n            prevent health hazards, through the rehabilitation of\n            sanitary, schools, and public facilities, integrating\n            technical specifications in procurement works."}, "docdt": "2000-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
