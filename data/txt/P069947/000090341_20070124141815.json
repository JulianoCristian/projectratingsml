There was some debate about whether a\n            project for emergency reconstruction such as this should\n            have included a new waste water treatment plant in the first\n            place. It is important to carefully select the appropriate\n            procurement and implementation procedures. An assessment of\n            local resources is required to ensure that the best\n            procurement procedures are adopted under the circumstances.\n            It is important that emergency operations such as this\n            project be able to depend on decentralized implementation\n            through existing sectoral institutions and capacity which is\n            much more appropriate and effective than using a\n            centrally-located project management unit or other ad hoc\n            implementation arrangements.
