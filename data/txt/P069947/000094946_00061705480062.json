The project consists of\n            five components. 1) Disaster organization and risk\n            management will strengthen the institutional capacity of\n            emergency management in Algeria to prepare for and manage\n            the consequences of large-scale emergencies, and to promote\n            a nationwide, comprehensive risk management strategy. The\n            component will finance acquisition of emergency response and\n            search-and-rescue capacity in Algeria through the purchase\n            of specialized equipment and training in the use and\n            maintenance of the equipment. 2) The housing component will\n            assist the government in the reconstruction of permanent\n            housing in the areas affected by the earthquake. 3)\n            Technical infrastructure will restore essential\n            infrastructure for the benefit of the population at large\n            and in particular for the population affected by the\n            earthquake. The component includes the design and\n            supervision of infrastructure construction. 4) Social\n            infrastructure will finance the reconstruction of public\n            buildings which provide vital social services, including\n            schools, hospitals, recreation centers, and government\n            offices. 5) Project implementation will finance the creation\n            and maintenance of a Project Coordination Unit during the implementation."}, "docdt": "2000-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
