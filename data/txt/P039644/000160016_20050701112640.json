These are among the key lessons cited: 1)\n            Where there is a potential for procurement problems, it is\n            important to have a high level of project preparation and\n            readiness at entry. 2) During times of financial crisis or\n            political change, projects should be designed with a view\n            toward maximum flexibility, and the potential for rapid\n            restructuring as the need arises. 3) There are advantages in\n            cost effectiveness and efficiency when several similar\n            projects are funded concurrently and managed as a single\n            program. 4) Baseline data should always be collected,\n            documented in the Project Appraisal Document, and agreed\n            upon during project preparation. 5) Systematic monitoring\n            and evaluation is critical in a project with widely\n            dispersed activities and sites. 6) The establishment of a\n            strongly staffed and well managed project implementation\n            unit are key factors for successful implementation.7)\n            Project personnel from provincial and district agencies\n            should become more familiar with Bank guidelines and\n            documentation requirements. 8) Geographical targeting of\n            services should be done on the basis of poverty. Estimates\n            should be made down to the village level. There should be a\n            pre-commitment to update the \"map\" each\n            year--thereby overcoming the static nature of most poverty\n            map schemes 9) School mapping can be useful to education\n            agencies. 10) When a project has widely disbursed project\n            sites, local administrators, coordinators and teachers\n            should be more fully briefed regarding the advantages of\n            participating as well as their responsibilities. 11) When\n            technical consultants are selected and contracted as\n            individuals, rather than as teams (organizations), there is\n            a strong possibility that they may not form a cohesive\n            working unit. This lack of cohesion may cause delays in\n            construction, lack of architectural control over the\n            project, and a lack of articulation between various plans\n            and specifications 12) Using contract teachers may address\n            the temporary teacher shortage and introduce increased\n            flexibility into the civil service."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
