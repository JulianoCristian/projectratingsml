The project sustainability is substantial,\n            considering both the government and the private\n            sector's interest in the future of the project. Some\n            key lessons learned and recommendations follow: 1) important\n            factors for project sustainability are the linkages among\n            the private industry, the government and public entities, as\n            well as coordination with the respective ministry, i.e., for\n            the provision or access to facilities, equipment, human\n            resources and technical expertise; 2) an institutional\n            framework should be in place to ease national policies and\n            delineate areas of responsibility; 3) decision making,\n            flexibility and creativity are paramount areas in the\n            vitality of a successful operation, and a constant\n            institutional strengthening provides the likelihood for\n            sustainable projects; 4) selection of courses, responding to\n            client and industry demands may be better obtained through a\n            timely and accurate labor market information; 5) flexibility\n            in the cycle schedule and training modules facilitated the\n            movement from level to level; 6) evidence suggests that the\n            Career Enhancement Program was vital for a successful\n            operation, and it should be strengthened in future\n            operations; and, 7) the Microenterprise Development Program\n            however, hindered success, thus substantial time should be\n            allowed for such programs to take off."}, "docdt": "1998-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
