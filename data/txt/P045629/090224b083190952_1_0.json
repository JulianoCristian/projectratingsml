In 2001, Cambodia had a population of around 12.3\n            million, with 20 percent of people living in urban areas.\n            Coverage of improved water supply was extremely low, and\n            institutional capacity in the utilities was virtually\n            non-existent. Urban sanitation was even more under-served\n            than urban water supply. For rural water supply and\n            sanitation, low coverage, low efficiency and the lack of a\n            clear development strategy remained key challenges. Cambodia\n            Provincial and Peri-Urban Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project provided 90 percent of the residents with a reliable\n            water supply in the country. The project was implemented by\n            Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA) to expand its\n            water network to target areas while supporting low-income\n            communities in urban centers through access to clean water\n            and sanitation."}, "docdt": "2010-09-24T08:21:00Z"}
