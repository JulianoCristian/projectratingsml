drinking water coverage, quality and access in\n            Cambodia's two biggest cities; b) improve the\n            performance of the water utilities in these cities; c)\n            enhance availability of water for commercial and industrial\n            purposes in these two cities as a spur to economic growth\n            and as a means of ensuring viability of the utilities; and\n            d) help the Government develop and implement an investment\n            program based on a well-articulated water and sanitation\n            sector policy framework.  The project consists of three\n            components: 1) Augmentation of water supply in Phnom Penh\n            will be done through rehabilitation and extension of the\n            Chruoy Chang War water treatment plant; supply of pipes,\n            ancillary equipment and leak detection equipment; and\n            technical assistance.  2) Augmentation of water supply in\n            Sihanoukville will be done by raising the outlet weir and\n            sealing off the sand spit to increase the storage of raw\n            water; constructing four new groundwater wells; and\n            improving distribution system.  3) Assistance to develop a\n            water and sanitary policy framework for the sector as a\n            whole will be provided through financing of consulting services."}, "docdt": "1998-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
