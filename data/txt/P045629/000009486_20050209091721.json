Among the lessons learned are the\n            following:  1) More efforts should have been expended at\n            preparation to identify a solution to Sihanoukville Water\n            Supply Authority's (SWSA's) lack of autonomy. The\n            Bank may have erred in repeatedly requesting autonomy\n            without exploring other more realistic avenues, such as\n            simple management contracts. 2) Disappointed by the small\n            amount of flexibility enjoyed by SWSA, during the\n            preparation of the successor project in 2000 the Bank\n            decided not to include in the latter urban water systems\n            without sufficient autonomy, and therefore to discontinue\n            its involvement in Sihanoukville. In hindsight, the\n            Bank's exit was probably premature and, as\n            implementation progressed after 2000, it became increasingly\n            clear that this had been a mistake. 3) Phnom Penh Water\n            Supply Authority's (PPWSA' s) leadership was to a\n            very large extent the driving force behind the whole\n            project, as it created a dynamic benefiting all\n            stakeholders. It also had a powerful demonstration effect.\n            4) Project implementation would have benefited, if, before\n            start of project execution, key personnel from the central\n            and technical ministries had been provided assistance and\n            training in Bank policies and procedures. It would have\n            reduced delays. To the extent possible, this type of\n            assistance should be on a grant basis. 5) The experiences\n            accumulated from the project plead for a continued\n            Bank's presence in the water and sanitation sector in\n            Cambodia to consolidate what was achieved and to expand much\n            needed services to a very poor population."}, "docdt": "2004-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
