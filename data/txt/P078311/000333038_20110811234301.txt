                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project (RECRP) is approaching the closing
date currently scheduled for October 31, 2011. This paper proposes a reallocation Credit
proceeds between disbursement categories to account for actual usage and commitments;
an extension of the project Closing Date by four months to February 29, 2012; and the
granting of a grace period of four months for withdrawal of funds in order to make final
payments. The request for these changes have been made by the Government in their
letters dated July 7, 2011 and July 21, 2011. These changes will enable completion of all
project activities and disbursement of the funds associated with these remaining
activities. No changes to the project development objective, environmental assessment
(EA) category, outcomes or the results monitoring framework are proposed.


PROJECT STATUS
The Project is progressing well in achieving the Project development objective: to
increase confidence and lower transaction costs by building a more efficient property
registration and cadastre system, with the purpose of contributing to the development of
effective real property markets. The Project has focused on technical and public
awareness solutions to improve the quality of services; targeted training and capacity
building to increase the skills and the knowledge base of its staff; developed and
implemented a good communication strategy to raise awareness of the registration
process; and provided free legal services to ensure that citizens understand the procedures
and requirements for registration. Project targets for increasing real estate market activity,
including mortgages, have already been exceeded and targets for completing digitizing of
records are also exceeded. Targets for completing the real estate cadastre (REC) by
systematically registering all legal properties in the country are nearing completion. The
REC has been established for 94 percent of all cadastre municipalities (CMs) with the
works in the remaining 6 percent ongoing and due to be completed before the end of the
proposed extended period of the project. The Republic Geodetic Authority (RGZ) is
committed to completing the REC in the whole country by the end of 2011. There are no
outstanding covenants awaiting compliance and audits are up to date (2010 audit
completed) and rated as satisfactory. Prior audits were also found to be satisfactory to the
Bank.

Demand for registration services is growing, particularly in Belgrade, and the RGZ has
recently implemented reforms to deal with the increased demand. There is progress in
reducing the number of days required to register a transaction, and RGZ is quickly
approaching the final target of five days. A customer satisfaction survey has been
recently completed and the findings indicate that customers are generally satisfied with


                                              4
registration and cadastre services and that the communication strategy has contributed in
raising the awareness and mobilizing the public to register.

Current disbursement is 86 percent. In February 2011 the contract for development of the
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system was terminated due to non-
performance by the contractor. In March 2011 the very experienced procurement officer
left the project. It was not possible to find another procurement officer of suitable
experience in Serbia and international recruitment had to be carried out. Following
cancellation of the ICT system development contract a new ICT strategy was developed
by RGZ and the funds originally allocated for the ICT system development contract (US$
3.6 Million) have been reallocated to fulfill the new strategy. The reallocation requested
includes reallocation of some of the funds for technical services to goods and consulting
services because of the cancellation of the ICT system development contract. The
reallocation also accounts for an increase in funds used for civil works because of higher
than expected costs. The request for an extension to the project period and reallocation of
funds is a result of the delays experienced following the departure of the procurement
officer and the cancellation of the ICT development contract. If the reallocation and
extension are granted The project is expected to close satisfactorily.



PROPOSED CHANGES

       •   Reallocations

       As described above, reallocations are required because (a) Civil works costs were
       slightly higher than originally envisaged; (b) Funds allocated for ICT system
       development reallocated from technical services category to goods and consulting
       services following cancellation of the ICT system development contract and
       development of a new ICT strategy. As per PIU confirmation, category (4a)
       Consulting Service – Audits and experts, should correctly state SDR553,624
       instead of SDR533,624 per Government letter of July 7, 2011.

  •     Closing Date

        The proposed extension of closing date from October 31, 2011 to February 29,
        2012 would be the second extension. The first extension was for one year from
        October 31, 2010 to October 31, 2011 and was granted primarily to compensate
        for the time lost due to delays in transferring land books from the municipal
        courts to the RGZ. As indicated, this extension is primarily to account for changes
        to the information technology strategy and delays that have resulted from the
        departure of the procurement officer.


  •     Grace Period

        The government have requested a four month grace period after the closure of the
        project in order to withdraw funds from the credit after completion of the project.
        This period will be needed and it is recommended that a Grace Period to June 30,
        2012 be approved.
