2.       The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project is approaching the Closing Date
currently scheduled for February 29, 2012. This paper proposes a reallocation of Credit
Proceeds between disbursement categories to cater for the actual expenditures incurred following
tenders. There are no major changes to activities and this reallocation is needed prior to the
Project’s Closing Date. The request for these changes have been made by the Government in
their letter dated November 14, 2011.

3.     These changes will enable completion of all project activities and disbursement of funds
associated with these remaining activities. No changes to the project development objective,
environmental assessment (EA) category, outcomes or the results monitoring framework are
proposed. Financial Management Reports issued have been satisfactory to the Bank and there
are no outstanding audits.
