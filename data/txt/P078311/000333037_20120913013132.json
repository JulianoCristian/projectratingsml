   Registration Project for Serbia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the Republic of Serbia had achieved good\n            donor coordination in the area of cadastre and land\n            registration; the Bank's involvement provided a\n            framework for project interaction with parallel donors. Good\n            coordination of parallel funding is a requirement for the\n            implementation of a successful project. Interaction between\n            the client and the Information and Communications\n            Technologies (ICT) contractor needs to be strengthened,\n            starting from the beginning of the contract; the contract\n            should not be treated as a turn-key project. The lesson\n            learned is that the client and contractor should form\n            managerial and technical commissions to discuss and monitor\n            the software to be produced by the contractor and the data\n            to be supplied by the client. The capacity of the client to\n            manage large ICT contracts needs more support from\n            independent ICT specialists. The client should be aware of\n            the complexity of managing large ICT contracts and have more\n            training to support him in this task. The client can then be\n            more critical in monitoring the contents and progress of\n            such contracts, scrutinize the reports produced by the\n            contractor throughout the Project and take remedial steps if necessary."}, "docdt": "2012-09-04T00:00:00Z"}
