                                      Restructuring Paper


1.      The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project is approaching the Closing Date
currently scheduled for February 29, 2012. This paper proposes an extension of Closing Date
until March 31, 2012. There are no changes to the project development objective, environmental
assessment (EA) category, outcomes or the results monitoring framework. The request for this
change has been made by the Government in their letter dated February 14, 2012.

2.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow for the completion of the delivery of goods
for the regional offices. The country is under a State of Emergency due to heavy snowfall and
extreme weather conditions. Delivery of goods has been interrupted and the mobility of people
is limited. Thus, the project risks not being able to complete the delivery of goods under six
contracts with a total value of € 600,000 by the Project’s current Closing Date of February 29,
2012.

3.     There are no overdue audits and previous audit reports have been found satisfactory to
the Bank. Overall financial management is rated satisfactory.

4.     This will be the third extension of the project.
