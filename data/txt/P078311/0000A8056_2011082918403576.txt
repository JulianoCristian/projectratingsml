                         systems modernization, and legalextension services); and Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening (including public awareness campaigns,
                         businessplanning, training, IT strategy, legal framework completion).

                         Targets for completing the real estate cadastre (REC) by systematically registering all legal properties in the country are nearing completion. The REC has been established for 94

                         percent of all cadastre municipalities (CMs) with the works in the remaining 6 percent ongoing. The Republic Geodetic Authority (RGZ) is committed to completing the REC in the
                         whole country by the end of 2011.
                         Demand for registration services is growing, particularly in Belgrade, and the RGZ has recently implemented reforms to deal with the increased demand. It is clear however that RGZ
                         will need to take more action to deal with increasing demand, such as recruiting more staff, expanding premises in Belgrade, more streamlining of processes, and greater access via
                         online services. There is progress in reducing the number of days required to register a transaction, and RGZ is quickly approaching the target of five days.
                         Third customer satisfaction survey has been completed and the findings indicate that customers are generally satisfied with registration and cadastre services and that the
                         communication strategy has contributed in raising the awareness and mobilizing the public to register.
