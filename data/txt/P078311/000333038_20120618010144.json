The project is approaching the\n            closing date currently scheduled for February 29, 2012. This\n            paper an extension of closing date until March 31, 2012. The\n            extension is necessary to allow for the completion of the\n            delivery of goods for the regional offices. The country is\n            under a state of emergency due to heavy snowfall and extreme\n            weather conditions. Delivery of goods has been interrupted\n            and the mobility of people is limited. Thus, the project\n            risks not being able to complete the delivery of goods under\n            six contracts with a total value of \u0080 600,000 by the\n            Project's current closing date of February 29, 2012.\n            Overall financial management is rated satisfactory. This\n            will be the third extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
