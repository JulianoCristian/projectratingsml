When Serbia started land\n            administration reforms in 2004, only nine percent of all\n            cadaster municipalities had unified and updated property and\n            ownership records. Many land transaction records were\n            incomplete, out of date, or not noted at all. Real Estate\n            Cadastre and Registration Project has established a unified\n            register for almost all of the cadaster municipalities. The\n            project also supported training for more than 1,500\n            employees, thirty six cadastre premises were refurbished and\n            modernized, two new buildings were built, digital archives\n            established, and a national network of forty four permanent\n            global positioning system stations developed"}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T05:22:05Z"}
