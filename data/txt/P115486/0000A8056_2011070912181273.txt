                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The LRIP implementation continues to progress in a satisfactory manner. All civil works activities planned under the original and LRIP-AF1, and several planned for LRIP-AF2, are
                         already completed. The 2011 work program is already under way with 13 km of roads under contract and several other works packages already advertised for bidding.
                         2. Based on past and current progress, it is highly likely that the targets of the LRIP would be exceeded. The second additional financing to the LRIP became effective on October 21,
                         2010
                         3. The team noted that the Transport PIU became severely overloaded with additional responsibility for implementing non-Bank-funded activities transferred to the unit. This was
                         done as part of a Government-wide decision to transfer such activities from Government to the respective PIUs. This decision should be accommodated with appropriate staff and
                         other resource allocations to the PIU. However, at the date of this ISR, such transfers have not taken place yet.
