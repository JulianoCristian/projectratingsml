The road to Tatev monastery, a 9th century\n            monastery, is an architectural masterpiece, a landmark, and\n            a tourist attraction which winds through a spectacular gorge\n            with rocky slopes and lush forests. It once connected\n            several villages, but became so dilapidated that it was\n            known not as the most beautiful pass in Armenia, but as the\n            most dangerous one. The government, with World Bank support,\n            rebuilt new road to Tatev, which lures tourists from Armenia\n            and beyond once again, and benefits these isolated\n            communities. One of the main goals of the Tatev revival\n            project, which upgraded the road and other infrastructure\n            here, was to connect the area's heritage with\n            today's development. As a result, the Wings of Tatev,\n            the longest aerial tramway in the world, spanning the\n            Vorotan River Gorge, was built and is already a major\n            attraction for tourists. The roads linking villages to\n            highways are often called lifeline roads in Armenia, as they\n            are vital for communities, located dozens of kilometers away\n            from urban centers. The World Bank-supported project has\n            ended geographic and economic isolation of rural\n            communities. It has fixed almost 300 kilometers of roads in\n            over 80 communities in Armenia, and has created thousands of\n            short-term jobs."}, "docdt": "2012-01-30T07:43:00Z"}
