1     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

    1.1.1   Country Background. Armenia suffered from severe economic contraction in
            2009 following the global economic crisis. The real Gross Domestics Product
            (GDP) declined by about 14.6 percent in 2009 (Figure 1 below), mainly caused
            by the decline in the construction sector. The economy resumed growth in
            2010 and has maintained a recovery path with a growth rate of 2.1 percent in
            2010, 4.6 percent in 2011, and 7.2 percent in 20121. The recession had a major
            impact on local employment, disrupted the poverty reduction momentum of
            Armenia and increased poverty for the first time since the late 1990s. During
            the peak of the recession, about 42 percent of Armenian households reported of
            suffering from the negative consequences of the global economic crisis. The
            poverty headcount increased from 28 percent of the population in rural areas in
            2008 to 36 percent in 2010. The Government of Armenia (GOA) reacted to the
            economic crisis by initiating a recovery strategy to protect the poor and support
            local employment by improving connectivity to markets and generated local
            employment.

    1.1.2   Road Sector. Armenia is a landlocked country in a strategically important
            location of the South Caucasus in Eurasia. The country shares its borders with
            four countries: Georgia, Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkey. However, only two of
            these borders are open: the southern border with Iran and the northern border
            with Georgia. The borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan were closed in the early

 The April 2014 IMF World Development Outlook forecast the growth rate from 2014 to 2019 to be 4.7
percent annually.



                                                                            1
            1990s as a result of the Nagorno-Karabash conflict. In addition, Armenia has
            very challenging topography and weather conditions during winter – the terrain
            is very mountainous, which results in high transport costs and expensive
            infrastructure maintenance and development.

    1.1.3   The transport sector has represented an average of 6.7 percent of GDP over the
            last seven years. The total length of the road network is 7,704 km, excluding
            urban roads, with less than half being in good or fair condition2. The network is
            classified into interstate (1,686 km), republican (4,056 km) and local roads
            (1,962 km), of which republican roads are subdivided into republican main
            roads (1,814 km) managed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications
            (MoTC) and other republican roads (2,242 km) managed by the Regional
            administrations (Marzes). Most of the road network was built in the 1960s and
            1970s. The percentage of paved roads, at 93 percent, is high compared to other
            developing countries, but is in line with most European countries. The majority
            of republican and local roads have deteriorated since independence and only 52
            percent of the republican roads are currently in good or fair condition. The
            average daily traffic of republican roads is around 8000 vehicles.

    1.1.4   The MoTC is responsible for the transport sector in Armenia and for managing
            interstate and republican main roads (1,814 km). Marzes and local
            communities are responsible for maintaining about 55 percent of other
            republican roads (2,242 km) and all local roads. The Armenian Road
            Directorate (ARD) is responsible for maintaining interstate and republican
            main roads. In 2008, the GOA launched the Lifeline Road Development
            Program, introducing the concept of lifeline roads, comprised of about 4,000
            km, mainly current republican roads under the responsibility of ARD. The
            lifeline roads concept ensures at least one access road to all 960 communities
            in Armenia, which is in line with the GOA’s transport strategy of focusing on
            improving key international roads network and rehabilitating the lifeline roads
            network (LRN). In international terms, the rate of deaths per capita and per
            vehicle in Armenia remains much higher than in best performing countries.
            Armenia’s deaths per 100,000 people are 10.5, compared with the average of
            6.0 for the European Union member states. The deaths per 100,000 people
            increased from 10.3 in 2005 to 13.7 in 2008 and since 2008 decreased to 10.5
            in 2012. Pedestrians account for 44 percent of the deaths.

    1.1.5   Rationale for Bank Assistance. In response to the global financial crisis in
            2009, the GOA requested support on three fronts: (i) a Small and Medium
            Enterprises credit line, to support real sector activity; (ii) budgetary support;
            and (iii) urgent support for small-scale infrastructure to generate increased
            employment. The Lifeline Roads Improvement Project (LRIP) was part of this
            requested program and was prepared under the International Development

2
  In 2008, 32.2 percent of republican roads were in good or fair condition. In 2013, the percentage increased
to 51.5 percent.

            Association (IDA) “Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track Facility” utilizing
            Operational Policy (OP) 8.0, Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergencies. The
            rationale for the Bank assistance was to mitigate the impact of the global
            financial crisis in Armenia, create employment and respond to the urgent
            request of support from the GOA, and use the Bank’s global knowledge to
            strengthen ARD’s capacity to improve efficiency through implementing cost
            effective pavement designs and to improve road safety. The LRIP had two
            additional financings approved within two years to increase the scope of the
            road works.

  1.1.6     LRIP was consistent with the 2004-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and
            addressed one of its three objectives: “promoting private sector growth by
            strengthening the financial sector, improving public sector management, and
            reducing infrastructure bottlenecks”. The CAS and Progress Report specifically
            included improving road transport infrastructure as a key outcome indicator.
            The Lifeline Roads Improvement Project Additional Financing (LRIP-AF) and
            the Lifeline Roads Improvement Project Additional Financing Two (LRIP-
            AF2) were aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2009-
            12, which emphasized that “the road network is of particular importance for a
            landlocked country with partly closed borders. Investment and operating costs
            are high, and strategic interests indicate investments in both transit transport
            corridors as well as in rural or lifeline roads”.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
        approved)

  1.2.1     The Project Development Objectives (PDO) of the LRIP, which was approved
            on February 24, 2009, were:

      (i) to upgrade selected sections of the Lifeline Road Network; and
      (ii) create temporary employment in road construction.

  1.2.2     The indicators proposed for the monitoring and evaluation of the project
            included:

  (A) Project Outcome Indicators:
       Travel time improvement to drive the length of the section over current
          situation; and
       Number of person-days/month of local jobs created.

  (B) Intermediate Outcome Indicators:
        Number of km improved;
        Low cost pavement options developed, including increased use of labor;
        Capacity building through training; and




                                              3
            Vehicle procured for supervision3.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
       Indicators, and reasons/justification

    1.3.1   The Project had an Additional Financing (AF), approved on August 27, 2009,
            in which the PDO is the same as under LRIP.

    1.3.2   The results framework and the monitoring indicators were updated to monitor
            the rehabilitation of an additional 140 km of Lifeline Road Network and to
            monitor other road sector strengthening activities. The intermediate outcome
            indicators “Low cost pavement options developed, including increased use of
            labor”, “Capacity building through training”, and “Vehicle procured for
            supervision” included in LRIP were removed from the results monitoring
            reflecting a change in the focus of the institutional strengthening activities to
            address road safety. The additional indicators include:

    (A) Project Outcome Indicators:
                                                          4
         One Pilot of “safe villages” program implemented .

    (B) Intermediate Outcome Indicators:
          Road Safety Audit Manual is developed;
          Roads in good or fair condition as a share of total classified roads measured;
             and
          Share of rural population with access to an all-season road measured.

    1.3.3   The project had a Second Additional Financing (AF2), approved on July 15,
            2010, in which the PDO is the same as under LRIP.

    1.3.4   The results framework and the monitoring indicators were updated to monitor
            the rehabilitation of an additional 140 km of Lifeline Road Network and to
            monitor other road sector strengthening activities. The additional indicators
            include:

    (A) Project Outcome Indicators:
         Transport cost reductions on project roads.

    (B) Intermediate Outcome Indicators:
          New road geometric design standards developed; and

3
  In the PP, this intermediate outcome indicator was included on the Arrangements for Results Monitoring
table, but was not included on the Results Framework table.
4
  In the LRIP-AF Project Paper, this project outcome indicator was defined as an outcome indicator on the
Revised Arrangements for Results Monitoring table, but it was defined as an intermediate outcome
indicator on Revised Results Framework table. The LRIP-AF2 Project Paper confirms that this is an
outcome indicator.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

    1.4.1   The primary target groups were the rural communities living along the project
            roads that directly benefited from (i) the creation of employment for the rural
            population, and (ii) better access to social services and economic markets. The
            project improved the livelihood of the local population by creating temporary
            employment and improving rural connectivity. The project was expected to
            have a direct and indirect temporary employment generation impact. Road
            rehabilitation creates direct temporary employment for skilled and unskilled
            labor and also creates employment in the production and transportation of road
            construction materials. The overall project benefited around 945,000 persons
            living along the project roads and nearby communities, as planned. The LRIP
            benefited 203,000 persons, the LRIP-AF 216,000 persons and the LRIP-AF2
            540,000 persons5.

    1.4.2   The secondary groups of beneficiaries include MoTC, ARD, and the local
            construction industry. The project strengthened the capacity of MoTC and
            ARD to manage their road assets including road safety and road asset
            management considerations and improved efficiency by promoting lower cost
            rehabilitation options and the use of international design standards. Moreover,
            the project helped local construction industries weather the economic crisis6
            and improve their technical skills, by emphasizing the role of technical
            supervision done by an international consultant company as an instrument for
            technology and knowledge transfer.

1.5    Original LRIP Components (as approved)

    1.5.1   Component 1: Rehabilitation of the Lifeline Road Network (US$30.0
            million including contingencies): This component was expected to
            rehabilitate approximately 100 kilometers of the LRN. The road sections were
            located in seven Marzes. The component included: (i) civil works for road
            rehabilitation; (ii) consultancy services for the construction supervision, design
            author supervision 7 , and technical auditing of rehabilitation works; (iii)
            updating the original Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)-financed 2007
            designs and environmental documents; and (iv) project implementation
            expenses including, but not limited to, funding project audits, incremental


5
  These values were estimated by the TPIU during the project implementation.
6
  Nine of 23 contractors did not have any other contracts than those offered under the stimulus package and
the rural roads contracts accounted for 22 percent to 27 percent of the gross revenue of all the contractors
benefiting from the program.
7
  According to the legislation of the Republic of Armenia, a fee of up to 0.6 percent of the construction
costs was paid to the original designers to ensure compliance with the designs, as well as updating of
designs to reflect any changed field conditions.

            operational implementation costs and additional costs for intensified project
            supervision.

    1.5.2   Component 2: Technical Assistance (US$0.4 million including
            contingencies): The project was expected to include technical assistance for
            strengthening ARD capacity, including but not limited to: (i) a study to review
            low cost pavement options for Armenia to explore options for different
            pavement types and ways to increase labor based activities; (ii) updating
            designs for approximately 100 kilometers of LRN roads for a potential future
            project; (iii) procurement of a vehicle for field supervision; and (iv) related
            training.

1.6    First Additional Financing Components

    1.6.1   The LRIP was approved on February 24, 2009 and became effective on April
            10, 2009 with a Credit (Credit: IDA-4549-AM) amount of Special Drawing
            Rights (SDR) 16.1 million (US$25.0 million equivalent). An additional loan
            amount of US$36.6 million was approved on August 27, 2009 to finance the
            scaling up of the project’s activities through rehabilitating an additional 140
            kilometers of the LRN. There were no changes in the PDO and the results
            framework and the monitoring indicators were revised to reflect the increased
            project scope and attention to road safety activities. There were no changes
            applicable to the institutional arrangements, financial management, and
            disbursement arrangements. The closing date was extended by one year, from
            December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011.

    1.6.2   Component 1: Rehabilitation of 140 kilometers of selected sections of
            lifeline roads (US$43.93 million, including contingencies). The LRIP-AF
            expected to rehabilitate in total 29 sections of lifeline roads in seven Marzes.
            This component included: civil works for the roads rehabilitation; supervision
            of the works; design supervision; technical auditing of rehabilitation works;
            and project implementation expenses included but not limited to, funding
            technical and financial audits, monitoring and evaluation, and incremental
            operating costs. This component financed the “safe villages” pilot program,
            which supports rural communities in implementing road safety measures
            recommended by road safety audits and the National Road Safety Strategy8.
            The “safe villages” pilot program supports the villages selected on a demand-
            driven basis in installing road safety measures, especially around schools, as
            required by a road safety audit. To be eligible for funding, villagers must
            prepare and start implementing their own road safety campaigns. The LRIP-AF
            provided necessary support to villagers.

    1.6.3   Component 2: Technical assistance (US$1.7 million). This component
            financed capacity development in alternative pavement designs (based on the
            recommendations of the study under the original project); the procurement of
            laboratory and testing equipment, and vehicles for supervision; training; and
            designs for future investments. This component supported the development of
            a road safety audit manual to provide checklist for assessing design and
            inspecting project sites throughout different phases of a road project, including
            assessment of existing roads.

1.7    Second Additional Financing Components

    1.7.1   Another additional loan amount of US$40.0 million was approved on July 15,
            2010 and became effective on November 15, 2010 to finance the scaling up of
            the project activities through rehabilitating approximately 190 kilometers of the
            LRN. There were no changes in the project’s PDO. The results framework and
            the monitoring indicators were revised to reflect the increased project scope
            and attention to road asset management activities. There were no changes to
            the implementation arrangements. The closing date was extended by two years,
            from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2013 to allow for all activities to be
            completed and fully cover the defect liability period for two years.

    1.7.2   Component 1: Rehabilitation of approximately 190 kilometers of selected
            sections of lifeline roads (US$45.8 million, including contingencies). The
            LRIP-AF2 expected to rehabilitate about 190 kilometers of lifeline roads. This
            included 178 kilometers of road sections for which rehabilitation works were
            suspended around 2008 due to a shortage of donor funding, and a 12 kilometer
            section of the H46 road to the town of Halidzor. This component included civil
            works for the rehabilitation of the roads; supervision of the works; technical
            auditing of rehabilitation works; and project implementation expenses
            including, but not limited to, funding technical and financial audits, monitoring
            and evaluation and incremental operating costs.

    1.7.3   Component 2: Technical assistance (US$1.1 million). This component was
            expected to finance the development of new road geometric standards,
            feasibility studies and designs of future investments and the procurement of
            road data collection equipment.

2     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

    2.1.1   Project preparation built upon the road rehabilitation program funded by
            MCC. The preparation of LRIP was initiated in late 2008 with a very tight
            preparation and implementation schedule in response to the emergency request
            from GOA. The LRIP Board Approval was on February 24, 2009, the Project
            Agreement was signed on February 26, 2009 and ratified by Parliament on
            March 17, 2009, and the project became effective on April 20, 2009.


                                              7
            Procurement of all civil works have been completed by April 2009 and
            contracts awarded by May 19, 2009. Contractors mobilized promptly and
            started works immediately after the project effectiveness. The project
            preparation and design were built on the experience with the program for
            rehabilitation of LRN roads funded by MCC9. The LRIP roads were selected
            based on their: (i) having been identified as priorities in the MCC program; (ii)
            located in areas facing increasing unemployment; (iii) having sufficient
            economic returns to justify the investment; and (iv) readiness to be
            implemented rapidly. Detailed designs of project roads prepared by MCC in
            2007 were reviewed and revised in light of European standards and to ensure
            consistency with actual traffic, enhance sustainability and improve road safety.
            The preparation of the additional financings was done based on current road
            condition and traffic surveys and new designs including the principles agreed
            on when the original project was prepared. The main reason behind the two
            successive additional financings in so short time was to increase the scope of
            the road works. Having two separate additional financings nearly duplicated
            the resources and efforts in terms of project preparation. The quality at entry is
            rated satisfactory.

    2.1.2   Project design tailored to an emergency project. The LRIP design was very
            simple and realistic in terms of components and involved organizations in line
            with the emergency nature of the project. LRIP had two components, which
            did not include complex activities. Because of the need to rapidly bid the roads
            and have fast disbursements (LRIP was the first of the IDA Fast Track Facility
            operations through to become effective), the project had intensive supervision
            and very close monitoring of project implementation. The main focus of the
            LRIP was to start the rehabilitation of the roads as soon as possible, maximize
            the employment generation, and improve the technical quality of the road
            works. The focus of the LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 increased to include concerns
            about road safety in Armenia and the availability of survey equipment for a
            road asset management system. The LRIP activities under the institutional
            strengthening component and later on more activities added to the same
            component under the LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 were modest and in areas where
            the project could rapidly add value to the institutional capacity of ARD. The
            institutional strengthening activities focused on: (i) adopting cost effective
            designs; (ii) improving road safety, and (iii) ensuring proper road construction
            quality 10 . The rationale for adding additional activities to the project
            institutional strengthening components during the additional financings was
            that the LRIP components were focused on quick execution of emergency

9
  The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) prepared in 2007 a Rural Road Rehabilitation Project
(RRRP) in Armenia designed to rehabilitate up to 943 km of LRN roads. However, in June 2009 the MCC
made the decision to discontinue funding any further road rehabilitation, after rehabilitating 24 km, due to
concerns about Armenia’s democratic governance.
10
   The condition of the rehabilitated roads is overall very satisfactory, particularly considering the rapid
preparation schedule. The average roughness of the rehabilitated roads is 3.1 IRI, m/km.



                                                     8
             rehabilitation works of good quality and once this was achieved there was the
             opportunity to tackle road safety and sustainability issues.

     2.1.3   The financial arrangements were simple and only involved Bank financing.
             The implementation arrangements were not complex, with the MoTC having
             the overall responsibility for implementation of the project. The MoTC
             delegated to the Transport Project Implementation Unit (TPIU) and ARD for
             the project implementation. The TPIU was established in 2000 as a state
             institution to implement World Bank financed transport projects. Currently, it
             manages International Financial Institution (IFI) funded transport projects, with
             exception of Asian Development Bank projects, and transport projects
             executed with local financing. The project was mainly implemented by the
             TPIU that was well qualified and has overseen well the project preparation and
             implementation. The project was classified through environmental screening as
             Category B. An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was
             developed for the project. Site–specific Environmental Management Plans
             (EMPs) were prepared for each project road section. No environmental
             safeguards other than OP/BP 4.01 were triggered. Overall the project has not
             faced major environmental11, social or fiduciary issues.

     2.1.4   The LRIP PDO consisted of two clearly defined development objectives. The
             LRIP had two outcome indicators corresponding to the two development
             objectives. The AFs added two outcome indicators to better measure the
             economic impact of the road works and a road safety activity. The project
             outcome indicators measured well the outcomes of the PDO. However, while
             the LRIP PP Results Framework defined the targets and stated that the
             employment generation was going to be measured in person-months, in reality
             the employment generation targets and monitoring was measured in average
             person-days/month12. The LRIP intermediate outcome indicators measured the
             number of kilometers improved and the implementation of institutional
             development activities. The project PDO did not change under the LRIP-AF
             and LRIP-AF2. The results framework and monitoring indicators were updated
             under the LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 to consider the escalation of the project
             civil works and new institutional development activities. The LRIP-AF and
             LRIP-AF2 Project Papers did not correct the typo related to the units of the
             targets measured and the monitoring of employment generation were being
             measured in average person-days/month13 and not in person-months. The typo

11
   From September 2009 to November 2010, minor issues in the area of EMP compliance and works of
drainage and sidewalks were identified and then fully addressed. Thus, during this period the
environmental rating was downgraded to moderately satisfactory.
12
   To achieve a target of 46,650 person-month of temporary employment with the rehabilitation of 430 km
of roads is unrealistic. Assuming that the labor works for six months on the rehabilitation of the project
road, results on 14.2 persons working on each kilometer of the rehabilitated roads continuously for six
months, which is very high. For similar projects, this value has a range from 2 to 5 persons per km.
13
   To proper monitor the number of jobs created during the implementation of the project; this task was
included in the ToR of the Technical Supervision consultant as a part of Supervision tasks during



                                                    9
           was identified only at the ICR stage, but the targets were met and exceeded.
           Overall, the results frameworks reflected properly the PDO and the project
           activities.

   2.1.5   Government’s commitment was strong along project cycle. The GOA
           demonstrated a strong commitment to the project through efficient project
           preparation and implementation14. The project was prepared and delivered to
           the board within two months15, which was an extremely tight and challenging
           timeline. The GOA also closely cooperated with the Bank during the
           preparation of the relevant safeguard documentation. The GOA adopted a
           Rural Infrastructure Strategy and Action Plan, and started its implementation
           prior to the project with MCC support, and thus, the GOA pre-identified
           priority LRN rural road links thereby ensuring LRIP roads would maximize
           improved basic access to rural populations. The GOA recognized the
           importance of maintaining the same TPIU team throughout project preparation
           and implementation to ensure continuity. The GOA reiterated its commitment
           to rehabilitate the LRN roads and strengthening the capacity of ARD, by
           requesting a follow-up Bank project to further rehabilitate 170 km of lifeline
           roads - the Lifeline Road Network Improvement Project (LRNIP) that was
           approved by the Board on January 31, 2013. However, the GOA was not able
           to allocate proper maintenance budget for the interstate and republican roads
           during the duration of the project. There were no co-financiers to the whole
           project16.

   2.1.6   Project risks identified. The LRIP PP defined the overall risk rating as
           moderate because of: (i) the accelerated processing timetable; (ii) potential
           construction quality risks; (iii) sector risks; and (iv) fiduciary risks. Due to the
           successful implementation of the project, the identified accelerated processing
           timetable and construction quality risks did not materialize. Given the
           emergency nature of the project and short time frame for implementation, the
           LRIP was not setup to address crucial sector issues. The corruption risk was
           identified as significant and a series of mitigation measures were incorporated,
           which were effective for the proper procurement and financial management
           processes with the project. The LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 did not identify any
           significant risks. Residual fiduciary risks were assessed as moderate based on
           the mitigation measures implemented under LRIP. The risk of the provision of




construction. The consultant included statistics on the temporary employment generation through civil
works in Monthly Progress Reports and the Completion Report.
14
   There was a period where counterpart funds flows were slow caused by quicker than anticipated
implementation of civil works. GOA reacted with large counterpart allocations to solve the issue.
15
   The identification mission was on January 10, 2009 and the Board approval was on February 24, 2009.
16
   The Bank coordinates road sector activities with other prominent partners in Armenia, such as Asian
Development Bank and European Investment Bank, but they were not involved on the LRIP.

             counterpart funding be delayed was identified and was mitigated by a dated
             covenant included in the legal agreement17.

2.2     Implementation

     2.2.1   The overall implementation progress was rated in the Implementation Status
             Results (ISR) reports satisfactory throughout May 2010, when it was upgraded
             to highly satisfactory because a study18 on employment generation found that
             there have been more jobs created, as well as more roads improved, than
             originally envisaged and in shorter time frame, and the good responsiveness of
             the TPIU and ARD to addressing the Bank's recommendations. The highly
             satisfactory rating of project implementation was maintained up to July 2011
             when it returned to satisfactory up to the end of the project. The downgrade of
             the rating was done to better reflect the fact that the TPIU became severely
             overloaded with additional responsibilities not related to any Bank-funded
             projects that started to affect its responsiveness to Bank requests, but without
             causing major implementation delays19. In addition, the lack of sufficient GOA
             funding for road maintenance was found to affect the sustainability of the
             rehabilitation works and the project covenants 20 . Thus, it was agreed to
             incorporate maintenance sustainability in the design of the LRNIP.

     2.2.2   Efficient implementation of civil works. Within eight months after the
             project became effective, about 150 km of LRN roads were rehabilitated and
             by the end of the project 446 kilometers were rehabilitated. The project
             outperformed the target (430 km) by using cost savings to rehabilitate an
             additional 16 km. In addition, local designers and contractors successfully
             applied new technologies and appropriate and cost-effective design standards
             based on international practices, which strengthened the sustainability of
             investments and improved road safety.

     2.2.3   Attention to road safety. During the project period a National Road Safety
             Secretariat21 was established, a "safe villages" program was implemented and a
             Road Safety Audit Manual was prepared. The village of Gyularabad was the
             pilot for the "safe villages" program that included civil works related to road
             traffic calming measurements, footway construction and awareness campaigns

ratification of the Loan Agreement.

   This was resolved by the hiring of additional staff by the TPIU.
20
   The GOA complied with all legal covenants or they were not yet due up to March 2012 when the legal
covenants I.A.3 and I.A4 became partially complied with up to the end of the project. These covenants
indicate that the Recipient and Borrower shall ensure that adequate budgetary resources are made available
to the road sector for maintenance of Interstate and Republican Roads in the Borrower's annual budget.

   The Armenia’s Road Safety Secretariat was established with support from a grant (TF094897) from the
Bank-administered Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF) in the amount of US$100,000. In addition to a
Director, the Secretariat has four full time staff.

             in the village, resulting in lower traffic speeds within the village. As a result of
             this pilot, the LRNIP extended the “safe villages” program to most of the
             villages covered by the LRNIP roads. The Road Safety Audit Manual report
             was completed and submitted to the Bank on June 2, 2011 and road safety
             audits are being done for all designs prepared for IFIs since 2010. Recent
             improvements in road safety can be attributed to a number of factors: (i) road
             safety is recognized as a problem by the GOA; (ii) a Secretariat for the
             National Road Safety Council of Armenia was established; (iii) seat belt
             wearing has been improved dramatically; (iv) road safety audits were
             introduced; and (v) the “safe villages” approach was introduced.

     2.2.4   Low cost pavement options. The project has taken a progressive approach to
             improve the design standards over project implementation. The project
             promoted the use of more efficient designs based on traffic and road conditions
             and paid particular attention to providing proper drainage to the roads. A study
             to review low cost pavements options and identify areas for improvements was
             programmed under the LRIP. The work started and a first draft report was
             produced, but the study was terminated on February 25, 2012, with agreement
             of the Bank 22 , due to poor performance of the Consultant. A study for the
             development of new road geometric design standards was programmed under
             LRIP-AF2, but the activity was canceled in 2011 at an early stage, before a
             TOR was prepared. The activity was canceled and funds reallocated because
             the work done on the rehabilitation designs addressed the issue of proper
             geometric design standards for Armenia. LRIP has mainstreamed the use of
             modern design standards and LRNIP designs include now the identification
             and evaluation of cheaper pavement options. LRIP financed a pilot road
             rehabilitation with Double Bituminous Surface Treatment (DBST) pavements23,
             which is a less expensive technical solution compared with traditional Asphalt
             Concrete pavements. In addition, the pavement layers used for Asphalt
             Concrete rehabilitations are now being designed adopting international
             standards resulting in reduced thicknesses 24 and costs savings; and gravel
             pavements are being considered a valid option for low volume roads. Therefore,
             there has been real progress in the use of more efficient design standards in

22
   The objective of the study was to review existing standards in Armenia and identify areas for
improvement. The Bank agreed that the bidding for this contract did not have to be re-launched and the
unspent amount used to finance capacity building activities for ARD/MOTC on designs standards because
the identification of lower cost options was already achieved through the project.
23
   The use of DBST was piloted on two sections covering 16.5 km of roads. The contract includes
rehabilitation, routine maintenance and winter maintenance. The DBST pavement of a small section (1 km)
that was rehabilitated with DBST was damaged by alcohol/acid from trucks waiting to serve a wine factory,
but this is considered an isolated issue. Overall the quality of the DBST pavements is satisfactory after
observing the road condition after two winter seasons.
24
   The Republic of Armenia Construction Norms IV-11.05.02-99 for reconstruction, used before the project,
calls roads with less than 1,000 AADT for two asphalt concrete surface layers of 3 cm and 6 cm, on top of
a 4 cm bituminous base, which is on top of additional subbase layers from 8 cm upwards. With project
support, now according to the traffic of the roads, only one asphalt concrete layer may be used with a
thickness as low as 4 cm, representing substantial savings.

             Armenia and the overall quality of the designs of rehabilitation works in
             Armenia was greatly improved with support from the project.

     2.2.5   Mid-term review. A mid-term review was not required for LRIP because the
             lending instrument was an Emergency Recovery Loan. The lending instrument
             for the LRIP-AF and ARIP-AF2 was Specific Investment Loan. No formal
             mid-term review was carried out for the project, though the 2011 supervision
             missions carried out more in-depth review of the project.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

     2.3.1   M&E Design. The overall M&E function was the responsibility of TPIU since
             the start of the project. The TPIU relied on reports of the construction
             supervision consultants to monitor the physical works and outcomes in terms
             of travel times, road roughness and employment generation. Quarterly and later
             semiannual reports on implementation progress and monitoring indicators were
             submitted to the Bank. The Results Frameworks consisted of a list of outcome
             indicators and intermediate results for monitoring progress and outcomes. The
             design included sufficiently appropriate specific indicators for each
             component, and covered physical works as well as implementation of
             institutional development activities. The indicators were simple to collect.

     2.3.2   Two sector indicators 25 were introduced in 2009 as per Bank institutional
             requirements in the ISRs. However, while the Bank Core Sector indicators are
             measured in percentage, the project indicators were defined to indicate only if
             measurements are being done (Yes or No). The Results Framework (RF) was
             updated under the LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 to reflect additional roads and
             changes to the project activities. The indicators were appropriate to measure
             the PDO. The PDO objective to upgrade selected sections of lifeline road
             network was measured by the project outcome indicators “travel time
             reductions on project roads” and ”transport cost reductions on project roads” ,
             and the objective to create temporary employment in road construction was
             measured by the project outcome indicator “number of person-days/month of
             local jobs created”. The intermediate outcome indicators were used to monitor
             the project activities. The intermediate outcome indicator “New road geometric
             design standards developed”, introduced under the LRIP-AF2, was not
             achieved because the activity was canceled. The intermediate outcome
             indicators “Low cost pavement options developed, including increased use of
             labor”, “Capacity building through training”, and “Vehicle procured for
             supervision”, defined on the LRIP RF were removed from the RF on the LRIP-
             AF.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

25
  Two indicators were added: (i) Roads in good or fair condition as share of total classified roads measured,
and (ii) Share of rural population with access to an all-season road measured.

     2.4.1   Environmental Safeguards. The project was classified as Environmental
             Category B, with minor expected negative impacts on the environment. In
             compliance with the World Bank OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, a
             framework Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed at the
             project preparation stage and site–specific EMPs were produced for each
             individual road selected for rehabilitation. The framework EMP was disclosed
             and consultations on environmental aspects of the Project implementation were
             carried out. Site-specific EMPs were discussed with local communities
             residing close to road sections to be rehabilitated to ensure that those most
             directly affected by the project could — by voicing their opinions and
             suggestions — increase the quality and efficiency of the designs, and minimize
             negative impacts of construction and operation of the roads. Site-specific
             EMPs were included into bidding documents and incorporated into contracts
             for the provision of works to make adherence to the proposed mitigation
             measures mandatory for contractors. Suggestions from local communities —
             such as provision of additional accesses and sidewalks within settlements —
             were incorporated into designs. Safeguard compliance was rated as
             “satisfactory” for most part of the Project life. During the September 2009
             supervision mission, minor shortfalls were identified in compliance with the
             requirements of EMPs, and in the quality of arranging drainage infrastructure
             and sidewalks. Thus, the environmental rating was downgraded to "moderately
             satisfactory". An Action Plan was prepared to address outstanding issues and to
             enhance the capacity of contractors and supervisors with regards to
             environmental performance and monitoring. Detailed instructions were
             provided to improve the quality of sidewalks and drainage systems. As a result,
             the environmental rating returned to "satisfactory" during the November 2009
             supervision mission upon confirmation that the Action Plan had been fully
             implemented and the minor issues identified earlier had been adequately
             addressed. The project's environmental category and safeguard policies
             triggered originally for it remained the same for LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2,
             because the project continued to provide support to rehabilitation of the
             existing roads.

     2.4.2   Social Safeguards. The roads selected for rehabilitation were entirely on
             public land and no resettlement or land acquisition was involved in any of the
             sites. This was confirmed through careful review of designs and visits to all
             project roads. Based on the experience with the LRIP implementation, the
             grievance mechanisms and beneficiary communications of the LRNIP were
             improved to promote bottom-up accountability and transparency, and
             encourage stakeholder feedback26.



26
  New communication tools are included such as new roadside billboards, complains telephone number
and handling procedures, and official letters to community leaders.



                                               14
     2.4.3   Procurement. LRIP was prepared under the OP 8.00 and for which various
             procurement policy exceptions were allowed. The LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2
             followed standard Bank procurement procedures. Annual procurement post
             reviews confirmed that all procurement activities related to works contracts
             were carried out satisfactorily. The Bank observed that the number of bids per
             Lot decreased over the years27 in part due to the increase in the cost per Lot28.
             A key aspect is the fact that the road transport market has been limited
             throughout the past five years. As a result, only a limited number of contracts
             are awarded each year. This affects companies when it comes to prove similar
             past experience. In addition, the uncertainty associated to the future (contracts
             are for one year or least), does not create incentives for investments in
             equipment.

     2.4.4   Financial Management. The Financial Management (FM) arrangements at
             TPIU, including planning and budgeting, accounting, financial reporting, funds
             flow, external auditing, and staffing remained satisfactory and acceptable to the
             Bank during preparation and implementation of the project. TPIU has adequate
             internal controls in place. The level and timelines of government counterpart
             contribution (GCF) was satisfactory, except for FY2010 when some delays in
             GCF were observed due to delayed approval of the project budget. TPIU is in
             compliance with the financial covenants. Particularly, adequate FM
             arrangements under the project were maintained. The project’s annual audited
             financial statements with the auditors’ unmodified opinions were always
             received on time. The project IFRs have always been received on time and
             were almost always acceptable to the Bank.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

     2.5.1   The maintenance of the project roads is under responsibility of ARD and the
             Marzes. ARD uses five-year performance based contracts (PBC) for all routine
             maintenance works but payments are determined annually based on budget
             available. The budget allocation for maintenance of the lifeline roads is
             insufficient to cover all the needs. The next Bank involvement on Armenia in
             the transport sector is the LRNIP, which was built on the success of previous
             engagement. Its PDO is to improve access of rural communities to markets and
             services through upgrading of selected lifeline roads, and to strengthen the
             capacity of the MoTC to manage the lifeline road network. This would be
             achieved by: (i) improving about 170 km of lifeline roads, including road
             safety features piloted under LRIP, (ii) the institutional strengthening of MoTC

27
   The first 25 Lots of LRIP had an average number of bids per Lot of 3.0 and a minimum number of bids
per Lot of 2. The first year program of LNRIP had seven Lots with an average number of bids per Lot of
2.1and a minimum number of bids per Lot of 1.
28
   The length of average Lots has been increasing, from 3.7 km in 2009 up to 12.7 km in 2012; average cost
also has been increasing from US$1.02 million in 2009 up to US$2.50 million in 2012.




                                                   15
            and ARD in road asset management related activities, and (iii) the
            implementation of two pilots on the use of microenterprises for basic routine
            maintenance and one pilot on performance-based contract for rehabilitation and
            maintenance. There is an ongoing policy dialog with the MoTC and the
            Ministry of Finance to address the issue of sustainable road maintenance.

3     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

    3.1.1   The PDO design and implementation of the LRIP and the AFs remain relevant
            to the Sustainable Development Program of the GOA. The PDO is closely
            aligned to the strategic objectives of the CPS for Armenia, that is,
            Strengthening Competitiveness for Post-Crisis Growth. The lifeline roads are
            referenced in the CPS Progress Report (FY09-FY13) presented to the Board in
            June 2011. The report highlights the importance of continued investments in
            lifeline roads rehabilitation in an effort to “further strengthen the CPS goals
            aiming at addressing vulnerability, while building the foundations for
            competitiveness and medium-term growth”.

    3.1.2   The designs of the LRIP and the AFs are also found relevant because their
            components are consistent with the PDO. The civil works component sought to
            contribute to the achievements of the PDO in terms of rehabilitating lifeline
            roads and generating temporary employment. The institutional components
            sought to improve the quality of road designs, improve road safety and increase
            the technical capacity of ARD. Implementation arrangements were
            appropriately chosen to facilitate the implementation of the components. The
            choice of a lending instrument for LRIP – Emergency Recovery Loan – was
            appropriate to address the urgent need of support for generation of temporary
            employment as a result of the 2008-09 financial crises. The choice of the
            lending instrument for the AFs – Specific Investment Loan – was appropriate
            to support the additional investments in the road sector and institutional
            development components.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

    3.2.1   The achievement of the PDO is rated satisfactory. The rating is based on the
            evaluation of the achievement of the PDO, its indicators and outcomes as of
            December 31, 2013. The ratings consider the two objectives of the PDO:

    3.2.2   Upgrade selected sections of lifeline road network (Fully Achieved). All
            indicators have been exceeded. In total 446 km of lifeline roads were upgraded
            under the LRIP and the AFs compared to a target value of 430 km. Travel




                                             16
             times29 were reduced by 58.5 percent compared to a target of 20.0 percent. The
             average roughness of the project roads reduced from 11.1 IRI, m/km, to 3.1 IRI,
             m/km, representing a 25.8 percent reduction in road user transport costs for
             medium trucks30 compared to a target value of 20.0 percent. If the project was
             not implemented, transport costs on the project roads would have increased by
             around 40.0 percent. The unit costs per km of the road works remained
             reasonable compared to the benefits and international benchmarks. Moreover,
             the project enabled testing less expensive solutions (DBST) for road
             rehabilitation that could be mainstreamed in the future. The non-development
             of the geometric standards did not negatively impact the achievement of this
             PDO because the use of proper geometric standards was addressed on the
             project designs.

     3.2.3   Create temporary employment in road construction (Fully Achieved). The
             indicator on employment generation was exceeded. The LRIP and the AFs
             created about 39,855 person-days/month of temporary construction jobs
             compared to a target value of 36,650 person-days/month31 , of whom 60-70
             percent were hired from local villages and 70 percent unskilled. Considering
             about US$500 paid per month to each worker, the total amount of direct
             income transfer to workers is approximately US$5.0 million in addition to
             indirect transfers not calculated here. In addition, jobs were created for
             production and transportation of construction materials32. The temporary labor
             after the completion of the project improved their technical skills increasing
             their employment opportunities. The project started the introduction of the
             concept of utilizing micro-enterprises 33 for routine maintenance of roads in
             Armenia using local labor, which could address the issue of providing
             permanent jobs to local labor.



29
   Travel times and road roughness were measured for all project roads by the road works Supervision
Consultant before the road work started and after the completion of the road works.
30
   Unit transport costs, in US$ per vehicle-km, were computed using the Highway Development and
Management Model for the ex-post economic evaluation. For a medium truck, the unit road user costs are
US$0.40 per vehicle-km and US$0.54 per vehicle-km, with and without the project respectively.
31
   To convert from average person-days/month to person-months one needs to divide by 24 (number of
labor days per month) and multiply by 6 (average number of months of employment for rehabilitation
works). Thus, 36,650 person-day/month corresponds to around 9,163 person-months and 39,855 person-
day/month corresponds to around 9,964 person-months. The achieved 9,964 person-months corresponds to
employment for 3.7 persons per km of rehabilitation works, which can be compared to the achievement of
the Georgia SLPR2 project that that created 13,431 person-months of temporarily employment (for 904 km
of rehabilitation works) or employment for 2.5 persons per km.
32
   The study “Report on Job Creation Impact Assessment” by Arsen Petrosyan financed by the Bank in
2009 indicates that for every 100 persons-months of direct employment generated by rehabilitation works,
40 person-months are created for administration and production and transportation of construction
materials.
33
   In 2010 with a PPIAF trust fund, a study on Improving Routine Maintenance of Local Roads in Armenia
was done that introduced the concept of micro-enterprises. As a result, a pilot for routine maintenance
through micro-enterprises of lifeline roads is being financed under the LRNIP.



                                                  17
     3.2.4   In addition to achieving the RF targets, the project strengthened ARD’s
             capacity to improve efficiency through implementing cost effective pavement
             designs and to improve road safety. Rehabilitation works are now designed
             according to traffic and include proper roads safety elements.

3.3     Efficiency

     3.3.1   The efficiency in achieving the PDO is Satisfactory in terms of economic
             justification. An ex-ante cost benefit analysis was done at the appraisals of
             LRIP, LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 for the proposed first year program roads. The
             ex-post analysis reevaluated the first year program roads that were rehabilitated
             under the project considering actual rehabilitation costs per kilometer and
             annual traffic growth rates from 2009 to 2013.

     3.3.2   The overall ex-post Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) (18.1 percent)
             for the rehabilitation works is slightly lower than the overall ex-ante EIRR
             (18.4 percent), but above the 12 percent threshold confirming the economic
             justification of the project (Table 1). Efficiency was affected by slightly higher
             rehabilitation costs (overall 5 percent higher than the appraisal estimates),
             which were compensated by actual traffic growth rates observed from 2009 to
             2013. Detailed economic analysis is available in Annex 3.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

     3.4.1   The overall outcome is rated Satisfactory taking into account the substantial
             relevance of the PDO and achievement of Outcome Indicators, satisfactory
             overall design rating for relevance and implementation progress, and
             satisfactory economic efficiency in achieving the PDO. The project met all its
             physical targets. Similarly, the project substantially met its institutional
             development objectives34..The summary of the assessment is provided on Table
             2.


34
   Local designers and contractors started to successfully apply new technologies and cost-effective design
standards strengthening the sustainability of investments and improving road safety for pedestrians. A road
safety audit manual was prepared and is being used by MoTC for IFI projects. A data collection unit in
ARD was established and is operational.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

     3.5.1   There was no study on poverty impacts or gender aspects undertaken during
             the preparation of the project. However, it is believed that the project
             facilitated the provision of social services and livelihood opportunities, created
             temporary jobs in construction, reduced transport costs and supported
             economic activities in Armenia35.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

     3.5.2   Notable progress was achieved in: (i) implementing new technologies and cost-
             effective design standards, (ii) improving road safety by preparing and
             effectively adopting a Road Safety Audit Manual and piloting a “safe villages”
             program that is being mainstreamed under LRNIP, (iii) strengthening the
             ARDs capacity for monitoring the network and planning and programming
             road investments through the establishment of a road data collection unit, and
             (iv) strengthening environmental and social safeguards.

      (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

     3.5.3   There were no noticeable negative impacts and on the positive side, at least
             three practices from the project – namely, road safety awareness campaigns,
             employment generation, and rehabilitated roads – have received wide
             recognition by road users and the public at large. The project has set the stage
             for the discussion on the sustainability of road maintenance in Armenia and the
             possible implementation of different roads maintenance contracts modalities,
             which are being addressed under the LRNIP36.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops



35
   Paragraph 3.6.2 presents some findings on income on the project roads found on an impact evaluation
study funded by MCC.
36
   During the implementation of LRIP, the benefits of long term area wide Performance Based Contracts
(PBC) including rehabilitation and maintenance works were presented to MoTC. The LRNIP will pilot a
three year pilot rehabilitation and maintenance contract and a pilot routine maintenance contract through
micro-enterprises. In addition, the LRNIP will finance the design of a pilot and feasibility of a PBC.

     3.6.1   A Project Social Assessment37 of the impact of the project on communities was
             financed by cost savings from the project and executed by the TPIU. The study
             was done after the completion of the project and concluded that overall the
             project was effective. The study found that as a result of the project
             implementation there is: (i) a reduction in vehicle operating costs (both
             transportation fees and vehicle maintenance expenses); (ii) increase in the
             frequency of traffic; and (iii) a significant reduction on time spent on the roads.
             However, in terms of economic investments and volume of sales of agricultural
             products, there were no statistically significant differences probably given the
             short-term period of the study. Other results are available in Annex 5.

     3.6.2   The MCC commissioned a study for the evaluation of its Rural Road
             Rehabilitation Project (RRRP)38 that included the roads financed by the Bank
             under LRIP. The study found significant impacts on household’s perception of
             road quality and their use of the roads. Treatment households were 40 percent
             more likely than households in the comparison group to rate lifeline roads as
             good or excellent. Treatment households were 19 percent more likely than
             households in the comparison group to rate transportation services as good or
             excellent. Treatment households were 20 percent less likely than households in
             the comparison group to encounter market access problems. However, the
             study found (i) no statistically significant differences of income and income-
             generation opportunities; and (ii) households did not report social infrastructure
             was more accessible. The latter probably result from the fact that household
             level incomes did not report total incomes (formal and informal) and missed
             reporting differences in incomes due to remittances, which are probably quite
             relevant in such analysis. Also, the report concludes that the analyses took
             place just after the road investments were completed and did not allow
             sufficient time for the benefits to materialize. Annex 5 gives other results.

4     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

      Rating: Substantial

     4.1.1   The risk that the achieved development outcomes may not be sustained is
             Substantial. Provision of maintenance for the rehabilitated roads is needed to
             ensure that the current good road condition is maintained over time. The GOA
             budget allocations for routine maintenance for interstate and lifeline roads have
             not been sufficient in recent years39, which compromised the sustainability of

Draft, November 12, 2013, Mathematica Policy Research.
39
   In 2012, US$24.9 million was allocated to routine maintenance for 5,742 km of interstate and lifeline
roads, and no funds were allocated to periodic maintenance. Such budget allocation for maintenance of
lifeline roads was insufficient, resulting in only half of the roads receiving winter maintenance and 26
percent of lifeline roads under the responsibility of the Marzes receiving summer maintenance.



                                                  20
             the project investments. Moreover, the Marzes often lack the financial
             resources and capacity to conduct routine maintenance. The lack of
             sustainability of road maintenance due to insufficient budget allocation is a
             chronic challenge in Armenia and it puts at great risk the sustainability of the
             road improvements carried out under the project. Notwithstanding an important
             sign of progress is that since March 2012, the legal covenants I.A.3 and I.A4
             became partially complied with up to the end of the project. These covenants
             indicate that the Recipient and Borrower shall ensure that adequate budgetary
             resources are made available to the road sector for maintenance of Interstate
             and Republican Roads in the Borrower's annual budget. To address the issue of
             sufficient maintenance requires better assessment of the maintenance needs and
             options for financing of the sector, including for the roads under the
             responsibility of the Marzes. The project set the stage for the discussions on
             more sustained funding for road maintenance and concrete initiatives are
             underway toward that sustainability such as the a study on road sector
             sustainability 40 , the development of a road asset management system and
             survey equipment, and the consideration for new contacting methods like
             output and performance based road contracts and micro-enterprises for
             maintenance.

     4.1.2   With regard to sustaining the policy and institutional reforms, positive steps
             were taken in 2009 on Road Safety, with the approval of a National Road
             Safety Strategy, the creation of the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) and
             the adoption of a five-year action plan. The NRSC has the mandate to
             implement the action plan and has received support from the Bank41 to improve
             coordination activities, strengthen capacity in road safety design within ARD
             and support approved road safety programs. However, the weak institutional
             arrangement of the Road Safety Secretariat, as a result of which this Secretariat
             is currently underfunded, understaffed, and almost dysfunctional to date,
             compromises the sustainability of the road safety program.

5     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry – Satisfactory

     5.1.1   The Bank’s performance during the preparatory periods was satisfactory with
             regard to strategic relevance and approach, technical, financial and economic
             analysis, and paying adequate attention to fiduciary and safeguards

40
   The Road Financing Study, included on LRNIP, has as objectives to recommend: (i) the level of
financing needed for maintenance and rehabilitation works; (ii) how all types of roads and types of road
works should be financed; (iii) how all types of roads and all types of road works should be managed; and
(iv) an appropriate legal framework for managing roads.
41
   A grant from the Bank-administered Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF) and LRIP have supported the
road safety action plan implementation.



                                                   21
          arrangements. The Bank’s performance during the preparation of the LRIP was
          particularly highly satisfactory. The LRIP was approved under a very tight
          schedule and winter conditions, which required an experienced team, strong
          leadership and practical decisions. The LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 followed a
          more normal preparation schedule, and thus the team focused more on the
          institutional issues. Insufficient foresight was observed on part of the Bank for
          not having combined the two AFs into a single AF to reduce the processing
          burden.

(b) Quality of Supervision – Satisfactory

  5.1.2   The quality of the supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank had been fully
          engaged with the client during the implementation of all planned activities,
          paying due attention to technical and institutional development issues. The
          frequent supervision missions during the first year of the project were
          appropriate considering the emergency nature of the project. A formal mid-
          term review of the AFs could have strengthened the project implementation.
          The Bank team was responsive to the TPIU and ARDs request for advice. The
          LRIP and the AFs had five task managers in five years, linked to Bank staff
          moving to other regions, while the TPIU manager remained the same during
          this period, which indicates insufficient Bank planning. The high number of
          task managers did not impact much the successful implementation of the
          project, but had an impact on the borrower’s perception of the Bank’s
          organization. Having different task managers helped change the focus of the
          project from emergency response and engineering aspects to road safety and
          maintenance contracting options and sustainability aspects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance - Satisfactory

  5.1.3   Overall, Bank performance is rated Satisfactory. The Bank assisted the
          Borrower in the adequate preparation of the project. The Bank also actively
          addressed implementation problems through proactive and intensive
          supervision.

5.2   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance – Moderately Satisfactory

  5.2.1   The GOA demonstrated a strong level of commitment and ownership toward
          the project design, preparation and implementation. The concept of the LRN
          was defined by the GOA before the project preparation. The GOA responded
          in a positive manner when the issues of counterpart funding, EMP compliance
          and adequate staff of the TPIU were raised by the Bank. However, the GOA
          did not fully ensure that adequate budgetary resources are made available to
          the road sector for maintenance of Interstate and Republican Roads in the
          Borrower's annual budget, which compromises the sustainability of the
          investments.


                                            22
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance – Satisfactory

    5.2.2     The project was implemented by a Transport Project Implementation Unit
              (PIU), which functioned well, delivered overall satisfactory project outcomes.
              The TPIU has experienced staff and knows well Bank procedures. There were
              no English language constraints. When needed, the staff of the TPIU was
              increased to cover its additional obligations. The TPIU was managed, during
              the entire period of the project preparation and implementation, by one
              experienced engineer with good knowledge of Bank and Armenian procedures.
              The TPIU handled well safeguards and fiduciary issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance – Moderately Satisfactory

    5.2.3     Considering that the performance of the GOA is moderately satisfactory, the
              overall performance of the Borrower is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. While
              its implementing agency performance is satisfactory, the impact of the GOA
              performance was considered higher than the implementing agency
              performance on achieving the project objectives.

6    Lessons Learned

    6.1.1     The Crisis and Emergencies Bank instrument and procedures offered
              advantages to assist in the Government’s situation. The project was possible
              because the GOA had pre-identified critical road links by adopting a Rural
              Infrastructure Strategy and Action Plan and started its implementation as
              conditions of adjustment credits, and availability of basic data and designs that
              only needed to be updated. The Bank assigned a very experienced project
              preparation team, mobilized international experts quickly and provided
              extensive supervision during implementation. Incremental improvements were
              made during project implementation adjusted to the current conditions (for
              example: move to more efficient designs) because of the phased approvals. The
              project used technical supervision as a means of technology transfer and
              project monitoring by employing for construction supervision an international
              consultant who had a local-sub-consultant and encouragement for collaboration
              by ARD between the supervision consultant, technical auditor and contractors.
              An experienced TPIU regularly visited contractors to oversee works and was
              supportive of the adoption of new technologies.

    6.1.2     The lessons learnt from implementation of the project are:

            (i)    road investments can support temporary employment generation and
                   provide quick economic support to rural areas;
            (ii)   incremental improvements can be made during project implementation
                   (e.g., move toward more efficient designs) if done step by step and
                   adjusted to current conditions;



                                               23
            (iii)  road safety audits can be successfully mainstreamed to be undertaken on
                   construction and rehabilitation works when there is Government
                   ownership;
            (iv)   there is a need to develop in-house capacity of the road administration so
                   design engineers and contractors can be properly supervised;
            (v)    strengthen the technical capacity of local engineers and contracting
                   capacity is needed to implement new technologies.
            (vi)   on emergency projects, make use of “walkover” surveys to help detect
                   and address design oversights, as they can be on projects that need to be
                   prepared quickly;
            (vii) the project should construct pavement trial sections before introducing
                   new pavement technologies;
            (viii) support for road safety programs are easily obtained from communities,
                   which consider road safety a major concern;
            (ix)   technical assistance activities, which require revision of standards or
                   practices should always be designed with close collaboration between
                   international and local consultants to avoid international consultants
                   working without benefiting from local experience;
            (x)    periodic maintenance funding is critical for the sustainability of
                   investments for gravel roads where grading and gravel resurfacing are
                   needed to maintain proper levels of service as observed on project gravel
                   roads;
            (xi)   there is a need to review the post-qualification requirements, contracts
                   sizes, unit rates, and disclosure requirements for rehabilitation works to
                   increase the competition level; and
            (xii) many TTLs during project implementation should be avoided by better
                   Bank planning.

    6.1.3     The project showed that to obtain support from local communities where
              possible, the designs should provide sidewalks in build-up areas (roadside strip
              development) and villages to improve access to public facilities and ensure
              pedestrian safety, and the project should promote local employment on the
              rehabilitation works. The use of cement concrete guardrails (labor intensive
              construction method) was experimented during the first year implementation of
              the project but this method was not mainstreamed due to its negative effect on
              snow removal activities.

7    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

    7.1.1     The Borrower submitted to the Bank its Completion Report (CR) on April 22,
              2014. Please refer to Annex 7. The Borrower submitted on June 5, 2014
              clarification comments on the content of the Bank’s ICR that were
              incorporated in the final ICR. The Borrower concurred with the Bank’s
              proposed rating (Satisfactory) of the Project Outcome, but contested the
              “moderately satisfactory” rating for Government Performance that resulted in


                                               24
            the “moderately satisfactory” rating for overall performance of the Borrower,
            indicating that the MoTC gradually increases budgetary resource allocation to
            the routine maintenance of Interstate and Republican Roads42. The ICR reflects
            the budgetary resource allocation to routine maintenance during the overall
            project period.

   In the approved 2014 state budget the Interstate and Republican Roads routine maintenance financing is
AMD 5.675 billion or 106.4% of 2013 actual financing (AMD 5.334 billion). According to the 2015-2017
Midterm Expenditures Framework, the following financing is projected for the routine maintenance of
Interstate and Republican Roads: 2015 - AMD 7.635 billion (143 percent of 2013 financing); 2016 - AMD
8.197 billion (153.6 percent of 2013 financing); and 2017 - AMD 8.863 billion (166.2 percent of 2013
financing).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The Cost-benefit analysis done at appraisal for the LRIP, LRIP-AF and LRI-AF2
was carried out using the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4),
which simulates highway life cycle and vehicle operating conditions and costs for
multiple road design and maintenance alternatives. The main economic benefits of the
project are vehicle operating cost and travel time savings. The main economic costs of
the project are road rehabilitation and maintenance costs. The vehicle operating cost
savings were estimated using the consumption of resources for each component of
vehicle operating cost based on the surface condition and geometry of each road section,
and the characteristics of representative vehicles. Travel time savings are obtained when
road improvements lead to an increase in vehicle speeds, and thus reducing the journey
times of passengers. The ex-post evaluation of the project was done also using the HDM-
4 model, but taking into account current rehabilitation costs and traffic growth rates from
2009 to 2012.

2.      For the LRIP, 12 road sections were evaluated at appraisal yielding an overall
EIRR of 20.3 percent43. For the LRIP-AF, 15 road sections were evaluated at appraisal
yielding an overall EIRR of 16.2 percent. For the LRIP-AF2, 8 road sections were
evaluated at appraisal yielding an overall EIRR of 21.1 percent. Some road sections
evaluated at appraisal were dropped from the project or were merged to form lots. Table
1 presents the road sections evaluated at the appraisals and that were included in the
project44. For these road sections (160 km totaling US$44.27 million or 38 percent of the
project costs), the overall ex-ante EIRR is 18.4 percent, the average traffic is 342 vehicles
per day and the average upgrading cost is US$276,788 per km.

  The LRIP PP indicates an overall ERR of 20.3 percent, but the examination of the ERRs computed per
road section indicate that this value is not correct. The correct overall ERR for the LRIP is 17.9 percent if
one takes into account the ERRs per road section presented on Table A9.2 of the PP and weights them by
the investment. Table A9-2 presents 13 road sections, but links 8 and 9 are the same road section; thus, one
has 12 road sections.

44
  The EIRR for LRIP-AF (15.9) on Table 3 is different from the PP EIRR (16.2 percent) because it takes
into consideration only the 12 road sections included in the project, instead of the 15 road sections
presented at the PP.

3.      Table 2 presents the actual rehabilitation costs per road section and the ratio
between the actual and appraisal cost per km. The actual costs per km of the LRIP were
on average 96 percent of the appraisal estimates, the actual costs per km of the LRIP-AF
were on average 126 percent of the appraisal estimates, and the actual costs per km of the
LRIP-AF2 were on average 97 percent of the appraisal estimates. Overall, for the actual
153 km, the actual costs per km increased by five percent compared with the appraisal
estimates. In addition, the table below shows the actual traffic in 2013 and the annual
traffic growth since appraisal. The traffic on the LRIP roads increased by 3.5 percent
from 2008 to 2013. The traffic on the LRIP-AF roads increased by 5.6 percent from 2009
to 2013. The traffic on the LRIP-AF2 roads increased by 6.3 percent from 2010 to 2013.

 4.      Table 5 presents the length and actual costs of the project roads. The average
 rehabilitation cost per km of the LRIP, LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2, is US$243,215 per km,
 US$326,316 per km, and US$231,427 per km respectively, with an overall cost of
 US$261,431 per km. LRIP-AF unit costs are higher because all LRIP-AF roads required
 rehabilitation, while some LRIP-AF2 roads required periodic maintenance.

6.      The LRIP appraisal economic analysis was done considering the relation between
annual traffic growth rates and estimated annual GDP growth rates. It was assumed at
appraisal that the annual growth rate in 2009 was zero, and the annual growth rates for
2010, 2011 and 2012 were 4.4, 5.5 and 6.6 percent per year respectively (6.6 percent after
2012). The LRIP-AF and LRIP-AF2 lowered the estimated annual growth rates to 1.65
percent in 2010 and 5.5 percent onwards. The table below presents the estimated annual
traffic growth rates and the actual traffic growth rates found on the lifeline roads since
2008. The ex-post economic evaluation was done with the actual traffic growth rates
from 2008 to 2013 and assuming an annual traffic growth rate of 5.7 percent after 2013
considering that the IMF46 predicts an average annual growth in GDP of 5.2 percent per
year from 2013 to 2018.

7.      The ex-post economic evaluation was done with the actual costs per km and
actual traffic growth rates. The table below shows the ex-post economic evaluation
results. The overall ex-post EIRR for the three projects is 18.1 percent that is slightly
lower than the overall EIRR based on the appraisal estimates (18.4 percent). The ex-post
EIRR of the LRIP-AF (13.8 percent) is lower than for other projects due to the higher
upgrading costs per km, but still is higher than 12 percent. The ex-post economic
evaluation shows that the original project and the two additional financings were
economically justified.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      A social assessment qualitative 47 done after the completion of the project,
evaluating the LRIP’s impact on communities concluded that overall the project was
effective. The survey was conducted in eight rural communities of eight regions of
Armenia with a total number of 48 focus groups and in-depth interviews. The study
found that as a result of the project implementation there is: (i) a reduction in vehicle
operating costs (both transportation fees and vehicle maintenance expenses); (ii) increase
in the frequency of traffic; (iii) a significant reduction of time spent on the roads, and (iv)
communities residents have been involved in the construction works as a temporary labor
force with reasonable remuneration. However, in terms of economic investments and
sales of agricultural products, there was no significant growth in the population’s living
standards observed in the short-term period of the study

2.      The previous condition of the roads included in the survey was estimated
extremely bad by all beneficiaries, with high presence of potholes and absence of
pedestrian sidewalks. Before road rehabilitation, community residents visited hospitals
only in extreme cases, while after road rehabilitation; access to hospitals is not an issue
anymore. During project design, public awareness meetings were held with project
implementers, local authorities and community representatives. In general, women’s
involvement in public awareness meetings was very low. In all communities some part of
the residents, mostly man, has been involved in the construction works as labor force.
Taxi traffic has grown in all beneficiary communities and in some communities fees for
taxi services have been reduced twice. The rehabilitation of roads had positive and
negative impact on private entrepreneurs who own stores. The positive impact is the
growth in the number of supplier of goods; the negative impact is the decrease of resident
clients due to benefits of new created opportunities to access larger markets outside of
their communities.

3.       Most of the survey respondents indicated that as a result of the rehabilitation an
increase in volume of agricultural product sales is not noticeable from the point of view
of profits partly due to disproportional inflation, which did not allow having a significant
increase in revenues. Among the beneficiary communities, there is no any noticeable
change in agricultural and non-agricultural incomes. As a result of the rehabilitation,
traffic increased and the communication between friends and relatives became easier. The
road rehabilitation has enhanced not only connections within communities but also
connections with regional centers and other cities. Reduction in travel time to health
infrastructure reduced health hazards and risks. Both passengers and drivers have
mentioned that a result of the rehabilitation works stress was reduced. The project had
positive impact on those communities where schools were located nearby reconstructed
roads by solving the issues of: (i) economic problems with eroded clothes and shoes; (ii)
daily problems with collected dirt on clothes and shoes; (iii) personal safety problems;

and (iv) education problems displayed by being late or absent from the lessons. The
compliance of LRIP with beneficiaries' needs was highly valued by all participants in the
survey. Good condition of the road was considered as one of the most important pillars of
community life and is one of the basic preconditions for raising living standards of the
community. Survey participants indicated that all residents of the community benefited
from the program, especially indicating the drivers and entrepreneurs.

4.      LRIP rehabilitated lifeline roads that were identified under the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) project titled “Rural Road Rehabilitation Project (RRRP)”
defined in 2007. The RRRP was designated to rehabilitate up to 943 km of lifeline roads,
but the project was canceled48 after rehabilitating only 24.4 km. Thus, the LRIP took over
the rehabilitation of priority lifeline roads not rehabilitated under the RRRP. Despite the
low number of kilometers rehabilitated under the RRRP, the MCC commissioned a
study49 for the evaluation of its rural roads project. The study included the roads financed
by the World Bank under LRIP.

5.      The data for the RRRP evaluation came from the Integrated Living Condition
Survey (ILCS). The ILCS is an annual national household survey fielded by the National
Statistics Service of Armenia. The MCC provided funding and increased the sample size
and longer questionnaire from 2007 to 2011 to facilitate the RRRP evaluation focusing
on lifeline roads communities. The treatment group included communities served by 27
roads rehabilitated under RRRP or LRIP, and the comparison group included
communities served by 29 roads included in the RRRP plans, but were not ultimately
rehabilitated with MCC or World Bank Financing.

6.      The study found significant impacts on household’s perception of road quality
and their use of road links. Treatment households were 40 percent more likely than
households in the comparison group to rate regional roads as good or excellent (see table
below). Treatment households were 19 percent more likely than households in the
comparison group to rate transportation services as good or excellent. Treatment
households were 20 percent less likely than households in the comparison group to
encounter market access problems. The study also observed a positive and statistically
significant impact on the likelihood of utilizing roads for shopping or visiting relatives
and other purposes (16 percent of difference) other than getting to work or buying and
selling agricultural projects. However, the study found: (i) there were no marked impacts
on use of roads for income-generating reasons; (ii) households did not report that social
infrastructure was more accessible; and (iii) there were no observed impacts on income
within the short evaluation time frame.

   In June 2009, the MCC Board made the decision to discontinue funding any further road rehabilitation
under the RRRP due to concerns about Armenia’s democratic governance.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Part I. Project Objectives:
The Project development objective (PDO) of the Lifeline Roads Improvement Project
(LRIP) for Armenia was to upgrade selected sections of the lifeline road network (LRN)
and create temporary employment in road construction. In response to the request of the
Government of Armenia (GoA), the original LRIP (US$25 million equivalent IDA
Credit) was prepared under the "IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track Facility"
utilizing OP 8.0, Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergencies, in order to mitigate the
impact of the global financial crisis in Armenia. The LRIP was approved by the Board on
February 24, 2009, and became effective on April 10, 2009. The Project Development
Objective of the LRIP is to upgrade 100 km selected sections of the LRN and create
temporary employment in road construction. On August 27, 2009, the Board approved
the First Additional Financing (LRIP-AF1) in the amount of US$36.6 million (IBRD-
7751-AM). The LRIP-AF1 aimed to scale up the project's activities through rehabilitating
an additional 140 km of the LRN. The LRIP-AF1 became effective on November 20,
2009. On July 15, 2010, the Board approved the Second Additional Financing (LRIP-
AF2) in the amount of US$40.0 million (IBRD-7936AM). The LRIP-AF2 aimed to scale
up the project's activities through rehabilitating an additional 190 km of the LRN. The
LRIP-AF2 became effective on November 15, 2010. In overall, the project aimed to
rehabilitate about 430 km of the LRN and create 36,650 person-months of
temporary jobs in road construction by the closing date, i.e. December 31, 2013.

These objectives were achieved through the implementation of the following
components:

Credit No 4549-AM (original project)

Component 1: Rehabilitation of the Lifeline Road Network (US$30.0 m including
contingencies): Rehabilitation of approximately 100 km of the LRN. The road sections
are located in the seven different regions of the country and their lengths vary between 1
and 14 km. The component includes: (i) civil works for road rehabilitation; (ii)
consultancy services for the construction supervision, design author supervision, and
technical auditing of rehabilitation works; (iii) updating of the original MCA-financed
2007 designs and environmental documents to meet the requirements of the project; and
(iv) project implementation expenses including, but not limited to, funding project audits,
incremental operational implementation costs and additional costs for intensified project
supervision.

Component 2: Technical Assistance (US$0.4 m including contingencies): Technical
assistance, including but not limited to: (i) a study to review low cost pavement options
for Armenia which will explore options for different pavement types and ways to
increase labor based activities; (ii) updating of designs for a potential future project; (iii)
a vehicle for field supervision; and (iv) related training.

Part II. Level of objective achievement

The DPO overall targets for the upgrading of the LRN and creating temporary
employment were achieved exceeding expectations. About 446 km of the LRN were
rehabilitated and about 40,000 person-months of jobs have been created, allowing the
Government to swiftly mitigate the negative impact of the financial crisis. Basic access to
social services and livelihood opportunities has been improved by connecting rural poor
to the main road network. Reduction of travel time by about 58.5 percent (in average)
along with improved riding quality on the project roads resulted in substantial reduction
of transport cost of road users and helped to reduce poverty among the rural population in
Armenia.

The Project has been recognized for achieving outstanding results receiving the WB
Vice-President Award for Improving Live of People in Europe and Central Asia.

The Project Social Assessment (conducted in December 2013) has also confirmed the
Project beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the Project objectives achievement:

      roads rehabilitation resulted in vehicle costs, travel time and road accidents
       significant reduction, traffic and agricultural products sells increase, improved
       road safety and reliable access to social services (schools, hospitals, polyclinics,
       community centers)



                                                                                                      43
      communities residents have been involved in the construction works as a
       temporary labor force with reasonable remuneration.

The overall compliance of the LRIP objectives with the needs of the beneficiary
communities and their residents was highly appreciated.

Part III. Output by Components

Rehabilitation of the Lifeline Road Network selected road sections:

   a) Technical aspects:
The expected outcome of the rehabilitation of approximately 430 km of roads were
achieved exceeding expectations. The project has mostly repaired road pavements on
existing alignments and some structures and proper drainage and safety facilities have
been installed. About 446 km of the selected sections of the LRN were rehabilitated with
satisfactory quality. This was confirmed by the Technical Supervision Consultants and
independent Technical Auditors. Share of roads in good or fair condition after project
made 51.5% compared to the 32.2 % before the project. According to the Project Social
Assessment, the all beneficiaries have described condition of the Project roads as follows:

      before the Project: "deteriorated, bumpy, without sidewalks and safety guardrails
       roads in very poor conditions"

      after the Project: "nice road providing riding comfort and improved safety,
       especially where the “safe village program” implemented".

Some pictures showing condition of the Project roads before and after the Project
are provided in the Annex 7-1.

   b) Environmental and social management:
The Project had positive impact on the livelihood of local population and generated about
40,000 person-months temporary employment providing important sources of revenues.
The “safe village program” through supporting small road safety civil works (improved
pedestrian crossings, speed management and proper horizontal and vertical signage)
combined with awareness campaigns at the community level was implemented in several
villages to improve safety for vulnerable road users.

The all civil works were conducted within the existing Right-of-Way and did not require
land acquisition or result in any other impact to trigger the Bank’s Social Safeguard
Policy (OP 4.12).

The project was classified as Environmental Category B. The Environmental
Management Framework was disclosed in country and then a stakeholder consultation
meeting was held. Site-specific Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) were prepared

                                                                                        44
for each road section prior to the beginning of works and disclosed to, and discussed with,
local stakeholders. The EMPs were included as part of the bidding documents to ensure
that contractors are aware of their responsibilities.

The Technical Supervision consultants monitored compliance with OP 4.12, EMF and
EMPs throughout the project implementation. Some minor environmental issues related
to the disposal of construction wastes noted and were followed by swiftly implemented
remedial measures.

                                1. Capacity strengthening in road sector

The Project had also positive and sustainable impact on the capacity of the Ministry of
Transport & Communication of Armenia (MoTC) and overall road sector:

      a data collection unit was established in the Armenian Roads Directorate State
       Non-Commercial Organization (ARD), equipped with the Falling Weight
       Deflectometer (procured under the Project), road roughness measurement and
       traffic counting devices, and regularly collects data for road surveys and works
       prioritizations

      the Transport Projects Implementation Unit State Institution of MoTC (Transport
       PIU) and ARD, local design consultants as well as many local construction
       industries have gained experience on the cost effective pavement designs, job
       creating technologies and “safe village program” and continue to apply this
       experience under the ongoing the WB and GoA funded road projects

      a Road Safety Audit (RSA) Manual was developed and training was delivered to
       the Transport PIU, ARD, Traffic Police and local design consultants engineers.
       RSA Manual is being used for IFIs funded road projects.

The Project Performance Indicators matrix is provided in the Annex 7-2.

Part IV. Assessment on the Borrower’s Performance

                               1. Assessment on the Government Performance
The commitments of the GoA towards achieving project objectives were fulfilled during
the project implementation. The GoA has carried out the Project through the Ministry of
Transport & Communication of Armenia (MoTC) in accordance with the provisions of
the respective Financial Agreement for original project and the Loan Agreements for two
additional financings. The use of standards recommended by the European Committee for
Standardization on design and construction of roads and highways (in addition to the
national standards) in the design and construction of road works under the Project was
permitted. The adequate budgetary resources were made available for the Project in due
time as the GoA counterpart funding. The GoA has cleared the all contracts above USD 1
million without delays.

                                                                                       45
2. Assessment on the Implementing Agency
   Performance

Project implementation agencies: The MoTC, as a policy making authority for the
transport sector, had the overall responsibility for implementation of the LRIP and has
delegated the Project management and day-to-day implementation to the Transport PIU
and the ARD (only technical aspects for period 2009-2010). The Project was
successfully implemented by the Transport PIU. A proper internal control system capable
of providing timely information and reporting on the Project was put in place. Project
financial and implementation progress reports were always submitted on-time and in
proper format. Project independent auditors always expressed clean (unqualified) opinion.
The WB regular supervision missions, financial management and procurement reviews
have not identified any significant weakness and overall Implementation and Project risks
were rated as Low or as Moderate. According to the Project Social Assessment, the
Project activities and the effectiveness of the carried out activities and the Project
management were highly estimated by almost all beneficiaries.

V. Lessons Learnt

The following lessons were learnt from the implementation of the LRIP:

      moving towards more efficient design standards taking into consideration the
       traffic on the roads and the current conditions to determine the most economically
       viable technical solution

      incorporation of routine summer and winter maintenance in contracts for
       rehabilitation of road sections as a potential for more efficiency gain in road
       works

      successful “Safe Village program” (combination of traffic calming measures,
       footway construction and an education program in the village school) has
       received enthusiastic support from the local mayor, the school headmasters and
       people in the village, and should be taken on board in the designs for road where
       they pass through villages
