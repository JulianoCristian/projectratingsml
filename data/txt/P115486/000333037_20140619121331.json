satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the crisis and emergencies bank\n            instrument and procedures offered advantages to assist in\n            the Government's situation. The project was possible\n            because the GOA had pre-identified critical road links by\n            adopting a rural infrastructure strategy and action plan and\n            started its implementation as conditions of adjustment\n            credits, and availability of basic data and designs that\n            only needed to be updated. The Bank assigned a very\n            experienced project preparation team, mobilized\n            international experts quickly and provided extensive\n            supervision during implementation. Incremental improvements\n            were made during project implementation adjusted to the\n            current conditions (for example: move to more efficient\n            designs) because of the phased approvals. The project showed\n            that to obtain support from local communities where\n            possible, the designs should provide sidewalks in build-up\n            areas (roadside strip development) and villages to improve\n            access to public facilities and ensure pedestrian safety,\n            and the project should promote local employment on the\n            rehabilitation works. The use of cement concrete guardrails\n            (labor intensive construction method) was experimented\n            during the first year implementation of the project but this\n            method was not mainstreamed due to its negative effect on\n            snow removal activities."}, "docdt": "2014-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
