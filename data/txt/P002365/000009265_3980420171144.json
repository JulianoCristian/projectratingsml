{"cdata!": "The Urban Development and\n            Decentralization Program Project supports the Senegalese\n            Decentralization Policy and aims at gradually shifting\n            responsibility and accountability -in terms of delivery and\n            maintenance of urban services, and infrastructure- to\n            municipalities. The program's objectives are to (a)\n            improve the financial and organizational management of\n            municipalities; (b) improve the programming of priority\n            urban investments; (c) rationalize and simplify the\n            financing of urban investments; and (d) upgrade basic\n            infrastructure in urban and some rural communities. The\n            first principal component consists of building the capacity\n            of central and local governments through (1) implementing a\n            Municipal Adjustment Program (MAP) and (2) supporting\n            activities aimed at providing an enabling environment for\n            these MAPs to take place (such as training, fiscal reforms\n            study, etc.). The second principal component consists of\n            physical investments like building, rehabilitating, and\n            maintaining public infrastructure, facilities, and services\n            under the responsibility of local governments (roads,\n            drainage, and lighting; education and health facilities;\n            socio-collective facilities; administrative and technical\n            buildings; revenue-generating facilities; environmental\n            sub-projects; and rehabilitation of historic buildings)."}, "docdt": "1997-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
