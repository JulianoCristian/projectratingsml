connections for one million\n            inhabitants, by extending sewerage interceptors and by\n            providing stormwater drainage to periodically flooded areas\n            where 0.4 million people live. It will also increase the\n            utilization of installed water production capacity by\n            connecting households with about 1.1 million people to the\n            water supply system and by extending the primary\n            distribution network. In addition, the project will support\n            studies to determine the least cost methods of disposing of\n            Bogota's sewage and reducing flooding and pollution in\n            the Bogota River. About 43 percent of the estimated\n            beneficiaries of the project are expected to be among the\n            poorest 40 percent of the population. The project faces no\n            special risks and, even if the delays and cost increases are\n            encountered, will yield a high return on the investments."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
