About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroup assesses the programs and activities of the World Bankfor two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second,to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operationsthrough field work. In selecting operationsfor assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requested assessments; andthose that are likely to generate
importantlessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWBRatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated Objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possibleratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possibleratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

         This i s a ProjectPerformanceAssessmentReport(PPAR) on three projectsfor
Cambodia:the TechnicalAssistance (TA) Project(Cr.2664), the StructuralAdjustment
Credit(SAC) (Cr. 33230), andthe DemobilizationandReintegrationProject (Cr. 35640).
         The TA projectinthe amount of US$17millionwas approvedon December 6,
1994andbecameeffectiveonMarch23,1995. The projectwas restructuredin1999and
closedonDecember31,2001,six monthsafterthe originalclosing date. TotalIDA
disbursementsat closing were US$l5.97 million.
         The StructuralAdjustment Credit(SAC) inthe amount of US$30 millionwas
approvedonFebruary29,2000 andbecameeffectiveonMarch28,2000. The
Governmentof Swedenprovidedco-financingofUS$5millionequivalent. The creditwas
disbursedinthree tranches. The first tranche ofUS$10millionwas disbursedonMay3,
2000. The "floating" tranche was releasedon September 11,2001. The secondtranche
was disbursedandthe projectclosedonDecember31,2003. Boththe IDA credit andthe
Swedishgrant were fully disbursed.

         The Demobilizationand ReintegrationProject inthe amount ofUS$18.4million
was approvedonAugust 23,2001 but didnotbecomeeffectiveuntilJuly 1,2002. Total
projectcostwas estimatedto beUS$42millionat appraisal. The projectwas co-financed
bythe GovernmentsofJapan,NetherlandsandSwedenandthe WorldFoodProgram. A
findingofmisprocurementonanIDA-fundedcontract ledthe Bankto suspendthe credit in
mid-2003,call for repaymentofUS$2.8milliondisbursedagainstthis contract, andimpose
sanctionsonindividualsandfirms. The project closedonDecember31,2004, the original
closingdate. After therepayment,net disbursementsfiomthe IDA creditwere only
US$0.7millionandtotal disbursements of donor andgovernmentcounterpart funds were
US$18.6million.
         The PPARis basedon a review of relevantBankdocuments, includingICRsand
ICRReviews, andinterviewswithBankstaff. An IEGmissionvisitedCambodiain
February2005 to conducta CountryAssistanceEvaluation(CAE) ofthe Bankprogram
duringthe periodFY99-December31,2006 andto reviewthe outcomes ofseveralIDA-
fundedprojects, includingthe three projects coveredinthis PPAR. The missionreviewed

Summary

1.      This PPARfor three IDA credits to Cambodia-a TechnicalAssistance (TA)
project, a StructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC), and a Demobilization and Reintegration
project (D&R) -was prepared inparallel with a Cambodia Country Assistance
Evaluation (CAE). These projects are reviewedtogether because all three dealt with
aspects o fpublic sector financial management(PFM). However, the TA project andthe
SAC also addressedmany other policy and institutional issues. All three projects
suffered from flaws inproject designand supervision, and weak government commitment
to certain project objectives. The TA project and the D&Rproject outcomes were rated
unsatisfactory inICRs and ICRreviews, andthe SAC outcome was ratedmoderately
satisfactory.

2.      The TA project was the second IDA commitment after lendingbeganin 1993. It
hadtwo main objectives -improving PFMand establishing an enabling legal
environment for private sector development (PSD). Project designwas deliberately
flexible giventhe Bank's limitedknowledge o f Cambodia's capacity-building needs. In
PFMthe project planned for TA, primarily to the Ministry o fEconomy and Finance
(MEF), inbudgeting,macroeconomic analysis and forecasting, public debtmonitoring,
public investmentmanagement, and funding for the establishment o fthe Economic and
Finance Institute (EFI) training facility. Inlegal reform the project plannedfor a legal
training needs assessment, a diagnostic study o f all economic and financial laws, and
publication o f an official legaljournal. Other components plannedor added during
implementation included studies o f options for reducing civil service numbers, state-
owned enterprise (SOE) reform, electricity tariffs andregulations, a stock exchange, TA
inforest management, andassistanceinstrengtheningcapacity inthe water supply sector.

3.      The "umbrella" nature o f the project, with many separate andunrelated
consultancies, made supervision difficult for both Bank and Government, and some o fthe
advisers provedunsatisfactory. Project implementationwas disruptedby an attempted
coup in 1997 and lack o f a full-timetask team leader (TTL) in 1997-99. Inmid-1999 the
project was declared a problem project, a new TTL was appointed, and an extensive
reviewwas carriedout. The project's scope was reduced, with government agreement, to
concentrate on continued support for capacity-building inthe MEF and EFI; public
administrationreform includingpreparation o f a civil service census and assistance in
preparingfor military demobilization; and a scaled back legal reform effort. While the
project did buildsome capacity inthe MEF and EFI, little was achieved incivil service
reform or legal/judicial reform.

4.      The PPARagreeswiththejudgment o fthe ICR and ICRreviewthat the outcome
o fthe TA project was unsatisfactory. Riskto development outcome i sjudged moderate
overall butsignijkant for civil service and legal/judicial reforms. Bank and borrower
performance are rated unsatisfactory, consistent with the findings of the ICR. While
Bank supervision and performance o fthe PMUimproved duringthe final three years o f
project implementation, the record over the first four andone halfyears - inadequate
supervision, poor performance by several consultants, weak project managementby the

                                                 xii


PMU, misuseo fproject funds, andlack o f government commitment to some reforms -
justifies these ratings.

5.      The SAC continued Bank support for PFMreforms, includingrevenue
mobilization, expenditure management, andreorientation o fpublic expendituresfrom
defense and security to the social sectors andrural development, plus reforms inforestry,
public administration, including a review o f government functions andthe civil service
census, registrationo f all military personnel and implementationo f a pilot demobilization
program, andpreparation o f a governance action plan. The SAC, like the TA project,
was broad-gauged, covering rather unrelated activities inseveral sectors. It was expected
that further adjustment operations would follow, andpreparatory work beganin2004, but
the first operation (a PRGO) was not approved untilJuly 2007.

6.      The SAC was overburdened with conditionality -50 performance indicators,
eleven conditions o f Boardpresentation, and thirteen tranche conditions. Project closing
was extendedfive times due to delays inmeetingtranche conditions. The SAC was rated
unsatisfactory on implementationprogress inMarch 2001 andfrom June 2002 to                          .
September2003. The credit finally closedwithdisbursemento fthe second tranche on
December 31,2003, buttwo Board waivers were requiredfor second tranche release.

7.      The SAC contributedto strong macroeconomic performance, some limited
improvements inpublic expenditure management, significant reorientation o fpublic
expendituresfrom defense and security to health, education andrural development which
has beensustained since the SAC closed, resumption o f import pre-shipment inspection,
and modest improvements inthe Law on Investment (LOI), but little or no progress
duringthe SAC period inrevenue mobilization, customs reform, or inpublic
administration and governance.' The overall outcome i sjudgedmoderately satisjiactory,
inlargepartbecauseofcontinuedimprovementsinPFM, especially expenditure
reorientation. Riskto development outcome i sjudged moderate overall, but low for
public expendituremanagement, including expenditure reorientation, low to moderate for
revenue mobilization, but signifzcant for forestry reform, public administration reforms
andthe other elements o fthe SAC program. Bank performance isjudged satisfactory and
borrower performance moderately satisfactory.

8.      The principal objective o fthe Demobilizationand Reintegration@&R)
Projectwas to facilitate a significant reductioninthe size o fthe armedforces to free up
budgetresources for the social sectors and rural development. Estimates o fthe size o f
the army as ofthe late 1990svaried widely; there was strong evidence that payroll
numberswere beinginflated and pressure was buildingonthe Government from donors,
includingthe Bank, to reduce defense expenditures. Underthe TA project, following the
 1999restructuring, and through a post-conflict grant, the Bank provided support for a
military census and for preliminary designo f a demobilizationprogram. The Bank's
Post-Conflict Unit ledthis work. The staff involved withproject preparationwere aware
o fthe many warnings about falsification o fthe census numbers, but did not challenge the


   While the SAC conditions on forestry and demobilization were met, these were linked to investment
projectswhich had unsatisfactory outcomes. For information on the outcomeo fthe Forest Concession
Managementand Control Project see World Bank, PPAR ReportNo. 40125, June 27,2007.

result. Despitethis flawedbeginning, apilot demobilizationprogramfor 1,500 soldiers
was successfullycompletedin2000. Basedonthis pilot, a demobilizationprogramfor
30,000 soldierswas plannedfor 2001-2002. The US$42 millionprogram, supportedby
the Bank andother donors, includedhealth screening, economic assistance, vocational
trainingandcounseling. The IDA credit fundeda large partofthe economicassistance
as well as TA for the implementingagency, the Council for the Demobilizationofthe
ArmedForces(CDAF). The first phasedemobilizationof 15,000 soldierswas completed
in2001, beforethe Bankprojectbecameeffective.

9.       The Bank'sD&R project facedproblemsfromthe outset. Effectivenesswas
delayedelevenmonths.2 Projectmanagementhadbeentransferredfromthe Bank'sPost-
Conflict Unitto the ResidentRepresentative,but with the extremelylimitedstaffingof
the ResidentMissionat thetime the Representativewas too overburdenedto deal
effectivelywiththis project. Inmid-2002anewTTL was assignedfromthe EAP Social
Developmentunit. Inlate 2002 losingbidders on anIDA-fundedcontract complainedto
the Bank that the winningbidder shouldbe disqualified. An investigationby the Bank
resultedina declarationofmisprocurement, suspensionofthe project, call for repayment
of US$2.8 milliondisbursedby IDA againstthis contract, and sanctions against firms and
individuals. The Governmentdisagreedstrongly withthe Bank's conclusionsand
actions, arguingthat only the consultingfirm employedby the Governmentshouldbe
heldliable.

10.      The D&R project closedonDecember31,2004. Althoughsome donor hnding
for the programcontinued,the plannedsecondphaseofthe demobilizationprogramwas
not carriedout. Onthe positiveside, the limiteddemobilizationcarriedout contributedto
a shift inbudgetresourcesfrom defense andsecurityto the social sectors andrural
developmentwhichhas beensustained, andthe Governmenthas maintainedtraining
programsfor soldiersdemobilizedinthe first phasewith support from JICA. However,
giventhe serious performanceissues inthis operation, the outcome rating for the Bank's
programremainsunsatisfactory andBankperformanceis ratedmoderately unsatisfactory
while borrowerperformanceis ratedunsatisfactory. However, giventhe positivetrends
inreductioninmilitaryexpendituresandintrainingdemobilizedsoldiers, the riskto
developmentoutcome is ratedmoderate.

11.     The mainfindingsand lessons fromthese credits are:

    0   A substantialshare ofdonor aidto Cambodiahas beenallocatedto TA, but results
        havebeengenerally disappointing. Too muchTA hasbeendonor-drivenwithout
        adequate Governmentinvolvement. This is changinginthe Bank-ledsupport for
        the PFMRP.
    0   All three projectssufferedfromflaws inproject design. The TA project andthe
         SAC were overly broadinattemptingto resolvetoo manyproblemsthrougha
        singleoperation. The SAC hadanexcessivenumberofconditions whichdelayed
        effectiveness andtranche releases. The D&R projectfailedto heedthe public

complaints about falsification ofthe number o f military personnel and corruption
inhandlingthe militarypayroll.
The Bank was unrealistic inits assessment o fthe Government'scommitment to
many o fthe reforms inpublic administration and governance supported by these
projects.
The Bank should have carried out more intensive supervision o f fiduciary issues
inthe IDAportfolio. However, after the findingsthat ledtheBankto declare
misprocurement inthe D&Rproject, the subsequent Fiduciary Review and the
ensuingINT investigations, the Bank has nowtaken appropriate steps to address
these problems.
The Bank delayed for almost ten years before buildingup anadequate field office
presence, contrary to the lessons o f experience inpost-conflict countries. This
had an adverse effect on the Bank's ability to supervise complex projects, to
maintainregular contact with government officials, andto work effectively with
other donors. This deficiency has beencorrected since 2003.

POLITICAL BACKGROUND

1.1      Cambodia, withan estimated population o f 14million in2005, has experienced
armedconflict over many decades including four years o f genocidal rule by the Khmer
Rouge from 1975to early 1979. This prolonged conflict resulted inthe deaths oftwo to
three millionpeople andvirtually destroyed the country's social, economic andpolitical
infrastructure. Low-level armedconflict continued duringthe 1980sand most o fthe
1990sdespite a UN-brokered peace agreement, a peace-keeping force underthe United
Nations Transitional Authority inCambodia (UNTAC), a new constitution and an elected
coalition government in 1993. The political situation stabilized following an aborted
coup attempt in 1997, withthe dominance ofthe rulingCambodianPeoples' Party
steadily increasing through national elections in 1988 and 2003 and local elections in
2002. While democratic processeshave beenestablished and some decentralizationo f
governmental authority to provinces a i d communes i s underway; the administration
remains highly centralized and authoritarian. The public sector i s characterized by weak
institutions and humanresources and widespread problems ingovernance.

ECONOMICAND SOCIAL BACKGROUND

poorest countries inthe world, with an estimated per-capita income below US$250.

most other low-income countries (LIC). (See Table 1below.) However, overall

economic performance over the past twelve years has beenquite strong. Annual GDP
growth has averaged above 8 percent since 1994andmore than 10percent over the past
three years, raising per capita incomes incurrent dollars to US$450 in2005 and over
US$500 (estimated) in2006. The highrate o f economic growthhas contributed to a

1.3        The international donor community has responded to Cambodia's overwhelming
social andeconomic needs with substantial inflows o f aid. During 1994-2005 Cambodia
has received over US$5 billioninofficial development assistance (ODA), or an average
o f~ $ 4 2 millionper year, but rising to almost US$490 million on average since 2000.

Annual aid disbursementshave beenequivalent to 12percent of GDP or US$33 per
capita, compared to an average for LICUS countries o fUS$18.4 per capita.

1.4        While progress inrecent years has been significant, economic growth to date has
beennarrowly based ontourism and garmentmanufacture for export, and related
construction activity. Despite the observed reductioninpoverty incidence, the rural
areas, where 85 percent o fthe population and 90 percent o fthe poor are located, have
laggedbehindindevelopment. Agricultural roductivity is low and output varies greatly
from year to year due to weather conditions?Most health indicators have improved
significantly and more rapidlythan inLICs on average, but still remainlow. School
enrollments have risen faster than the LIC average and narrowedthe gap with other EAP
countries. While significant improvements have beenmade ininfrastructure, with strong
support from the Bank and other donors, Cambodia still lags well behindits neighbors in
availability o ftransport, electricity, water and sanitation services.

FY94. Following the UNinterventioninthe early 1990sand the election o f a new
government in 1993, the Bank moved rapidly to complete a review o fthe country's
economic and social needs' and prepare import-support and TA credits. Since thenthe
Bank's program has evolved through four country assistance strategies (CASs) from the
mid 1990sto 2005. The objectives o feach CAS are showninBox 1below. Although

2.       Technical Assistance Project

BACKGROUND
2.1      Inlate 1992, the Government calledonthe Bankandthe Ih4Ffor assistancein
developing an economic reform program, indicating that its highestpriority needs were
for assistance inreducing the budgetdeficit by controlling current expenditures and
increasing revenues, restructuringthe civil service to improve the efficiency o fpublic
administration, reducing subsidiesto state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through reforms and
privatization, managing a rapidly expanding public investmentprogram, andmanaging
foreign debt. The Bank provided an InstitutionalDevelopment Fund(IDF) grant for the
rehabilitation o fpublic finances to support development o f budget and Treasury
management systems and also for preparation o fthis TA project, andthe IMFprovided
TA andfinancial support through a Systematic Transformation Facility. The TA project
was preparedinparallel with IMF assistance intax administration and monetary
management and a UNDPproject inadministrative reform.

OBJECTIVESAND DESIGN
2.2      The primary objectives o fthe TA project were: (i)      buildingcapacity for public
financial management(budget preparation andmonitoring, macroeconomic analysis and
forecasting, public investmentprogramming, external debt management) inthe Ministry
o f Economy and Finance (MEF), other ministries, provincial governments, andthe
Council for the Development o f Cambodia (CDC), and establishment o f a training
institute -the Economic and Finance Institute(EFI);' and (ii) andjudicial reforms
                                                                    legal
(LJR)to improvethe environment for private sector development (PSD), includingan
assessment o f legal training needs, establishment o f a legal reform unit and legal advisory
services for key government institutions, supporting regular publication o f laws,
regulations andjudicial decisions inan Official Gazette, and support to the Council o f
Jurists. The project's objectives were consistent with the Government's priorities -to
stabilize and liberalize the economy and stimulate private investment. The breakdown o f
project costs at appraisal called for 50 percent o fproject funds to be allocated to P F Mand
18 percent to public administration and legal assistance, with the balance for trainingo f
all types andproject management.

IMPLEMENTATIONEXPERIENCE
2.3      The TA project was an "umbrella" project intendedto cover a wide spectrum o f
capacity-building requirements, butwith identification o f specific components to be
determined duringimplementation, given the Bank's limitedknowledge at appraisal of
Cambodia's highest priority needs.' With this flexible approach the project took on many


7 Support for the CDC, which coordinatesdonor aid and privateinvestment, was insteadprovidedthrough
a Japanese grant.
* The Bank establishedamulti-yearpartnership betweenthe EFIandthe World Bank Institute,and the
MEFguaranteed support for the EFIfor threeyears following completiono fthe TA project.
  Initiallysome considerationwas givento preparingseveral separateTA projects for differentsectorso f
the economy, butit was decidedthat this would havebeenevenmore challenging for the Bank and
Governmentto supervise than asingle omnibusoperation.

diverse activities, bothwithin and outside its primaryobjectives. Fundingwas
subsequently provided for a legal adviser to assist the MEF inmaking preparations for
Cambodia's membership inASEAN; support to the National Bank o f Cambodia to
complete restructuring and modernizing o f its accounting system; assistance to the CDC
inpromotingprivate foreign investment; consultants to designa strategy for privatization
andliquidation ofpublic enterprises; capacity-building inthe water supply sector; a study
o f electricity sector regulation, pricing, finances, and operation andmaintenance; a study
o fprospects for a stock exchange and for a securities commission; and a study on options
for reducingthe size o fthe civil service. A significant change inproject scope occurred
in 1996whenproject funds were allocated to finance a study o fthe forestry sector which
ledto the Bank's Forest Concession Management andControlproject.

2.4      Duringthe first four years o f implementation(1995-98) the project encountered
numerous problems. The large Project Management Unit (PMU)set up by the Bank did
not provide effective management despite the substantial resources allocated to project
administration. While the employment o f some qualified returningCambodian
expatriates as consultants was a rational step, consultant remunerationwas highly
variable and generally well above prevailingmarket rates andnorms established by other
donors. Insome cases the quality o f consultants' output was poor andthe time taken to
complete tasks was inordinately long; some advisers remainedinplace long after their
original terms o freference hadlapsed. There was excessive reliance on substitution-type
TA with insufficient attentiongivento training o f Cambodian counterparts. Training was
not systematically evaluated, makingit difficult to determine its effectiveness.
Effectiveness was also reduced by weak inter-ministerial coordination and the absence o f
strong government ownership, outside the MEF, for many o fthe reforms introducedby
the project. Finally, the project was adversely affected bythe July 1997 political
disturbances. Many Government officials, includingthe project manager and some o fthe
Cambodian consultants on the project, left the country.

2.5      The breadth ofproject activities substantially increased the complexity o f
supervisionfor boththe Bank and Governmentandthe Bank was handicapped by the
absence o f staff in-country to oversee project implementation."         While a few o fthe
Bank's early Cambodia projects were managed by staff based inneighboring countries,
the TA project Task Team Leader (TTL) was based inBank Headquarters. Frommid-
1997 untilMay 1998 the TTL had other responsibilitieswhich left little time to supervise
the project, and inMay 1998 the TTL transferred from the Region and was not replaced
untilApril 1999. While all supervision reports during 1995-98 ratedimplementation
progress sati$actory, subsequent review found these ratings unjustified.l1




lo  The Bank hadonly a liaisonofficer inCambodiainthe mid-1990sanddidnot opena ResidentMission
with a ResidentRepresentativeuntil 1999.A second internationalstaffmemberwas added in mid-2001but
the Bank didnot beginbuildingupthePhnomPenhoffice staffuntil2003.
    The Bank's2000 CountryReviewstatedthat "The World Bank is exposed to considerablereputational
riskbecauseofinadequatesupervision [ofthe TA project], primarilybeforeMay 1999." Surprisingly,
other Bankratings, ratedquality ofsupervisioninthe first phaseofprojectimplementationsatisfactoly, but
rated "realism ofprojectperformanceratings", marginal.

2.6     A newTTL was appointed inApril 1999. Following anAprilNay 1999
supervision missionthe project was declared a problemproject for the first time. The
mission found some progress inbuildingcapacity for macroeconomic management in
MEF, butuncovered all o fthe above-mentioned problemsas well as others. Serious
errors were found insome consultants' contracts, credit proceeds had beenutilized for
ineligible expenditures,the systemo f allowances paidto civil servants attendingtraining
courses and seminars was abused, the inventory o f fixed assets was inadequate, and
record-keeping was confused.12 As a result o fthese findings the PMUwas reorganized,
MEF staffthat were paid from the PMUbudgetbut didnot belongto the PMUwere
reassigned, some consultant contracts were declared ineligible for IDA financing, andthe
Bank calledfor immediatereimbursemento fall ineligible expenditures. The project was
restructured; components were reduced innumber and regrouped under: (a) continued
support for macroeconomic management and capacity-building inthe budget and
economic policy departments o fthe MEF;I3(b) public administration reform -a census
andregistrationo f civil servants anddesigno f a military demobilization program; and (c)
a scaled-back legal andjudicial reform effort - support to the Ministryo f Commerce for
development o f a commercial code andrelated regulatory activities.             -

2.7     Project supervision, including the role o fthe PMU, improved over the last two
andone halfyears o fproject implementation. However, many o fthe problems could not
be overcome andthe project remainedaproblem project untilmid-2000. Knowledge
transfer from consultants to counterparts remainedan issue. The census o f civil servants
was not completed prior to project closing. Analysis o foptions to reduce the size ofthe
civil service through a voluntary departure program proved to be a highly sensitive issue.
The Government didnot respond to the consultant's recommendations, and no action was
takento implementthe program. Furthersupport for civil service reform inthe second
phase o fthe project was cancelled. InLJR a Legal Reform Unitwas established in 1997
and a diagnostic study was completed and discussed ina workshop in2000, but little
action was taken. The consultant's report on a legal andjudicial reform strategy was
judgedunsatisfactory by the Bank. There were continuing delays incompletiono f a
Commercial Code and implementingregulations. Consultants were employed to advise
the MinistryofCommerce on laws on commercial enterprises and on commercial
contracts, butthe work was not completed. At closure disbursementsfrom the project
account were US$15.97 million out o fthe US$17million IDA credit. Giventhe shifting
objectives over the life o fthe project, significant modifications were made inthe
allocation o fproject funds; PFMabsorbed 40 percent rather than 50 percent of the total,
public administrationand LJR 25 percent, despite the lack of progress, and forestry
reform, not includedinthe initial project design, used 11percent o f total expenditures.

Departmentbutthis was not done.
l3 Supportwas addedfor introductionofa VAT; howeverthe consultancyserviceprovidedwasjudged
inadequateandthe IMFpickedupthe work.

2.8      This project paralleledthe efforts o fmany donors to rebuildCambodia's severely
weakened administrative capacity through massive infusions o f TA.l4Assessments o f
donor-funded TA inCambodia have found that results were far short o f expectation^.'^
Most projects, including the Bank's, were donor-driven inidentification and designwith
government having little or no role inselection o f advisors, resultinginweak government
ownership. The Government was also at fault inoften asking consultants to complete
assignments themselves rather than training local counterparts. All such projects were,
and still are, adversely affected bythe disincentive o flow government salaries for all
civil servants.16 To deal with this problem most donor agencies, includingthe Bank, set
upPMUs instead o fimplementingprojects through normal governmental structures,
which underminedgovernment's internal capacity and institutions rather than
strengtheningthem."

2.9      Following closure o fthe TA project the Bank continued, with some lags, to
support most o fthe policy reforms and capacity-building needs addressedinthat project.
Ongoing support for public administration, civil service reform andLJR has been
provided primarilythrough the FY02 Economic andPublic SectorrCapacity Building
project (EPSCB) andrelated Trust Funds. The EPSCB project i s a small (US$5.5
million) LILYa bridgingoperation on which work started before the TA project closed,
intendedto fill a gap inTA support untila more comprehensive roject couldbe
designedwhich would incorporate lessons from the TA project." It is focused primarily
on broadpublic administration and governance reforms -draftinga medium-term
strategy for civil service reform, training needs assessments, managerial training, and
studies o fthe labor market, government functions, compensation policy, decentralization,
and mechanisms to reduce staffing which were to be carried out under an Institutional
DevelopmentFund(IDF) grant. The EPSCBP has experienced numerous delays and has
beenrated unsatisfactory on implementationprogress over mucho f its life. Only one o f
the five studies has beencompleted, results o fthe earlier civil service censushave not
beensharedwith the Bank, and the Government has beenresistant to the Bank's
proposals for compensation reform. Inaddition to the EPSCB the Bankproposedpublic
sector reform and LJR projects inthe FYOO CAS but these didnot materialize. InFY03 a
trust fund grant was proposed for a legal/judicial needs assessment but this was not

    Almost US$2 million fromthe creditwas allocatedto construction of aGlobalDevelopmentLearning
Networkwhich is not discussedinthis report. In2005 the projectwas restructuredwith US$1million
reallocatedfrom the GDLNto training.

Bank does notprovidesupport for any specific componentsofLJRat the presenttime.
Withrespectto broadcivil servicereformsandLJRthe Bank andGovernmenthavenot

emphasisonPFM, exceptfor limitedTA to MEFinbudgetmanagementand
procurementreformunderthe EPSCBand support for expenditurereorientationunder
the SAC andthe Demobilizationproject. This was due inpartto the Government'slack
ofprogress inimplementingthe recommendationsofthe Bank's 1999PER. The Bank
didnot participateinthe TechnicalCooperationAssistance Programon Strengthening
EconomicandFinancialManagement(TCAP) undertakenduring2001-2003bythe IMF,

HIPC countries andin2004 Cambodiamet only five of sixteenbenchmarksversus an
averageof6-7 for 26 HIPCcountries.

2.11     However,the situation inPFMhas improvedsignificantlyinthe pasttwo to three
years, due inlarge partto actionbythe Bank. In2003 the Bank collaboratedwiththe
ADB andthe MEFto produceanIntegratedFiduciaryAssessment andPublic
ExpenditureReview(IFAPER). This ledto a Governmentdecisionto undertakeaPublic
FinancialManagementReformProgram(PFMRP) basedonthe recommendationsofthe

PHRDgrants for projectpreparation, for strengtheningtheNationalAudit Authority
(NAA) andfor improvingthe managementofpublicprocurement. These reformsare
also supportedby a multi-donortask force and a multi-donortrust fundmanagedby the
Bank. This programis nowproducingpositiveresultsacross a broadspectrumofPFM

differenceinthis newapproachis that donors are supportingthe Government'sprogram,
not one designedandimposedby donors; the Governmenthas definedthe objectivesand

economic data base andprepared the macroeconomic framework usedinthe PFP. The
Economic Advisory Team prepared statements o f economic and financial policies for C G
meetings, andwas involved inSAC and PRSP preparation. The External DebtUnit
developed a satisfactory debt recording and reporting service incompliance with World
Bankrequirementsanditremains adequately staffed andoperational. The project also
fundedlegal advice onthe requirements for Cambodia's accessionto ASEANandthe
WTO. While the EFIstill lacks adequate staff and depends on donor support, it
continues to provide neededtraining to MEF staff, including an important training
function insupport o fthe PFMRP. Onrevenue administration, while there were some
problems with consultants, tax experts fundedby the project assisted the MEF with VAT
implementation and administration, including draftin implementingregulations for the
Law on Taxation, and training seminars on the VAT!'          Although there was limited
progress intax administrationunder the TA project, some improvement i s apparently
now occurring underthe PFMRP. The Bank has made modest contributions to customs
administrationandadvice ontrade policy to the Ministry o f Commerce.

2.13    Inthe other broadareao f support underthe TA project-public administration
and legal/judicial reforms to create a conducive environment for PSD-the outcome has
been unsatisfactory. The project provided support for the pilot demobilization program
which was successfully completed, and financed initiation o fthe first civil service census,
which was completedafter longdelays. However, there was no progress incivil service
reorganization and little effective progress incivil service compensation untilthe
introductiono f a limitedMerit-BasedPay Initiative developed by the Bank underthe
PFMRP. InLJRthe only actions takento date have been procedural andhave not
brought about fundamental reforms inthejudicial system. Giventhis very mixedrecord
on progress against the objectives o fthe TA project, the overall outcome i sjudged
unsdisfuctory, consistent withthe findings o fthe ICR.

2.14    Relevance. The project was highly relevant inthat Cambodia desperately needed
TA inalmost all areas o f governmental activity. Itwas linkedto the country's needs
identifiedinthe Bank'sfirst economic report, andwith the country strategy set out inthe
first CAS. The project's broad objectives were consistent with government priorities for
liberalizing the economy and openingit to foreign investment.What was not factored
into the Bank's thinkingwas that a multitudeo f donors were already providing, or
preparing to provide, TA as well. Inlight o fthis the Bank could have designed a more
tightly structuredproject focused onthe Bank's areas o fcomparative advantage such as
macroeconomic management, PFM, public investmentandtrade policy. While the initial
goal o fthe project was to begina process o f long-term capacity-building, this longer-run
focus was diluted as the Bank respondedincreasingly to requests from the Government
for short-term assistance to deal with immediateproblems. As the project took on an
increasing number o fthese unrelated TA activities its relevance was weakened.

2.15    EfJicacy. It is understandable, giventhe Bank's limitedknowledge o f Cambodia
at appraisal, that project objectives could only be loosely definedinthe credit document -


2o The Value AddedTax (VAT) was introducedinJanuary 1999. The TA projectfundedexpertsto assist
inthe implementationof the VAT buttherewere irregularitiesincontract execution; as a resultthe contract
was cancelledandthe IMFtook over responsibility.

                                              11


"assist inthe transition to a market economy; help to implementthe Government's
economic reform program, strengthen the economic management team, and help put in
place the foundations for an environment conducive to private sector development."
Eventhe definition o fspecific project activities could only bepresentedinvery general
terms - "strengthenbudget preparation capacity o f MEF, strengthenbudget monitoring
and control mechanisms, define a series o foptions for reductiono fpublic sector
employment by various departure schemes." However, this vagueness, and the absence
o f any benchmarks for measuringprogress inany o fthe project components, makes it
possible to judge only insubjective terms the extent to which project objectives were
achieved. Inaddition, the achievement o f project objectives was adversely affectedby
several other factors. The broad range o f components covered by the project made it
difficult for the Bank to focus onprogress inany single area. The complexity o fthe
project worked against efforts to monitor the performance o fthe consultants delivering
training and advisory services, and, as was stated earlier, the performance o f several
consultants was inadequate, particularly incounterpart training. The Bank's limited
supervision capacity contributedto this deficiency. Also, although at the time o fproject
preparation the Bank felt that the Government's commitment to the reformprogram was
strong andbroadly shared, this provednot to be the case. The Bank over-estimated
governmental commitment inseveral sensitive areas, includingcivil service reform, LJR,
developing a reliable base-line for militarypersonnel, andthe support for P F Mreforms
outside the MEF. Also, project effectiveness was adversely affected by the political
climate inCambodia leading up to the political disturbances in 1997 and the election in
1998; the 1997 coup causedthe departure from the country o fkey project staff and
consultants, leading to a virtual halt inprogress for almost two years.

2.16    Risk to Development Outcome. The ICR ratedthe project's sustainability unlikely
primarilyonthe grounds that the capacity-building efforts supported bythe project were
still needed but could not be maintainedwithout continued donor funding. The ICR
anticipated that some future capacity-building needs might be met by the Bankthrough a
series o fproposed operations inLJR, civil service reform and training, o f which only the
EPSCB materialized. The PPAR, five years after the ICR, judges the riskto development
outcome moderate. The constraint to capacity-building inCambodia i sjudgednot to be
limiteddonor assistance, which has continuedto increase, butrather government's
commitment to sustain reform efforts. This commitment now appears to be relatively
strong inPFM, but negligible incivil service reform and LJR.

2.17    Bank and Borrowerperformance. Inproject preparationthe Bank didnot
adequately assess government commitment or capacity, and insupervisioninthe first
phase o f implementation the Bank didnot addressproblems ina timely manner.
Supervision ratings didnot reflect the true situation andthe project languished virtually
unsupervisedfor almost two years. Despitethe improvement inproject supervision
following the mid-termreview in 1999, the overall rating for Bank performance is
unsatisfactory. The ICR ratedborrower performance unsatisfactory because o f long
delays inimplementation, problems incoordination between ministriesand weak
ownership outside the MEF. The PPAR accepts these valid criticisms o fthe
Government's performance during implementation o f the TA project and concurs inthe
rating o funsatisfactory.

OBJECTIVESANDDESIGN
3.1     The SAC was inmany respects an "umbrella" project comparable to the TA
project. The broad objectives o fthe SAC were to: i)improve public resource
management, including resource mobilization2*andforestry management; ii)enhance
public sector management -expenditure reorientationandpreparatory steps for military
demobilization and administrative reform; and iii)assist government informulating and
implementinga strategy for enhancing governance and fighting corruption. Underthese
objectives the specific SAC components were:

        public resource management: revenuemobilization -improve administration o f
        the Law on Taxation (with support from FIAS), reduce exemptions incustoms
        and inthe VAT, re-introduce pre-shipmentinspectiono f imports,Zzreduce fiscal
        exemptions inthe Law on Investment(LOI), and inforestry management -
        support development o f a new forestry law, improved concession management,
        reduction inillegal logging, and forest crime m~nitoring.'~
        public expenditures -improve the budgetprocess, strengthen management o f
        public investment, improve performance o f spendingunits, reorient expenditures
        from defense and security to the social sectors and rural development, and adopt a
        Medium Term Economic Framework (MTEF) for budget forecasting on a pilot
        basis inthe Ministryo fHealth. The key problems here were that budget
        allocations were not honored, coordination betweenthe MEF and the Ministryo f
        Planning on the investmentbudgetwas weak, andministries such as Healthand
        Education didnot receive their budgetedallocations while budget overruns often
        occurred indefense, security andthe Office o fthe Prime Mini~ter.'~Also, budget
        releaseswere not spread evenly over the year but were usually concentrated inthe
        final months.
        governance and anti-corruption -complete a census o fthe civil service (which
        had not beencompletedunderthe TA project) and a functional reviewo f all
        ministries, extendthe computerized payroll system to all ministries, prepare an
        action plan for rationalizingthe size and functions o fthe civil service; registration
        o fall militarypersonnel, formulation and implementation o f a pilot
        demobilization scheme, and development o f a full demobilization program -this
        activity would contribute to expenditure reorientationunder objective (ii);        carry
        out surveys o f public perceptions o f corruption, prepare a national governance
        action plan, disseminate the planandbeginits implementation. Also, under this



   Foregonepublic revenueswere estimatedat 5-6 perecent ofGDP in 1996-1997, or morethan halfthe
amountactually collected.
"  A PSIfirm hadbeencontractedin 1995 butthe contractwas later cancelled. A Boardconditiono fthe
SAC was tenderingfor a new PSIcontract.
23 The annual revenue loss from illegalloggingwas estimatedat US$60million in 1997 or 2 percento f
GDP.
24 In 1994-98 defenseexpendituresvariedbetween3.3 percentand 5 percentofGDP, close to halfoftotal
revenue.

        headingthe Government was committed to modernize the Commercial Code
        coveringbusiness organizations, trademarks, commercial arbitration, commercial
        agency, bankruptcy, commercial contracts, product liability, andto ratify the
        convention on arbitration.

3.2     While these individual objectives were highly relevant, the SAC lacked a clear
central focus. Its main purpose seemedto be to add conditionality to achieve outcomes
that were not beingrealizedunder ongoing investment operation^.^^ Some concerns were
raised by RegionalManagement about some o fthe issues covered by the SAC -whether
the Bank should proceed with demobilization giventhe controversy over the baseline
data, and whether the SAC was the appropriate vehicle for civil service reform.

IMPLEMENTATIONEXPERIENCE
3.3     The Bankmovedexpeditiouslyto prepare the SAC, with appraisal inDecember
1999, Board inFebruary 2000, and effectiveness inMarch. The SAC was designedas a
three-tranche operationwith 50 performance indicators, eleven conditions for Board
presentation, and 13 tranche release conditions. While Bank supervision was
satisfactory, withthe same TTL throughout, headquarters supervisiono f so many
components was difficult and would have benefited from a stronger Bankpresence inthe
country. Supervisionratings were realistic and didnot hide ongoing problems.
Implementationprogress was rated unsatisfactory inAugust 2002 andMay-November
2003, due to lack o fprogress inforestry management and amending the LOI. Therewas
sufficient management oversight which benefited from the move o fthe Country Director
to the field in2001. The Bank worked withthe MEF on most SAC issues but other
branches o f government were not necessarily committedto the reforms agreed withthe
MEF, andthe MEFdidnot have sufficient leverage to compelcompliance. The SAC
would have benefitedfrom an inter-ministerial steering group and a secretariat with
representatives from affected ministriesand agencies to oversee day-to-day
implementation. There was an Inter-Ministerial High-LevelCommittee for Economic
andFinancial Policies chaired bythe MEF and composed o f several Ministers and Vice-
Ministers, but this committee did not focus attention on the SAC.

3.4      Completion o fthe SAC program requiredalmost four years with the closing date
extended five times. Delays occurred inadopting the revisedforest law and reforming
forestry management (requiring 33 months longer that originally anticipated),
rationalizing fiscal incentives for investment,improving tax and customs administration,
implementinga governance actionplan, formulating a civil service reform strategy,
moving toward a full demobilization program, andproducing a new Commercial Code.
Inaddition, waivers were requiredfor two secondtranche conditions. One waiver related
to the lengtho fthe tax holiday granted under the revisedLaw on Investment; the SAC
condition was to limit the tax holiday period to three years while the amended law
provides for three years plus a possible extension after evaluationby government. The
other relatedto the targets for reorientationo fpublic expenditures which were not



25 The Bank was also beingurgedbythe IMFto add itsweight to the objectivesofthe Fund'sprogram.
An IMFPRGFwas approvedinOctober 1999.The IMFprogramfocusedon fiscal and financial sector
reforms. The programremainedontrack andthe final installment was releasedinFebruary2003.

                                                                  15


attainedduring the SAC period because of exceptional expendituresfor flood relief
following devastating floods in2000. The SAC closedon 12/31/03having fully
disbursedthe fullcredit ofUS$30 million (US$lO million inthe first tranche, US$5
million inthe floating tranche and US$15 millioninthe secondtranche.)
3.5        The Bank'sintention hadbeenthat the SAC would be followed by one or more
additional quick-disbursing operations, suggested inthe 2000 CAS, or by a series of
PRSO budget support operations proposedinthe FY05 CAS. Preparatorywork actually
beganin2004; however, due to concernswith lack ofprogress ingovernance and
corruption problems uncoveredinthe IDA portfolio, as well as the needto builda strong
program inPFM, the Bank didnot present the first ofthese operationsfor Boardapproval
untilJuly 2007.
OUTCOMEK4TINGS
3.6        The SAC'S50 performance indicators hada 1999baseline. Those which couldbe
evaluatedquantitatively were: raise the GDP growth rateto 6.0 percent in2002, raise
GDP per capitato US$360 in2002, reduce inflationfrom 5 percent in 1999to 4 percent
in2002, raisedomesticrevenuefrom 11.2percent ofGDP to 13.2 pei-cent in2002, raise
expendituresfor health, education, agriculture andrural development from 23 percent of
recurrent expendituresto 32 percent in2002 and from 2.1 percent of GDP to 3.2 percent
in2002, reducepoverty from 36percent in1997to 27 percent., attainanexport growth
rate of 8 percent, andrestrict the Balance of Paymentscurrent account deficit to 12-13
percent of GDP. Most of these targets, including the GDP growthrate, inflation, export
growth, current account deficit andpublic expenditurereorientation, were met and
continue to be met or exceeded. The GDP per capitatarget for 2002 was not met but
continued growth has now raised incomes well beyondthis                                         The poverty
reductiontarget was not met butthe benchmarkwas based on flawed data.27

Bank supported the Fund'sefforts with fiscal revenue targets andlimitedcustoms reforms
inthe SAC, andsome support for the VAT underthe TA project. While the SAC target
was to increase total revenues to 13.2 percent o f GDP in2002, revenues remained at
10.0-10.5 percent o f GDPbefore rising modestlyto 11.5 percent in2006. Some revenue
enhancing measureshave beenimplemented,including improvements intax
administration, a limitedreduction inthe fiscal incentives inthe LOI, reintroduction o f
PSI, and an increase inthe royalty ontimber (a moot issue so long as there i s no
resolution o f concession arrangements anda ban on log exports), butthese had little
impact on overall revenue performance until2006. Thus, despite donor inflows equal to
almost 10percent o f GDP, total public spendinghas beentightly constrained -a major
reason why the Government has beenunable to raise civil service compensation.

3.8     The reorientation o fpublic expenditures from defense and security to health,
education andrural development has beena major success story, as shown inFigure 1
below. Education spending as a share o f GDP rose significantly during a period o f rapid
GDP growth, increasing more than 50 percent inreal per-capita terms. The share o f
public education spending financed domestically rose from 54 percent inthe mid-1990s ..
to 80 percent inthe mid-2000s, reducing reliance on donor funding. Inhealthtotal
spendingmore than doubled inrealper-capita terms between 1996-98 and 2004-06,
while the shareo fhealthexpendituresinthe domestic budgetincreasedby over 90
percent.28 However, cash management problemswhichledto delayed releases of
budgetedfunds continued, thereby dilutingthe impact o fthe increased allocations.

3.9     Progress on expendituremanagement under the SAC was limited. The
fundamental objectives were essentially non-quantitative andthus difficult to monitor -
to "ensure the integrity o fthe budgetprocess by establishing a budgetary strategy and
enforcement center at the MEF, strengthen the public investmentmanagement system,
and improve the performance o f spendingunits." A pilot MTEF was introduced inthe
Ministryo fHealth, butuseofthis budgetforecasting toolhasnot yet beenexpandedto
the rest o fthe government. Useful expendituretracking studies were carried out in
education andhealthbut the Government has not established a plan for continuing such
studies. A budget strategy and enforcement center was set up inthe MEF to streamline
budget processes and facilitate cash disbursements to key social and economic sectors,
but itwas unsuccessful andwas subsequentlydisbanded. There was little progress inthis
area untilwork beganon the PFMRP in2005.

3.10    Inpublic administrationreformthe pilot demobilizationprogramfor 1,500
soldiers was completed inJuly 2000 and a plan for demobilizing a further 30,000 soldiers
was prepared. (See next chapter for details.) IDA ledthe efforts to secure funds for the
pilot program from six donorsand supervised implementationo f the pilot scheme...At the
same time, almost no progress was achieved incivil service reform beyond
computerizationo fthe payroll for the central administration. As indicated earlier, the
Bank considered designing a separate public sector reform credit and a PHRD grant o f
US$480,000 was approved inOctober 2002 for preparationo fthis credit, but the plan
was dropped and the grant was reallocated inDecember 2003 to support PRSC
preparation. Onthis subject the Bank admitted inmid-2004 that the preparatory activities
toward administrativereform were still inthe initial stages.

3.11    On governance and anti-corruption under the SAC the Bank supportedanNGO
study on governance and corruption problems inthe public sector leadingto preparation
bythe Government of a draft Governance Action Plan(GAP) which was presented at the
May 2000 CGmeeting.29The GAP was finalized and approved bythe Council o f
Ministers in2001 and disseminated but little has beendone to make it effective. N o fully
autonomous anti-corruption body exists. In1999 the Government hadestablished a
Ministry o fNationalAssembly-Senate Relations and Investigations (MONASRI) to
investigate allegations of corruption and an anti-corruption unit inthe Council o f
Ministers. However, neither o f these bodies i s independent o f the executive branch o f
government andboth lack capacity and resources. The Government began working on a
draft anti-corruption law in 1995, but the law has not yet beenadopted. No corruption
cases have beenbrought to court. There are no rules on conflict o f interest and Ministers,
Parliamentarians and other officials are not required to disclose assets. There are also no
rules on funding o fpolitical parties. Corruption remains the highest-ranked concern o f
Cambodian citizens. With respect to the broad issues o f governance and corruption the
Bank's efforts under the SAC, as well as inother initiatives duringthis period, were

and Public Official Surveys, May 10,2000. Another study ongovernance was carriedout by CDRIfunded
bythe ADB. Severalother NGOreportson this topic have beenissued inrecentyears, including
CambodiaCenter for Social Development,National Integrify Systems Country Report, 2006, and
Corruption and Cambodian Household, 2005, andEconomic Institute o f Cambodia, Cambodia
Competitiveness Report 2005-2006, September2005.

                                              18


unsuccessful. As a result the Bank has taken a muchmore narrowly focused approach to
governance reforms under the most recent (FY05) CAS.

3.12    Clearly the outcomes for the reforms supported by the SAC were mixed. This i s
perhaps not surprising giventhat such a wide range o f issues was included inthe
program. Taking into account the trends since the SAC closed at the end o f 2003, the
results vary from successfulhhowing definite progress (expenditure reorientation, PFM),
very limitedprogress (trade reforms, PSI, LOI), little progress untilrecently (fiscal
revenue), initial progress followed by collapse (military demobilization),
proceduralAegislative reforms but no substantiveresults (forestry), to no discernable
movement (public administration reforms, governance and anti-corruption). At the same
time, the SAC supported macroeconomic management andthe Government has
continuedto adhere to responsible fiscal andmonetary policies which have contributed to
strong economic growth and poverty reduction. Weighing all o fthese contradictory
results the PPAR evaluates the overall outcome as moderately satisfactory, consistent
withthe findingofthe ICRandICRReview.

3.13    Relevance. The issues taken up inthe SAC were relevant. Most o fthese were in
areas where the Bank had already been working to bringabout reforms -PFM, revenue
mobilization (includingthe LO1and the VAT), customs reforms, forestry, civil service
reform, governance and anti-corruption. Inmany o fthese areas the Bank was frustrated
withthe lack o fprogress and sought to apply the addedleverage o fquick-disbursing
funds to achieve a break-through. Inretrospect iti s questionable whether packaging all
o f these diverseissues ina single adjustment operationwas the most effective approach
to follow. Onthe one handthe task o f supervision was made more difficult for the Bank
due to the wide rangeo fministriesand government agencies involved. This problemwas
compounded by the Bank's lack o f field presence during SAC implementation. Onthe
Government side there was a serious problem o f lack o f coordination. All o f the SAC
issues were relevant to some degree to the MEF, but that ministry was unable to compel
timely compliance with SAC conditions from other branches o fthe government.

3.14    E'cacy.   The achievement o fproject objectives has already been described
above. This can be summarized by stating that inthose areas where the Bank was seeing
progress before the SAC there continued to be progress during implementation o fthe
SAC and beyond. Inthose areas where progress was not beingrealizedlittle was
accomplished by the SAC, andinmany cases this remains true up to the present. The
overall outcome for the objectives incorporated inthe SAC was judgedto be moderate
success, but the real question i s whether the SAC contributed significantly to this
outcome. This could be re-interpreted as asking whether the SAC shiftedthe trendline o f
reform actions upward. Since the pace o f reforms inmost o fthe areas coveredby the
SAC was not substantially altered by the SAC, the conclusion drawni s that the SAC was
only marginally relevant for the outcomes under the Bank's agenda duringthis period.
(The one SAC area inwhich progress is now accelerating is PFM, butthe focus on PFM
inthe SAC was peripheralandvaguely defined.) This argumentis reinforcedbythe fact
that, following the SAC, there was no further Bank adjustment lendinginCambodia for
almost four years, with no observable impact on the economy or on the pace o f reforms.

                                             19


3.15    Risk to Development Outcome. The ICR evaluated sustainability as moderately
likely but the IEGreviewjudged it non-evaluable primarilybecause o f unclear
government commitment to some o fthe SAC reforms. As was the case for outcomes, the
risksto outcomes are highlyvaried. The PPARassessesthe riskto be low for PFM,
including expenditurereorientation, and low to moderate for revenue mobilization, based
onvery recent improvedrevenueperformance, but significant for forestry reform, public
administrationreforms, governance, and demobilization. The overall risk to development
outcome i sjudgedto be moderate.

3.16    Bank and Borrower performance. Bankperformance inpreparation and
supervision o fthe SAC was satisfactory. The same TTL supervisedthe project
throughout implementation andmanagement at all levels provided careful oversight. The
Bankremainedengagedwithall o fthe units of government involved with SAC
conditions andremainedfirmly committedto holding government to the conditions
negotiated inthe SAC. (Inthis regard, the deviation from two o fthe second tranche
conditions was minor and the Bank was justified inrequestingwaivers inthis case.)
However, as has been stated repeatedly inthis PPAR, Bank supervisiono f this complex
operation suffered from lack o frelevant personnel on the ground. This undoubtedly
contributedto the extraordinarily longdelay incompletion o fthe SAC. Nevertheless,
Bankperformance isjudgedsatisfactory. The Governmentparticipatedinthe designand
preparation o fthe SAC and there appeared to be strong commitment from senior officials
inthe MEFto the development objectives ofthe credit. Theperformance oftheMEF
duringimplementationwas satisfactory. However, the country's weak institutional
capacity and apparent absence o f ownership inother branches o f government and inthe
lower ranks o fthe civil service meant that implementationtook much longer than
originally plannedandwas less complete that hoped. Inthe absence o f a formal high-
level inter-ministerial coordinating body, neither the MEF nor the PMUwere able to
compel compliance with SAC conditions ina timely manner. These problems were
primarilyresponsible for the lengthydelays inreaching SAC targets. Overall borrower
performance i s rated moderately satisfactory.

4.        Demobilization and Reintegration Project

BACKGROUND
4.1       One legacy of Cambodia's decades ofcivil conflict was the existence intothe 1990s
of several armedforces-remnantsofthe Khmer Rouge, a national army withdivided
politicalallegiances, local militias andprivate armies. According to the UnitedNations,
140,000 soldiers from the four factions were absorbedintothe national army inthe early
1 9 9 0following which 36,000 were officially demobilized. Duringthe 1990smanymore
          ~ ~
former combatantsdiedor returned to civilianlife, but all the factions continued recruiting,
swelling the numbersinuniform to analleged 150,000-160,000 by 1999.30However, it
was commonly believedthat these numbers were greatly inflatedby local commandersin
orderto receivesalary allotments which could compensate for lack o ffinding for food and
other supplies, or for personalgain. Itwas rumoredthat villagers who hadnever been
combatantswere outfitted, photographedandregisteredtojustify the reportednumbers.
The donor community, including the Bank, was pressingthe Government to carry out a
demobilizationprogram inorder to reducethe excessiveburdenofunwarrantedmilitary
expendituresandshift budget resourcesto meet socialneeds. A census was finally carried
out during 1999, assisted bythe Bank's Post-Conflict Unitandsupportedby anIDApost-
conflict grant, inwhich 15,55 1"ghost" soldiers and 160,000 "ghost" dependantswere
allegedly removedfrom the rolls, leaving a re ortedtotal force of 131,227. However, even
these census results were widely discredited?' The Post-Conflict Unit's defense ofthe
census figures underminedthe Bank's ~redibility.~~

4.2       Despite widespreaddoubts about the validity ofthe census numbers, a pilot
demobilization scheme for 1,500 soldierswas developedwithsupport from the Bank and
successfully carriedout in2000. The Bankdidnot participate infinding this US$2.25
millionpilot project but manageddonor trust funds providedby Canada, the Netherlands
and Sweden. The pilotproject was well managedanddevelopedeffective implementation
arrangements. However the pilot operationfailed to putto rest doubts about anumberof
keyproject parameters -the reliabilityofthe figures onwhich demobilization planswere
based, includingthe problem of "ghost" soldiersand inflationofthe militarypayroll, and
whetherthe right soldiers-the old, sick anddisabled-were onthe list. Nevertheless,
basedonthe positive evaluation o fthe pilotprogram, a full-scale demobilization planfor



30 The Governmentprepareda hrtherdemobilizationplan, the CambodianVeterans' AssistanceProgram,
1995-96,whichwas supportedbythe Bank's TA project andAusAid(Australia), but it was not
implementedbecauseofthe politicaldisturbancesin 1997.
31 One publishedaccount claimedthat there hadnever beenmorethan40,000 uniformedcombatants.
"The Cambodiangovernmenthas continuedto claimthat it has a force of at least 130,000 soldiers, yet its
owncommanders admittedthatthe numbersare probablyno greater than40,000." Sophie Richardsonand
Peter Sainsbury,"Security Sector ReforminCambodia," inSchnabel, Albrecht, Security SectorReform and
Post-Conjlict Peacebuilding, UnitedNationsUniversity, 2005.
32 The Bank'sPost-ConflictUnit failedto heedthe manywarnings about the inflatednumbersinthe
census, includingwarnings fromthe unit's own consultantonthe ground. Inaddition, the unitwas
proposinga modelfor demobilizationfrom its African experiencewhich the Cambodianauthoritiesfelt did
not fit their situation. As aresultofthese shortcomings, responsibilityfor the subsequentDemobilization
andReintegrationProjectwas transferredto the CountryDepartment.

                                                     22


30,000 soldiers was prepared, with 15,000 to be demobilized in2001 and 15,000 in2002.33
This program was supported by the US$42 millionDemobilization and Reintegration
@&R) project financedbythe Cambodian Government, Japan, theNetherlands, Sweden,
WFP, andthe World Bank,withthe Bank'sUS$18.4 millionandthe Japanese contribution
o fUS$10millionaccounting for two-thirds o fthe funding. The Bank'smanagement was
reluctant to participate inthe operation, and the program was rated as high-riskinthe
PAD,34butthe other donors insistedthat the Bank take the lead.

OBJECTIVES
4.3         The objectives o fthe D&Rproject were to: (i) the Government in
                                                                   assist
demobilizing 30,000 soldiers and supporting their successful re-entry into civilianlife;
and (ii)   contribute to a reallocation o f budgetary resources to the social sectors andrural
development. The components were: (i)             preparationo f a computerizedpersonnel
database, estimated cost US$0.2 million; (ii)          demobilization -assembly and
disarmament, discharge, a transitional safety net o fUS$240 for each soldier, and
transport to home village, estimated cost US$ 13.2 million; (iii)            reintegration-health
screening, counseling, assistancepackage o f food, household supplies, and income-
generating assets-a generator, water pumpor sewingmachine plus a motorbike,35and
vocational training, estimated cost US$22.8 million; (iv) project management and
technical assistance, estimated cost US$3.9 million. Bank participation included funding
for the data base, TA and project management, and for the income-generating assets. The
performance indicators were to be (a) the number o f soldiers removed from the military
records and from the payroll data base; (b) the percentage o f demobilized soldiers able to
maintain or improve their standard o f living; and (c) the increase inpublic spending on
the social sectors andrural development to follow from the reductions inspendingon
defense and security. This was not a quantitative target inthe D&Rproject but was a
condition inthe SAC, as mentionedearlier.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
4.4       In2000, becauseofRegionalmanagement'sdissatisfactionwiththe performance o f
the Post-Conflict Unit,management o fproject preparation was taken over by the Country
Department(CD) and, withinthe CD, bythe over-stretched ResidentRepresentative in
PhnomP e r ~ h The~D&Rproject was approved by the Bank'sBoardinAugust 2001.
                      . ~
Project effectiveness was expected inSeptember2001 but didnot occur untilJuly 1,2002,
primarily due to delay inselection ofconsultants to assist the Council for the
Demobilization o fthe ArmedForces (CDAF) inimplementingthe program. Nevertheless,
the first phasedemobilizationof 15,000 soldiers was completed inOctober 2001,37



33 The Government declaredin its Defense White Paper ofFebruary2001 that atotal of 55,000 soldiers
would be demobilized over a five-year period.
34 However, the risk analysisfocusedon technicalproblemsrather than the political risks associatedwith
the allegedcensus over-counting.
35  Soldiersidentified land, cows and cash as their primary needs for establishingan economic base in
civilian life, but these were determinedto be ineligible for funding by IDA.
36 Inmid-2001 therewere only two internationalstaff assignedto the CambodiaResidentMission.
37 The demobilization included 15,000 regular soldiers and 1,000 reserves. The Ministryo fDefense
reportedadrop inthe total payroll from 130,695 inSeptember 2001 to 112,359 inSeptember 2002, a
reduction of 18,336.

                                                 23


although deliveryo fthe income-generating assets fundedbythe Bankwas delayedfor a
year.

4.5     Recognizing that the ResidentRepresentative could not effectively supervise this
project alongside his other responsibilities, project management was transferred inmid-
2002 to the EAP Social Development unit. Project supervision was intensified under a new
task team which was well aware o fthe serious allegations surrounding the program. A
procurement problem arose soon after the project was declared effective. Complaints were
received fiom losingbiddersonthe motorbike contract that the winning bidder shouldhave
beendisqualified. The Bank conveyedthese allegations to the CDAF butreceived
assurancesthat the winning bidder was fully qualified. Accordingly, the Bank issueda
letter of no-objection to the motorbike contract on October 24,2002. However, the
complaints continued and RegionalManagement called onthe Bank's Department o f
Institutional Integrity(INT) to investigate. INTissued its report inMarch2003 leadingthe
World Bankto declare misprocurement andto issue an informal suspension o f
disbursementsonJune 26,2003. The Government reactedbyinforming the Bank that itno
longer wantedto continue the relationship withthe Bank on demobilization. Over the
following fifteen months the misprocurement issue was not resolved because, following the
July 2003 national election a new coalition government was not formed untilAugust 2004.
Finally, inSeptember 2004, the Bank formally suspendedthe project, issued sanctions
against suppliers, government officials and the consulting firm advisingthe Government on
the demobilization program, anddemandedrepayment ofUS$2.8 milliondisbursedby
IDA againstthe motorbike contract. The Sanctions Committee's debarment decisions
were basedon a preponderance o fthe evidence that the respondents engaged in
fraudulent practices duringthe procurement and/or implementation process o f the
~ontract.~'The Bankdidnot receive reimbursementuntilJanuary 2005, after the project
hadbeenclosed, andafter the Bank threatened to suspendthe entire lendingprogram
unless the funds were repaid. The Government took strong exception to the Bank's actions
(see Box 2 below and the Government's comments inAnnex B).

Box 2. Government Reaction to the Bank's Actions in the Demobilization Project
   The Governmentprotestedthat the Bankdidnot furnish proofofits findings, althoughthe Bank
hadprovidedthe Governmentwith a detailedreport fromINTwhich the Governmentchosenot to
review. The Governmentalso arguedthat, iffraud hadoccurred,the only liable party shouldbethe
consultingfirm employedto assist inthe demobilizationprogram,which, inthe Government's
view, hadfull authorityto act onthe Government'sbehalf. The Governmentstatedthat, "The
RoyalGovernmento f Cambodianeitheracceptednor rejectedthe decisionto declare
misprocurementand debar firms andpeople. The WorldBank conducteda unilateralinvestigation
andthe RGCwas not privyto its methodology,factual findings, or conclusions. The RGCwas
therefore inno positionto make ajudgment aboutthe World Bank'sdecisionsor actions. Onthe
role ofconsultants,the DevelopmentCredit Agreement states inSchedule4, SectionI(4) `The

   Two pointsarerelevanthere. First, the evidenceo fmisprocurementwas irrefutable. Second,
while the Bank is clear that ultimateresponsibilityfor any misuse ofBankADA funds always rests
withthe borrower, inthis case the borrowertried, unsuccessfully,to usethe Bank's own legal
languageto shift this responsibilityto consultants.


OUTCOMEDCVALUATION
4.6      Following the suspension and eventual cancellationo fthe Bankproject, and the
repayment o fthe component o fthe Netherlands Trust Fundlinkedto motorbike
procurement, resources for sustaining the demobilizationprogram were severely limited,
eventhough other donor support continued.39 Project expenditures were only US$18.6
million out o fthe original total o fUS$42 million, and only US$0.7 million fiom the IDA
credit o f $18.4 million (after reimbursementsandcancellations.) O fthe US$13.2 million
allocated to demobilization only US$3.5 million was spent; o f US$22.8 million for
reintegrationonly US$14.3 millionwas spent. There has been no further progress inthe
formal demobilizationprogram due to lack o f funds, neither for the 15,000 inthe second
phase o fthe project nor the remainder o fthe 55,000 which the Government set as the
ultimate target for demobilization. Nevertheless, the continuing decline indefense
expenditures shown inFigure 1has been due to informal but steady attrition o f former
combatants and deliberate downsizing o fthe military establishment. (See the
Government's statement inAnnex B.)

4.7      The Bank and other donors were fully aware o fwidespread problems o f
corruptioninCambodia; Bank reports, consultancies andpolicy dialogue at the time the
D&Rproject was launched were already giving increasing attentionto the issue. The
Bank was also aware that the IDA portfolio was vulnerable to these problems. However,
it canbe arguedthat the Bankplacedtoo muchreliance onthe performanceo fPMUsand
consultants and did not utilize its own financial andprocurement specialists to the extent
ne~essary.~'Inadequate attentionto fiduciary issues was also due inpart to the Bank's
lack o f staffresources on the groundprior to 2003. While concerns were growing
regarding the possibilities o f fraud inthe Bank's lendingprogram, andthese concerns had
beenconveyed repeatedly to the MEF, the D&R project represented the first case in
which clear evidence o f misprocurement could be substantiated. Following on the
actions taken inthis case, the Bank (EAP and INT) undertook ajoint FiduciaryReview4'
withthe Government (theMEF)of four other IDA credits, leadingto an INT

investigationofthese andfive other projects. The final outcomewas a finding of
widespreadprocurementproblemsinmostofthe nineprojectsinvestigated, suspension
bythe Bankofthree projects, andajoint decisionthat Governmentwould employan
independentagentto handleprocurementonIDA-fundedprojects.

4.8     There havebeensome positiveoutcomesfrom this program, althoughthey cannot
be attributedexclusivelyto the IDAproject. Altogether over 16,000 soldiers and
reservistswere demobilizedandreintegratedintocivilianlife. The Governmenthas
maintainedgoodrecordsonthose who were demobilized. A Pilot Skills TrainingProject
(STP) for demobilizedveteranswas introducedintwo provincesin2003. Basedonthe
successful implementationof the pilot STP, the CDAF has continuedto provideskills
trainingprogramsin24 provincesfor soldiersdischargedin2000-2001. (See Annex B
for a detaileddescriptionofthis program.) The Governmenthas continuedto reducethe
share of the budgetallocatedto defenseandsecuritywhile expandingsignificantly the
allocations to the social sectors. During2000-2005 securityspendingremainedthe same
innominaltermswhile social sector spendingmorethandoubled. As aresult
defensehecurityfell from 47 percentoftotal public expendituresin 1997to 18percentin
2005. Similarly, as showninFigure 1inChapter 3, defenseandsecurityexpenditures
havedeclinedfrom 3 percentof GDP in 1997to approximately 1percentin2006.
However, inadditionto the breakdowninprocurementwhichledto cancellationofthe
IDA credit, andthe serious questionsregardingthe numbersinthe military andthe level
of defenseexpenditures,there were other outcomesofthe programwhichwere not
achieved. Plansto involvecivil society inmonitoringthe demobilizationprocesswere
not implemented. A monitoringandevaluationsystemfor measuringthe socio-economic
impactofthe projectwas designedandreadyfor implementation,butthe projectwas
stoppedbeforethis couldbe implemented. Finally, amorecomprehensivesocial safety
net such as a militarypensionsystem or a social security system, that wouldhave
strengthenedthe long-runsustainabilityofthe reintegrationprogram,was not developed.
Despitethe successfulcompletionofthe first phase ofthe demobilizationprogram,the
outcomeofthe Bank's programis ratedunsatisfactory, consistent with the findings ofthe
ICRandICRReview.

4.9     Relevance. This projectwas highlyrelevantfor the future development of
Cambodiaandwas citedas a highpriorityinthe Bank's2000 CAS. The Bank correctly
identifiedthe needfor the programgiventhe highpriority attachedto reducingdefense
expendituresby Government,civil societyandthe donor community. However, the
Bank'sreservationsaboutwhether to participateinthe programwerejustified. A fully
effectiveoperationwouldhaverequireddirect interventionto determinethe levelof
militaryestablishmentrequired(similarto a functional reviewofthe civil service) andto
verify the true levelof staffing, butthe Bankis prohibitedfrom direct involvementinthe
militaryaffairs ofits membercountries. Thus the Bank, andthe other involveddonors,
were forcedtojoin inbackingthe demobilizationprogramsimply onthe basisthat
supportingsome demobilization,howeverflawedthe process, wouldbebetterthanthe
status quo. Also, Cambodia'sdemobilizationexercisewas moreproblematicthanthose
inother countries wherethe Bankhadbeeninvolved. Inother countriesthe
demobilizationusuallytook placeimmediatelyfollowingthe cessation ofhostilities, was
a comprehensiveexerciseintendedto return to civilian life the greatmajorityof
combatants, andinmany cases was organizedandsupervisedby an outside agencyor

                                                26


government. Itwas a one-time effort which could be quickly completed. However, in
Cambodia's case the demobilizationwas taking place many years after the end o f most
hostilities, whenthe numbers inthe militaryforces had fallen and then risen again and
whenthe present complement was not the same as the force that shouldhave been
demobilized inthe early 1990s. Insummary, while demobilization o f bothreal and
"ghost" soldiers was needed and relevant, the approach adopted didnot address
adequately the concerns surrounding the program.

4.10     Efficacy. The project was successful incompleting the first phase o fthe
demobilizationprogram andbeginninga shift inbudgetaryexpendituresfrom defense
and security to the social sectors andrural development which has beensustained. While
reaching only half o fthe ultimate target, the implementation o fthis component was
carried out as plannedandwas relatively effective. However, the delivery o f
reintegrationpackages to the demobilized veterans suffered from long delays, due in
largepart to the eleven-month delay ineffectiveness o fthe Bank project. Also, because
the demobilizationprogramwas terminated at the mid-point, many other objectiveswere
not achieved, including not only the second phase demobilization, andpossibly donor
support for even further demobilization exercises, but also the implementation o f a
monitoring and evaluation program andtimely follow-up investigation o fthe experience
withreintegration.

4.11 Risk to Development Outcome. The ICRrated sustainability unlikely. Clearly
further progress withformal demobilizationwas not achieved, despite the fact that some
donor support remained to support the program and that the pilot and first phase
demobilizationexercises were carried out effectively. At this point there is no further
dialogue betweenthe Government andthe Bank on demobilization. The reductions in
military expenditureswhich have taken place since the D&Rproject closed have resulted
from attrition andrestructuringo fthe military forces rather than any formal
demobilizationeffort by G~vernment.~~        However, giventhe sustained reduction inthe
share o fmilitary expenditures inthe budget, and the maintenance o ftraining programs
for demobilized soldiers, the riskto development outcome i s ratedonly moderate.

4.12     Bank and Borrower performance. Bank performance inthe early stages o f the
demobilization program was unsatisfactory. The Bank deserves credit for recognizing
the needfor demobilization, for assisting with the militarycensus, design o fthe pilot
program, coordination o f assistance from other donors for the pilot program, andfor
takingthe leadrole insupporting the fullprogram (despite major reservations).
However, while the Bank identifiedmany o fthe project risks at appraisal -flaws inthe
registrationprocess and the risks o f corruption -these were not adequately addressed in
project design. The Bank's defense o fthe military census underminedits credibility with
civil society. Initially the project was managed by the Bank's Post-Conflict Unit,but
Regional Managementwas unhappy with issues o fproject designandthe consultation
process. As a result, project management was transferred to the C D and later to the EAP
Social Developmentunit, both o f which lacked technical expertise and experience with

similarprojects. Oncethe projectbecameeffective Banksupervisionwas intensiveand
was ratedsatisfactoryby QAG. The Bankpursuedthe issue ofmisprocurement
diligently eventhoughthis ledinthe endto a breachinrelations withthe project
implementingagency andto strains inthe overallBank-Governmentrelationship. The
evaluationof overallBankperformanceis moderately unsatisfactory. Withrespectto
Government'sperformance,the CDAF carriedout a successfulpilot project andmade
concertedefforts to implementthe fullprogrameffectively, butit was unableto challenge
the flawedmilitary census whichunderminedthe program. The majorfailing of
governmentwithrespectto the Bank'sprojectwas misprocurementunderthe contract for
motorbikeswhich ledto the suspensionandeventualclosure ofthe project. The Bank
presentedfirm evidenceofits findingsto the Government, andsanctionedspecific firms
andindividuals,butthe Governmentdidnottake any further actionitself. Instead,the
Governmentdeniedresponsibilityfor the problem. (See Annex B for the Government's
statementonthe issues surroundingthe Bank'sfindingofmisprocurement.) Given
Government'srole inthe faulty census onwhichthe programwas based, andinvolvement
inmisuseofprojectfunds, overallborrowerperformanceisjudgedunsatisfactory.

5. Findingsand Lessons

   Some 40 percent o f donor aid has beenfor TA, well above the average for LDCs.
   MuchTA has been donor-driven with inadequate government involvement in
   definingobjectives or choice o fconsultants. Capacity-building has fallen short of
   objectives and the Government has developed a negative attitude toward donor
   TA. However, incontrast to past experience, PFMreforms are nowmoving
   forward because, inaddition to the technical nature o fthe reforms andbacking by
   reformers inthe MEF, donors are listening to the Government and agreeing to
   feasible benchmarks, government has a voice inthe choice o f consultants, and
   there is effective donor collaboration inwhich the Bankhas played a lead role.

   All three projects sufferedfiom flaws indesign. The TA project andthe SAC
   were overly broad inattemptingto resolve too many problems through a single
   operation. The SAC had an excessive number o f conditions which delayed
   effectiveness andtranche releases. The D&Rproject failed to heedthe public's
   complaints about falsification o fthe number o f militarypersonnel. Delays in
   effectiveness and/or inimplementationhave also affected the D&Rproject and
   the EPSCB project which followed the TA project. The Bank's lending
   operations should be more narrowly focused, concentrating on a few limited
   objectives and specific implementationsteps to achieve these objectives.

   The Bank needsto do a betterjob o fjudgingGovernment's willingness to
   implementdifficult reforms. The D&Rproject shows the importance of
   understandingunderlyingpolitical realities. Underthe 2005 CAS the Bank is
   following a more targetedapproach focused on achievable governance reforms.

   Giventhe problemsuncovered first inthe DemobilizationandReintegration
   project and subsequently inother Bank operations, the Bank can be faulted for not
   having carried out more intensive supervision and more careful oversight o f
   fiduciary issues inthe portfolio. An important lesson fiom this project is that
   contracting an international firm to oversee procurement andfinancial
   management is insufficient to preventmisuse o fIDA finds. The Bankhas now
   taken steps to address these issues inproject implementation, includingthe
   employmentof an independentprocurementagent for IDA-fundedprograms.

   Duringthe first ten years o fthe Bank'sengagementwith Cambodia the Bank
   lacked adequate staff resources inthe country. Almost all project development,
   appraisal and supervision were managed through visiting missions. This had an
   adverse effect onthe Bank's ability to supervise complex projects such as the TA
   project andthe SAC andproblem projects such as the D&Rproject, to maintain
   regular contact with key government officials, andto work effectively with other
   donors. One o fthe most important lessons drawn from IEGanalysis o f the Bank's
   performance inpost-conflict countries i s the needto establish an early, strong

                                                30


         presence inthe               This should have beeno f particular relevance for
         Cambodia, where the Bank hadno program before the 1990s. Fortunately, this
         problem has been corrected.
