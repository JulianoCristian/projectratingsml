The Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Project objectives were (i) to assist the Government in its\n            effort to demobilize 30,000 soldiers and to promote their\n            successful adaptation to civilian life; and (ii) to\n            contribute to a reallocation of budgetary resources to the\n            social sectors in order to build human, social and economic\n            assets.  Lessons learned include: the issues which arose due\n            to the political environment highlight the need for good and\n            frank political analysis and assessment as part of project\n            preparation; for the Bank to assist in developing better\n            mechanisms of accountability in the government, makes sense\n            from the perspective of internal governance, as well as\n            ultimately helping to create a healthier environment; even\n            in the absence of formal mechanisms in the country, the Bank\n            and Implementing agency can do much to help build trust\n            between all parties from the outset by agreeing on process\n            and procedures to ensure transparency and encouraging broad\n            participation from a range of stakeholders at all stages in\n            the project; good knowledge and understanding of the\n            military issues and objectives of military reform should be\n            an essential element of designing demobilization;\n            registration of soldiers needs to be carried out with\n            extreme caution; demobilization projects need to be designed\n            so that they do not increase incentives for soldiers to stay\n            in the army in the hope of being included in a later stage,\n            but progressively offer encouragement to leave for those\n            that are no longer suitable to serve; increased monitoring\n            of outputs on the ground, and greater inclusion of civil\n            society and others in monitoring these outputs would be\n            beneficial; legal agreements and Terms of Reference for\n            consultants need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that\n            there is no doubt as to the level of responsibility\n            delegated to the consultants; strong leadership by Bank\n            management in difficult cases is essential."}, "docdt": "2006-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
