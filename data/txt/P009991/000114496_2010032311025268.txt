(b) and
(c) of Schedule 1 to  this Agreement, payments for expenditures to
be financed out of  the  proceeds  of  free-limit Sub-loans may be
made out  of  the  Special  Account  before  the  Bank  shall have
authorized withdrawals from the  Loan  Account in respect thereof.
Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as eligible expenditures
only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize such withdrawals.
2.
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
this Schedule.
3.
After the Bank has received  evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special  Account  has  been  duly  opened,  withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent  withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
 
(a)
For withdrawals  of  the  Authorized  Allocation for the
Special Account, the Borrower shall  furnish to the Bank a request
or requests for a  deposit  or  deposits  which  do not exceed the
aggregate amount of  the  Authorized  Allocation.
On the basis of
such request  or  requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of the
Borrower, withdraw from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit into the
Special Account such amount or  amounts as the Borrower shall have
requested.
(b)   (i)
For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account, the
Borrower shall furnish  to  the  Bank requests for
deposits  into   the   Special   Account  at  such
intervals as the Bank shall specify.
 
(ii)
Prior to or at the  time of each such request, the
Borrower shall furnish  to  the Bank the documents
and  other  evidence  required  pursuant  to para-
graph
4
of this  Schedule  for the payment or pay-
ments  in  respect   of   which  replenishment  is
requested.
On the basis  of each such request, the
Bank shall, on  behalf  of  the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special
Account such  amount  as  the  Borrower shall have
requested and as  shall  have  been  shown by said
documents and other evidence to have been made out
of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
 
All such deposits shall  be  withdrawn  by  the Bank from the Loan
Account under  the  respective  eligible  Categories,  and  in the
respective equivalent amounts,  as  shall  have  been justified by
said documents and other evidence.
 
4.
For each payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at  such  time as the Bank shall rea-
sonably request, furnish  to  the  Bank  such  documents and other
evidence  showing  that  such  payment  was  made  exclusively for
eligible expenditures.
 
5.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph
3
of  this
Schedule, the Bank shall not  be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
 
(a)
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be  made  by the Borrower directly from
the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of
the General Conditions and paragraph
(a)
of Section
2.02 of this
Agreement; or
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
Page  19
to the eligible  Categories  less  the  amount  of any outstanding
special commitment entered into  by  the  Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the respective Part
of the Project, shall equal the  equivalent of twice the amount of
the Authorized Allocation.
 
Thereafter, withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the  Loan  allocated to the eligible Catego-
ries for the  respective  Part  of  the  Project shall follow such
procedures as the Bank  shall  specify  by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals  shall  be  made  only  after  and to the
extent that the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will  be  utilized  in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.   (a)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment out of the Special  Account:  (i) was made for an expendi-
ture or in an amount not  eligible pursuant to paragraph
2
of this
Schedule; or
(ii) was not  justified  by the evidence furnished to
the Bank, the Borrower shall,  promptly upon notice from the Bank:
(A) provide such additional evidence  as  the Bank may request; or
(B) deposit into the  Special  Account
(or,  if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible or justified.
Unless the Bank shall otherwise  agree,  no further deposit by the
Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has
provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be
.
(b)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special  Account will not be required to
cover further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
 
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion  of  the  funds  on deposit in the Special
Account.
(d)
Refunds to the Bank  made  pursuant to paragraphs
6
(a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or  for  cancellation in accordance with
the relevant provisions of  this  Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
