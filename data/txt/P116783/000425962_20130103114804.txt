                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.     The Fast track Initiative Catalytic Fund Grant (FTI CF) aims to contribute to the
Government's goal of attaining universal primary education by 2015, through
construction, extension and equipment of classrooms.

2.    The closing date for Senegal, Education For All Fast Track Initiative Project
(P116783), TF94753 will be extended from December 31, 2012 until September 30,
2013.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The project is on track in meeting its development objective. The grade one intake
rate is 113 percent while the target at the end of the project is 110 percent. The primary
Gross enrollment rate of 93.9 percent is likely to meet the end of project target of 96
percent. Currently more girls than boys are enrolled at the primary level. The primary
completion rate (PCR) rose from 59.1% to 66.5% for the 2010-11 school year greater
than the average 1 point annually over the last decade and if this continues for 2013 the
target of 70% will likely be exceeded.

4.     The Grant agreement of US$81.5 was signed on July 2009. A first tranche of
US$35 million was released in 2009 for Phase 1 of the 3 year project. That amount has
been used to implement a program of 1771 of the planned 1960 classrooms, 254 schools
administration facilities, 374 water points. The construction of the remaining 89
classrooms is being finalized.

5.      For Phase II of US$46.5 million, the Government and the World Bank team
restructured the project in November 2010 to diversify the implementation modalities for
an accelerated delivery of the second phase. So, in addition to AGETIP, in charge of
implementing the first phase, six additional agencies have been designated to handle the
implementation of the project. They are: The Directorate of School Construction and the
six Regional Development Agencies of the Regions for Kaolack, Thies, Diourbel, Louga,
and St-Louis.

6.       The more efficient and effective procurement process generated US$8.3 million
in savings that the Government is using to build additional classrooms and auxiliary
facilities for 25 junior secondary schools to support the Government’s recent policy to
implement a compulsory ten-year basic education.

7.     So far, 80 percent of the resources are disbursed and 2919 classrooms are
completely built while 1331 are being finalized. However, the construction of 268
classrooms (5.9 percent of the program) of which 126 in the district of Bignona
(Casamance Region) has not started due to security reasons in addition to the difficulties
faced by building companies to have access to remote areas in Casamance and Kedougou
regions during the rainy season that goes from June to October. To date, all
                                            4
implementing agencies have completed their procurement processes and are constructing
in 2400 classrooms, 460 latrines, 266 school administration facilities, and 421 water
points.


8.     Therefore, the proposed extension is necessary to finalize the ongoing
construction program. The implementation schedule has been revised to reflect the
extension of the project closing date by one year.

9.     There is no pending audit report.

10. This will be the second extension. A first extension of 12 months was granted in
    December 28, 2011.
