                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track to meet its development objective. The grade one intake rate is 113 percent while the target at the end of the project is 110 percent. The primary GER of 93.9
                         percent is likely to meet the end of project target of 96 percent. Currently more girls than boys are enrolled at the primary level. The primary completion rate (PCR) rose from 59.1% to
                         66.5% for the 2010-11 school year greater than the average 1 point annual increase over the last decade and if this continues for 2013 the target of 70% will likely be exceeded.

                         The Grant agreement for US$81.5 was signed on July 2009. A first tranche of US$35 million was released in 2009 for Phase 1 of the 3-year project. That amount has been used to
                         fund the construction of 1,771 (of the 1960 classrooms planned under the project), 254 schools administration facilities, 374 water points, and 20 walls. The construction of the

                         For Phase 2 of the project (US$46.5 million), the Government and the WB team decided to restructure the project in November 2010 to diversify the implementation modalities for an
                         accelerated delivery of Phase 2. So, in addition to AGETIP, in charge of implementing the first phase, six additional agencies have been designated to handle the phase2. These

                         agencies include: The Directorate of School Construction and the six Regional Development Agencies of the Regions for Kaolack, Thies, Diourbel, Louga, and St-Louis.

                         The more efficient and effective procurement process generated US$8.3 million in savings that the Government is using to build additional classrooms and auxiliary facilities for 25
                         junior secondary schools to support the Government’s recent policy to implement a compulsory ten-year basic education.

                         So far, 80 percent of the resources have been disbursed and 2919 classrooms have been built while 1331 are currently being finalized. However, the construction of 268 classrooms
                         (5.9 percent of those supported by the Project) 126 of which are in the district of Bignona (Casamance Region) has not begun due to security reasons in addition to the difficulties
                         faced by building companies in accessing remote areas in Casamance and Kedougou regions during the rainy season that goes from June to October. To date, all implementing
                         agencies have completed their procurement processes and are constructing 2400 classrooms, 460 latrines, 266 school administration facilities, and 421 water points.
