                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track in meeting its development objective. The grade one intake rate is 113 percent while the target at the end of the project is 110 percent. The primary Gross
                         enrollment rate of 93.9 percent is likely to meet the end of project target of 96 percent. Currently more girls than boys are enrolled at the primary level. The primary completion rate
                         (PCR) rose from 59.1% to 66.5% for the 2010-11 school year greater than the average 1 point annually over the last decade and if this continues for 2011 the target of 70% will likely
                         be exceeded.

                         The Grant agreement of US$81.5 was signed on July 2009. A first tranche of US$35 million was released in 2009. That amount has been used to implement a program of 1960

                         accelerated delivery of the second phase. So, in addition to AGETIP, in charge of implementing the first phase, six additional agencies have been designated to handle the
                         implementation of the project. They are : The Directorate of School Construction, the six Regional Development Agencies of the Regions for Kaolack, Thies, Diourbel, Louga, and St-
                         Louis.

                         To date, all implementing agencies have completed their procurement processes and have started the construction of 2400 classrooms, 460 latrines, 266 school administration
                         facilities, and 421 water points.

                         The more efficient and effective procurement process generated US$8.3 million that the Government proposes to use to build additional classrooms and auxiliary facilities for 25
                         junior secondary schools to support the Government’s recent policy to implement a compulsory ten-year basic education.
