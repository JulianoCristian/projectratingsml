                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Grant agreement for US$81.5 was signed in July 2009 to support one of the most ambitious school construction programs implemented in Senegal with the building of 4,360
                         classrooms, 650 school administration facilities, 964 blocks of latrines, and 610 water points.

                         A first tranche of US$35 million was released in 2009 for Phase 1 of the three-year project. That amount has been used to fund the construction of 1,854 classrooms (of the 1,960
                         planned under the project), 240 school administration facilities, 318 latrines, and 13 walls.

                         For Phase 2 of the project (US$46.5 million), the Government and the World Bank team restructured the project in November 2010 to diversify implementation modalities for an
                         accelerated delivery. Thus, in addition to AGETIP, in charge of implementing the first phase, six additional agencies were designated to handle Phase 2. These agencies include:
                         The Directorate of School Construction and the five Regional Development Agencies for the following regions: Kaolack, Thies, Diourbel, Louga, and St-Louis.

                         The more efficient and effective procurement process generated initial savings of US$8.3 million that the Government used to build: (i) additional classrooms and auxiliary facilities for
                         46 middle schools to support the Governmentâ€™s policy to implement a compulsory ten year basic education program; and (ii) 183 classrooms for primary education. To date, 80
                         percent of the resources have been disbursed and 3,971 classrooms and 22 middle schools have been built while 743 primary schools classrooms and 19 middle schools are
                         currently being finalized.

                         The efficient procurement process generated an additional saving of US$7 million that the Government is using to build 20 additional middle schools and rehabilitate two historical
                         girls high schools namely Mariama Ba School in Goree and Ameth Fall in Saint-Louis. To that end, the project closing date was extended to September 30, 2014 to allow a full
                         implementation of this program.
