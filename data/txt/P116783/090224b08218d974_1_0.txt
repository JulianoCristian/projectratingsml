                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track to meet its development objective. The grade one intake rate is 113 percent while the target at the end of the project is 110 percent. The primary GER of 93.9
                         percent is likely to meet the end of project target of 96 percent by the proposed revised closing date. Currently more girls than boys are enrolled at the primary level. The primary
                         completion rate (PCR) rose from 59.1 percent in 2009 to 66.5 percent in 2012 while the end of project target is 70 percent. The repetition rate decreased to 3 percent while the target
                         was 6 percent. The project was extended three times for a total of 33 months.

                         The Grant agreement for US$81.5 was signed in July 2009 to support one of the most ambitious school construction programs implemented in Senegal with the building of 4,360
                         classrooms, 650 school administration facilities, 964 blocks of latrines, and 610 water points.

                         A first tranche of US$35 million was released in 2009 for Phase 1 of the three-year project. That amount has been used to fund the construction of 1,854 classrooms (of the 1,960

                         planned under the project), 240 school administration facilities, 318 latrines, and 13 walls.
                         For Phase 2 of the project (US$46.5 million), the Government and the World Bank team restructured the project in November 2010 to diversify implementation modalities for an
                         accelerated delivery. Thus, in addition to AGETIP, in charge of implementing the first phase, six additional agencies were designated to handle Phase 2. These agencies include:
                         The Directorate of School Construction and the five Regional Development Agencies for the following regions: Kaolack, Thies, Diourbel, Louga, and St-Louis.

                         The more efficient and effective procurement process generated initial savings of US$8.3 million that the Government used to build: (i) additional classrooms and auxiliary facilities for
                         26 middle schools to support the Governmentâ€™s policy to implement a compulsory ten year basic education program; and (ii) 183 classrooms for primary education. To date, 80
                         percent of the resources have been disbursed and 3,617 classrooms and 7 middle schools have been built while 743 primary schools classrooms and 19 middle schools are currently
                         being finalized.

                         However, the construction of 52 classrooms in the district of Bignona (Casamance Region) was delayed due to security reasons and to the difficulties faced by building companies in
                         accessing remote areas in Casamance during the June to October rainy season. The work has recommenced and is being completed.

                         The efficient procurement process generated an additional saving of US$7 million that the Government intends to use to build 20 additional middle schools and rehabilitate two girls
                         high schools namely Mariama Ba School in Goree and Ameth Fall in Saint-Louis. The project closing date has been extended to September 30, 2014 to allow a full implementation of
                         this program.
