                         1. Relevance of the project objective: The Catalytic Fund project was intended to contribute to the Recipient’s goal of attaining universal primary education by 2015, through
                         construction and equipment of classrooms. Furthermore, the project’s relevance is enhanced with the government’s additional goal of putting in place a compulsory ten-year basic
                         education program, merging primary and junior secondary levels. The project continues to be aligned with the Government’s poverty reduction strategy and the World Bank country

                         assistance strategy.

                         2. Design: The design was appropriate and relevant to the government goal of expanding access to basic education. In many aspects, the project built on the design of the first and
                         second quality education for all projects. It used the same implementation arrangement with the regular government structures at local and deconcentrated levels in charge of the

                         technical and fiduciary aspects of the project. The project design was intended to contribute to the goal to implement the most ambitious construction program ever implemented in
                         Senegal in just 2 years. After one year of implementation, it became clear from monitoring data that implementation arrangements had to be modified in order to increase the chance
                         of achieving the intended goal. The project was restructured to increase the numbers of entities in charge of the implementation of the construction program by combining three
                         modalities that are: (i) the Regional Development Agencies (ARDs) that supported local Governments to implement ambitious schools, water and health facilities programs in Senegal
                         rural areas, (ii) the Directorate of Schools construction, and (iii) the delegated contract management agency that was already in charge of implementing the first year.

                         3. Implementation: Overall project implementation is satisfactory as the project delivered more facilities than initially planned. Overall, the Government was able to satisfactorily
                         coordinate and implement the project both at central and deconcentrated levels. The Directorate of Planning and Education Reform (DPRE) coordinated the entire education ten-year
                         program. Meetings were regularly organized within the Ministry and with implementing agencies. The Minister of education personally chaired implementation monitoring meetings in
                         order to overcome any difficulty or bottleneck that could prevent an effective implementation. As a result, the entire construction program was delivered and even largely exceeded.
                         Safeguards requirements were followed. The World Bank carried out regular supervision of environmental and resettlement issues and worked with the Government to overcome any
                         issues that came up.

                         4. Changes: The Project Development Objectives (PDO), indicators and project components were not changed. The implementation arrangements were modified in November 2011
                         to diversify the implementation modalities for an accelerated delivery. So, in addition to AGETIP, in charge of implementing the first phase, six additional agencies have been
                         designated to handle the implementation of the project. They are: The Directorate of School Construction, the five Regional Development Agencies of the Regions for Kaolack, Thies,
                         Diourbel, Louga, and St-Louis.

                         Extension of the closing date: The project closing date was extended three times for a cumulative duration of 33 months. The main reasons that led to the extensions of the project
                         closing date were (i) the insecurity in Casamance where contractors were several times obliged to stop as they were very often obliged to stop because they were hijacked by the
                         rebels and (ii) the need build additional facilities with the savings generated by a more efficient procurement process.

                         Components: One change was introduced into the sub-component “construction of new facilities” to include an activity aimed at building junior secondary schools as part of the basic
                         education system with the goal of improving primary completion rate, drop out at grade 6 and repetition at grade 5.

                         II.      Efficacy

                         The Grant agreement for US$81.5 was signed in July 2009 to support the most ambitious school construction programs ever implemented in Senegal with the building of 4,360
                         classrooms, 650 school administration facilities, 964 blocks of latrines, and 610 water points. At closing the project built 4360 classrooms, 650 school administrative, 964 blocks
                         latrines and 619 water points. In addition to the delivery of the initial program, the project used the savings to build 48 junior secondary schools, 183 classrooms in existing junior
                         secondary schools, and 39 latrines. In addition, the project rehabilitated four schools of which 2 primary schools and the girls’ schools of Mariama Ba and Ameth Fall, two historical

                         schools and sites.

                         On the management improvement side, the project has supported the production of the annual statistical yearbook. In addition, the project supported the Government to carry out an
                         extensive audit of the education staff and wage bill, to develop a new personnel management software that has led to a remarkable improvement of the Senegal education efficiency.

                         The National Statics Agency has not yet provided the new population data following the 2013 census to recalculate the enrollment and completion rates. The following assessment is
                         based on indicators calculated using population projections based on the 2002 population census. The project has exceeded most of the expected outcomes.

                         The project has met or exceeded many of the results targets. The grade one intake rate in 2014 is 112.6 percent, exceeding the end of project target of 110 percent. The gross
                         enrollment rate improved from 90 percent to 94.7 percent for a target of 95 percent. The repetition rate indicator decreased from 6.9 percent to 3 percent, exceeding the end of
                         project target of 6.8 percent. The dropout rate decreased from 10.9 percent to 7.7 percent against a target of 6.3 percent. The primary completion rate has improved from 58 percent

                         is higher.

                         III.      Efficiency
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The project has delivered all expected outputs and has by far exceeded the quantity planned.

                         -        the project has built the planned 4,360 classrooms, 650 school administration facilities, 964 blocks of latrines, and 610 water points. At closing the project built all of the
                         planned facilities as well as additional water points
                         The more efficient and effective procurement process generated initial savings of US$15 million that the Government used to build: (i) an additional 48 middle schools to support the
                         Government’s policy to implement a compulsory ten year basic education program; and (ii) 183 classrooms for primary education. As a comparison, the previous IDA project, the
                         Senegal Second Quality Education for All, built 28 middle schools.

                         The project demonstrated efficiencies in many areas which will be analyzed in more depth in the ICR and include:

                         -         Lower repetition and dropout rates and increased transition rates has led to a decline in the cost to educated primary school graduate

                         -         The development of management software has improved the efficiency of the wage bill management.

                         IV.       Risk to development outcomes:

                         The project supported a government policy and strategy that has been reconfirmed with the new letter of development policy. It used the government’s own structure to implement the
                         project, and there is strong ownership. The follow-up IDA/GPE project (P133333) has built on the project experience to decentralize the management of school construction.
