                         The project is on track to meet its development objective. The grade one intake rate is 113 percent while the target at the end of the project is 110 percent. The primary GER target of
                         96 percent (rate is currently 94.1 percent) is likely to be met by the end of project. Currently, more girls than boys are enrolled at the primary level. The primary completion rate (PCR)
                         in 2012 was 65.6 percent (end of project target of 70 percent). The 2013 statistics are not yet available. They will be used for the last ISR that will be prepared in September 2013.
