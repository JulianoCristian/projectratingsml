INTERiATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENr
REPORT AND RECOlisIvENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE JAMAICA DEVELOPMENT BAINK
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amlunt in various currencies equivalent to US$3.7 million to
the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) for an agricultural credit project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the first made by the Bank in the
agricultural sector in Jamaica. An economic mission which visited Jamaica
in mid-1968 noted the need for supervised agricultural credit. An FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program mission visited Jamaica in 1May/June 1969 at the Govern-
ment's request and identified two agricultural credit projects, for one of
which the Government decided to approach the Balk.   A Bank mission in January
1970 reviewed the organization and policies of the JDB, and further assistance
in preparing the project was given at the same time by a separate mission
under the FAO/I9RD Cooperative Program. The project was submitted by the
Government in April 1970 and appraised by the Bank in June 1970. For the
other project, the Government sought assistance from the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB).  A $6.2 million loan from the IDB is scheduled for
signature very shortly.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan were held between November 19
and 25, 1970. The Jamaican delegation was headed by MvIr. D. R. Clarke,
General Manager of the Jamaica Development Bank, and included Mr. H. Milner,
Under-Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Mr. D. MIarsh, Assistant Attorney-
General on behalf of the Guarantor.
4.        The proposed loan, the seventh to Jamaica, would increase the Bank's
total lending (net of cancellations) to US$46.4 mil'lion. 1/ No IDA credits
have been made to Jamaica.  The following is a summary orBank loans as of
November 30, 1970:
1/ Without taking into consideration the $11.2 million loan (No. 481-JMi)
made in 1967 to the Jamaica Telephone Company. The loan was cancelled
by the Borrower in 1967 after only $13,000 had been disbursed and this
amount was repaid in full.

5.        The highway project was set back by over two years because of an
initial delay in the selection of consultants and a large increase in the
estimated costs, on the basis of which a reduction in the scope of the
project was agreed to with the approval of the Executive Directors in
August 1968. Contracts for the reduced project, based on new bids, were
awarded in July 1969. Since then, construction has been proceeding satis-
factorily. The education project is proceeding slightly behind schedule,
and construction is expected to be completed by mid-1971 instead of by early
1971. As regards the water supply project, since some major bids were re-
ceived in the latter half of 1970 and contracts awarded thereafter, it is
expected that disbursements will start from early 1971. The population
project was made effective only on November 2, 1970, after some delays in
finalizing a contract with architectural consultants. Since the work on
designing the project buildings has now begun, disbursements can be expected
from early 1971.

6.        A number of new projects are at different stages of preparation
and consideration. Negotiations for the second education project are
tentatively scheduled for early 1971. A proposal for financing industry
and tourism enterprises through the JDB is due to be appraised shortly.
The feasibility study for a sewerage project for Kingston is currently
being reviewed. The Government has approached the Bank for future assistance
towards financing additional highwiays and airports, and the feasibility
studies of these projects should commence shortly.
7.        IFC has so far made two investments totaling US$3.14 million in
a hotel (Pegasus Hotel) and a cement manufacturing project.

PART III - THE PROJBCT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "Jamaica, Agricultural Credit
Project" (No. PA-66a) is attached.
10.       The agricultural sector in Jamaica, which so far has been
essentially based on sugar and banana production, has suffered a gradual
decline over the last few years. The best agricultural lands in the island
have been concentrated in the hands of sugar and banana companies and other
large landowmers, who have not been fuUly cultivating the utilizable lands
they own. Other lands are owned by farmers with holdings varying from 5 to
99 acres, but the great majority of farmers are eking out a livelihood on
very small holdings in the hills. The Government recently recognized the
possibility of not only bringing the unutilized good agricultural lands
under cultivation, but also of giving an impetus to viable farmers through
supervised agricultural credit programs for the production of foodstuffs,
which could advantageously substitute imports, and of exportable agricul-
tural products.  The FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program identified two supervised
agricultural credit projects, the first for small and medium-sized farmers
having between 5 and 99 acres and the second for comnercial farmers with
over 100 acres. The Bank had from the outset indicated its willingness to
consider both projects, but since the IDB was prepared to provide financing
from its Fund for Special Operations at an interest rate significantly
lower than the Bank's, the Government decided to approach that institution
for financing the first project, which is to be administered through a
different credit channel. The Bank was requested to assist with the
project for providing credit to commercial farmers on commercial terms
and conditions.
11.       The proposed project covers JDB's credit program for the
expansion and development of about lbo farms and ranches with about
23,200 additional acres of land and consists of:
(a) the development and expansion of:
(i)  about 50 coconut farms with the planting
of Ualayan dwarf coconuts, involving about
5,000 additional acres;
(ii)  about 30 citrus farms, involving about 3,000
additional acres;
(iii)  about 45 beef cattle ranches, involving about
13,500 additional acres;
(iv) about 15 dairy ranches, involving about 1,700
additional acres; and
(b) technical assistance for project implementation.



12.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$8.0 million.
The proposed 1    n of US$3.7 million would finance the foreign component
of the project.-  or 46 percent of the total project cost.  The Bank would
finance 45 percent of on-farm investments, the JDB 35 percent and the
participating farmers the remaining 20 percent. The Bank would thus
provide financing to cover 57 percent and the JDB 43 percent of each sub-
loan.
13.       The financing provided for on-farm investments would cover land
preparation, planting materials, equipment and machinery, buildings, water
supply, fertilizers, pesticides, fencing and livestock.  The small scale
of individual investments and the great variety of items to be procured
in small lots would make formal international competitive bidding imprac-
tical and procurement would essentially be through existing commercial
channels. Competition is keen and servicing adequate.
14.       Sub-loans would be extended by the JDB for the farm investment
plans developed and recommended to the JDB's management by the JDB's
Agriculture Credit Section.  Sub-loans would be for a minimum of US$24,000,
and those exceeding US$1C0,000 would be subject to prior approval by the
Bank. They would be made at 8-3/L percent interest per annum, plus a
commitment fee of one-half of one percent on the undran'm balance and a
flat service charge of one-half of one percent payable before the first
disbursement against the sub-loan. Although the current prime rate for
lending in Jamaica is around 8 percent, long-term credit for commercial
agriculture has not been available. The proposed interest rate should
therefore be competitive and at the same time provide a sufficient spread
to JDB for profitable operations. The sub-loans would be designated in
Jamaican dollars. The Government has agreed to carry the fall foreign
exchange risk arising from the proposed loan, subject to receiving a
token payment from the JDB for this service, such payment representing
one-tenth of one percent out of the annual interest rate of 8-3/4 percent
on the sub-loans. The sub-loans would have maximum repayment periods
varying from 10 to 15 years depending on the type of farm to be financed,
i.e., 15 years including 4 or 6 years' grace for coconuts, 15 years
including 7 years' grace for citrus, 12 years including 5 years' grace
for beef and 10 years including 3 years' grace for dairy farms. The
amortization period for the Bank loan would be 16 years including 5
years' grace.
15.       The JDB, which became operational in September 1969, is a multi-
purpose development bank which is designed to lend for industry and tourism
as well as for commercial agriculture. It is a successor to the Develop-
ment Finance Company, whose assets were taken over by the JDB under the
Janaica Development Bank Act of 1969. While the JDB's equity is held
by the Government and the Bank of Jamaica (the central bank), its Board
represents a fairly diversified cross-section of private businessmen and
civil servants. The JDB has requested assistance from the Bank in extend-
1/ Subject to the ininor exception indicated in para. 15 below.

ing credit to industry and tourism as well as agriculture. Prior to appraisal,
therefore, the Agricultural Projects and Development Finance Company Depart-
ments of the Bank together reviewed the organization of the JDB and assisted
in formulating a Policy Statement. To facilitate its lending activities in
the agriculture field, the JDB has established an Agricultural Credit Section
headed by an experienced Jamaican agriculturist with wide knowledge of the
country's agriculture. In the initial stages, this new Section would need
the assistance of an experienced agricultural economist and a livestock
specialist, both of whom would be recruited specially for the project and
financed under the proposed loan, irrespective of whether they were recruited
locally or abroad. (If either were recruited locally, a small amount of
local cost financing would be involved.) The Section would assist applicants
not only in preparing viable farm investment plans, but also in implementing
them.
16.       Arrangements will be made by the Government and by the JDB to ensure
that both the participating farmers and the JDB freely obtain the benefits
of research work done and technical and extension services provided by the
Agriculture Ministry, the Citrus Growers' Association and the Coconut Industry
Board. To ensure that programs of agricultural credit and related develop-
mental efforts in the agricultural sector are properly coordinated within the
context of the Government's policies and priorities, the Government has already
set up and has agreed to continue a Coordination Committee. It will include
senior officials from each of the Mlinistries of Agriculture, Rural Land De-
velopment and Finance, and from the JDB.
17.       The project's rate of return to tlhe economy, over an average life
of 20 years, is estimated to be 17 percent.   In quantitative terms, the
project would have as its main direct benefits the improvement in Jamaica's
balance of payment position through increases in export earnings (citrus)
and through import substitution (vegetable oils/copra, meat and dairy
products) amounting to about US$3 million a year, at the project's full de-
velopment. About one-third of these benefits to the balance of payments
would come from export earnings. By developing and bringing into use about
23,200 acres of mostly idle lands, the project in the long run should stimu-
late production beyond this acreage by making considerable earnings available
for reinvestment in agriculture. Lending for coconut planting would acceler-
ate the current program for re-planting with iIalayan dwarf cocon-ats, which
are resistant to the lethal yellowsing disease that is presently devastating
Jamaica's tall coconut plantations.  In addition to the readily quantifiable
benefits already mentioned, there would be secondary benefits such as the
domestic value added by processing the project's products and the benefits
frcm increased employment on farms and in processing activities.
13.       Since the income tax payable by project farmers would depend on
their total income from all sources, it is difficult to assess the additional
tax revenues that would be generated through the project. Jamaica has one of
the more progressive systems of personal income tax in the Western Hemisphere.
Assuming that the average income tax rate to be paid by tlie project farmers
is about 20 percent, then annual income tax revenue from the project at full
development would be significant (in the region of US$400,000).

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMEITS AJD AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Loan Agreement betwufeen tlle Bank and the JDB, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
20.       The draft Loan Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of
agreements for agricultural credit projects. However, since the proposed loan
is being made to a multi-purpose institution to which the Bank is likely to
lend also for the traditional development finance company activities, the
Agreement includes some of the basic features of agreements for DFC projects.
PART V - THE ECOTIOICY
21.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Jamaica" (No. M11-187a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
December 26, 1968. The report concluded that, on the whole, the performance
of the economy had been satisfactory and that the ouitlook for further growth
was quite favorable. With the expected continuation of sound economic and
fiscal policies and a more active government role in fostering agriculture
and dealing with the high rate of population growth, Jamaica was considered
creditworthy for further external borrowing on conventional terms.   A new
economic report on Jamaics is currently under preparation; it is not expected
to arrive at very different conclusions. A basic data sheet is attached.
22.       The growth of real GDP at factor cost in both 1968 and 1969 came
close to the 1962-67 average of just below 5 percent. Investment concurrently
reached 26-27 percent of gross domestic expenditure, ccmpared to a 20 percent
average in 1961-67. Hence the prospects for attaining faster growth rates of
output in the next few years seem quite good.  However, an accelerated growth
rate will be consistent with balance of payments equilibrium only if the annual
rate of price increases can be reduced below 6 percent recorded during 1968
and 1969. The monetary authorities have recently introduced credit restraints,
and a Prices Commission is soon to be established to make a closer study of
the factors pushing prices up. Among these factors, wage pressures and rising
import prices stand out.
23.       Central Government capital expenditures, including transfers and
loans to the rest of government and to the private sector, came to US$73
million equivalent last year, accounting for about one-fifth of gross domestic
investment, or 7 percent of GNP. Preliminary estimates indicate that public
investment may stabilize at about US$85 million annually, with a slight in-
crease in the share allocated to transport. Although generally, the public
investments presently planned or under execution correspond to Jamaica's
development needs, there are some sec-tors in which more could be done to
develop projects, particularly in agriculture, education, and urban infra-
structure.



-8-
24.       In the view of the authorities, the chief limitation on accelerated
public investment is one of qualified person-nel, which the Government has
found difficult to attract and retain. To correct this condition, the Govern-
ment has initiated a comprehensive position classification and pay survey,
and as a stopgap measure, is granting substantial pay increases to be spread
over the next three years. lHevertheless, fiscal constraints hnave as yet not
been serious. Over the 1966-69 period the proportion of the Government in-
vestment program covered by the current account surplus increased from 38 to
58 percent, despite current expenditures increasing at a rate of 9 percent
annually in real terms. Apart from the effect on revenues of general economic
growth, the Government is proposing to introduce substantial new revenue
measures which should continue to ensure a relatively com,fortable fiscal
position.
25.       The public debt is still relatively light.   The total internal and
external debt of the Central Government came to US$304 million equivalent at
the start of the current fiscal year in Mtarch. The service on it, at US$25.6
million, was equivalent to less than 12 percent of current revenue in 1969/70.
For the public sectors as a whole, the external debt at the end of 1969 came
to US$154 million including undisbursed. The service on it amounted to US$13.8
million in 1969, or to 3.4 percent of exports of goods and services net of in-
vestment income payments. However, at present, the Government's borrowing
possibilities are limited; at home it now has to compete with ot-her investment
opportunities which bring a higher yield to institutional investors, while the
high cost of borrowing in capital markets abroad has deterred Jamaica from
resorting to them since 1968.
26.       The Government's expectations for future borrowing tend to be con-
servative, and are focused primarily on possibilities for increased project
borrowing from international institutions.  Under these conditions, Jamaica
should remain creditworthy for significant amounts of additional external
borrowing on conventional terms.
PART VI - COMPLIAiCE WITH TTE ARTICLES OF AGREUIFN
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
