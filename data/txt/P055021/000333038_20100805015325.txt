     IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Banks lending operations through field
work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other
in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is
sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the
public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with
the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk t o Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report of the Registration and Cadastre Project
in the Republic of Bulgaria. The project was approved in June 200 1, and received an IBRD
Loan (Loan No. 46190) of EURO 33.5 million ($30.0 million equivalent at the prevailing
exchange rate). The project was restructured in May, 2006, accompanied by a cancellation
of $4.8 million of the Loan and a one-year extension of the project period to install an
information technology system. A further extension of one year was granted in 2008, to
complete the information technology system. The project closed in March, 2009, two years
beyond the original closing date.

The report presents the Independent Evaluation Group's (IEG) findings, based on review of
the project implementation completion report, appraisal report, loan agreement, sector
reports, and other relevant material; and a mission to Bulgaria in NovembedDecember 2009.
The mission visited project sites, and held discussions with government officials and
agencies, project directors and staff, beneficiaries, the private sector, key donors and NGOs.

The Registration and Cadastre Project was chosen for assessment because the project exhibits
several interesting design features. First, Bulgaria has adopted a dual-agency approach to
land administration, whereas a number of countries have all land administration activities
under one agency. Bulgaria's experience adds understanding on the relative merits of
different institutional choices. Second, the project was sharply focused on land
administration, simplifying project implementation. How this has fared, and consideration of
additional actions to further develop the land market is of interest. Third, the project's design
and implementation embodied a number of choices and specific features that have general
interest in other countries. This PPAR is undertaken as part of a series of PPARs of several
similar land administration projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft Project Performance Assessment
Report have been sent to the concerned government officials and agencies for their review
and comment. No comments were received from the Borrower.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the experience and lessons of the
Bulgaria Registration and Cadastre Project (RCP) in the Republic of Bulgaria.

The RCP's objective was: "to improve the coverage, completeness, accuracy and
responsiveness of the real property and cadastre registration systems, thereby contributing to
the development of the real property market." This objective was undoubtedly relevant to
Bulgaria's needs. Throughout the period when the project was being prepared and
implemented (1999 to 2009), Bulgaria has been in rapid transition. From the vestiges of the
former communist regime, an increasingly market oriented economy has been developing
and has been further stimulated by the country's accession to the European Union in 1998
and eventual membership in 2007. The primary economic focus of both Government and the
Bank has been to develop a demand-based economy; stimulating economic growth through
privatization, efficient markets, and supportive public investments and institutional reforms.

The land sector is a necessarily core part of the market liberalization. As a basic factor of
production, a liberalized land market is essential to efficient economic growth. Yet this was
far from the case before the project. A free land market - i.e. clear land boundaries and
assured tenure, and ability to readily buy, sell and mortgage land at low transaction cost -
was notably absent. Land ownership records were fragmented under different agencies, land
boundaries were imprecise, tenure was not clear and could be disputed, land values were low
and transaction costs were high. These uncertainties affected access to credit using land as
collateral. Insecurity of tenure was also a disincentive to industrial and agricultural
investment and presented risks to the welfare of land-holders dependent on the land for their
livelihoods.

RCP's sharply focused design reflected its objective. It provided for the creation of
specialized agencies and a network of field offices for cadastre and property registration;
preparation of enabling legislation; a program under the Cadastre Agency to map and record
ownership of land; a program under the district courts for registration of transactions;
establishment of an information technology system; and progressive digitization of land and
property records. A project implementation unit was set up to coordinate activities between
institutions.

There were two main design issues. First, Government was insistent on maintaining its
existing and long-standing arrangement of having separate agencies for cadastre and
registration. This "dual-agency" system had been shown from experience elsewhere to be
less effective than having all land administration activities under one institution (the "single-
agency" model) and was vehemently opposed by the Bank task team. However, when it
became apparenl that Bulgaria would not forsake its existing system, a calculated risk was
taken by the Bank to go ahead with the project in such a second-best situation. The relevance
of land administration to Bulgaria's development strategy was considered to justify a less
than ideal situation for project implementation. In the event, although not without
implementation difficulties, this was justified - the project objectives were achieved.
                                                    X



A second issue was an inappropriate institutional design for RCP's registration activities.
Registration of land sales and mortgages, which was under the Ministry of Justice, was to be
undertaken by the existing staff of the district courts, and was to be managed by a
coordination cell in the Ministry. This proved totally inadequate. Court staff had many
responsibilities and to expect them to also handle a modernizing and expanding land
registration system was unrealistic. Also, the lightly staffed coordination cell had insufficient
capacity and authority to supervise the courts. The result might have been predicted -
registration activities hardly got off the ground in the first two years of the project. There was
then a decidedly positive initiative. An independent Registration Agency with its own staff
was established, analogous to the Cadastre Agency which had been making good progress.
The Registration Agency quickly built capacity, and by project completion had achieved the
project's registration and efficiency improvement targets - a notable achievement given the
late start.

RCP achieved its objectives. Coverage exceeded targets. Some 28 cadastral offices were
established and 113 registration offices in the courts were upgraded and equipped, providing
an accessible network covering the country, and staff in the field offices and at headquarters
were trained. The cadastral target of 300,000 services per annum reached 565,000 services.
Cadastral mapping reached 4.6 million parcels compared with the target of 3 million
properties. The target for annual registrations of 700,000 services (there were no recorded
sales before the project) was also exceeded, reaching 1 million services in 2007 (although
this fell to 770,000 in 2008 due to the global financial downturn). The accuracy of land
administration was also improved, through more accurate cadastral mapping, digitization of
records and establishment of information technology to share land records and transaction
data between the two agencies and also accessible to the general public. Finally, registering
transactions was made more responsive to client needs. The time required for registering a
transaction was reduced from several weeks or even months to about 14 days (the ECA
average is 60 days), of which the Registration Agency now takes 1 to 3 days (the rest of the
time is for actions required from other government agencies). The land market grew rapidly
during the project period, in value terms by about 45 percent per annum. This compares with
the situation before the project when land-based mortgages (now the largest segment of the
land market) were rare. Social issues could have received more attention. There is minimal
information on social impacts of land administration, and investigating this should have been
part of project preparation and subsequent monitoring - experience in other countries is that
land registration can have deleterious impact on vulnerable groups such as women and
poorer households.

RCP's outcome was Satisfactory overall. The project achieved its objectives and can be
expected to have played a key facilitating role in the rapid expansion of the land market.
Efficacy and efficiency were both substantial. The project's objectives were substantially
relevant to the Bank's and Government's development strategy for Bulgaria. The relevance
of RCP's design is assessed modest because, while the institutional structure for cadastre was
well formulated, for registration the initial design of only a coordinating cell was inadequate.
Nevertheless, this was corrected during project implementation. Monitoring and evaluation
was substantial. Data covered the project's performance indicators, and was reported
regularly as part of the management information process.
                                             xi

Risk to development outcome is Moderate. The Cadastral Agency and the Registration
Agency are now experienced institutions and their services are appreciated by clients and
government. However, they would be less vulnerable to any future shortfalls in government
financing or to excessive political involvement if they achieved financial independence. This
is feasible as combined fees of the two agencies already exceed their operating costs. But
first call on such revenues needs to be the agencies themselves - at present all fees go to
Government, which then funds the agencies from the general budget. Merging of the two
agencies should also be considered. Despite RCP' s general success, from experience with
dual and single agencies in other countries, and Bulgaria's own experience, implementation
of the project could be expected to have been more efficient with a single agency

The performance of both the Bank and the borrower was Satisfactory. Other than the
inadequate initial design of the institutional arrangements for registration, the Bank
performed well. Good technical expertise and hands-on guidance were applied throughout
the project, and supervision was intensive. This facilitated Bulgaria's venture creating a
modern land administration system with little preceding experience. Government was late
establishing the institution for land registration, but the eventual full-time and staffed
Registration Agency was far more satisfactory than the coordination cell originally
conceived. The two agencies have developed to effective institutions, and have achieved the
project's targets.

As Bulgaria moves forward, two further options to improve the functioning of the land
market could be considered. First, further improvements in land administration efficiency
will need attention to institutions and processes outside the purview of the Registration and
Cadastre Agencies. Thus, while the time taken for the Registration Agency's actions in the
registration process has reduced to only 1 to 3 days, the overall registration process involves
three other institutions taking 6 to 12 days between them. Addressing bottlenecks with these
institutions must now be the main source of improvements in service efficiency. Second, the
broader business environment can be considered. Investment in a building or other structure
is often associated with purchase of land. But getting a construction permit in Bulgaria
involves 24 procedures and about 140 days. These difficulties in effect add to the cost of a
land transaction, and they can be expected to constrain the attractiveness of investing in real
estate, and the fluidity of the land market.

The experience gained under the Bulgaria RCP yields the following main lessons:

(i)    .While land administration through a "dual-agency" approach can work, a unified
agency is preferable as program implementation is easier and efficiency gains more
attainable. Actions that helped the dual-agency model to work included a project
coordination unit and development of a unified data sharing system. The further benefits
expected from a single agency would be seamless coordination of activities, more easily
achievable financial self-sufficiency, improved registration efficiency, and greater
convenience for customers.

(ii)   The legal and institutional base for land administration should be established before
commencing a project, and the land administration institution(s) should have full-time staff
and be dedicated only to land administration. Government had passed a law establishing the
                                                  xii


legal basis for land administration more than a year before Board approval, and the CA was
established six months before approval. But the registration coordination unit was not
established until 16 months after Board approval. Registration activities only got going after
the RA had been created.

 (iii) Financial self-suficiency for a land administration agency is desirable and feasible if
fees are appropriately channeled. Fees need to be retained rather than passed to Government,
 and cadastral activities may need cross-subsidization from registration revenues.

 (iv)    The eficiencies o other institutions andprocesses are relevant to achieving a well
                           f
functioning land market. The Registration Agency's one to three day turnaround for its part
 of land registration is not matched by other involved institutions which add another one to
 two weeks. The land market is also affected by constraints outside the registration process,
 such as obtaining a construction permit.

(v)     Possible adverse impacts on weaker social groups should be investigated while
preparing a land administration project and mitigating project design features included if
needed. The impact on such groups should be monitored during project implementation.
Minimal information is available in Bulgaria on social influences, the typical view being that
the land administration program is "neutral" in its treatment of all persons. However, in a
number of countries, also with no difference in approach between social groups, inequalities
have been found, as well as practical solutions.

 1. Development Context
 1.1    Throughout the period when the Bulgaria Registration and Cadastre Project (RCP)
was being prepared (from about 1999 to 2001) and implemented (2001 to 2009), and
continuing to this day, Bulgaria has been in rapid transition. From the vestiges of the former
communist regime, an increasingly market oriented economy has been developing and has
been further stimulated by the country's accession to the European Union (EU) in 1998 and
eventual membership in 2007. GDP growth in the 1998 - 2008 period averaged a robust 6.3
percent per annum. The primary economic focus of both Government and the Bank has been
to develop a demand-based economy; stimulating economic growth through privatization,
efficient markets, and supportive public investments. The 1998 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) called for sustained economic growth by accelerating reforms and rapid development
of the private sector. Transformation of institutions and policies to the exigencies and
opportunities from Bulgaria's new membership in the EU has also been a dominating policy
for Government, strongly supported by the Bank.'

 1.2    The land sector2 is a necessarily core part of the market liberalization. As a basic
factor of production, a liberalized land market is essential to efficient economic growth. Yet
this was far from the case in the 1990's. A first positive step had been taken by Bulgaria
through restitution of collective lands and urban land to the former owners. By 2000, just
before Board approval of the RCP, land restitution had been virtually completed. However,
for both urban and agricultural land, a free land market - i.e. clear land boundaries and
assured tenure, and ability to readily buy, sell and mortgage land at low transaction cost -
was notably absent. Land ownership records were fragmented and recorded under different
agencies, land boundaries were imprecise, there were possibilities for fraud, tenure was not
clear and could be disputed, land values were low, in part due to such uncertainties, and
transaction costs were high due to unclear bureaucratic procedures. Uncertainties also
affected access to credit using land as collateral, and tenure insecurity was also a disincentive
to industrial and agricultural in~estment.~




 1. As reflected in the 1998 CAS - "Bulgarian foreign and domestic policy is dominated by its aspirations for
membership in the European Union." Also, in the Bank's lending program, of the seven projects reviewed in
Bulgaria's FY08 "Status of Projects in Execution" (excluding the RCP), three projects refer to the EU in their
development objectives.
2. Throughout this report the terms "land", "real estate", "property" and "real property" are used synonymously.
In all cases they refer to the land and fixed property on the land (such as a house, shop, factory, drainage
infrastructure, etc.).
3. The following comment is in similar vein: "The current land administration system is confusing, strongly
fragmented in a number of poorly coordinated institutions, inefficient and overly bureaucratic. Consequently the
system does not meet modem requirements in general and those of a transition to a market economy in
particular." (From "Land Markets in Bulgaria." D. Kopeva, 2003).
                                                              2


 2. Project Objectives and Implementation
 Objectives and Design
2.1     Development Obiective. The Objective of the Bulgaria Registration and Cadastre
Project (RCP) was "to improve the coverage, completeness, accuracy and responsiveness of
the real property and cadastre registration systems, thereby contributing to the development
of the real property market." (from Loan Agreement.) (The Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) also refers to securing tenure of real property to boost investments in housing,
agriculture, commerce, manufacturing and services, and to the requirements of EU accession.
However, this is not reflected elsewhere in the PAD, indicating that the de facto intent of the
project was restricted to the Development Objective in the Loan Agreement.)4

2.2      Components. The project components (Box 1) are consistent with these objectives.
Component A - cadastre system development (costs at project completion $9.8 million)
provided much needed capacity building of the new government Cadastre Agency, including
related equipment and technical assistance. Likewise, on the registration side, Component B -
property registration system development (costs at completion $10.4 million) was to create
an efficient registration system to reduce transaction costs and time. Component C - cadastre
and property registration operations (costs at completion $26.0 million) supported
implementation of a mass registration and supporting cadastre program, and a major program
to transfer and digitize land records. Finally, Component D - project management and
development of a policy and legal framework (costs at completion $3.4 million) funded
operations of the Project Implementation Unit, training, technical assistance, improving the
legal framework, an information technology system, monitoring and evaluation, and a public
awareness campaigna5

2.3     Each component was broad in scope, resulting between them in a comprehensive
program to transform Bulgaria's land cadastre and registration services to a modern system -
in technology, institutional capacity, the administrative and legal framework, and service
standards.



4. Investments and security of tenure do not feature in key parts of the PAD where the project's objectives
would normally be expected: the logfiame, strategic context section, project description, economic analysis and
M&E.
5 , The Bulgaria Registration and Cadastre Project was approved on June 2 1,200 1and received an IBRD Loan
(Loan 46190) of EURO 33.5 million ($30.0 million equivalent at the prevailing exchange rate). Additionally,
the Netherlands government provided a grant of $2 million for technical assistance and capacity building,
primarily contributing to activities under component C. The RCP was restructured in May, 2006 accompanied
by a cancellation of $4.8 million of the Loan and a one-year extension of the Loan period to complete
installation of the information technology system. A further extension of one year was granted in FY08 to
hrther develop the IT system to a unified joint information technology system common to both the Cadastre
Agency and the Registration Agency. The project closed on March 01,2009, two years beyond the original
closing date, with $37.0 million equivalent of the Loan disbursed. Due primarily to appreciation of the EURO
against the US dollar, project costs expressed in dollars at completion ($49.6 million) were substantially (about
30 percent) higher than costs estimated at appraisal. Likewise, the value of the loan (after a cancellation of $4.8
million) was $37.1 million compared with the loan expressed in dollars of $30 million (Appendix B).

Box 1: Objectives and Components of the Bulgaria Registration and Cadastre Project
Development Obiective :

To improve the coverage, completeness, accuracy and responsiveness of the real property and cadastre
registration systems, thereby contributing to the development of the real property markets (from Loan
Agreement .)

Components:

                 -
Component A Cadastre System Development: Build the capacity of the new Cadastre Agency to design
and implement a unified national cadastre system through provision of equipment, office renovations and
furnishings, vehicles and technical assistance; development of a cadastre information technology system;
preparation of a strategy to enable the agency to run along business lines; and development of operational
service standards for customers and a human resources strategy for the agency. Cost estimate at appraisal (base
costs without contingencies): $5.1 million; actual costs at completion: $9.8 million.
Component B - Property Registration System Development: Capacity building for Bulgaria's 1 12 district
courts and the Ministry of Justice for implementation of a new real property registration system so as to
establish an efficient real property registration system that lowers transaction costs and reduces transaction
processing times. Project support includes equipment, furnishings, vehicles, computer software and refurbishing
of offices; and technical assistance for developing strategies for digitizing of real estate records, and running the
service along business principles including cost recovery. (Cost estimate at appraisal: $5.8 million; actual costs:
$10.4 million.
Component C - Cadastre and Property Registration Operations: Mass registration of property into a new
digitized data system including data entry, cleaning, conversions, transfer of records, and cadastre. Project
support would cover. (Cost estimate at appraisal - $22.0 million; actual costs $26.0 million.
Component D - Proiect Manapement and Development of a Policy and Legal Framework Training of
staff from the Cadastre Agency and involved district courts; technical assistance to complete the legal
framework for the cadastre and property registration systems; development of an information technology
system; a public awareness program; and monitoring and studies relative to system efficiency and social
                                         -
impacts. . (Cost estimate at appraisal $1.5 million; actual costs: $ 3.4 million.
 Sources: PAD. (costs data at project completion are from ICR, based on costs in Euro converted to US$ using
 Weighted average historical exchange rate of Euro 1 = US$1.3 1. Actual costs in dollars exceed appraisal estimates
primarily due to the appreciation of the Bulgarian Lev.


Institutional Arrangements
2.4    The Bulgaria Registration and Cadastre Project (RCP) was implemented under what
has come to be known as the "dual-agency model" wherein cadastre and registration services
are handled under separate agencies. To facilitate coordination between the institutions
involved, a "Project Implementation Unit" (PIU) was also set-up.6

2.5     The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works was responsible for the
cartography side of the project and a "Cartography Agency" (CA) was established in January
2001 for this purpose. This was some six months before Board approval in June 2001.
Another up-front action was the passing of a law which established the legal base for the
registration and cadastre p r ~ g r a m . ~



6. The two-agency system, sometimes known as the Austro-Hungarian System, was spread under the Austro-
Hungarian empire, and is found in a number of countries, mostly in Eastern Europe.
7. The "Law on Cadastre and the Property Register" (April 2000).
                                                              4

2.6      Preparatory actions for the project's land registration program were much less
complete. It had been intended under the two-agency model to create a "unit" under the
Ministry of Justice to coordinate the registration program.' The unit was formed in October
2002, 16 months after Board approval. The unit proved ineffective. Later, a fwll "agency" -
the "Registration Agency" (RA) - was created in July 2004. This was three years after RCP's
Board Approval, but its creation as an independent full-time entity went much further
institutionally than the small coordinating cell originally intended, and the RA developed to
an effective institution. While the late start had held up registration progress in the first years
of RCP, in the second half of the project the R4 achieved the intended transfer of
registration activities from the courts to its own staff situated in each of Bulgaria's 112 court
         and
townsYg caught up on and surpassed RCP's annual registration targets.

Implementation
2.7     The project commenced inauspiciously given the delay establishing the land
registration program. For about two years (June 2004 to March 2006) in the middle of the
project period, the Bank rated the project as Unsatisfactory, and, in 2005, even commenced
procedures to suspend the project. However, performance picked up in the last years of the
project, and all implementation targets were met or exceeded (Table 2). These achievements
were helped by two successive one-year extensions of the project, lengthening the project
period from 5 % to 7 % years. The expressed reasons for the extensions were to allow
establishment of the project's information technology systems, but they also allowed more
time for roll-out of the cadastre and registration network, which achieved nation-wide
coverage.

Safeguards and Fiduciary Management
2.8     No safeguards were triggered at appraisal and the project was classified as category
C, thus not requiring an environmental assessment. The Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR) reports that there were no social or environmental issues during
implementation. However, social risks may be present, as discussed in Section 3.

2.9     No fiduciary malfeasance is reported in the ICR, and financial management was rated
satisfactory throughout project implementation. However, contract preparation capacity was
weak until the last four years of the project when it improved in line with the general pick-up
in performance of the project as a whole.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.10 Based on the design, implementation and utilization of the Bulgaria RCP, M&E
performance is rated Substantial.

          Design. Modest: An M&E cell was established in the PIU supported by consultants.
          This was to monitor both the delivery of services and the impacts for stakeholders.
          The variables that would be monitored corresponded to most of the performance
          indicators in the project's results framework and provided a comprehensive basis for
          assessing project progress and performance. This proved to be a useful management
          tool (refer below). Although beyond the specific objectives of the project, inclusion of
          some parameters to assess broader impacts of the project such as investments and
          possible social impacts would have been desirable. 10
          Implementation. Substantial: An M&E unit of 3 persons was established in the PIU
          at project start-up (2001). A consulting team helped establish the work program and
         provided training. In the first several years, M&E was largely restricted to the
          cadastral program, but the program was expanded to cover all of RCP's activities
          after the RA was formed, and several surveys and workshops were held to get client
                      '
          feedback. By mid-project the M&E unit was measuring and reporting data on a
         quarterly basis, and data was included as part of the quarterly Project Management
         Reports. Also, based on Bank recommendations, the variables measured were
         expanded to better reflect RCP's core objective to develop the property market. Data
         collected included variables such as the number of mortgages, number of
         transactions, interest rates and property prices, all indicators or proxy indicators of
         development of the land market.
         Utilization. Substantial: According to the Director of the PIU, the M&E data has
         been useful, both for hands-on management, through the regular reporting of physical
         progress and outcome data, and for client feedback. The workshops highlighted the
         views of customers that the major improvement in the quality and time requirement
         for registration also needs to be accompanied by other user -friendly measures, for
         instance, as simple as having benches to sit on while waiting, and an information desk
         for guidance on the documentation needed. The IEG mission was also informed that
         the project's M&E activities would continue, attesting to the utility of M&E in land
         administration as seen by the implementing agencies.

    Relevance
    3.2     Relevance of Objectives. The Development Objective of the Bulgaria RCP had
    substantial relevance. Bulgaria was in process of moving from the command economy of the
    former communist regime towards a market economy. It was necessary for good economic
    growth that basic factors of production such as land were operating in an economically
    efficient market. Accelerated and private sector led economic growth, stimulated by a market
    economy, was central to the 1998 Country Assistance Strategy issued at the time of project
    preparation. There is also specific reference in the strategy to" remove regulatory
    impediments to land transactions and complete permanent registration (i.e. registration and
    cadastre - the two main activities of the project). The 2006-2009 Country Partnership
    Strategy, the relevant strategy document at the end of RCP, had broadly similar priorities:
    improving the efficiency of the economy, reaching a higher growth path and sustained
    private sector-led growth. l 2 The RCP supported this strategy. With secure and geographically
    defined tenure, land could be sold or leased under a free market, tending, through market

forces, to progressively transfer to higher value economic use.13 Bulgaria's EU accession
added further urgency to this need. The main accession requirements were that there would
be transparent and secure titles for real estate, and that an open land market was emerging.
There was also a social dimension. Before the land cadastre and registration services
promoted by the project, land possession was confused geographically and even as concerns
legitimate ownership. This would likely have disadvantaged the poor and less powerful,
creating tenure insecurity and also discouraging investment and land sales.

3.3      Relevance of Design: Bulgaria RCP's design was well crafted in its technical
features, and this provided a strong base for taking the project forward and delivering in full
against the project's output targets (Table 2). Only minor changes to RCP's technical design
were necessary during project implementation, further attesting to the quality of the project's
technical preparation in the complex land administration sector. Nevertheless, there were
several flaws on the institutional side. The first - the choice of a two-agency system,
separating land cadastre from land registration - could be considered more a strategic choice
than a flaw per se - the decision to have a two-agency system was made unilaterally by
Government, and the Bank advised firmly against this. Recognizing the reality of
Government's choice, there were then various decisions facing the Bank - to go ahead with a
similar sized project with adjustments to reflect the institutional realities of a dual-agency
system, to develop a modified and downsized project, to reject the project, or other options.
The appropriate choice in such a situation contains a large element of judgment more than
empirical reasoning, but is considered further in paras. 3.43 to 3.46. The Bank's eventual
choice was to accept the dual agency situation as a reality and go ahead with the project. In
the event RCP achieved its targets, but not without considerable difficulties in the first years.
The Bank's experience with projects in the ECA Region and elsewhere is that one combined
agency is generally better, reducing coordination problems. This proved to be the case for the
Bulgaria RCP. Communication between the cadastre agency and the MOJ was quite limited
in the first years of the project, whereas close linkage of the two activities is required.

3.4     Second, the intended institutional structure for registration activities was to use the
existing court system and staff and to have only a coordination cell in the Ministry of Justice
to manage the program. Without full-time registration staff in the courts and given the many
responsibilities of court staff, it was unlikely that registration would receive the dedicated
attention that was required. (This was rectified during project implementation when a
specialized registration agency was created. Para 3S3). Exacerbating this design shortfall,
there was a quality at entry issue. Although RCP was ready on the cadastral side (by
appraisal the Cadastre Agency had already been established, and was also backed by new
land laws) this was far from the case with land registration. The Registration Agency was
only established in 2004, some three years after Board presentation, resulting in minimal
registration activity until the second half of the project period.

 13. Developing a land market in Bulgaria was further challenged by Bulgaria's unusual demographics and land
ownership. About one-third of the population are of retirement age, and the restitution process led to most land
going to older people. According to a World Bank survey in 2005, only five percent of the rural heads of
households that received land were younger than 40 years old. Productivity was low and without access to land
administration services, tenure was insecure, and elderly households tended to stay on their farms. Land
transactions to higher value usage were, in these circumstances, limited.
                                                    8


3.5     Third, social issues received only minor attention, despite evidence in a number of
other countries that proactive measures might be needed in a project to include and protect
vulnerable groups (paras. 3.15 and 3.16). Also prioritization of the number and locations of
registration offices could have been considered (para. 3.14). And a more structured path to
cost recovery and financial independence would have been helpful (para. 3.39).

3.6     Balancing the strong technical aspects of the project against the institutional and other
shortfalls, RCP's relevance of design is rated Modest.

Efficacy
3.7       Evaluation Amroach. RCP's objective - "to improve the coverage, completeness,
accuracy and responsiveness of the real property and cadastre registration systems, thereby
contributing to the development of the real property market" - involved four aspects:
4 4 coverage", "accuracy", "responsiveness", and "completeness". These are not precisely

defined in the PAD or ICR. Efficacy will therefore be categorized based on inferences in the
PAD and on common usage of these terms in land administration. Coverage is taken to refer
to the geographic coverage of the project including regional, social and rural-urban variance.
Under Accuracy, the management of data and information technology are considered. The
Responsiveness section covers the efficiency of land administration services which is used as
a proxy for responsiveness of the service to client needs. The PAD provides no clarity on the
meaning of completeness, other than a reference to fragmentation of data (PAD page 3).
Hence, Completeness is subsumed under Accuracy. Finally, the possible impacts of RCP on
market development are examined. A reference point for the main output achievements of
RCP is provided in Table 2.

Improving Coverage
ESTABLISHING
          A CADASTRE AND REGISTRATION NETWORK

3.8     The intended 28 cadastral offices were set up by the CA - one for each of Bulgaria's
regions. Also as intended, 1 13 registration offices were established by the RA, a network
covering every court town. The RA and CA advised the IEG mission that all offices were
staffed and functioning, although some more isolated offices were less efficient performers
and required greater management supervision.

3.9     Cadastral achievements. Cadastre maps and registers were created for 4.6 million
parcels; significantly more than the appraisal target of three million properties. About 30
percent of Bulgaria's land area (there was no appraisal target) was covered by "adopted"
cadastre maps (Le. maps that are recognized for official use). Additionally, "approved"
cadastre maps (maps that have been legally affirmed and transferred to the CA) were created
for 30 percent of the country's land area as targeted at appraisal.

3.10 Registration achievements. Recorded sales only began in 2005, after the
establishment of the RA. Thereafter, deeds lodged for registration increased from 234,000 in
2005 to 325,000 in 2007, an annual increase of 17 percent (Appendix A, Table 3). Sales
declined in 2008 to 3 10,000, but, consistent with the downturns in other countries, this is
likely due to the influence of the global economic crisis. The number of property based
mortgages per annum increased at about the same growth rate as sales - New mortgages
were 63,000 in 2005 and 96,000 in 2007, an annual growth rate of about 15 percent. As
discussed in the efficiency section, growth of the market in value terms was considerably
greater.

REGIONAL AND RURAL SECTOR COVERAGE

3.1 1 Regional coverage. The decision to establish RA and CA offices positioned in line
with Bulgaria's network of local governments meant that the number and locations of the
offices were predetermined by the locations of the government administrative network.
Following the locations of the local governments automatically created a dispersed network
of land administration offices. All RA offices are used, with over 70 percent of them
registering between 500 and 5,000 transactions in 2008.

3.12 Decentralization. Following the local government administrative network made sense
operationally as land administration activities partly involve other branches of local
government. Nearly all CA and R4 activities are implemented locally rather than being
concentrated in Sofia. This provides the close contact with clients and other service providers
(notaries, lawyers, locally based officials from ministries) that land administration typically
requires.

3.13 Rural-urban coverage. Comparing the relative degrees of service coverage between
urban and rural populations is more difficult. Neither RA nor CA specifically differentiate
data between the rural and urban sectors - both sectors are considered to have equal access to
their services. Nevertheless, the basis for equal accessibility appears present. The dispersed
                                                             10


network of offices means that an RA or CA office is not far from the great majority of
villages. Most clients in rural areas would be within 10 kms. of an RA office, and accessible
by a local bus ride. Further, major urban conurbations do not dominate the registration
market. Registrations in Bulgaria's three largest cities - Sofia, Varna and Plovdev -
represented 25 percent of the national registered sales total in 2008.

 3.14 Benefits and cost-effectiveness. The accessibility of the RA and CA offices is
                             and
considered by RA and CAY clients met by the IEG mission, to be a strength of the land
 administration network. Convenience for clients was one self-evident advantage. Ready
access would also have a social dimension - benefiting more remote villages with higher
poverty levels. Another benefit would be the possible effect of such proximity in stimulating
more land transactions, more investment and higher land productivity. Against these
economic and social advantages is the cost of coverage. A question that could be posed for
the small RA offices is whether the economic and social benefits of having a particular office
justify its investment and operating costs. Lack of data precludes quantified analysis, but a
subjective assessment and ranking of options would have been desirable at appraisal. l 4

     INCLUSION
SOCIAL

3.15 Land Security. The consistent view of persons met by the IEG mission was that the
RCP, by improving security of tenure, had helped increase welfare for the great majority of
households. Compared with the prior situation of poorly defined and inaccurate documents
(if any), and confused ownership between cadastre, registration and other data sources, the
occupier gained clear and secure ownership. A commonly found view was that this was
likely to have been particularly beneficial to rural households, especially when land security
was essential to subsistence. However, data to back up such views is lacking. Experience in
other countries is variable - they include causes and effects such as the above, but also
situations where specific proactive measures are required to involve and protect vulnerable
groups.

3.16 Gender and ethnic groups. Under Bulgarian law, differentiation between gender,
ethnic groups and incomes is not permitted. In, for instance, property ownership, the man's
and the woman's names are required on title'deeds. All Government and Bank staff met by
the IEG mission were adamant that there was also no discrimination in practice, although
exceptions might arise. But again, no data was found by the mission - from official or other
documents, to back up such claims. No cases of discrimination were encountered by the
mission but experience in some countries - for instance in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan -
suggests that land registration can be detrimental to vulnerable groups.15The Bulgaria RCP
itself illustrates both an apparent need,16 and proactive measures that RCP employed to help

 14. As examples, the following might be amongst the options to consider: establishingkeeping an office in a
low income area but on a part-time basis using visiting staff from regional centers; mobile offices; absorption of
a county court office into the operations of a larger office, etc.
15. As reported in the Project Performance Assessment Report of the Azerbaijan Farm Privatization Project and
the Agricultural Development Project (IEG, July 2008); and the Tajikistan Survey (World Bank, USAID and
Government of Tajikistan, 2008).
16. The susceptibility for social exclusion appears present from a recent study which found that "the risk of
poverty in Bulgaria is twice as large in female-headed households as in male-headed households." Some 10 to
                                                      11

clients with difficulties. Thus, CA offices provide free legal services to clients with
difficulties, and both the RA and CA consider their widespread networks of field offices to
be particularly helpful to poorer households and women. The CA considers its legal
assistance program successful enough to continue legal services after project completion.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT O W SUCCESSFUL WAS RCP AT IMPROVING COVERAGE?
                 H

3.17 Achievements for cadastre and registration - the core of the project and representing
over 80 percent of project costs - significantly exceeded the project targets established at
appraisal. The CA reached 565,000 services per annum, nearly double the target of 300,000
annual services. The RA reached over 1 million services per annum in 2007 - 43 percent
more volume than the targeted 700,000 services. A national network of offices was
established and equipped, and staff trained to operational effectiveness throughout both
agencies and their field offices. These were outstanding achievements. But there were limited
actions and inconclusive achievements for social inclusion. This reduces the overall efficacy
for improving coverage from an otherwise high efficacy to a substantial rating overall.

Improving Accuracy and Completeness of Land Administration
GENERAL
      IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF DATA

3.18 Before the CA?s and RA?s establishment, cadastre and administrative records were
limited in extent and, where existing, were under a number of different agencies, none of
which were specialized in modern land administration. This made for highly inaccurate
maps, confused boundaries, fragmented records and even cases of multiple claims of
ownership of the same property. The RCP brought in a new land administration system, with
all activities and records consolidated under two agencies (the CA and RA) and with
technologies and processes able to accurately measure land boundaries and maintain and
update land records to a level consistent with EU standard^.'^ All new land cadastre and
tenure records are now digitized, and a program to progressively digitize previous records is
ongoing. Quality control standards for cadastral data were promulgated in the first year of the
project,18 and appear to have contributed to a generally considered view that mapping and
records are of good standard. This is consistent with the low incidence of client complaints -
as of November 2006, 3 million properties had new approved cadastre maps, while only 400
complaints had been received; about one complaint per 7,500 cases.

UNIFIED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

3.19 A unified information technology system (the ?Integrated Information System for
Cadastre and Property Registration?) was developed and then, in the last two years of the

15 percent of male-headed households in the survey were in the poorlvery poor category; whereas 20 to 25
percent of female-headed households are poorhery poor. (From Bulgaria, Living Conditions before and after
EU Accession. World Bank,March 2009.)
17. As indicated in the introduction to the efficacy section, there is minimal indication in the PAD as to what is
meant by completeness. An indirect inference from page 3 of the PAD is that it refers to the need to consolidate
data, which is already covered under accuracy.
18. Regulation No. 19 of December 2001 - ?For Control and Approval of the Cadastral Map and the Cadastral
Register.?

project, rolled out nationally. This is fully functional and has become the central feature of
the new land administration system, improving both the accuracy and efficiency of the land
administration system. The system connects all of CA's and RA's field offices and
headquarters to a common web-based computer system updated daily. All cadastral and land
tenure records and changes are recorded in the system, and data is available to all users
including the general public. The digitized system eliminates errors or losses in manual
records. Possibly the greatest benefit is that the integrated and unified IT system brings the
activities of the CA and RA closer together, significantly improving coordination between
the two agencies and improving efficiency.

TRANSPARENCY
3.20 The RCP introduced a number of procedures to increase the transparency of its
operations and reduce potential for corruption. Some of the measures noted by the IEG
mission were: public notice-boards displaying tariffs; separation of tellers from
administration and data entry officials; uniform procedures; use of service standards to
minimize transaction times and, hence, opportunities for fraud; and, in larger offices, the use
of a ticket system for waiting, so that the window available for a customer is determined
randomly rather than selected by the customer or official. The unified information system,
once established, also played a role in enabling transparency of data and transactions. Details
of properties and transactions are now viewable, with a subscription fee, to notaries, lawyers,
government departments, and any other interested person.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT        -
                 HOW SUCCESSFULLY DID THE PROJECT IMPROVE ACCURACY?

3.21 Cadastral mapping is progressively replacing the former inadequate system, providing
a sufficiently accurate cadastre to meet EU requirements. Digitized records are replacing
paper records, reducing the risk of lost data. The information technology system is making
data transparently available, and measures to enhance transparency of transactions are being
promoted for all offices. These measures provide for safer, more accurate ownership records,
increasing security of tenure as well as the ease of making property transactions. RCP's
efficacy improving the accuracy of land administration was High in all respects.

Responsiveness of Land Administration
3.22 While "responsiveness" is not defined in the PAD, the PAD'S monitorable indicators
and discussion refer to reducing the time required for registering a transaction, keeping
registration costs low, and services that are simple and easy for the client. Such client-
responsive factors can in large part be represented by a standard measure of efficiency
commonly used internationally. This comprises three yardsticks. For the purchase of a
property: (i) the number of procedures involved in the transaction; (ii) the time typically
needed for the transaction, and (iii) the associated costs for the purchaser. Appendix A, Table
1, based on IEG mission interviews with a broad set of stakeholders, represents the case of a
property purchase by a medium sized business. A similar exercise has been done for the land
administration systems in Kyrgyz, Slovenia and other countries reviewed by IEG, and with
                                                       13


data from the ?Doing Business? series of annual report^.'^ For Bulgaria, while there is much
in common between IEG mission findings and the Doing Business data (averages are very
similar), there are differences in detail. Where the stakeholder interviews consistently
indicate such differences,20the mission findings have been used.

3.23 Number of procedures to register a property purchase. There are seven procedures for
a property purchase in Bulgaria - four that ?aresequential actions and three that can be done
in parallel to the sequential actions (as noted in Appendix A, Table l).With seven procedures
involved, Bulgaria?s pathway for registering a property transaction is slightly more
complicated than the average for the Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) group of
countries (6 procedures) and for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) with 5 procedures (Table 3).

3.24 Time taken to register a property. In the time taken for registering a property
transaction through all procedures, Bulgaria performs relatively well. The assessed fastest
time in Bulgaria is 7 days, although business persons and real estate professionals met felt
that 14 days or somewhat more would be a more realistic assessment. Nevertheless, even
taking 14 days as a more achievable process, this is better than the ECA average (60 days)
and OECD (25 days). Data over time for Bulgaria is not available, although from remarks by
the RA and Bank staff, there has been a substantial reduction in total time for all procedures
from the situation in the 1990s and early 2000s when several months were not unusual.

3.25 For the time taken by the RA alone, (Le. excluding the time taken by other
institutions) there are also no time-series data. The PAD refers as a monitorable indicator to a
reduction in RA?s registration time to an intermediate target of five days (and an eventual
goal of one day). From discussions with RA staff, the pre-project situation was well over five
days. The RA also advised that its service standard had now reached a one-day norm, with
three days an outer limit. Interviews during the mission field visits were consistent with these
assessments.

3.26 Costs of registering a property. The total costs (public and private sector fees and
taxes) of registering a transaction expressed as a percentage of the property?s value are 2.5
percent (Appendix A, Table 2).21Most of this (2.0 percent) is due to the municipal tax. With
the municipal tax excluded, the combined service fees of the RA, CA, notary, lawyer and
municipality are 0.5 percent of property value. The combined fees charged by the CA and

20. From IEG mission interviews with the RA, CA, clients at RA and CA offices, the Confederation of
Bulgarian Industrialists, businessmen, lawyers, a notary, court judge, land purchasing consultant and land-lease
contractor in December 2010 (The Doing Business 2010 report uses earlier data (estimation year not specified).
However, notwithstanding such differences in detail, overall average estimates for time and costs of
registration, work out to be substantially similar between the IEG and the ?Doing Business? assessments.
21. An issue raised by an industrialist is that the overall costs of obtaining cadastral maps to investigate business
potential can be high. Maps for a typical rural village comprising 10,000 land parcels could cost over 8,000
leva, ?hampering entrepreneurship with land;? (iii) the short validity period of property sketches was also cited
as a problem - sketches have to be verified again every six months, at significant cumulative costs and effort.
Such experiences indicate the potential gains from resolving land administration physical or incentive
bottlenecks, both within the purview of the two agencies and by actors other than the RA and CA.
                                                               14


RA are a yet smaller part of property value - only 0.1 percent. Bulgaria's total transaction
registration costs of under 2.5 percent are slightly more than the ECA average (2.2 percent),
but about half of the average (4.6 percent) for OECD countries. There is no equivalent
comparator data for the RA's and CA's costs alone.

3.27 Overall achievements improving;transaction processes. The number of procedures
involved has not changed much, but reductions in time have been considerable. The RA has
met the RCP's ambitious target of one day for its part of the processing of a property
registration (the rest of the 7 to 14 days is for actions taken by other agencies). Costs of
registration are low compared with ECA and OECD averages (Appendix A, Table 4). While
outside the scope of the project, a further opportunity remains - to also improve efficiency of
the other agencies involved with land registration (para. 3.40).

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT O WHAT DEGREE DID THE PROJECT IMPROVE THE
                      T
RESPONSIVENESS OF LAND ADMINISTRATION SERVICES?

3.28 RCP was responsive to consumer needs in the measures used internationally for
assessing the efficiency of a land administration service: the number of registration
procedures was not reduced, but RA's time for registration was radically cut, to only one day,
and costs of registration are lower than in most countries. Responsiveness was Substantial.

DEVELOPMENT THE LAND MARKET
         OF

3.29 Estimation of RCP's contribution to development of the land market can only be
indicative given several analytical impediments. First is the difficulty of attribution - there
are other factors influencing the market which can be expected to have more impact than
land administration. Second, time series data encompasses only four years. And third is the
influence of the global financial downturn.

3.30 As indicated in Table 4, there has been strong growth in the real estate sales and
mortgages markets. The number of new sales and mortgages increased by 10 and 8 percent
per annum respectively, and the total value of new sales and mortgages increased by about 45
percent each. These increases were in spite of the beginning of the global financial downturn
                                                       15

in 2008. Foreign direct investment in real estate also increased to the extent that real estate
became Bulgaria?s largest recipient of foreign direct investment.

3.3 1 Clearly, the real estate market has grown rapidly. The more difficult consideration is
the degree to which the RCP has influenced this growth. One businessman encountered by
the IEG mission felt that other influences have as great or even more impact on market
growth as RCP?s development of land administration services - for instance, the general
economic boom in Bulgaria, and the impact from accession to the European Union. But it
would be hard to argue that the RCP has not also had impact. Global experience indicates
that secure land tenure and the means to formally record changes in ownership are key
foundations for a dynamic land market.22For Bulgaria, the land cadastre and transaction
system introduced under the RCP, despite the high probability that major economic forces
have had greater impact on the property market, has been an important facilitator. The project
has resulted in property boundaries being unequivocally established, ownership clear, tenure
fully secured, land information available to all, and land transactions more expeditious and
legally recognized; thereby providing a base for trading and investing in property with
greater confidence. Based on the above information, it is reasonable to expect that RCP?s
impact on the property market has been substantial.

            EFFICACY
RCP?s OVERALL

3.32 The RCP achieved or surpassed all the implementation targets set at appraisal.
Coverage had Substantial achievement. The network of offices was established nation-wide,
in rural and urban areas, and accessible to all but the most remotely situated villages.23
Cadastre and registration significantly exceeded targets, and provided the tenure security and
the ease and legitimacy of transactions necessary for stable welfare and investment.
Improvements in Accuracy were High. Cadastral measurement and records are much more
accurate and now at EU standards. All new data is digitized and entered in a transparent
information technology system, and can be shared in near real-time between the RA and CA


22. As discussed, for instance, in ?Land Policies for Growth and Poverty Reduction?, K. Deininger (World
Bank, 2003).
23. The complete network, corresponding to the Government local administration?s court towns, provided
excellent accessibility, although, to assess benefits against costs, a prioritization exercise on the number of
offices to establish would have been desirable.
                                                   16


and with clients. Responsiveness had High efficacy given the reduction in registration time
and a service increasingly geared to customer needs. Registration takes only one day for the
RA (although other involved institutions take further time resulting in a 7 to 14 day period),
and costs are relatively low when compared internationally. This is likely to have contributed
to the boom in the land market since the mid-2000s. Although the overall contribution that
the project has had on land market development cannot be determined with currently existing
data, proxy indicators suggest Substantial impact. Taking the project as a whole, the RCP's
achievements have been considerable. RCP's overall efficacy was Substantial.

EFFICACY
       WITH THE DUAL AGENCY APPROACH

3.33 From the above, Bulgaria can be considered a country where the dual agency model
has been made to function reasonably well. The project's quite ambitious physical objectives
were achieved; the CA and RA have evolved into capable institutions; and the new
information technology system has made data freely available between the two agencies, thus
achieving part of the advantages of a single agency. The RCP therefore demonstrates that the
single agency approach is not categorically the only institutional structure that can make land
administration work. Nevertheless, from the IEG mission's observations and as concurred
with by both CA and RAY     there would be advantages if the two agencies were merged into
one institution: (i) achieving financial self-sufficiency would be easier; (ii) coordination of
registration and cadastre would be facilitated; (iii) efficiency gains are probable (for instance
in registering property, which currently requires separate inputs from both the CA and RA);
and (iv) dealing with only one agency would be more convenient for customers.

Efficiency
COST EFFECTIVENESS

3.34 Project costs in dollars were estimated at 36.8 million at appraisal The actual project
costs at completion were $49.6 million compared with the $36.8 million project cost
estimated at appraisal - a 34 percent increase. The increase in costs was almost entirely due
to an appreciation of the Bulgarian leva. Between 2000-2002 and 2006-2008 (three year
averages) the leva appreciated against the dollar by about 45 percent, implying cost savings
in local currency terms. The project components with the largest savings were cadastre and
registration, RCP's primary activities. Cost-efficiency can also be gauged from the
perspective of the costs of registering a transaction compared with other countries. As
reviewed in the Efficacy Section, the cost of registering a transaction in Bulgaria at 2.5
percent of the value of a property, is within the range of most ECA countries.

ECONOMIC
       VIABILITY

3.35 An economic rate of return for the RCP was not estimated at appraisal or project
completion on the grounds that the macro-variables that might be influenced by the project
were so large compared with the project's costs, that, as typically found for land
administration programs, even slight changes assumed for the macro-variable, would result
                                                     17

in large changes in the ERR.24Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the RCP's
improved land administration services had at least a facilitating role in the boom of the real
estate market from the mid 1990s to 2007.25The project's influence on the market could be
quite small for the RCP to have been economically viable (for instance, using financial costs
and benefits as a proxy for economic values, if only one percent of the growth in the value of
property sales between 2005 and 2007 was due to the project, the RCP's entire investment
costs would be covered by this increase). Consumer views also indicate economic viability.
C A / M service fees cover operational costs, yet services are in demand, even when
municipal taxes are added. In RCP's 2008 beneficiary survey,26the main need expressed by
clients was for improved facilities in the registration offices, and the fees for services
received relatively minor complaints. This suggests significant consumer surplus. Taking
account of RCP's good cost-effectiveness and indications of good economic viability, RCP's
efficiency is assessed Substantial.

Risk to Development Outcome
3.36 `The Bulgaria RCP has a Moderate risk to development outcome. The CA and RA are
now established agencies with five or more years of experience, and the potential for
financial independence is there. Clients and the business community appreciate the services
provided (or at least enough to be willing to pay for them), and, based on government's
support to the RCP in the last several years, a functioning land market is recognized as
important for economic development. These factors provide a strong base of demand-led
drivers for a continued good land administration service.

3.37 There are several risk areas (and potential actions to avert them): (i) the current lack
of financial self-sufficiency is one uncertainty. An agreed part of the revenues from fees
could be retained by each agency, eliminating dependence on government budgets; (ii) Also,
there is the risk of untoward political involvement. Government would need to avoid
deleterious actions such as frequent management changes for the implementing agencies; and
(iii) while the double agency institutional model has been made operational, albeit with some
difficulties, merging the CA and RA into a single agency would provide a better coordinated
and more autonomous institution with greater facility to become&mncially and managerially
independent. Nevertheless, the growing strength of CA's and RA's management, and of
stakeholder interest, provide a buffer against such risks, although risk to development
outcome would be reduced yet further with the stronger institutional structure provided by a
single agency.




24. A question can also be posed regarding the limits of RCP's objective. Development of the property market
is not the only economic impact to be expected from improved land administration services. Security of tenure
would, in principle, provide incentives for investment on the property (new or additional machinery for an
urban enterprise, equipment, etc.) with a view to increase productivity.
25. Moreover, international experience is that real estate values and access to mortgages based on land
collateral, are significantly enhanced when land boundaries are clear and ownership legally established.

The Larger Context for Further Impact
3.38 As indicated in the evaluation above, RCP has successfully raised the standard of land
administration from a rudimentary base to an increasingly effective service. One of the
factors instrumental to this success has been the sharp focus of the project, exclusively to the
land administration activities of the two specialized land agencies. As Bulgaria's land
administration program goes forward, continued close attention of the CA and RA to their
core functions remains essential. Two operational areas that should receive further attention
are achieving financial independence, and examining the possibility of migrating to a single-
agency institutional structure. Two further perspectives could also be considered: the
efficiency of other institutions involved with land administration, and the broader business
environment associated with the land market. These opportunities are discussed below
(advantages of the single-agency approach are reviewed under Efficacy).

ACHIEVING
        FINANCIAL SELF-SUFFICIENCY

3.39 Both the cadastre and registration agencies are able to cover their operating costs
through their fees; by a narrow margin for the CA, and with substantial surpluses for the RA
(Table 5).Together, they had a net surplus in 2008 of BGN 46 million ($34 Million). The
surplus is about 69 percent of the total RCP costs at completion.

3.40 However, cost coverage is not enough; financial independence is the key need.
Without this, the sustainability of the RA's and CA's operations could not be assured over
time.27In IEG mission discussions with the CA and RA, several steps were identified to help
achieve such financial independence:

         Each agency to keep (or retain an agreed percentage), the fees it collects to cover
         staff, operating costs and renewals (of equipment, software and infrastructure) for an
         agreed development program. (Currently, all fees go to Government, and the CA and
         RA are then financed from the general budget. By law, the RA is entitled to keep 25
         percent of the fees it collects, but this has never been practiced.)


27. At appraisal, intentions to achieve financial self-sufficiency were expressed although an action path to
achieve this was not elaborated: "The project will focus on the development of the Cadastre Agency to run
along business lines including cost recovery to ensure that the system is sustainable." (PAD, section B.3).
                                               19

        Fees to be determined by the agency to cover the above costs (with oversight by a
        regulator, as typical for a utility). The present practice is for fees to be set nationally
        with limited reference to CNRA needs.
        Special consideration for the CA. The CA's fees only just covered its operating costs
        in 2008. By their nature cadastral activities have a public good element (e.g.
        systematic mapping, geodetic control, digitization of former paper records), while
        fees can only charge for private services such as preparation of sketches, etc. There is
        the option of raising fees for these private services to also cover such general
        services, but there may be practical limits to this.
    0   Merging of CA and RA. A single agency would resolve the financing issue for the
        CA. As typically found internationally, RA's registration fees amply cover its service
        provision costs, and leave a substantial surplus that could be used to cross-subsidize
        part of cadastral costs.

ENHANCING IMPACTS OF LAND ADMINISTRATION - GOING BEYOND THE CA AND RA
        THE

3.4 1 Tackling bottlenecks in registration processes outside the purview of the RA and CA
has considerable and largely untapped potential to improve the efficiency of land
administration. For the customer, the end result is what counts - the time and cost of the
entire registration process, from (in the case of a purchase) decision to buy to when the title
deed is received. The RA has now reduced its registration service standard to one day (three
days in peak periods). But other agencies are involved, and significant further improvements
in efficiency would need to involve improving their processes as well. As example, the
municipality and tax department take respectively 2-3 and 3-7 days each These and other
procedures (Appendix A, Table 1) are now the primary bottleneck to improve the efficiency
of land registration.

3.42 It was a sensible strategy for RCP to focus uniquely on getting the dysfunctionalhon-
existent land and registration services going. This was already a tough challenge and was a
good first step. But now, in parallel with continuing the improvement of the RA and CA,
attention to the other agencies and processes will yield the largest gains in the efficiency of
registration. The current efforts by RA/CA to establish "one-stop-shops" combining
processes is a potentially promising avenue in this direction.

THEBROADER BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
3.43 Bulgaria's goal to develop the land and real property market and to enhance
investments across all main sectors (housing, industry, agriculture and services) is also
stimulated by other aspects of the business environment. The ease of getting permits for
construction, which is often associated with purchase of land, is one such factor. Thus, in the
case of a real estate buyer who plans to install or expand a building on the land to be
purchased, if construction permits are particularly difficult to obtain, this in effect adds to the
cost of registering the property. Here, according to Doing Business 201 0, there are major
inefficiencies. Getting a construction permit involves 24 procedures and 139 days, putting
Bulgaria in the 119`hplace out of 193 countries in the global ranking for obtaining a
construction permit. Bulgaria's RCP is limited to land administration - an already difficult
task. But, the project's objectives to develop the land administration service are placed in a
                                                           20


broader perspective if government considers the business environment as a whole. Land
administration may be improved, but high costs and delays in starting construction can be
expected to constrain the attractiveness of investing in real estate, and in turn reduce fluidity
in the land market. A consideration for Government would be to identify and tackle the most
significant constraints in the broader business environment that also impinge on the land
market.

Bank Performance
QUALITY ENTRY
      AT

3.44 Technically, the project was well prepared. Clear guidance was provided in the PAD
and the project design remained mostly valid throughout project implementation. The Bank
team provided extensive technical guidance as most project activities were new to Bulgaria.
This included hands-on guidance as Government created the CA and prepared the project's
underpinning legislation. On the cadastral side the project had the basic requirements for
implementation - the CA was already established with supporting legislation before Board
approval. But land registration services did not even have an institution to undertake the
work. At its face value, delaying Board presentation until the RA had been established would
have been a more prudent course of action.

3.45 On the other hand, initiating the RCP before it was ready may represent one of those
situations where strategic considerations outweigh "good practice." For Bulgaria, with
accession to the EU imminent and with a pressing need to stimulate economic growth to a
higher path, there was a particular need to free up basic factor markets - not least, the land
market. Tenure security could be substantially improved with cadastral work alone, which is
already a significant benefit. Further, if there are no legal, credit market or other constraints,
secure tender would provide better conditions for investing to make the property more
productive. But market development would have increasing constraints over time as
registering transactions would need to use the cumbersome procedures that then existed.
Thus, there is a case for considering that the further benefits from registration services, while
evidently needed, could as a second best come later. Going ahead while recognizing that
development would be uneven between cadastre and registration activities could make sense,
despite the more prudent course of action referred above. Nevertheless, if this was the
implicit thinking, project design would best have been tailored to a more graduated and
smaller land registration component.

3.46 The intended institutional structure for land registration also raises questions. The
PAD envisaged establishing a small coordination unit within the Ministry of Justice.28
Hands-on implementation was assumed to be handled by staff in the district courts. Specialist
land administration staff would be lacking and court staff would have other judicial duties to
handle. Yet the coordination unit and district courts were presumed to take land
administration from the barely functional to a modern and effective service. Based on global
experience, a structured cadre of full-time land professionals at headquarters and in the field

28. This unit was to be called the Property Registration Control and Management Unit and was to be established
within the Ministry of Justice (PAD, page 11).
                                                 21

would have been better. The weak initial institutional arrangements for registration (which
were later corrected during project implementation) are nevertheless countered by the strong
quality at entry of the technical aspects of the project and of the institutional arrangements on
the cadastral side. Overall, quality at entry was Satisfactory.

QUALITY SUPERVISION
      OF

3.47 The Quality of Supervision was Highly Satisfactory. The supervision team included
the technical specialists needed and responded at critical junctures with more intense and
frequent missions (there were five missions in FY06 during project restructuring). The team
was effective in helping resolve bottlenecks and providing guidance to Bulgaria as it took on
land administration activities which were mostly unfamiliar. This enabled a major
improvement in project performance, and the substantial achievement (with two additional
years) of the project's objectives. The only significant question is whether the project should
have been declared 'unsatisfactory earlier than 2004 - at that time the land registration
program had hardly begun. Nevertheless, Bank attention to the issues was considerable -
supervision intensity was high during the critical 200 1-2003 period (intervals between
missions averaged four months), and dialogue with Government was at senior level - broadly
what one would expect had the project been rated unsatisfactory earlier. Supervision further
intensified in the second part of the project period, under task management from Sofia. This
enabled hands on work with the agencies and contributed to the spurt in project activities.

3.48 Remarks by the CA and RA to the IEG mission about the Bank's performance, during
both preparation and implementation of the project, were consistently favorable; in particular
as regards the Bank's technical expertise, its hands-on guidance, and its greater access to
government for promoting reforms. Ultimately, a strong supervision performance and
detailed technical assistance to Government during project preparation, including for the
institutional structure of the CA and legal aspects, outweighed the initial institutional
shortfalls for registration at project start-up, and led to a successful project outcome. The
Bank's overall performance is rated Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT
        PERFORMANCE

3.49 As up-front actions, the Government took two significant actions that formed a base
for the RCP: the passing of the law on Cadastre and the Property Register; and the creation of
the CA. The main issue was the Ministry of Justice's reservations about forming a
registration institution. Nevertheless, the RAY   while established late, became much more than
the implementation cell planned at appraisal2' - it became, with government support, a "real"
agency, with its own specialist staff, facilities, budget, mandate and management. This was a
leap beyond the idea at appraisal to just have a small coordinating cell, the more so given that
creation of an independent agency was politically difficult as it impinged on the powers and
long-term vested interests of the Ministry of Justice, the district courts and other parties.
Once the RA had been established, proactive engagement by Government supported a

29. The cell was termed the "Property Registration Control and Management Unit." (PAD page 18)
                                                           22


turnaround in RCP's performance. Taking Government performance as a whole, while the
institutional arrangements for registration could have been resolved earlier, Government's
strong and ultimately successful performance in later years, warrants a Satisfactory
assessment overall.

          AGENCIES
IMPLEMENTING

3.50 Once created (the CA in 2001 and the RA in 2004), both agencies progressively built
themselves up and have become effective institution^.^' They have established a nationwide
land administration program, with facilities, trained staff and modern information
technology. Based on beneficiary surveys and confirmed from IEG mission field interviews,
clients appreciate their services. Both agencies have exceeded project targets, and have
successfully continued the land administration program after the project period. The
implementation capacity of the two agencies provides a good base for further development.
Another consideration that reflects well on Bulgaria - both government and the RA/CA - and
on the Bank, is the relatively short time it has taken to establish the institutional capability
and experience to enable the country to continue without further Bank support. At appraisal,
RCP was considered as a first tranche of a 15 year program.31Yet the implementing
agencies, while appreciative of Bank expertise and support, do not consider further Bank
assistance a critical need. It is not uncommon for the Bank to be involved developing a land
administration program over a 12 to 15 year period, involving two or more consecutive
projects.32Performance of the implementing agencies was Highly Satisfactory.

3.5 1 The performance of Government and the implementing agencies were strong in most
respects. Borrower Performance is rated as Satisfactory overall.



4. Lessons
4.1      The experience gained under the Bulgaria RCP yields the following Main lessons:

 (i)   While land administration through a "dual-agency" approach (separate institutions
for cadastre and registration) can work, a uniJied agency is preferable as program
implementation is easier and eflciency gains more attainable than with a single agency.

30. The degree to which institutional arrangements for registration have gone is not reflected in the ICR. Also
not reflected is the time frame within which the two agencies were established and developed to their current
competence. By comparison, recognizing that development of land administration systems is a long-term
process, it is not uncommon for the Bank to provide support over more than one project. Bulgaria is proceeding
without such further Bank engagement, and, while a second Bank project would probably add value, to date,
Bulgaria has managed well without external support.
31. Thus, from the PAD (page 2) "The implementation of an integrated cadastre and registration system to
cover the whole country would be phased over a period of 15 years. The proposed project will cover the first
five full years of this comprehensive program."
32. For instance, Thailand had three projects, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan are in their second projects.
                                                 23

-
    Nevertheless, practical steps can be taken to reduce the disadvantages o a dual-agency
                                                                            f
    system. Bulgaria, once both the CA and RA had been established, moved fast, and the RCP's
    project objectives were achieved. Actions that helped the dual-agency model to work
    included: establishing a PIU providing a coordination bridge between the CA and RA; and,
    later, the unified information technology system providing fully shared data. Nevertheless,
    there would be further benefits with a single agency, amongst these: that coordination
    between activities would become seamless; financial self-sufficiency would be easier;
    registration efficiency would be faster; and there would be greater convenience for customers
    (paras. 3.3 to 3.33).

    (ii)    Establish the institutional and legal base for land administration prior to a project.
    Government had passed a law establishing the legal basis for land administration more than a
    year before Board approval, and the CA was established six months before approval. But the
    registration coordination unit was not established until 16 months after Board approval.
    Registration activities only got going after the RA had been created. (paras. 3.4 to 3.49).

    (iii) The need for agencies, dedicated only to land administration. Having only a
    coordination unit within the Ministry of Justice to oversee land administration activities of
    the district judiciaries was inadequate. District judiciary staff were not solely answerable to
    the coordination unit and had many other duties besides land administration. It was not until
    the RA was formed -a specialized agency with trained, full-time staff and a clear command
    structure - that land registration got off the ground (para. 3.4).

    (iv) Formalfinancial autonomy for land-revenue generating administration agencies is
    preferable as financial self-sufficiency is more easily attained and thefinancial status
    assuresfinancial and administrative stability. RA and CA already have combined inflows
    from fees that cover operating costs. However, the fees or a portion thereof need to be
    retained by the agencies, and cadastral activities may need cross-subsidization from the RA
    to the CA. (This would be simpler if the CA and RA were merged to one institution.)
    Financial self-reliance would better assure adequacy of funds and provide more
    administrative autonomy (para. 3.39).

    (v)      Signifwant further improvements in the functioning o land markets can be gained by
                                                                 f
    improving the efficiency o land administration processes outside the purview o the
                               f                                                    f
    specialist land agencies. The RA has now reduced the time taken for its part of the
    registration process to one day. However, another 6 to 13 days are required for other
    institutions (The Municipality, Tax Department, etc.) to do their work. The opportunities for
    future improvements in efficiency will come primarily from these institutions (paras. 3.4 1
    and 3.42).

    (vi) Land market constraints in the broader business environment merit consideration.
    The RCP, by making land administration processes more efficient, has played a significant
    facilitating role in liberalizing the land market. But in broader terms this is not the only
    important influence on the land market. For instance, getting a construction permit, a
    frequent sequitur when a business buys a property, takes about 140 days and involves 24
    procedures (para. 3.43).
                                                  24


 (vii) Possible adverse impacts on weaker social groups (such as the poor, women and
 illiterate) o land administration projects should be averted by speciJicproject design
              f
features. The impact on, and utilization oJ;services, by such groups should be monitored and
 analyzed as implementation proceeds, Minimal information is available in Bulgaria on social
 influences, the typical view being that the land administration program is "neutral" in its
treatment of all persons. However, in a number of countries, also with no difference in
 approach between social groups, inequalities have been found, as well as practical solutions
 (paras. 3.15 and 3.16).

(viii) When deciding on the number and distribution o land administration offices, the
                                                          f
trade-off between uniform coverage and accessibility on the one hand and cost-effectiveness
on the other should be considered. In the case of Bulgaria there is a logic in following the
Government administrative system, with one land administration office for each of the
country's court towns. This provides the same density of coverage as for other Government
services. For smaller offices, however, less costly alternatives to permanent offices, such as
part-time or mobile offices, could be considered (para. 3.14).
