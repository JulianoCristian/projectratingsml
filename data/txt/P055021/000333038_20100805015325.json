Lessons learned include: Government\n            had passed a law establishing the legal basis for land\n            administration more than a year before Board approval, and\n            the Cadastre Agency (CA) was established six months before\n            approval. But the registration coordination unit was not\n            established until 16 months after Board approval.\n            Registration activities only got going after the\n            Registration Agency (RA) had been created. Having only a\n            coordination unit within the Ministry of Justice to oversee\n            land administration activities of the district judiciaries\n            was inadequate. District judiciary staffs were not solely\n            answerable to the coordination unit and had many other\n            duties besides land administration. It was not until the RA\n            was formed a specialized agency with trained, full-time\n            staff and a clear command structure that land registration\n            got off the ground. RA and CA already have combined inflows\n            from fees that cover operating costs. However, the fees or a\n            portion thereof need to be retained by the agencies, and\n            cadastral activities may need cross-subsidization from the\n            RA to the CA. The RA has now reduced the time taken for its\n            part of the registration process to one day. However,\n            another 6 to 13 days are required for other institutions\n            (The Municipality, Tax Department, etc.) to do their work.\n            The opportunities for future improvements in efficiency will\n            come primarily from these institutions. The RCP, by making\n            land administration processes more efficient, has played a\n            significant facilitating role in liberalizing the land\n            market. But in broader terms this is not the only important\n            influence on the land market. For instance, getting a\n            construction permit, a frequent sequitur when a business\n            buys a property, takes about 140 days and involves 24 procedures."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
