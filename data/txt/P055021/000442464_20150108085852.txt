 SYNOPSIS

   Bulgaria’s efforts to transition to a market economy were rewarded by membership in the European
   Union in 2007 but the country still faced steep challenges to elevate the income of its more than seven
   million people to the average seen in the EU. Partnering with IBRD, Bulgaria continues to make great
   strides in improving financial management, channeling increased revenue to programs that are deliver-
   ing new or improved water connections, better schools, and renovated homes for the elderly.

combination of analytical depth that brings both global
and regional best practice, substantial financing, and
hands-on implementation experience based on detailed
country and sector knowledge. It is considered a trusted,
unbiased partner and solid reform proponent that, over
the years, contributed substantially and transparently
to policy dialogue with stakeholders and civil society in
Bulgaria. Given EU membership and advanced middle-

Good Practices Developed/
Replicated (Optional)
ÔÔ   Close consultation and stakeholders involvement not
     only improved the quality of the analytical work but
     also increased receptiveness of stakeholders to the pol-
     icy recommendations, many of which are sensitive and
     touch upon vested interests.
ÔÔ   Dissemination of analytical work: A deliberate and
     carefully focused dissemination strategy was an essen-
     tial ingredient to enhancing the impact of reports and
     recommendations.
ÔÔ   Policy dialogue in the context of the development poli-

     elements of the government’s reform agenda.
ÔÔ   Synergies between investment and policy lending of-

                               The establishment of a Digital Property Register and a modern joint

                               the project. Each property was incorporated in the new centralized
                               information system. This includes both village houses in countryside and
                               the urbanized parts of the country.

                               The information system is designed to service both the general public
                               and companies. The Registry Agency offers on-line verification service.
