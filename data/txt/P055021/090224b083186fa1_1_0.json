The Revenue Administration\n            and Reform Project supported the integration of tax and\n            social contribution revenue collection, to improve the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of the public revenue\n            collection system in Bulgaria and facilitate private sector\n            development. The Social Investment and Employment Promotion\n            Project brought school improvements, energy efficiency,\n            water supply and sewerage to small villages, and enabled\n            rehabilitation of homes for the elderly and for children\n            without parental care. The Registration and Cadastre Project\n            contributed to a secure and efficient real estate market.\n            Bulgaria continued to make great strides in improving\n            financial management and channeling increased revenue to\n            programs that were delivering improved water connections,\n            better schools, and renovated homes for the elderly."}, "docdt": "2010-09-21T07:24:02Z"}
