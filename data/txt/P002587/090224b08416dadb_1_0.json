Co-financing of US73.4 million was\n            expected at the time of Board presentation, based on\n            information received from several donor organizations. Part\n            of the expected project co-financing has not materialized.\n            This has resulted in a delay in the effectiveness of the IDA\n            credit, because a condition of effectiveness was that the\n            Government obtains US$50 million in co-financing. The\n            Board's approval is sought to amend the credit\n            agreement by removing a condition of effectiveness and a\n            dated covenant, and by providing for a review of available\n            co-financing by March 31, 1986. The proposed amendments are\n            summarized in attached two."}, "docdt": "1985-03-25T22:06:01Z"}
