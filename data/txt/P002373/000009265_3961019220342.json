cost-effectiveness and\n            more relevance for Senegal's economic development. To\n            this end, the project will help the government refocus the\n            activities of its two universities around their pedagogic\n            mission, while reinforcing management capacity and quality\n            control. Specific objectives are as follows: 1) to reinforce\n            library services; 2) to improve teaching; 3) to improve\n            research; 4) to develop a maintenance system; 5) to\n            strengthen management and public and private financing; and\n            6) to complete the reorganization of student services. The\n            project comprises the following four main components: 1)\n            improvement of library services which will include: (a)\n            expansion and rehabilitation of the central library of the\n            Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar; and (b) acquisition of\n            books and periodicals/library management; 2) upgrading of\n            teaching and research consisting of: (a) reinforcement of\n            applied science teaching; (b) development and pilot testing\n            of an accreditation system; (c) management of a university\n            research fund; (d) study of alternative models for teaching\n            and financing; and (e) information of computerized\n            information service; 3) strengthening of management capacity\n            involving: (a) reorganization of student services; (b)\n            development of maintenance system; and (c) project\n            administration; and 4) refinancing of 3 project preparation\n            facility advances."}, "docdt": "1996-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
