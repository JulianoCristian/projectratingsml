The primary objective of the\n            project was to foster more rapid industrial growth by\n            advancing Indian companies' adjustments to the\n            significant reforms in the regulatory environment that had\n            already occurred. The Bank performance was satisfactory in\n            identification, preparation, appraisal and supervision.\n            Borrower\u2019s performance was highly satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned from the project were (a) that this\n            experience illustrated the value of an early beginning and\n            continuing policy dialogue on sector problems and their\n            possible solutions, as part of a sustained Bank government\n            working relationship; (b) this along with extensive Bank\n            economic analysis contributed to substantial agreements on\n            sweeping policy and institutional changes; (c) the project\n            per se illustrated that there can be merit in judicious\n            separate investment lending untied to but supporting these\n            dialogues and in so doing, it provided a mechanism to\n            monitor and discuss important sector changes."}, "docdt": "1996-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
