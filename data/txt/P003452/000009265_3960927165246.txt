MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PRWECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 38.5 million (US$50.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and would help finance a vocational
and technical education project. The project would be parellel-financed by
Federal Republic of Germany with a grant of US$7.0 million.
2.       Ba kgtond.  As its economy expands, China is experiencing serious
shortages of workers with technical skills. The Government therefore has
increasingly emphasized the development of secondary vocational and technical
education (VTE) to provide the technical manpower required by rapidly expand-
ing national economy. The Government's increasing emphasis on VTE is evi-
denced in the following objectives of 1985 Education Reform: (a) signifi-
cantly expanding enrollment in upper secondary VTE, to 50% by 1990; (b)
'training before employment," which shifts training responsibility from enter-
prises to schools and individuals; (c) requiring state enterprises to recruit
under a labor contract system rather than through assignmeut; and (d) develop-
ing programs to correct the serious shortages of specialized teachers in VTE.
In 1987, the Bank Group completed a sector study of the VTE system (Report No.
6789-CHA) in China. The principal findings include the following: (a) ineffi-
cient use of existing VTE infrastructure, especially teacher time and
workshop/laboratory facilities; (b) inadequate coordination among key govern-
mental bodies, particularly the State Education Commission (SEdC), the
Ministry of Labor (MOL) and provincial authorities, and with local employers;
(c) the need for improvement in the quality of education, through provision of
more relevant equipment, books and instructional materials, better training
for teachers and administrators, use of more modern instructional methods, and
curriculum reform to move away from narrow and inflexible curricula which are
not responsive to changing skill requirements; and (d) the inappropriateness
of establishing an across the board increase to 50% of VTE enrollments, given
the wide variation in resources, capabilities, and demaud for graduates in
different regions/provinces of China. The Government has since come to the
same conclusion and is proceeding to increase the percentage of upper
secondary school students enrolled in VTE at a more deliberate pace than
required by the 1990 target, consistent with the financial capabilities of
provinces and municipalities to fund the incremental costs of VTE, the
existing differences in the development of secondary education, and labor
market requirements among the various provinces and municipalities.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  As part of its support to China's
success with its ongoing economic reforms, the Bank Group has identified the
rapid growth and qualitative improvement of the VTE system as one of the
critical elements for smooth progress in implementing the reforms. The Bank
Group's extensive international experience in VTE, knowledge about the Chinese
educational system throug' six education projects under implementation, and
its recent policy dialogue through the VTE sector work, puts it in a unique



-2-
position to help the Government in its efforts to rapidly expand and lmprove
the VTE system. Since VTE development is largely a provincial/municipal
responsibility, the Bank Group involvement will allow stronger coordination
between provinces and the central governmental bodies, particularly the SEdC,
MOL, and provincial authorities. Through this project, the Bank Group is
beginning the development of a new strategy for supporting education in China.
Previous projects implemented by SEdC have typically spread resources
relatively equally among provinces. This project would focus its efforts on
five highly industrialized provinces and municipalities (Liaoning, Jiangsu,
Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai), which will serve as models for VT! development
and effective use of resources In the VTE system. The project would also
assist 12 other provinces to improve the VTE system.
4.       Projegt Objectives.  The project objectives would be to: (a) expand
enrollments and improve the quality and efficiency of upper secondary VTE and
technical teacher training systems; (b) strengthen the capacity of the
national VTE system to improve curriculum and adapt the training system to
changing requirements; and (c) increase the capacity of S&dC, MOL and
provincial/municipal education commissions, especially in the five key
provinces, to manage the VTE system.
5.       Prolect Descrintion.  To achieve these objectives the project would
support improvements in selected existing VT! schools and teacher training
institutions, create VTE research and development centers, and strengthen the
anagement capability of the VTE system. Exlsting secondary VT! schools would
be transformed into vocational training centers (VTCs), wilch would provide
models for future development of the VTE schools. The improved facilities in
VTCs and technical teacher training colleges (TTCs) and university teacher
training departments (TTDs) would also be made available to other neighboring
institutions. The project would consist of the following components: (a)
development of 59 VTCs which would serve as models for development of VTE; (b)
upgrading of 9 TTCs and 3 TTDs to expand enrollments and lmprove the quality
of laboratory and workshop instruction; (c) establishment of a national and 2
regional VTE research and developments (R&D) centers to research and recommend
policy measures to improve the quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of
the VTE system; and (d) improvement of the management capability of the VTE
system. The proposed project would be carried out over five and a half years
and would provide construction, instructional equipment, books and teaching
materials, and related technical assistance (TA). The total project cost is
estimated at US$91.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$40.3 million (44%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  A map, IBRD #21582 is attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7672, dated May 15, 1989 is being distributed.
6.       Agreed Actions.  To make the VTE system at all levels more efficient,
cost-effective and responsive to changing needs of the rapidly developing
economy, the Government has agreed to: (a) abandon the present practice of
scheduling classes only in the mornings and laboratories and workshops
activities in the afternoons to increase utilization rate: (b) increase the
recurrent budgets of the project institutions to cover additional costs
incurred to accomodate participants from nearby schools; (c) increase the



-3-
minimum weekly teaching hours per VTC teacher to 12-14 hours from 6-10 hours
-and to 10 hours per TTC/TTD teacher from 4.6 hours; (d) establish teacher
qualification standards and upgrade all project institution teachers who do
not meet the qualification criteria; (e)improve balance between the numbers of
teaching and non-teaching personnel by reducing the latter; (f) improve the
effectiveness of industry liaison cemmittees, so that the changing needs for
skills can be reflected in the development of the VTE curriculum; (g) set up a
Student Counseling Office at each project VTC, and add 'counseling" as a
teaching subject at the TTCs/TTDs; (h) set aside a sufficient number of
student places each year in the TTCs/TTDs for students from less developed
non-project provinces and autonoous regions, where opportunity for techn'.cal
teacher training is limited; (i) phase out the departments/sections that now
train teachers of general subjects from the TTCs/TTDs to concentrate all of
their resources on training technical teachers; (j) require VTC teachers to
teach both the theory and related practical work to improve consistency in the
content and interpretation of specialized courses; and (k) provide additional
funr-a each year specifically to upgrade equipment in non-project VTE schools.
In addition, the Government has agreed that: (a) it would carry out the TA
program as agreed with IDA; and (b) it would provide an annual report on
progress with the above mentioned actions and hold a mid-term project review
with IDA.
7.       Benefts.  The principal benefits of the proposed project would be
to: (a) an expansion and improvement in the quality of 59 secondary VTE
schools selected to become VTC8 as "Centers of Excellence"; (b) a wide
demonstration effect throughout the provinces and municipalities in which the
VTCs would be located; (c) an expansion and quality improvement of nine TTCs
and three TTDs; (d) development of a needed R&D capibility to bring about the
necessary changes in curriculum, teaching methods, and coordination with the
labor market; (e) enhanced capability in planning, management, and evaluation
in the VTE system; and (f) rapid and coordinated development of the entire VTE
system in five key provinces through the concentration of 588 of the total
Credit and FRG funds to assist all segments of VTE in these provinces - VTCs,
teacher training, research and development, and audio-visual and teaching
materials production.
S.       Risks. The main risk is delay due to the inexperience of
provincial/municipal authorities with Bank Group-financed activities. This
would be reduced by participation of the Foreign Investment Loan Office of
SEdC, which has had considerable experience in implementing Bank Group-
financed projects. There is also a risk that over the long-term new project
approaches may not be sufficiently replicated because of financial
constraints. Prospects for new forms of financing from industry and other
sources would be studied under the project. The Bank Group would support this
work by synthesizing relevant lessons of international experience.
9.       Recommendat      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
