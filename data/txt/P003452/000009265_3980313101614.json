Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Vocational and Technical Education\n            Project in China. The main objectives of the project were to\n            expand, upgrade and increase the efficiency of the secondary\n            vocational and technical education (VTE) system with\n            emphasis on improvements in the quality of the system,\n            including its institutions at all levels. The project is\n            rated generally satisfactory in that it initiated a process\n            of quality and efficiency improvements in the VTE system\n            that are now accelerating with the pace of economic reform.\n            The main lessons learned from the project are: (a)\n            establishment of Industrial Liaison Committees is a useful\n            vehicle in promoting increased participation of industries;\n            (b) a monitoring and evaluation system is essential to track\n            implementation and assess project impact; and (c) under the\n            project, more supervision resources, both in terms of staff\n            time and appropriate technical expertise, should have been\n            provided by IDA."}, "docdt": "1997-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
