The first lesson suggests\n            that building human resource and research capacity is a\n            long-term endeavor that requires concerted public efforts.\n            The Scientific and Technological (S&T) capacity building\n            strategy has been reinforced by  the National Council for\n            Science and Technology (CONACYT) co-funding of scholarships\n            and research grants with state governments (Mixed Funds) and\n            line ministries (Sectoral Funds). This is an example to be\n            considered by other countries, as a way to leverage the use\n            of public resources, increase policy coherence, and maximize\n            development impact. Following lessons indicate that\n            effective support programs for private sector technology\n            development, require adequate time for demand to be properly\n            articulated. And, related  programs should also allow\n            resources help finance the formulation of new technological\n            projects due to private sector weaknesses in technological\n            areas. Related to the above, the importance of dissemination\n            activities cannot be underestimated. The successful\n            implementation of new S&T programs requires\n            well-designed dissemination programs that are able to reach\n            targeted beneficiaries. Lessons further reinforce that\n            Project design should be simple and flexible to facilitate\n            implementation and allow the project to adapt to changing\n            conditions and emerging opportunities, and as well, Project\n            design needs to define clear performance indicators which\n            are closely connected to project objectives and interventions."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
