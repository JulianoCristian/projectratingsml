The\n            lessons learned indicate if core issues, such as teacher\n            deployment, teacher absenteeism or poor teacher management,\n            are not adequately dealt with, then development inputs, such\n            as improved planning and education system monitoring, are\n            less effective. Importance of ensuring sufficient financial\n            support for non-salary recurrent costs was lacking under the\n            project and limited the impact of some quality-enhancement\n            measures. It was important that BPEP2 instill mechanisms and\n            processes to ensure accountability of public officials to\n            beneficiaries. Adopting a holistic view of education system\n            development over a drive will meet targets. Much of the\n            teacher training under BPEP2 was deemed to be too abstract.\n            Keeping overall responsibility for BPEP2 donor coordination\n            in the hands of His Majesty's Government of Nepal\n            (HMG/N) reduced potential levels of tension, complexity and\n            duplication of efforts.
