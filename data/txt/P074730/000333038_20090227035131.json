For example, advanced procurement\n            actions should have been completed with regard to the\n            contracting of the Non-Government Organization (NGO)\n            management agency during preparation so as to avoid the\n            foreseeable delays that occurred later. Ensure that adequate\n            measures have been incorporated into project design to\n            address identified risks. For example, having identified the\n            capacity needs of the implementing entity, an initial period\n            of intense handholding should have been built into project\n            design to overcome this initial hurdle. Project design needs\n            to be firmly grounded in the country reality. In this case,\n            the country was not quite ready for some of the\n            implementation modalities. A phased approach could have been\n            used while capacity for NGO contracting / NGO service\n            delivery skills were being built up."}, "docdt": "2008-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
