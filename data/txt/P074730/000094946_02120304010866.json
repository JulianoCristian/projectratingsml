{"cdata!": "The National HIV/AIDS Prevention Project\n            will assist the Government of Sri Lanka to curb the spread\n            of HIV infection among its highly vulnerable subpopulations\n            and the population at large, without stigmatizing those who\n            are engaging in high risk behaviors. Furthermore, by acting\n            now to revitalize and expand the tuberculosis control\n            program, Sri Lanka can help reduce the risk of an emerging\n            HIV-associated TB epidemic among the HIV-infected and the\n            non-infected. There are three project components. The first\n            component expands prevention programs for highly vulnerable\n            groups and the general population, in particular youth. The\n            second component develops programs to sustain political and\n            societal commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention and to reduce\n            stigma and discrimination against people living with\n            HIV/AIDS and expands coverage and quality of treatment\n            services and develops research. The third component\n            strengthens multisectoral involvement and capacity, improves\n            the information base for policy decisions and program\n            management, and improves health care waste management. The\n            project will also support efforts to reduce the risk of an\n            emerging HIV-associated TB epidemic among the HIV infected\n            and the non-infected populations."}, "docdt": "2002-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
