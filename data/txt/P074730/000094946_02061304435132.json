Currently\n            environment-friendly, safe, and affordable options may not\n            be available for every situation in Sri Lanka. The risk of\n            health impact from environmental exposure should always be\n            weighed against the risk of accidental infection from poor\n            HCWM. Non-risk HCW will be placed in black polyethylene bags\n            and either bagged for recycling or collected with other\n            municipal waste. Hazardous HCW will be incinerated in double\n            chamber incinerators or alternatively treated with\n            disinfectant-autoclaving and shredding are the recommended\n            technologies. A pit hole with a concrete lining is an\n            alternative solution when underground waters do not risk\n            being contaminated. Anatomical water will be collected\n            separately and transported to a crematorium for\n            incineration. Alternatively it can be dropped into a\n            concrete lime pit or buried at a sufficient depth in a\n            totally enclosed and secured location. Infected blood\n            samples autoclaved or incinerated or incinerated or\n            transported to a suitable facility for disposal. Highly\n            infectious waste shall be autoclaved or alternatively,\n            disinfected in a solution of sodium hypo chlorite in\n            concentrated form and then discarded.
