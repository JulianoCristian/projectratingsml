Re: Credit 3084-NI (Health Sector Modernization Project)
Second Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Dear Minister Montealegre:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua 
(the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the Association) dated July 8, 
1998, as amended on April 25, 2001 (the DCA). Due to a clerical error the Amendment letter of 
April 25, 2001 failed to include the new Category - Category 9 - in Schedule 4 of the DCA, 
dealing with Special Accounts. Consequently, paragraph 1 (a) of Schedule 4 of the DCA shall 
read as follows:
“the term “eligible Categories” means, in the case of the MOH Credit Special Account 
and the NORAD Grant Special Account, Categories (1), (6), (7), (8) and (9) and 
Subcategories (2) (a) and (c), 3 (a), 4 (a) and 5 (a), set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and in the case of the INSS Credit Special Account, 
Subcategories (2) (b), 3 (b), 4 (b) and 5 (b) set forth in the said table;” 
Please signify your agreement with the above by signing and dating the attached duplicate 
of this letter on behalf of the Borrower as its authorized representative under Section 8.01 of the 
DCA and by returning to us the said duplicate duly countersigned.
This Amendment shall have retroactive effect to the day first above written upon receipt 
by the Association of a countersigned original of this Amendment letter.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
ASSOCIATION
