Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua

Categories of Schedule 1 as set forth in the Annex to this Amendment Letter.  
 
This Amendment Letter shall not become effective until the Norwegian Agency for 
Development Cooperation (NORAD) shall have notified its acceptance of the reallocation of 
Grant proceeds shown in the Annex hereto to the Association, in form and substance satisfactory 
to the Association. 
 
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and dating this
