improvement program. It will\n            cover the entire National Irrigation System (NIS) service\n            area of 600,000 ha, benefitting some 430,000 rural families.\n            During the project annual average expenditure on O&M\n            will be increased to about US$ 24.80/ha, a level of about\n            90% of what is estimated to be necessary to maintain the\n            National Irrigation System (NIS)s at maximum productivity.\n            The project will also provide for minor rehabilitation of\n            existing infrastructure; assist in the further development\n            of IAs (Irrigators Association) and expanded beneficiary\n            participation in O&M of all National Irrigation System\n            (NIS)s.
