SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CMEDIT 1200-M;;
PRJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.   This  is  the  Project  Completion  Report  (PCR)  for  the  Second
Telecommunications Project in Mali, for which Crsdit 1200-MLI in the amount of
SDR 11.8 million to the Republic of Mali was signed on April 30, 1982, became
effective on November 24, 1982 and was closed on June 30, 1988, the original
closing date.
2.    The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Division
of the Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and
the Borrower (Part II).
3.    Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final suparvision
mission in April 1988, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report;
the  Credit,  Guarantee,  and  Project  Agreements;  supervision  reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

SECONf TELECOMMUNIgATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT 1200-MLI).
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUWMARY
Project Objectives
1.        The main objectives of the project were to (i) improve OPTM's
organization, management and operations; (ii) provide reliable
telecommunications between the country's main economic centers, with rural
areas and with neighboring countries; and (iii) modernize and expand local
network facilities (paras. 3.02 and 4.01).
2.        The project includeds  (i) the expansion and construction of
local telephone facilities; (ii) expansion of the long distance
transmission network; (iii) support facilities for operation, maintenance
and construction of the networks; and tiv) technical assistance and
training in management, accounting, development planning and operation
(paras. 3.03 and 4.01).
Ezperience and Results
3.        Implementation did not raise difficulties with regard to
procurement, supply and construction. Completion was delayed by about two
years due to late tendering and revision of network design at several
locations. To cope with growing demand, the project component co-financed
by CCCE was redesigned in 1985, increasing capacities and adding exchanges
at new locations. The design of the network component financed by IDA as
well as the credit allocation also had to be revised accordingly (paras.
5.01 to 5.03, and 6.01).
4.        The estimated project cost was CPAP 6.35 billion ($25.3
million), with a foreign exchange component of about 72?. The actual cost
is CFAF 8.43 billion ($23.0 million) also with 722 foreign exchange. The
decrease in US dollar equivalent is due to dollar appreciation. A higher
percentage of the local costs has been financed from IDA credit and the
remaining 102 increase in OPTM's share of project costs was met by self-
generated funds (paras. 5.04 to 5.06).
5.        The physical part of the project went slightly beyond target,
(4,500 additional telephone lines, cumpared with 4,000 at appraisal).  At
project completion, 842 of all 9,200 main working lines had access to
nationwide subscriber dialing service and most of them also had access to
international subscriber dialing.  Overall demand and usage of service grew
in line with appraisal estimates (para. 6.01).



- iii -
6.        In the financial area, the results were well below what was
anticipated at the time of appraisal. The accounting system remained
insufficient and unreliable. Billing was still slow and Government
agencies accumulated further arrears. The target rate of return was not
reached (paras 6.02, 6.03 and 11.02).
7.        The implementation of the institutional component was also
unsatisfactory at the beginning of the project, and to speed up progress in
this area, a sector study was carried out in the context of the Public
Enterprise (PE) Sector Reform Program (credit 1937 and 1938-14LI) in
coordination with the technical assistance under the project. Based on the
study's recommendations, Government is implementing a comprehensive sector
reform, which began in 1988 (paras. 10.01, 11.03 and 11.04).
Findings and Lessons to be Learned
8.        The main findings and lessons to be learned are thats
(a) delay in procurement could have been avoided by financing
preparation of bid documents through PPF (para. 5.02);
(b) a more thorough evaluation of the impact of OPTM's outpayments
to the company providing international carrier facilities should
have been made during appraisal (para. 6.02(e));
(c)  IDA should have further insisted on borrower's compliance with:
(i) the settlement of Government arrears; (ii) the impact of the
1985 tariff studv and the requirement to consult with IDA before
implementing new tariffs (paras. 6.02, 9.01, 10.01 and 11.03);
and
*d) one very positive step was taken when a sector reform program
and action plan was undertaken in the context of the Mali PE
project and in coordination with other donors/lenders (paras.
11.04 and 12.01).
Conclusion
9.        The follow-up of two telecommunications projects has shown that
institutional building and restructuring in Hali is a difficult, complex
and slow process. Appropriate coordination and complementary outside
assistance are required for a long period of time in addition to further
investments in telecommunications, which are necessary to meet the
country's future communications needs. This strongly advocates continued
IDA involvement in Mali's Telecommunications sector, in close cooperation
with other donors.

Subsector s   Telecommunications
2.   Background
2.01      Telecommunications in Mali are under the supervision of the
Ministry of Information and Telecommunications.   During the project
implementation period, operation and development of domestic
telecommunications services were the responsibility of the "Office des
Postes et Telecommunications" (OPT), a public enterprise established in
1960, which also operated the postal services and provided various public
financial services - money orders, postal checking -counts and savings
accounts.  A mixed company, "T4lcommunications Int.- ationales du Mali"
(TIM), jointly owned by the Government (65Z) and a French Company, 'France
Cable et Radio," (352) operated common carrier facilities for international
services.
2.02      IDA has been associated with the telecommunications sector in
Mali since 1972 through two credits. The first credit (Credit 321-MLI) of
$3.6 million, declared effective on April 4, 1973, was closed on June 30,
1979. It supported construction of a microwave link Bamako-Segou, supply
of switching equipment in three main cities and cable work in Bamako.
Implementation suffered considerable delays and cost overrun due to poor
performance of the consultants and to institutional weakness of OPT. A
Project Completion Report was issued on September 30, 1981 and a Projekt
Performance Audit Report on June 6, 1983.  The Credit 1200-MLI, of SDR 11.8
million for the second telecommunications project, for which this is the
completion report, was signed on April 30, 1982 and closed on June 30,
1988. The Public Enterprise Institutional Development project (Cr. 1938
MLI), signed on June 24, 1988, includes a post and telecommunications
component for restructuring the sector with the creation of two new
entities--one responsible for postal services and the other for all public
telecommunications services, including international ones. A decision has
also been reached to create, out of OPT's financial services arm, an
independent financial institution subject to banking regulations.
3.   Project Oblectives and Description
3.01      In March 1978, the Government of Mali requested IDA's assistance
in financing the second telecommunications project, which was part of its



- 2 -
1981-85 telecommunications investment program. The project was prepared by
OPT with the assistance of consultants financed through a PPF. The project
was appraised in January!February 1981 and negotiations were held in
November 1981. The credit of SDR 11.8 million was approved by IDA's Board
ou January 7, 1982 and the credit agreement with the Government of Mali was
signed on April 30, 1982 (para. 2.02). A project agreement between IDA and
OPT was also signed on the same date.
Proiect Objectives
3.02      The objectives of the project were tot
(a) provide reliable telecommunications between all the
main economic centers of the country;
(b) improve and expand local telephone services in Bamako,
in provincial towns, important district centers, and
rural and remote areas;
(c) improve international facilities and introduce
subscriber trunk dialing (STD) and links to
neighboring countrips;
(d) improve and expand domestic r.nd international telex
service; and
Ce) improve OPT's management and operations.
Project Description
3.03      The project components are:
(a) construction of a new 200-line automatic telephone
exchange in San and extension of trunk switching
facilities in Segou;
(b)  expansion of the local cahle network in Bamako to a
capacity of about 13,000 pairs, construction of new
networks, with a total capacity of about 5,000 pairs,
in eight provincial towns and the connection of about
4,000 additional DELs;
(c) construction of a microwave radio link on the route
Segou-Sevare, and of a number of secondary and rural
radio links;
(d) installation of a telex exchange, with 400 lines
initial capacity in Bamako and the addition of 150
telex subscribers;
(e) provision of teaching aids, tools, instruments,
equipment and vehicles for construction, maintenance,
and operation; and
(f) consultancy services for strengthening OPT's
administration, financial management, operations and
maintenance, and training and fellowships.
4.   Project Design and Organization
4.01      The project was designed to support sector objectives described
in paragraph 3.02 and to complete the investments initially planned under
the First IDA-financed Telecommunications Project. Implementation problems
and cost overruns under the first project had resulted in substantial



delays and subsequent project revisions, including reduction of project
scope. About one half of the second project is made up of components of the
first project which had to be deferred, such as local networks in
provincial towns and long distance transmission links. The other half
included essential elements of the second phase of OPT's 1981-85 investment
program - further extension of local cable networks, new telex facilities,
secondary radio links, rural coverage and support facilities for
construction and maintenance. The project was designed to enable OPT to
meet growth of demand, improve domestic and international services and
increase service penetration into rural areas. The project also aimed at
institutional development and strengthening of OPT's management, in
particular its tclecomunications branch - planning and preparing,
financial management, operation and maintenance, management information and
statistics. Project design and project management organization remained
unchanged throughout implementation in spite of some revisions (para.
5.05).
5.   Proiect Implementation
5.01      Credit Effectiveness and Proiect Start-up:  The Credit Agreement
signed in April 1982 specified July 30, 1982 for credit effectiveness, but
it was only declared on November 24, 1982. This postponement came from:
Mi) difficulties encountered in obtaining the subsidiary loan agreement
between GOM and OPT and the legal opinion on the Credit and Project
Agreements, duly ratified by all necessary authorities; and (ii) delays in
fulfilling conditions of effectiveness of the parallel financing agreement
with CCCE. Improvements could be achieved in this area by better informing
the various parties invol7ed in the document approval cycle. For instance,
these documents and the ratifying procedure could be discussed and
explained at negotiations.
5.02      Procurement:  The first disbursement took place at the end of
1984, two years after effectiveness. This delay could have been avoided by
financing preparation of bid documents through PPF. However, the
procurement process went well with assistance of consultants. Performance
of the suppliers and consultants was satisfactory.
5.03      Proiect Implementation Schedule:  Physical project components
originally scheduled to be completed in December 1986, were completed about
two years behind schedule. Table 3.4 in part III gives details of the
completion dates, estimated and actual, for the main project components.
However, telephone and telex exchanges, microwave links, subscriber
equipment and network construction equipment and tools were delivered as
early as December 1987. Local networks construction was delayed because of
design and procedural changes which also caused cost increases (para.
5.05). Final orders for cables had to be adjusted and cable laying was
rescheduled accordingly. The closing date was not extended because funds
had been fully committed by June 30, 1988 ar.d final delivery and payments
were completed by December 31, 1988. Only about 500 of the 4,000 new
subscribers under the project were left to be connected during the first
semester of 1989. In the financial area, audits were late but the delay
was reduced to eight months for the last audit (1986 accounts), and audits



- 4 -
of the 1987 to 1989 accounts are underway as part of OPT's ongoing
restructuring program under Cr. 1938-MLI.
Project Cost and Revision
5.04      The  .ost of the project was estimated at Malian F. 12.70 billion
or, following ;eintegration of Mali into the West African Monetary Union in
1986, ClAP 6.35 billion (US$25.30 million equivalent) with a foreign
exchange component representing 722 of total cost. The final cost is about
US$23.05 million of which 722 is foreign exchange. Appraisal estimate and
final costs in CFAF were 6.35 and 8.43 billion CFAP respectively. A 33Z
increase in the total project cost expressed in CFAF compares with an 8O
decrease in US dollars, due to dollar appreciation. Consequently, foreign
financing was sufficient, but OPT's share which represented about 102 of
total cost did increase and was barely met by self generated funds. A
comparison of the project costs, as estimated at appraisal and actual as of
December 31, 1988, is shown in Table 3.5.A. of Part III. Project financing
is detailed in Table 3.5.B. Table 3.5.C. indicates the country exchange
rate variations during the project period. 1/
5.05      The cost difference between appraisal and implementation stems
from three main factors:
(a)  the revision of the project component financed by
CCCE, which increased line capacities and added a
number of exchanges within OPT's program, increasing
the project cost by about 352 (Table 3.5.b.) and the
overall program cost by over 2002;
(b)  the use of contractors for civil works and
installation of large local networks contributed to
nearly half the increase of 34Z in local costs; and
(c)  a major portion of civil works had to be done twice
because of an unexpected change in highway
construction.
The additional cost incurred under (b) was more than compensated by the
incremental revenue generated by the faster connection rate of new
subscribers. Concerning item (c), better coordination between OPT and the
Ministry of Transport responsible for road construction could have avoided
a cost overrun of 1312, i.e., 700 MCPAF.
5.06      Allocation of Credit Proceeds:  The original and revised
allocation of proceeds and final disbursement for the credit in SDR, is
given in Part III, Table 3.3.A. The revised allocation was agreed in July
1986 to reflect project revision, which was based on actual costs. It also
reflected the dollar depreciation for the late orders for cables and
11 The exchange rate for the Mali Franc at appraisal was US$1 - MF500 -
equivalent CFAF 250. The annual exchange rate variations were taken into
account in determining the actual cost in US$. This results in an average
rate of US$ = CPAF 366 during the project period.

million for each Bank fiscal year, are shown in Table 3.3.B. of Part III.
6.        Proiect Results
6.01      Physical and Operational Results.  The physical targets of the
project as planned and achieved are shown in Tables 3.4.A. and 3.6.A of
Part III. Growth of DEL's as forecasted at appraisal was revised and
increased, by about 12.52 from 4,000 to 4,500, DEL's to be connected under
the project. It was also anticipated that construction of local networks
in Bamako and the provinces would require about two more years than
initially planned, and full development and usage of the new facilities
would only occur by December 1989. OPT's main operational results and
performance on major indicators is given in Annex 1, on a yearly basis as
estimated during appraisal and actual from 1983 to 1987. During the
project period, actual yearly growth of new telephone connections averaged
about 9Z, compared to appraisal estimates of 12X. At the end of 1987, the
total expressed demand of 3,800 applicants and 8,300 DEL's reached 12,100
lines, which was slightly above the demand of 12,000 lines forecasted at
appraisal. At project completion, 842 of all working DELs had access to
nationwide STD service and most of them had also access to international
subscriber dialing (ISD).
6.02      Financial Performance:  OPT's financial performance has been
well below what was anticipated at the time of appraisal.
(a) Accounts were audited from 1980 to 1986, with a time
lag, which was progressively reduced, since the 1986
audited accounts were available in December 1987;
(b) The status of the accounting system, as described in
the last auditora' report on the 1986 accounts
(February 1988), reads like a calamity list: (i) all
entries are manually made, which causes delays; (ii)
receivables cannot be properly monitored because there
is no updated register of individual subscribers,
which is one explanation for arrears; (Mii) there is
no register of fixed assets (although one was
established under the first IDA project), the amounts
of annual construction expenditure cannot thus be
correctly assessed and there is no possibility of
revaluation; (iv) there is no physical inventory of
stocks; (v) there is no cash management; (vi)
outstanding amounts, due to TIM which is the largest
supplier of services, are not checked with it. In
summary, the accounting system is wholly unreliable.
(c) Billing was still slow (six to seven weeks),
collection improved in 1987 for private consumers due
to enforcement of strict procedures, but there was no
trace of it in the 1986 audited accounts. And
Government agencies have not ,aid for their
consumption during the whole period of the project;



-6
there was compensation in 1984, but bills were never
formally paid. Arrears are a very thorny question.
They are caused by insufficient monitoring of
accounts, though it has improved over the years,
unwillingness to cut off delinquent customers and
opposition of Government to discuss ways of settling
its agencies' accounts, which tend to consume freely
above their budgets.
(d) The tariff study was completed with delay, its conclusions were
not applied and the purpose of achieving the required rate of
return was not taken into account.
(e) The objective rate of return of 122 on revalued net assets was
overstated as outpaymants to TIM were omitted in the appraisal
report from 1980 onwards. The rate reached 7? in 1985 and 1986
on book values, when sharing with TIM was more favorable to OPT,
and after being negative from 1980 to 1982 and low in 1983 and
1984. Apart from the overvaluation of the comparator, the rate
of return did not go higher because of slow increase in revenues
due to the relatively slow commissioning of DEL's. There often
is a noticeable difference in the degree of success between
implementing the physical components and implementing the
institutional ones, as there is generally in the country a
greater purpose and more available competence to achieve
physical investment. The problem is how to motivate managemet
improvements as all aspects of it, quality of accounting,
tariffs, receivables, rate of return, cosc analysis, are
constrained by the country's envirorment and then equally poor.
In spite of adequate supervision and insistence on the weak
aspects of project implementation, the Bank is not, in fact, in
a position to enforce institutional covenants, which are often
difficult to meet by lack of competent or motivated people, not
perceived as essential by the borrower, and not crucial enough
to justify a credit suspension.
6.03      Rate of Return.  The internal economic rate of return of the
project is estimated, on the basis of the last available documents - the
1986 audited accounts and 1988 supervision report - at 162. This falls
short of the 252 calculated at appraisal, which was overvalued (para. 6.02-
e). The main reason is the relative slowness with which new DEL's have
been initially connected to the network, whereas the funds for the
construction program has been disbursed closer to schedule. Anyway, the
economic rate of return is high and this underlines the importance of the
development of the telecommunications sector for the country's economy.
7.        Project Sustainability
7.01      Project Benefit:  The project has had short term benefits that
are significant although lower than expected. They include:
(a) an increase both in the quality and the coverage of
telephone services; and



(b) the turning of OPT into a profit generating entity
with a positive net contribution to government
resources.
7.02      Institutional Impact:  Sustaining and improving those benefits
in the long term will hinge on two factors:
(a)  the establishment of adequate sector institution, in
view of the present fragile situation (pars. 6.02);
and
(b)  the improvement of the strained OPT cash position. The
impact has been limited during the project, but the
institutional set uplrehabilitation will be
strengthened in the framework of the public enterprise
sector reform: Item (a) is being addressed under a
plan to reform the sector institutions, the
implementation of which started in 1986 and will
culminate with the Institutional Development project;
item (b) is related to the reduction of Government
receivables (para. 6.02).
8.        Bank's Performance
8.01      Bank's performance has been satisfactory on the supervision of
the implementation of the physical component but, despite valuable efforts
and insistence, the end result has been mixed on the institutional side.
Supervision was conducted in a timely and adequate manner, but
inastitutional improvements have been difficult to accomplisb on the
borrower's side (para. 6.02) and thus more time and outside assistance than
initially anticipated should have been provided. Table 3.8 in part III
gives details of the supervision missions which were timely and took place
at the pace of about two visits each year.
9.        Borrower's Performance
9.01      Covenants:  Government was the Borrower and OPT was the
implementing agency. The status of compliance with the conditions of the
Credit and Project Agreements is indicated in Table 3.7. The main non-
compliance of Government was its de facto non-payment of telecommunications
consumption due to critical public finance position, though some
compensation of accrued debts was made in 1984. Concerning OPT's
compliance, impact of tariff study was limited, assets revaluation was not
applied, there were considerable delays in submitting the audited financial
statements, and the rate of return covenant was not met (para. 6.02).
10.       Proiect Relationship
10.01     IDA relationship with Government and OPT on the project has been
good. Lack of adequate and timely information on OPT's financial status
and management constituted a handicap in dealing with the managerial and
institutional problems. Nevertheless, good will prevailed and to the



extent possible under the circumstances of project delays and financial
covenant non-compliance, cooperation was obtained and advice con.sidered.
in particular as a result of the ongoing dialogue and consensus building
with IDA supervision missions on institutional issues, in 1986, Government
agreed on a more comprehensive sector restructuring program to be
implemented under the PE project. Also, adequate liaison and communication
were established and maintained under the project with the other donors
(France, Canada, AfDB, UNDP, etc.), largely on IDA's initiative.
11.       Consulting Services
11.01     Technicals  The project provided for technical consultancy
services to assist OPT in project preparation, detailed planning, project
management, and supervision of execution of most of the works. About
40 manmonths of technical expert services were to be financed from the
proceeds of the credit including about 13 manmonths for engineering studies
under PPF. Technical assistance was also provided in parallel under
projects financed from other donors or contributors (France, Canada,
Switzerland, AfDB, UNDP, etc.). Specific assistance for the IDA financed
components was slightly delayed at project start-up pending credit
effectiveness. Due to project revision, additional expertise for about
20 manmonths was required, which was financed in part by IDA
(five manmonths) and the complement by other contributors. In 1987, when
the local networks component was almost completed, albeit lately due to
project program revision and changes (para. 5.05), about 1,000 additional
DELs were connected. This practically doubled the previous record of new
DEL connections by OPT in any past year. As a whole the technical
assistance services provided to OPT were satisfactory.
11.02     Financial Management and Audit:  The project also provided for
consultancy services to assist and advise OPT on financial management and
other managerial and administrative matters. About 20 manmonths of
services were to be financed from the proceeds of the credit, principally
for assets revaluation, audit and advice on overall financial management.
Parallel assistance was also provided from other contributors, in
particular from France. Some additional assistance in these fields was
also required due to the extension of the project period and the slow
attention given by OPT to the reorganization and the compliance with
financial covenants. The quality of the audit services was generally
satisfactory. However, the technical assistance under the project for
OPT's financial management improvement was discontinued by common agreement
between the Government and IDA, since OPT's institutional development as
appraised was substituted, in late 1986, by a more comprehensive scheme
that became part of the Mali Public Enterprise Reform Program (PE), under
IDA's stewardship.
11.03     Studies:  The Project Agreement provided for a tariff structure
study to be completed by December 31, 1982, and for OPT to furnish IDA for
its comments a program for tariffs adjustments on the basis of the study.
Table 3.6.D., Part III, gives details of the purpose of the study and its
partial completion and results. In fact, several tariff adjustments were
made by OPT during the project period based on both the partial tariff
study completed only in 1985 and recommendations from financial consultants



- 9 -
under the project. In particular, tariffs were adjusted in 1982 and 1985
to be in line with tariff changes made in neighboring countries to follow
inflation. Also, in 1986, the distribution of revenues from international
services between OPT and TIM was adjusted from 50-50a to 70-30Z, which
resulted in about doubling OPT's rate of return up to 72 from 3.52 in 1985.
All these measures, however, proved inadequate to enable OPT to meet the
122 rate of return requirement set forth in the Project Agreement (see also
para. 6.02-e). Furthermore, OPT and Government did not consult with IDA.
before implementing new tariffs, as required in the Project Agreement.
11.04     In early 1984, when project status was downgraded for major
managerial and financial problems, and because the institutional and
financial problems of the sector were judged sufficiently acute, it was
recommended during supervision that a comprehensive prograw of studies,
technical assistance and training for accounting and financial management,
be undertaken. This program included: (i) splitting telecommunications and
postal/financial services into two separate entities; (ii) much closer
coordination of the efforts of all lenders/donors, mainly the Bank, CCCE
and Canada; and (iii) incorporating the OPT reform program, and the
supplemental financial requirement, into the PE reform. The program
started in 1985. Table 3.6.D. summarizes the purpose of the studies, their
implementation and impact. Relevant comments in this respect are made in
paras 7.02 and 8.02 above. After considerable amount of discussion
involving the Bank, the Government and other lenders/donors, towards the
end of 1986, the Government decided to implement a major restructuring of
OPTITIM as a component of Mali PE reform. (Cr. 1937 and 1938 MLI). It
started in 1989, on the basis of the studies recommendations and as a
follow-up to the efforts made under the first and second telecommunications
projects to improve the sector. There are still delicate issues of lender
coordination, and search for consensus is necessary on such matters as to
whether to set up the financial services arm of OPT as a separate entity.
12.       Project Documentation and Reporting
12.01     The Development Credit and Project Agreements in the case of
Credit 1200-MLI were not geared to achieve project objectives in the key
areas of sector development and manageriallorganizational improvement. The
appraisal report for the project provided a useful framework for review of
project implementation by both IDA and OPT. Para 6.01, in particular,
indicates that development requirement forecast was realistic and could
have been feasible. OPT submitted the necessary information during project
supervision and through quarterly reports for presentation and updating of
the execution of the works. The reporting and exchange of information was,
however, less thorough and timely with regard to institution building and
improvement of financial management and overall administration of OPT, as,
before 1986, the scope of the institutional component was very modest.
This is often the case when comLined complex public utility sectors such as
post (including financial services) and telecommunications are operated and
managed with little or no financial autonomy from government treasury.
However, this issue is now being tackled under the PE reform and
Institutional Development projects (Credits 1937 and 1938-MLI) and will be
part of specific actions on the future institutional structures for OPT/TIM
and CCP/CNE.



- 10 -
12.02     OPT and Government have been asked to prepare a draft project
completion report to reflect the Borrower's perspective on the project, its
implementation, and its results and impact for the future. The report has
not been received yet.
13.       Conclusion and Recommended Actions
13.01     The first and second telecommunications projects in Mali have
shown that the process of institutional building and restructuring is
complex and slow, involving political, cultural and human resource factors
which require long time for appropriate evolution. Following the basic
decision taken late in 1986 to restructure the post and telecommunications
sector, splitting them into two separate autonomous operating entities, the
Government expressed its wish for continued IDA assistance in the process,
and for the development and further improvement of both services, as a
reflection of its satisfaction for the timeliness and value of Bank's
advice on institutional development. This should enable the Government to
achieve the basic sectoral objectives, in particular with regard to the
management and operation of the services. Several lenders/donors have
indicated their interest in participating in these efforts. Appropriate
coordination and complementary assistance could be exercised by IDA at a
crucial time when restructuring, building up of new organizational set-ups
and action plans for management improvement would have to be defined and
implemented together with an appropriate investment program for the
rehabilitation, balancing and further expansion of the networks. This
would, no doubt, constitute a strong rationale for continued IDA
involvement in the sector.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (CREDIT 1200-MLI)
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
PR  II - COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER ON PARTS I AND III
(As made on June 8, 1990 on Parts I and III of the report, and sent to IDA
under the signature of the Chairman of the Board of the Mali
Telecommunications Company, SOTELMA)
Introduction
In general, the World Bank report reflects our views regarding
project results. However, points that should be reformulated and
additional aspects that would lead to a better understanding of the
evaluation are the subject of the following comments and observations.
ProJect Objectives
3.02      Point c.  The Second Telecommunications Project was designed
essentially to improve the national'telecommunications network through the
construction, modernization and expansion of works (local networks,
transmission trunk lines and switching stations).
Although these activities had a positive impact on the quality
of international service, there was no direct intervention to improve
international facilities, as mentioned in the report.
Proiect Description
3.03      Point d.  The initial capacity of the telex exchange in
accordance with the specifications was 666 lines and not 400.
Point e. Should read the provision of tools, measuring
devices... telephone sets and telex and other equipment...).
Project Implementation Schedule
The delay in construction was due not only to changes in design
(following an increase in requirements), but also the procurement procedure
for network supplies (cables in particular).
Because the contract provided for delivery in three groups, the
delivery dates of which were beyond our control, the resulting materials
shortages considerably impacted the imlementation schedule.



- 12 -
Project cgst and revision
Point c.  The construction works for the roads network did indeed
delay execution, but in no way were responsible for civil works having to be
done twice.
For these works, there was in fact coordination between OPT and
Public Works, as reflected in the conclusion of a negotiated contract between
the two entities that was carried out in full.
Additional costs were due to:
For civil works:
-     an increase in the real needs determined in the field;
-     additional works not envisaged (+ 10 - [?illegible 701) (increment
for works on particularly hard terrain, raised room construction,
etc.);
-     increase in surfacing materials (+ 1251).
For the network:
-     increase in real needs;
-     the revision of unit costs for the third group (+ 292).
Prolect results
The project was carried out to the satisfaction of OPT, as it made
it possible to automate much of its network, expand the telephone system and
improve the quality of service.
In addition to the expansion of the telephone system, the project
helped make a significant improvement to the quality of service. For example,
the rate of line trouble signals in Bamako fell from 1.67 to 1.16.
Nevertheless, the results for maintenance are much more modest.
The targets regarding line repair turnaround had to be revised downward.
Project financing
PZioU b. As regards collections, the firm contracted for the
opening balance sheet recommended that a provision be established for bad
claims in the amount of 4,116 billion at December 31, 1988, out of a total of
7,361 billion to be collected.
In addition, the software for billing private clients (FACT 300)
can be used to monitor client accounts, as introduced on January 1, 1989,
since which time the data have been entered. The information dating to before
that time will be processed manually until this section of the record is
completely updated and then be loaded into the computer.

The auditors do not show any fixed assets reserve as part of the
audit for fiscal 1988.
Moreover, an accounting of TIN is no longer necessary following
its liquidation. A buyout agreement was concluded with the partner, the
financial cost being borne by the State.
Point c. At present (end of May 1990), the billing lag is 22 days
after the end of the 2-month calendar period and 7 more days for bill
distribution. This is after one year.
With the commissioning of the new B10 telephone exchange scheduled
for July 1990, that 22-day billing lag will be reduced to a maximum of 15
days, owing to the automatic transfer of meter readings.
Following the compensatory subsidy in 1984, at December 31, 1989
the State had paid CFAF 3,631 billion for its telephone and telex consumption.
As part of the restructuring of the post and telecommunications
sector, the State will have to considerably cut its telephone and telex
arrears, which at December 31, 1989 totalled nearly CFAF 4,721 billion. In
addition, its 1990 budget includes an appropriation of CFAF 1,846 billion for
telephone and telex services. There has thus been a positive change in the
behavior of the State.
Pgint e. The restructuring of the telecommunications sector has
stressed the aspects that would help improve management:
-     a credit for 36 man-months of consultancy services and financial
management, with a view to establishing the management-finance
function;
-     establishment of a finance and accounting department on the new
organizational chart for SOTELMA (the telecommunications
administration);
-     establishment of new central offices (staff) for functions such as
monitoring/management and auditing.
SOTELMA will increasingly have personnel trained in management
techniques. It plans to use outside expertise, while at the same time
promoting training in management.
Training
This aspect, which was not covered in the report, clearly had a
favorable impact on project results.
The training of 63 agents (42 linemen and 21 foremen) was very
beneficial because it apparently enabled the agents to start on the B10 cable
work and especially to improve their line construction technique.



- 14 -
Financial nerformance
Point . To the best of our knowledge, although the project terms
of reference included a tariff study, this was not done.
However, a tariff study was conducted as part of the 1990-2010
Master Plan. The document has not yet been finalized.
Institutional impact
(a)   The second [? line] should read "it. the light of the poor fit of
the current structure" (para. 6.02 [sic: ?7.02]).
Credit covenants
The report mentions that fixed assets were not revalued. It is
our understanding thst they were indeed revalued in 1984 by the TELESUISSE
consulting firm as part of the project. A supplementary study was prepared by
the same consultant in 1985. One of the reasons that the studies were not
used was the lack of a tariff study.
Conclusion
We concur with the analysis regarding the improvements that could
result from consultations amonig the donors for the management of future
projects.
Improved management would require:
=     Institutional restructuring associated with the legal environment
and legislation relating to the articles of association of the
companies and enterprises and their staff regulations. In this
regard, the legal texts governing SOTELNA are available.
The financial restructuring that remains to be done is at present
the only major outside constraint to the success of the restructuring program.
SOTELMA has a Master Plan for developing communications over a 20-
year period, to be adopted in the near future. Implementation of the Plan
first requires the financial rehabilitation mentioned earlier.
In addition to the assistance that IDA can provide to SOTELMA in
the financing of its investment programs (e.g. continuation of the expansion
of the Bamako network, works at the Segou exchange, Mopti Tombouctou-Gao link,
rural service, etc.), it should also provide financial assistance to help the
enterprise achieve a healthier balance sheet.

1/   As a whole, completion was delayed by about 18 months due to late
tendering for the sophisticated installations (telephone exchange,
microwave links and telex exchange) and deliveries of terminal
equipment (telephone, teleprinter) anl tools, and by about two years
for construction of local networks. No extension of the closing date
was required due to suffic'kent time having been allocated for final
acceptance of the systems.
2/   Following physical completion of the local networks by December 1988,
it was expected that the about 1,000 additional DELs from the
project, still to be connected, would be in service by the end of
1989.

Appraisal Estimate        Actual
Internal Economic Rate of Returns                 251                 16Z
Underlying Assumptions
1.   Incremental revenues assigned to the program are based on the
traffic increase brought about by the program, from 1983 to 1989
(forecasts for the last three years), until 2002.
2.   Incremental costs excluding depreciation and interest are based
on the additional assets, traffic and staff requirements brought
about by the program.
3.   Costs have been deflated to bring them to the 1981 price level
and make them comparable with the capital expenditures.
4.   Revenues have been calculated by estimating a portion of the
consumer surplus, with prices expressed in real terms until the
whole program is comissioned (1989), to show that existing and
new subscribers are willing to buy services at tariffs
increasing with inflation (US producers' price index, multiplied
by rate of exchange index).
5.   Labor has not been shadow priced, as OPT mostly employs skilled
staff of which there is no surplus in Mali.
6.  A sensitivity analysis on the above rate of return shows that
with 1OZ higher capital and operating costs and 10? lower
revenues, the rate of return would be 11X.
7.   A-suwmary of the program incremental cost and benefit streams,
at 1981 price level for cost and at current price level (until
end of the implementation period) for revenues, is as follows:
Capital                     Operating                   Net

Anpraisal Estimate Actual
Internal Financial Rate of Returns             1St               9?
Underlyins Assumptions
They are the same as for the internal economic rate of return,
except that incremental revenues have been deflated to bring them to the
1981 price level.
Fiscal Imact
The income taxes due by OPT and assigned over the 20-year life
of the program would be CPA? 1,161 million compared to revenues of CFAF
43,179 million both expressed in 1981 price levels. The huge discrepancy
between the two amounts (the ratio is 37, and should be well below 10) is
the result of OPT's failure to reach the rate of return objective.

Comments:
1/       The study was made with delay under CIDA (Canada) Technical Assistance Program.
It was, however, partial and its impact limited as proposals only covered first
stage of interim changes and not a comprehensive plan for tariff structure or
measures for progressive application and term adjustments. Tariffs structure and
distribution with regard to international services were considered separately by
OPT as recommended by IDA during supervision and the financial consultants under
the project. In particular, the 501502 distribution of international revenues
between OPT and TIM was changed to 70/30? in 1986 resulting in substantial
improvement of OPTSs rate of return.
2/       The study was recommended during project supervision and made in the context of
the Public Enterprise (PE) Sector Reform Program and in coordination with the
technical assistance to OPT's operation and management under the project. Such
assistance was enlarged to OPT's overall operation, including postal and
financial services. Based on recommendations from the study, Government has
agreed to implement a comprehensive sector restructuring program beginning in
1989. This would involve the splitting of OPT's operations into separate
entities for posts (including financial services) and for telecommunications
(including a merger with TIH, the mixed company for international
telecommunications). Continued studies and assistance in the reform process is
being sought by Government under PE program or a possible 3rd telecommunications
project.
