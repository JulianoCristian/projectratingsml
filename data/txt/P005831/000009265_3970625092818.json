       at the oil field to domestic markets. It will also (b)\n            facilitate the further development of the oil fields; (c)\n            provide road access for the movement and marketing of\n            agricultural products from the Wadi As Sudd area; and (d)\n            increase the capability of the Highway Authority (HA) to\n            design road works. The project, itself, consists of the\n            second phase, which involves completion to paved standard,\n            of the Marib-Safir road (62.5 km). It is designed to connect\n            the paved road network at Marib with the oil field and\n            refinery at Safir, and also serve an agricultural area for\n            the first 32 km."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
