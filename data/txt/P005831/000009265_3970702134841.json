   critically short supply of potable water to meet peak\n            demands in the metropolitan area of Aden through the year\n            2000.  It provides for (i) construction of a wellfield; (ii)\n            further renovation and expansion of the water distribution\n            network; (iii) management assistance and staff training of\n            the Public Water Corporation (PWC) for carrying out\n            hydrogeological studies; and (iv) a leak detection and\n            repair program.  Increased availability of potable water in\n            metropolitan Aden would help improve the sanitary and health\n            conditions of the city's population.  The network\n            expansion would be mainly in low-income districts where\n            under the project about 83,000 residents, who now obtain\n            their supply from standposts and water vendors, would be\n            served by individual house connections.  As part of the\n            project, further strengthening of the sector organization\n            and the PWC will take place."}, "docdt": "1986-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
