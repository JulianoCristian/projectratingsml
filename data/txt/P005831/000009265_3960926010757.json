The project, itself, consists of the\n            second phase, which involves completion to paved standard,\n            of the Marib-Safir road (62.5 km). It is designed to connect\n            the paved road network at Marib with the oil field and\n            refinery at Safir, and also serve an agricultural area for\n            the first 32 km."}, "docdt": "1986-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
