Mr. Federico Puno 
President

Dear Secretary Espiritu and Mr. Puno:
Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project (LN 3996 and 3997 PH) Amendment to Loan 
Agreements
I refer to the Loan Agreements dated May 15, 1996 between the National Power 
Corporation (the "NPC") and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(the "Bank") for the above referenced Project (the "Loan Agreements") and to the 
Guarantee Agreement dated May 15, 1996 between the Republic of the Philippines (the 
"Guarantor") and the Bank for the same Projects. I am pleased to inform you that the 
Bank agrees to amend the Loan Agreements by revising the provisions of LN 3996 as 
follows:
1.
A new paragraph (g) is added to Section 1.02 as follows:
"(g) `Y2K Problem' means potential problems that might be encountered by 
computer 
hardware, software, embedded systems and other components of the 
Borrower's power supply 
system in processing year\1edate information for the 
year 2000 and beyond."
2.
Section 5.02 is amended to read as follows:
"Section 5.02 (a) The Borrower shall take all measures, including but not 
limited to 
tariff adjustments, cost cutting measures, debt control and equity 
increases, to earn: (i) 
an annual return of not less than eight percent (8%) of the 
average current net value of the
(a)
Borrower's fixed assets in operation each Fiscal Year; and (ii) internal 
cash generation sufficient to cover its estimated debt service requirements during 
each such Fiscal Year.
(b) 
Before December 1 in each of its Fiscal Years, the Borrower shall, on the 
basis of forecasts prepared by the Borrower and satisfactory to the Bank, review 
whether it would meet the requirements set forth in sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and (ii) of 
this Section in respect of such year and the next following Fiscal Year and shall 
furnish to the Bank the results of such review upon its completion.
(c) 
If any such review shows that the Borrower would not meet the 
requirements set forth in said sub-paragraphs (a)(i) or (ii) for its Fiscal Years 
covered by such review, the Borrower shall promptly take all necessary measures 
(including, without limitation, adjustments of the structure or levels of its rates, 
cost cutting measures, debt control and equity increases) in order to meet such 
requirements.
(d)
For the purposes of this Section:
(i)
The annual return shall be calculated by dividing the Borrower's 
net operating 
income for the Fiscal Year in question by one half(1 
/2) of the sum of the 
current net value of the Borrower's 
fixed assets in operation at the beginning 
and at the end of that 
Fiscal Year."
(ii)
The term "net operating income" means total operating revenues 
Page  2
less total 
operating expenses.
(iii)
The term "total operating revenues" means revenues from all 
sources related to 
operations.
(iv)
The term "total operating expenses" means all expenses related to 
operations, 
including administration, adequate maintenance, taxes, and 
provision for 
depreciation in a manner consistent with 
generally accepted accounting 
principles.
(v)
The term "current net value of the Borrower's fixed assets in 
operation" means 
the total gross value of the Borrower's fixed assets 
in operation (excluding 
assets being acquired through build operate 
transfer contracts and recorded 
according to finance lease arrangements) 
less the amount of accumulated 
depreciation, as valued from time 
to time in accordance with sound and 
consistently maintained 
methods of valuation satisfactory to the Bank. The 
average 
current net value of the Borrower's fixed assets in operation each 
Fiscal Year shall be calculated by dividing the Borrower's fixed assets in 
operation for the Fiscal Year in question by one half (1/2) of the 
sum of the 
Borrower's fixed assets in operation at the beginning and at 
the end of that 
Fiscal Year.
(vi)
The term "debt" means any indebtedness of the Borrower maturing by 
its terms 
more than one year after the date on which it is originally 
incurred 
(including that portion of any such debt payable 
within one year from the date 
of any debt-service ratio calculation), 
provided that debt shall be counted 
only to the extent that it is 
drawn down and outstanding. Debt shall be deemed 
to be incurred under 
a loan contract or agreement or other instrument 
providing for 
such debt or for the modification of its terms of payment on the 
date 
of such contract, agreement, or instrument.
(vii)
The term "internal cash generation" means the difference between 
(A) the sum 
of revenues from all sources related to operations and net 
non\1eoperating 
income, and any decrease in working capital 
(excluding cash and the current 
portion of long-term debt) and (B) the 
sum of all expenses related to 
operations including 
administration, adequate maintenance and taxes (but 
excluding 
depreciation, depletion, amortization of electric plant in service 
under capital lease, other non-cash operating charges and interest 
and other 
charges on debt), and any increase in working capital (excluding cash and 
the 
current portion of long-term debt).
(viii) The term "debt service requirement" shall mean the aggregate 
amount of (A) 
debt repayments (including lease obligations under 
build operate transfer 
contracts and sinking fund payments, if 
any) and (B) interest and other 
charges on debt, other than 
interest and other charges on debt incurred in 
financing 
capital expenditures during construction that are financed under any 
loan to the Borrower.
(ix)
The term "net non\1eoperating income" means the difference between:
(A) revenues from all sources other than those related to 
operations; and
(B)
expenses, including rates and payments in lieu of taxes, 
incurred in 
the generation of revenues in (A) above."
