are to: 1) evacuate power from\n            major generation plants at Sual and Masinloc, both expected\n            to be operational in 1998; 2) reinforce overloaded\n            substations and extend the extra high voltage (EHV) grid in\n            Northwest Luzon and Western Visayas; and 3) strengthen the\n            transmission system and load dispatch operations to support\n            creation of an autonomous transmission subsidiary (TRANSCO),\n            which may later be privatized. The project has four main\n            components: 1) improvement of the trasmission in Northwest\n            Luzon; 2) installation of a new National Load Dispatch\n            Center (NLDC) including communications, metering, and\n            protection equipment in Luzon and the Visayas; 3)\n            reinforcement of the systems in Negros, Panay and Cebu ; and\n            4) provision of experts services and equipment."}, "docdt": "1996-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
