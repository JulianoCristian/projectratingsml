were as\n            follows: the outcome was unsatisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            unsatisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that concerning\n            project preparation, this operation underlines the\n            importance of ensuring quality at entry including the need\n            to have a solid assessment of project readiness for\n            implementation. With a flaw in the initial project design\n            and whatever the ensuing effort to put the Project on track,\n            the price to pay would be high and the results limited. A\n            clear lesson from the experience in Ghana is that careful\n            attention to the sequencing of the reform is essential\n            within the individual component, with other related project\n            components and with other reforms being undertaken outside\n            the project. The ambition attached to the original project\n            design exceeded any reasonable expectation given the\n            experience of such budget preparation and public expenditure\n            management systems in Ghana and elsewhere. Another lesson is\n            the confirmation of the need for sufficient attention to\n            institutional issues at the initial stages of project design."}, "docdt": "2004-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
