Several lessons are drawn\n            from the project, in particular, that project design was\n            relatively complex, based on several broad ranging\n            objectives, and components involving a number of Oyo State\n            Government agencies. Although this operation was based on a\n            standard design at the time, it is now suggested that\n            simpler projects need to be designed in the future, without\n            overestimating the capacity of weak administrative\n            infrastructures. In addition, project objectives should be\n            measurable, avoiding overly ambitious objectives. It appears\n            that revenue generation remains a major difficulty for local\n            governments (LG), hence, while the project enhanced the tax\n            bases of several LGs, further major improvements are needed\n            to realize additional revenues, through better billing, and\n            collection practices. This remains relevant to state\n            parastatals, such as the Solid Waste Management Authority in\n            this project, which encountered difficulties in increasing\n            rates due to cultural, political, and/or legal constraints.\n            Hence, costs must be directly, or indirectly recovered, to\n            ensure sustained provision of infrastructure services.\n            Finally, all aspects of community involvement in\n            infrastructure require equal emphasis, particularly as in\n            this project, when at the early stages, increased demands\n            led to decreased focus on the logistics of cost recovery."}, "docdt": "2000-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
