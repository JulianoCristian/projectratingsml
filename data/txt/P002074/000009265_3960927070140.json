institutional constraints limiting the allocations for\n            maintenace and infrastructure investments, which leads to\n            inadequate urban services.  The main objectives are to\n            promote the efficient functioning of Ibadan and Oyo\n            State's other major towns through city-wide\n            infrastructure rehabilitation, and through strengthening the\n            institutions responsible for urban management and local\n            resource mobilization.  Project components will consist of :\n            a) infrastructure rehabilitation in Ibadan : a flood control\n            program through channelization and maintenance of major\n            storm drains; improved solid waste management; and\n            integrated community improvement programs in 3 pilot areas;\n            b) infrastructure improvements in selected LG towns and LG\n            centers; c) revenue enhancement and institutional\n            strengthening; and d) support to the Federal Ministry of\n            Works and Housing (FMWH) for coordinating and monitoring\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1990-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
