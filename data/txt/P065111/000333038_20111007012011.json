"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Port Cities Development\n            Program Project for Republic of Yemen were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            generally during project preparation, when an Adaptable\n            Program Loan (APL) is being debated as the choice\n            instrument, particularly in fragile and conflict countries,\n            it is advisable that perspectives of experts external to the\n            Bank be made available to the teams to improve quality of\n            Bank's operations. In such countries, a sound analysis\n            of the political economy is critical in assessing the\n            readiness of a project failing to take cognizance of this\n            may lead to an underestimation of the challenges of reform.\n            The integration of national level reforms with local level\n            reforms in one project, particularly in low capacity\n            environments, is best avoided. National reforms that affect\n            urban development and are within the mandate of national\n            entities require sustained engagement over the long term.\n            This is best supported through single sector instruments, so\n            that results are achievable within a defined time frame.\n            City Development Strategies (CDSs) that focus on an\n            'output document' that defines investments (for\n            example a capital investment plan), risk becoming a one-time\n            donor supported activity. The process of undertaking a CDS\n            needs to ensure in depth, and locally specific analysis that\n            first informs the development of a segmented participation\n            and consultation plan. When participation is underpinned\n            with local level information which drives the consultative\n            process, the potential for creating a network of an\n            inclusive stakeholder group is high, and can be an important\n            legacy of the CDS process. Genuine consultation with direct\n            beneficiaries of infrastructure sub-projects is essential so\n            that social and sustainability issues normally associated\n            with infrastructure investments are addressed in a timely\n            way, including sector-wide or ring-fenced reforms for a\n            subproject. Such consultation can avoid the development of\n            inappropriate design solutions."}, "docdt": "2010-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
