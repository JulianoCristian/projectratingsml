SIXTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1365-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Completion Report (PCR) for the project financed under
the seventh loan to the Government of Indonesia. The US$116 million loan,
which became effective on June 6, 1977, was provided to finance approximately
821 of the foreign cost of a project consisting of the addition of two 200-MW
oil-fired units at the Muara Karang power station, the cost of consultancy
services for a 200-MW unit for the Semarang Harbor power statioa and the Java
Extra High Voltage system study.
Although the project was cxmpleted in September 1982, disbursements,
mainly for payment of contractors' retention monies, continued until August
1985, and the original closing date of December 31, 1984, was extended to
August 1985. The Bank loan was underutilized to the extent of US$2602 mil-
lion, of which about US$20.7 million was used to finance cost overruns in Bank
loan 1!z7-IND for Huara Karang and preparation of several feasibility
studies. US$5 million was cancelled on April 6, 1985, and about US$0.5 mil-
lion was cancelled when the loan was finally closed.
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Projects
Department, Energy Division, following a project completion mission which took
place in July 1985, and is based in part on completion reports prepared by the
consultants retained for this project.
In accordance with revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED),
but the project was not audited by ORD staff.
Following standard procedurest OED sent copies of the draft PCR to
the Government and the Borrower for commetq.  However, no comuts were
received.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1365-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
i.        A US$116 million loan was made to the Government of Indonesia to
finance part of the foreign costs of constructing two 200-MW oil-fired units
at the Muara Karang thermal power station, the cost of consultancy services
for a 200-MW unit for the Semarang Harbor power station, and the Java Extra
High Voltage system study.  The first 200-MW unit was comissioned in May
1982, followed by the second unit in September 1982. The project was
completed about 12 months behind appraisal projections and was accomplished
with a cost underrun of about 36.71. Major reasons for project delay were
delays in contract finalization, construction error in alignment between
existing and new plant buildings, and unsatisfactory contractor performance in
certain areas.  The large cost underrun was due to lower-than-anticipated
equipment prices, strength of the US dollar and very low rates quoted by the
government-owned contracting agency for civil works.
ii.       The generating sets at Muara Karang have been operating satis-
factorily with acceptable levels of efficiency and plant outage rates. The
EI of the project is 12.3X against an appraisal estimate of 21X, in view of
higher actual system operation and maintenance costs and low-)r revenue
realizations. The Extra High Voltage (ESV) system study accomplished under
the project paved the way for establishment of a natiunal EYV grid. Other
technical studies subsequently included in the project concerning hydro,
geothermal, minihydro, and transmission/distribution development served a
useful preparatory ground for future projects in the power sector.
iii.      During project construction (1977-82) PLN's sales increased by about
258%, at an average annual growth rate of 211. The project was thus a timely
addition to PLN's generating capability.              I
iv.       While fuel oil price was subsidized by the Government until 1978/79,
in the succeeding 4 years the price increased by about 350%. As corresponding
tariff adjustments allowed by the Government were not adequate, PLU registered
a net operating loss in 1982/83. PLN's future performance will significantly
depend on tariff level, the price of fuel oil, improvement in system losses
and financial assistance from the Government for its rural electrification
program.
v.        PLt's institutional development has been impressive, and it has
continued its efforts to make further progress in various fields. An
important issue which needs to be addressed in the future concerns reduction
of the project implementation period, especially through speedier procurement
and contracting procedures.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1365-IMD)
Project Completion Report
T. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.01      The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in
Indonesia is the responsibility of PLN, a government-owned enterprise created
in 1951.  Captive power plants installed by private parties also play a predo-
minant role in the power sector, which in addition, comprises municipal fran-
chises and cooperatives supplying power in a few remote rural areas.  The  
activities of the power sector are regulated by the Ministry of Mines and
Energy (MM) established in 1978, through its Directorate General of Electric
Power (DOEP). Dy a legislation enacted in 1979, DGEP acquired from PLN the
responsibility for policy planning, licensing of franchises and general super-
vision of the power sector. PLY started to function as an autonomous utility
around 1972, when its status was changed from that of a ministry departent to
a public corporation. Thereafter, it undertook the urgently needed rehabili-
tation and expansion programs. PLN's subsequent growth was rapid and in
1983/84 it had about 4.4 million consumers and supplied about 651 of the total
electricity in the country. The growth in generating capacity of PLY since
the time of appraisal in 1976/7? and projected up to 1988/89, is shown in
Table 1.1, which also indicates the growth of captive power plants up to
1983/84.
1.02      Following the steep increases in oll prices from 1979, diversifica-
tion away from oil was established as a policy objective and coal was estab-
lished as the primary choice for thermal power plants. New hydro and coal-
fired plants started comdng on line since 1985. Geothermal energy will play
an increasing role in the power sector, while. oil-fired capacity will remain
stable and gas turbines and diesel generators will be progressively phased
out. By 1988/89, oil-fired capacity will reduce to odly 44X of the total
compared to 79X in 1983/84. Captive power plant capacity is expected to
reduce as economic, reliable grid power becomes available.

The Borrower/Beneficiary
1.03      The borrower was the Government of Indonesia and loan proceeds were
onlent to PLU on the same terms and conditions as those of the Bank loan.  PLN
operations are managed by a board of directors (presently consisting of five
directors, of plann ng, construction, operations, finance and administration)
headed by a President-Director, who is appointed by the President and
accountable to the Minister of Mines and Energy. The directors perform more
of a staff than a line role, as line responsibility devolves from the board as
a whole to 16 regional operating managers and 12 construction project
maw-gers. PLY's major policies and programs - including its investment
plans, budgets and tariffs -- are subject to review by a supervisory board
chaired by the DCWP and the Ninister for Mines and Energy. PLY's procurement
activities are controlled by a Procurement Control Team in the Governmenc's
State Secretariat (5E1REG) set up in 1980.
1.04      Since 1969, the Bank has played a significant role in the develop-
ment of power generation and distribution facilities in and around Jaka.rta and
in West and Central Java, through three distribution projects (Credits 165-IND
and 334-IND and Loan 1259-IND) and eleven power generation cum transmission
and distribution projects (Credit 399-IND and Loans 1127-IND, 1365-IND,
1513-IND, 1708-IND, 1872-IND, 1950-IND, 2056-IND, 2214-IND, 2300-ID and 2443-
IND). These loans and credits encouraged some major institutional, organiza-
tional and financial reforms in the sector, and provided PLN with a new
charter giving it substantial autonomy. They also provided funds for consult-
ing services, notably a large management consultancy effort, the Java Syutem



Development Study, and the EHV System Study, amng a host of other technical
and institutional studies. Five power projects have been completed so far.
While PLI's performance in implementation has been uneven, it has shown
significant growth in its capability to undertake large and complex projects
such as Suralaya Steam Power Plant, 500KV Transmission lines, and Saguling and
Cirata hydroelectric projects financed from the Bank loans.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PMEPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01      The Bank has been associated with the power development program of
Indonesia since 1969 and the present project was a logical step in this
development process. The Java System Development Study carried out by a con-
sultant had identified addition of 2 x 200 MW units at Muara Xarang power
station (where 3 X 100 MW units were then nearing completion) followed by the
addition of 1 x 200 MW unit at the existing 2 x 50 MW Semarang power station,
as the least cost sequence of development, to meet the demand by 1982-83.
Hydro projects could not be commissioned in time, while the gas turbine
alternative was less economical. The basis for the above plan was an annual
rate of load growth of 20X in the Java system, during 1975-85. The actual
rate of load growth was around 181. However, with delays in the comissioning
of generating sets, the ratio of installed capacity to peak demand has been
substantially maintained (thus 1982/83 installed capacity/peak demand ratio
was 1.68 as forecast and 1.60 actual). The high value of this ratio is due to
600 NW of gas turbine plant (installed as a crash program between 1975-77),
which is uneconomical to run except for peaking duty.



-4-
Preparation and Appraisal
2.02      The project was conceived around September 1915 and was prepared by
PLN in about 12 month's time, with the assistance of BeA' missions id4 consul-
tants who were working on Muara Karang unit 3. A unit size selection study by
the consultant established 200 MW as the next appropriate size for the 8rid.
Muara Karan8 site did not have adequate space for coal storage, hence the
units were desiped for oil firing only. It was earlier proposed to provide
Bank funds for financing the fourth 200 MW unit; subsequently, at 001's
request, the financing of the fifth 200 MW unit was also included . During
loan negotiations, quotations for major equipment for unit 4 had already been
obtained, together with options for unit 5, with financing either by IBRD or
suppliers' credits. The Bank demonstrated to the negotiating team that
suppliers' credit terms would be advantageous; it was therefore decided to
limit IBRD finance for unit 5 to general construction, minor equipment and
miscellaneous items.
2.03      An important item which was incorporated for Bank financing at the
request of the Indonesian negotiating team in December 1976, was the SHY
system study including engineering for the transmission lines. The Java
System Development Study done by consultants had indicated the need for an
island-wide ESV interconnection in the early 19809 to ensure optimum
utilization of generat;ng capacity and enable growth of PLN's system in an
integrated manner.  In early 1977, based on discussions with consultants, PL4
advised the Bank of its decision to select 400 kV as the SHV system voltage,
which would have made the EHV study unnecessary. The Bank however persuadcid
PLN to undertake the EHV study as originally planned. The ultimate selection
of 500 kV rather than 400 kV as the ENV system voltage, was indicated by this
study as a better alternative.
Project Objectives
2.04      The main objectives of the jnuject at appraisal were to augment
PLN's system capability to meet the rapidly growing demand, to initiate action
for the next stage of generation development by financing detailed engineering
for the 200 MW unit at Semarang and to prepare the ground for the island-wide
EHV link through an ENV feasibility study, followed by detailed engineering.
An annual review by the Bank of PLN's detailed financial plan that would
enable it to meet its operating expenses, interest and other charges on debt
and provide a reasonable contribution towards new capital investment, was a
major objective aimed at strengthening the institution. During project
execution, several additional studies, having technical and institution
building objectives, were added to the project scope and financed by the Bank
(see para. 2.07).
Project Description
2.05      The project comprised:
(a) the fourth and fifth thermal power units (200 MW each) at the Muara
Karang power station;

cover 150 kV system protection coordination and training of PLN personnel in
EHV system design.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Arrangements
3.01      In the absence of an organization in PL  for designing thermal
stations, it was decided to entrust to a consultant the design, preparation of
bid documents, assistance in bid evaluation and contract award and
construction supervision of Muara Karang thermal station. The Department of
Steam and Gas Turbine Construction of PLN provided a construction supervision
team under a project manager. Evaluation of bids was accomplished at PLN's
head office with the consultant's assistance.
3.02      PL, exercising its option for extending the then-existing
consultancy contract for units 1, 2 and 3 at Muara Karang, appointed the same
consultants for units 4 and 5. At the time of appointment, PLY pointed out
certain deficiencies in the existing consultancy services, notably lack of



experience of consultants' site staff and the consequent need to refer too
many decisions to the consultants' office in the US. The consultants agreed
to provide more experienced site personnel.
Implementation Schedule
3.03      Delays in Contract Awards.  An analysis of the scheduled and actual
dates of contract award and contract implementation for major project compo-
nents is presented in Annex 1. There were delays ranging from 3 to 5 months
in the signing of most of the contracts, a delay of 7 months in the contract
for fabricated steel and 17 months in the contracts for site development.
Finalization of the Control and Instrument Contract also dragged for several
months. The time interval between tender invitation and contract signing
ranged from 8 to 14 months for the major contracts.
3.04      Major Problems and Delays in Construction.  The project was beset
with several problems during the construction phase which resulted in lengthy
implementation delays. The major problem areas are highlighted below:
Lack of access due to deiay in Units 1,2 & 3
As construction work was not complete on the earlier units,
commencement of activities for the new units had to be delayed by
five to six months.
Site Development and Piling
These activities started about six months behind schedule due to
lack of access caused by delays in completion of the earlier units,
and tardy cement supplies introduced a further delay of about one
month.
Misalignment of Building for Units 4 and 5 vis-a-vis Building of Units 1,
2 and 3
In October 1978, PLY suspected a misalignment between the center
lines of units 4 and 5 and the rest of the building, and this was
confirmed by PLN and the consultants in February 1979. The progress
report of June 1979 indicated that the misalignment, which was about
10 cm, would be corrected by suitable modification of the columns of
units 4 and 5. However, the consultants failed to evolve a workable
solution to this problem until the end of 1979, causing a delay of
about nine months. The consultant's completion report, attributed
an effective project delay of 2.1 months to this incident, but it is
believed that this figure would be much higher.
Mechanical and Electrical Construction
The tardy and inefficient work of the contractor -- failure of
valves, inefficient installation of condenser, inefficient prepara-
tion, installation and chemical cleaning of feed water and main
steam lines, inefficient installation of control and instrumentation



-8-
work - resulted in a delay of about seven months in the commis-
sioning of unit 4. A part of this delay, however, was due to pipe
routing modifications which had to be later introduced by the
consultant as a result of change in vendor data.
3.05      Minor project delays also occurred as under:
Late comissioning of outfall structure             -  delay of about
1 month
Commissioning problems during initial firing       -  delay of about
of unit 4 boiler, which produced a lot of tar          1 month
in the air heater
Lack of make-up water for unit 4 due to            -  delay of about
potlution in the intake from Nuara Karang              2 months
river, making it impossible for the desalinator
and demineraliser to prepare enough water
3.06      As a result of the above delays unit 4 was commissioned 22 months
behind schedule. Some time was made up for unit 5 which went into service
about 18 months behind schedule. These delays refer to targets set by PLY
subsequently to the SAR. With regard to the BAR projections the delays were
20 months for unit 4 and 12 months for unit 5.
3.07      Delays in completion of the 150 kV line associated with Muara
Karang, restricted output from unit 4 in the first year of operation. This
delay was due to problems of land acquisition.
Project Costs
3.08      The estimated and actual costs of the original project components
are detailed in Annez 2 and a summary comparison with the SAR estimates is
presented in Table 3.1.

7i   Local cost conversion based on US$1 - Rp 625.
3.09      There was a large differential of almost 65Z between the estimated
and actual cost of civil works and general construction. This was due to a
very low quotation submitted by a government-owned contracting agency, whereas
the estimate had provided for an offshore bid. This, coupled with much lower
than anticipated equipment prices and stronger US dollar resulted in a cost
underrun of about 38X on Muara Karang units 4 and 5.
Disbursements
3.10      A comparison of actual disbursements of the Bank loan versus
appraisal estimate is shown in Annex 3. Actual disbursements as percentage of
the appraisal forecasts are tabulated below.

/a   US$5.0 million was cancelled from the loan amount on April 6, 1985, and the
balance was cancelled on loan closing in August 1985.
3,11      The delayed disbursements were largely due to procurement and imple-
mentation delays and to some extent also due to cost savings.
Performance of Consultants
3.12      While the performance of the main plant consultants was satisfactory
with regard to engineering and design of the plant and training of operating
personnel, their performance on construction supervision left much to be
desired. Not only did a serious construction error arise in misalignment
between the new and the existing plant buildings, but the consultant's
response was also so tardy in suggesting suitable corrective measures that the
project completion schedule was adversely affected. A tighter supervision was
also called for on the work of the mechanical and electrical contractor for
unit 4, which necessitated a lot of rectification work and consequent delays
in project completion.
3.13      The performance of the consultants on the various studies (see
para. 2.07) and on the engineering and design of Semarang unit 3 was generally
satisfactory. Of particular note is the benefit derived by PLV from the hydro
potential study with regard to its institutional development (including active
involvement of Department of Public Works, Agency for Land and Aerial Survey
and provincial governments) and compilation of useful hydro potential data in
its computer. The Java EHV System study established the system voltage as
500 kV, laid down the basic configuration of the EHV network and its coordina-
tion with the associated 150 kV network and the concept of the national
control center.
Reporting
3.14      PLN and the consultant submitted a total of 31 physical completion
and financial reports. The format of the reports was useful in monitoring
progress of the project. The consultant also submitted a detailed completion
report, which though not following Bank guidelines, contains useful informa-
tion on the project.



- 11 -
Procurement
3.15      Procurement was accomplished through a total of about 13 contract
packages. Site Development and Piling were awarded to local contractors who
were paid in rupiah. The General Construction and Mechanical and Electrical
contracts, which were common for units 4 and 5, covered mainly the erection
work with some items of supply and involved both foreign and local cost
components. A }.5X price preference was permitted in the loan agreement for
local construction contractors. The General Construction contract was won by
a local firm without recourse to the price preference. The Mechanical and
Electrical contract was won by a joint venture between a Dutch and an
Indonesian firm. While unit 4 had four contract packages for major plant
items, unit S (largely financed by supplier's credit) had a single contract
package including supply and erection of boiler plant, turbine generator plant
and electrical items. Control and instrumentation and fabricated steel works
were included in common packages for units 4 and 5.
3.16      There were no major problems in procurement apart from inordinate
delays in the award of contracts.
IV. OPERATINC PERFORMANCE
4.01      The operating performance of Muara Karang units 4 and S as briefly
narrated here is based on discussions with PLN engineers during a site visit
in July 1985.
Operating Efficiency
4.02      Performance tests on units 4 and 5 yielded a gross heat rate value
of about 10,035 kJ/kWh at 100% load, corresponding to a gross thermal effici-
ency of about 35.9X.  The net heat rate and efficiency figures, after allowing
for auxiliary consumption, were 10,540 kJ/kWh and 34.2%, respectively. These
figures are satisfactory for 200 MW units and meet the guarantees. The net
(test) heat rate and efficiency figures for the 100 MW units at Muara Karang
were of the order of 12,650 kJ/kWh and 28.52, respectively.
Operating Problems
4.03      There have been no major operating problems with these units.  Air
heater elements require to be cleaned every two months; this problem is common
with stations burning high sulfur content (up to 3.5Z) oil. The penalty due
to loss of efficiency, if average cold-end temperature of the flue gas is
reduced, is higher than the maintenance cost due to increased corrosion. The
problem of condenser fouling due to debris in the river water was solved by
subsequent installation of debris filters. The circulating water system's
marine growth problem with the earlier units' intermittent chlorine injection
system has been minimized after installation of the continuous hypochlorite
system (electrochlorination). There is a minor problem of high coupling oil
temperature, when two boiler feed pumps are operated at partial (below 50X)
load. This is presently resolved by operating one pump at partial load. The



- 12 -
desalination plants have not been operating satisfactorily due to high level
of river pollution especially during rains. The total desalination plant
capacity is 1 X 30 tons/hour plus 3 x 10 tons/hour (derated to 3 x 5 tons/hour
due to pollution), against a make up water requirement of 24 tons/hour. If
the 30 tons/hour plant should fail, the remaining plants would be unable to
supply the total station's water requirement. Problems of similar nature
affect the demineralizing plants at the station. These problems are being
looked into by PLV and the consultants. The problem of soot collection
following soot separation, was solved by installation of an automatic soot
collection system. The latter system has not been found necessary for plants
not having soot separators.
4.04      The station has kept detailed statistics of plant outages and has
effectively monitored the outage rates of all the units. Table 4.1 summaries
the performance of units 4 and S.

4.05      The performance figures for 1982/83 onwards are considered to be
within acceptable range for good operating practice.
Engineering, Design, Operation and Maintenance
4.06      The engineering and design of the plant were generally satisfac-
tory. The operators have been well trained during the construction phase
under the consultancy contract, as also through some of the supply contracts
in Indonesia and abroad. However, there is a severe shortage of experienced
maintenance personnel, and this problem has been engaging the attention of
PLN. Presently no maintenance work is given out on contract; supervisors from
equipment suppliers are, however, engaged during major overhauls. A major
unit overhaul takes about 60 days, and there are proposals for cutting down
this period to 45 days. The station employs a total of 340 persons (280 in
operation and maintenance) which is slightly on the high side.

Environmental Aspects
4.07      The Muara Karang power plant was designed using US Environmental
Protection Agency standards as criteria. One-time environmental pollution
measurements made by PLN's research department gave the following results.

/a   Set by government of Jakarta.  Environmental regulations were introduced
in Indonesia in 1977-79.
4.08      The stack monitoring systems and the mobile atmosphere pollution
measuring stations8 procured under the loan, were received only in 1985 and
trial operations have been commenced with the equipment. Training abroad of
personnel for operating the mobile units has also recently commernced. On line
monitoring of cooling water temperature and monitoring of waste effluent water
are proposed to be undertaken on a periodic basis. Residual chlorine is
monitored and kept below 0.1 ppm. Monitoring of the sea is-being done
annually by the National Institute for Oceanology.
4.09      Periodic monitoring of air and effluent water at the station, as
also instailation of remote air monitoring systems near the densely populated
Jakarta area, are activities that PLN still has to introduce. Theoretical
studies made by the consultant, at Bank's instance, have pointed to the need
for close monitoring of air pollution near Jakarta, in view of prevailing wind
conditions and narrow margins between calculated and permissible pollution
levels.
4.10      Subsequent to the design of the Muara Karang plant, two developments
took place (a) a landfill about 400 m to the east of the station jutting about
500 m into the sea and (b) a canal constructed about 1000 m to the west of the
station. The possibility of water recirculation due to these obstructions was



- 14 -
pointed out by the Bank mission in September 1978 and a detailed study of the
problem was undertaken by the consultant. It was found that the higher cool-
ing water temperature (about 1°C) and consequent lower efficiency caused by
the obstructions would involve a cost penalty of about US$69,000 per year at
80X plant capacity. Moving the outfall about 1,500 m to the east would have
resulted in an annual .aving of about US$141,000. The additional cost (and
inconvenience) of the increased outfall tunnel length did not justify the
annual cost saving and hence the original layout was maintained.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Objectives
5.01      Under the sixth power project, the Government and PLN agreed to
review annually with the Bank PLN's investment budget for the next fiscal year
before its final approval by the Borrower. This was the interim period
between completion of the Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) (adopted under the
Third and Fourth Power Projects and continued under the Fifth Power Project)
and the introduction of financial performance targets.
5.02      The new system of financial performance targets for the period after
the MP was first established through a covenant under the Seventh Power
Project (Loan 1513-IND, 1978). A self-financing ratio (SFR) was then adopted
because of the desirability of financing, out of internal cash generation, a
reasonable proportion of PLN's investment program. The agreed SFR was 30X by
1985/86, with indicative targets for the intervening years.
Performance Results
5.03      The objective of the FRP for PL  to achieve a full revenue/cost
recovery was met in 1975/76, three years ahead of schedule and PLY was able to
continue to maintain a position slightly above breakeven in terms of operating
income through 1978/79. This satisfactory trend is shown in Table 5.1.

5.04      The quantification of SFM  indicative targets had been revised under
the Eighth Power Project (Loan 1108-IND) and the Twelfth Power Project (Loan
2214-IND), to take into account significant changes in PLN's capital expendi-
tures and fuel costs. The SF1 target for 1985/86 and onwards was reduced from
30X to 201 under the Twelfth Power Project. PLN's financial performance in
terms of cash generation is shown in Table 5.2.

preceding years covered by its net revenue plus depreciation retentions less debt
service for the same three years.
5.05      PLN was able to meet the revised minimum SFR targets in each year.
The total capital expenditure over the period 1976/77 to 1983/84 was
Rp 3,904 billion compared to appraisal projection of Rp 3,020 billion and the
coLresponding internal cash generation for the period was Rp 817 billion
against the appraisal forecast of Rp 902 billion.
5.06      Actual operating revenues increased, over the period 1976/77 through
1983/84, at 37Z p.a., as against the projected 28% p.a. As regards PLN's
sales in GWh, the actual results were close to the projected sales until
1981/82. In 1982/83 and 1983/84, the actual sales were about 10.5Z and 191
lower than the projections mainly due to the economic recession in the last
few years leading to lower consumption from existing consumers. A comparison
between the projected and actual financial results is summarized in Annex 4.
Detailed comparative financial stements are given in Annex S, Tables 1 to 3.
Tariffs
5.07      Fuel price increases following 001's policy of removing domestic oil
subsidies significantly increased PL's operating expenses. The average fuel
price paid by PL remained at about tp 25/liter until 1978/79 and increased by
about 301 in 1979/80, 401 in 1980/81, 202 in 1982/83 and about 601 in 1983/84
and 1984/85. The fuel cost as a percentage of total operating expenses rose
from 24.51 in 1976/77 to 601 in 1983/84.



- 16 -
5.08      While fuel prices increased significantly in recent years, PLN's
tariff remained unchanged until 1960/81, when PLN raised tariffs about 501 as
a condition of the Bank's assistance in financing the Ninth Power Project
(Loan 1872-IND, 1980). Tariff adjustments since 1980/81 have mainly offset
the fuel cost increases and in addition lagged behind the fuel price adjust-
ments. Consequently, PLN's tariffs were not sufficient to cover the full
increases in its operating expenses, resulting in operating losses 1982/83.
5.09      In May 1974, PLN instituted a mechanism of tariff surcharges,
through which adjustments of revenues were made possible. Repeated use of the
surcharge mechanism introduced distortion into the tariff structure. The
consequential pricing anomalies were rectified in the tariff revision of May
1980, which was based on the Long-run Marginal Cost (LRMC) pricing princi-
ples. However, since 1980, all tariff increases have been effected entirely
through changes only in the energy charges. The failure to adjust the demand
charges has thus reintroduced distortions in the tariff structure.
5.10      In 1983, the Bank assisted PLN in its studies of costs and tariff
structure. Based on the results of these studies, PLY agreed to revise its
tariff structure to reflect the LRMC of electricity supply. The Bank's
continued involvement in the power sector and itA support in tariff studies
has been an important contributing factor in motivating PLN towards economic-
efficiency pricing. In January 1984 PL1 introduced an increase of about 241
in the demand as well as energy charges. With this change the average level
of tariff is close to the average costs of supply, though some distortions
remain in individual categories.
Financial Management
5.11      The Bank had recommended a change in the financial performance
indicator from the Self rinancing Ratio (SFR) to the Rate of Return on the
revaluded asset base, as more appropriate in the stage of development that PLN
had reached by early 1980s. Under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-
IND, 1984), GOI/PLN agreed to a rate of return covenant of at least 8Z from
1986/87 onwards, with a target of 61 in 1985/86. This change is expected to
avoid the uncertainties associated with the setting of SFR targets because of
the uncertainties in the investment program and ensure that assets in opera-
tion would earn a reasonable return. The SFR will be retained as one of the
performance indicators and will be monitored to ensure PL1's self-financing
capability.
5.12      Under the Fifth Power Project, two covenants were introduced to
ensure PLN's prudent debt management: (i) minimum future debt service cover-
age of 1.0; and (ii) settlement of all its debts within one month when due.
These covenants (which applied for the Sixth Power Project, also) were
replaced under the Seventh Power Project by: (i) minimum future debt service
coverage of 1.3 times; and (ii) a debt/equity ratio of 60/40. The Thirteenth
Power Project (Loan 2300-IND, 1983) adopted only one debt management covenant
which required a minimum of 1.5 times coverage of future debt service each
year out of the forecast internal funds for that year; this requirement
replaced all earlier debt limitation covenants. This change reflected the
growth of a company like PLN, and at the same time, made allowance for the
added future earning power. PIN has been complying with these covenants.



- 17 -
5.13      PL's collection performance has been generally satisfactory.  The
accounts receivable position of customers other than government users has been
improved to about two months of billing. PLN's sales to government users
account for about lOZ of its total sales} but collections from some government
users (including Army and local governments) have not been promptly settled
when due.
5.14      The Government has taken various measures to correct the unsatisfac-
tory payment performance by government users. Outstanding government accounts
receivable were reduced from over one year in 1981/82 to about fVve months of
billing in 1983/84; this is still not considered satisfactory. An action plan
was agreed under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) to reduce the
arrears further. It was also agreed under the Fourteenth Power Project to
amend the old covenant which would require each and every government user to
pay its bills promptly to a more realistic covenant that would require the
amounts owed by all government users in aggregate be kept to less than two
months of total billings for such users. PLN would also be required under the
new covenant to keep collection data for government users adequately
disaggregated so that the source of any overdue payment problems could be
identified.
Auditing
5.15      PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
government auditors. The audit reports are acceptable to the Bank, but are
subject to long delays. In 1983 special efforts were made by the Accounting
Department to expedite the closing of accounts within six months after the
close of the fiscal year as stipulated in PLN's charter. This was a signifi-
ca_; improvement. Government audit would normally take about two to three
months. To be more realistic and also in line with PLN's charter requirement
and Government's regulations, the Bank's audit submission covenant was amended
under the Fourteenth Power Project from six to nine months after the close of
the fiscal year. PLN, however, will submit its unaudited accounts to the Bank
for early review and, as required of all public corporations in Indonesia, to
the Government for audit within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      At the time of appraisal in 1977, PLN had begun to emerge and was
continuing to develop into a well-organized power utility from the "chaotic
state" it was in in 1969, the first year of Bank's involvement in the power
sector. The present project contributed to the institutional development
process, through continuous review of financial performance and organixational
development as also through several major technical studies, which had compo-
nents for training and enhancement of expertise in specific areas. PLN's
institutional development and Bank's involvement in this process is briefly
narrated below.



- 18 -
Management
6.02      PLN's management systems have in general been well designed;
however, there are still certain weaknesses, notably in the division of
responsibility between the regions/construction divisions on the one hand and
the central departments on the other. The process of decentralization of
responsibility to the regions/construction departments is under consideration,
but its implementation will be gradual as improved and restructured
information systems are still being developed. A management audit was
commissioned by PLY in 1980/81 and was undertaken by a local firm working in
association with international management consultants. Their recommendations
for the establishment of a more comprehensive corporate plannning process,
improvement in coordination between the various headquarters departments and
between headquarters and the regions, adoption of common design standards and
procuremeut methodology and improvements in accounting, computing, inventory
control and personnel management were reviewed by an in-house committee and
several recommendations were implemented. The Bank has financed several
management studies: Project Management Advisory Services (under Power 8),
Accounting, Budgeting and Management Information Systems (under Power 11),
Management Information Systems for PLN (under Power 12) and Management
Information Systems for DCEP (under Power 7). The studies are in various
stages of completion/implementation. Reporting systems for PLN and the
project management information systems for Cirata and Suralaya are under
implementation.
Planning. Design and Research
6.03      PLN has acquired adequate expertise in generation, transmission and
distribution planning. Steps towards greater regional involvement in planning
were taken in 1981 and a series of management development courses have been
instituted for regional and branch managers. Several Bank-financed studies
have been devised for enhancing PLN's planning capabilities, notably Power
Market Study (under Power 8) and the Hydro Potential studies under the present
project. Towards strengthening PLN's engineering and design capabilities the
Bank has supported the creation of an Engineering Services Center and is pro-
posing to finance consultancy assistance for this under a future loan. With
all these efforts PLN's capability to formulate, design and supervise large
projects will further improve over the years.
Manpower and Training
6.04      PLN's staff increased from a level of about 21,000 in 1976/77 to
about 32,000 in 1982/83 and is projected to a level of about 42,000 in
1985/86. About 601 of the staff is in technical and 401 in administrative
cadres. In spite of efforts such as student scholarships and incentives of
foreign technical training, PLY has always faced and continues to face diffi-
culties in recruiting technical graduates, whose composition continuous to
remain at an unsatisfactorily low level of about 31 of the total staff.
6.05      PLN's efforts at training and Bank's involvement in this field, have
been considerable. PLN has a separate function (Pusdiklat) for education and
traininj. Its staff of about 200 (including 48 trained instructors) trains



- :9 -
annually about 1,300 personnel in technical and financial disciplines. Five
training centers were built under earlier Bank loans. The Ninth Power Project
(.oan 1872-IND) provided for an advanced training school, including a
facsimile digital training simulator for the training of operating staff for
thermal power plants, which is now functioning at Suralaya. The Ninth Power
Project also provided Zor training in the fields of systems protection,
thermal station operation, maintenance and design and in EHV practice, while
the Tenth Power Project (Loan 1950-IND) provided for on-the-job training in
the country in selected fields like civil works contract administration. The
Twelfth Power Project (Loan 2214-IND) includes a large training omponent of
US$25.0 million to (a) reorganize and enlarge the entire manpower development,
training and personnel management functions for middle and lower level staff,
improving job performance evaluation systems and introducing in-house
management training; (b) start 5 more training centers (in addition to the
existing 6); and (c) develop a training/development program for PLN's senior
technical staff.
Accounting and Budgeting
6.06      The present system of accounting, installed in the early 1970s,
though generally following normal utility practice, is in a need for improve-
ment. Though delays in the finalization of accounts have been greatly
reduced, there is scope for further improvement. PLN's procedures for budget
preparation and monitoring expenditures still need to be properly coordinated
between departments and between regional offices. PLN's management has initi-
ated a detailed review of the procedures. Under the Eleventh Power Project
(Loan 2056-IND) Bank funds have been provided for management consultancy in
setting up an appropriate accotunting system, strengthening budgetary control
procedures and computerizing the accounts. This study is still in progress,
as there was considerable delay in appointment of consultants. PLN has also
engaged consultants to improve assets evaluation, inventory control and
project cost accounting. A major constraint to PLNs accounting has been a
lack of trained senior accountants. Steps are being taken to redress this
situation through the training program and transfer of personnel from the
Ministry of Finance.
Procurement
6.07      Procurement of goods and services has a major influence on PLN's
overall performance in project implementation. Procedures introduced b7 GOI
in 1980 and 1981 for external control of procurement of both consultants
services and of goods and services have reduced PLN's autonomy in procure-
ment. These procedures have also considerably lengthened the time required in
the procurement cycle, particularly bid evaluation, approval of the evalua-
tion, contract negotiations, etc. PLY is looking into this problem to find
ways and means of trimming down internal procedures to reduce delays. The
organization of procurement has been reviewed, inter alia, by consultants in
the context of the project management study under the Eighth Power Project
(Loan 1708-IND).



- 20 -
Overall Performance
6.08      PL3's overall performance from the time of appraisal in 1976/77
through 1983/84 has been impressive. Its sales increased annually by an aver-
age of 181. The performance indicators such as the number of consumers per
employee increased from 5.6 to 12.0 (i.e., by 1142) and energy sold per
employee increased from 142 MWh to 273 MWh (i.e., by 922). Its ambitious
customer connection programs were fulfilled year after year. Access to ser-
vice increased by about 50X. Standards of reliability of supply were
improved. The rate of growth of uneconomic captive plants in the country
declined after 1977. Improvements in the speed of implementation of projects
have been eroded by slippages of over a year in construction of major thermal
projects like Muara Karang, Semarang and Suralaya. The main problems have now
shifted to complex procurement procedures and resource constraints. PLN's
drive to reduce transmission and distribution losses which appeared to have
run out of momentum, has recently been revived (Loan 2214-IND) and an
intensive loss reduction effort has been initiated.
VII . ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01      An economic re-evaluation of the 2 x 200 KW units for Nuara Karang
has been done, essentially on the lines of the SAR. The re-evaluation is
based on constant end-1981/1982 prices. The main points which highlight the
differences between the data and assumptions used in the SAR and those used in
the reevaluation are summarized below.
Plant Capacity Factor
7.02      The 8AR assumed a capacity factor of about 70?  for the first
10 yearst reducing to about 552 tovards the end of the plant life of
30 years. The PCR uses actual capacity factor values from 1981/82 to 1983/84
and values declining from about 652 from 1984/85 to about 301 in 2006/07 as
shown in Annex 6, assuming a plant economic life of 25 years. Lower capacity
factors are used in the PCR, in view of the planned shift from oil to coal as
fuel for the base loaded thermal stations.
Fuel Price
7.03      The SAR's economic evaluation was based on a fuel price of
US$11.25 per barrel of Bunker C oil (US cents 7.1/liter or Rp 29.4/liter in
1976 prices); the equivalent energy cost being tp 9.1/kWh generated. Prior to
1984/85, the fuel oil prices to PLN were subsidize4d In 1984/85 the fuel oil
price for PLY was slightly above the international price. The PCI uses a
1984/85 fuel price of Rp 200/liter (equivalent to about US$31.8 per barrel),
actual gross fuel efficiency of 0.24 1/kWh, amounting to an energy cost of
Rp 48/kWh in 1984/85 prices or Rp 34.3/kWh in 1981/82 prices.



- 21 -
Operation and Maintenance Cost
7.04      The BAR had assumed an operation and maintenance cost of 2X of the
capital cost for Muara Karang and the associated transmission and distribu-
tion. The PCR uses actual OiM costs for Muara Karang from 1981/82 up to
1984/85 and the 1984/85 value throughout the remainder of the plant life. O&N
and administration costs for transmission and distribution are based on actual
costs furnished by PLU per kWh of electricity sales from 1981/82 to 1984/85
and the 1984/85 value for the remaining years. These cests are much higher
than the SAR value of 22 of the capital costs.
Benefits
7.05      The SAR evaluated the benefits on the basis of average sale price of
Rp 27.21 per kVh in 1976 prices. The PC& evaluates the benefits based on
actual average revenues per kVh from 1981/82 to 1984/85 and the 1984/85 value
for the rest of the plant life. As may be seen from Annex 6 Table 2, revenue
barely covered the fuel cost in 1982/83 and was below fuel cost in 1981/82.
These aspects are not revealed in PLN's financial statements as the fuel costs
were heavily subsidized by GOI. To allow for the distortion (arising out of
001's subsidizing of fuel costs without allowing PLN to raise tariffs) the PCR
assumes additional benefits corresponding to the difference between the
economic fuel cost and the subsidized fuel cost, for the years 1981/82 to
1983/84.
KIBB Computation
7.06      Details of the economic reevaluation are presented in Annex 6.  The
EIR works out to 9.42 without considering the compensation for fuel subsidy
(para. 7.05) and 12.32 with this compensation. The values are lower than the
SAM figure of 20.9X due to several factors such as delays in commissioning,
much higher system OUM cost and comparatively higher fuel cost via a vis
revenue realized. A sensitivity test using OlM cost at 21 of capital cost (as
assumed in the SAR) yields an EIRR of 18.2Z.
VIII. COICLUSIONS
Achievement of Project Objectives
8.01      Construction of the two 200 MW units at Muara Karang was a timely
augmentation of the generation capability of PLY, as borne out by the
sustained load growth at an average annual rate of 18X.
8.02      The two 200 MS units have been operating at about 652 capacity
factor instead of 701 assumed in the SAR. further, with shift away from oil
fired generation to coal, the capacity factor for Nuara Karang will progres-
sively reduce. The Nuara Karang units achieve an economic internal rate of
return of 12.31, with benefit evaluation based on prevailing tariff levels in
view of much higher than anticipated OLM costs and lower revenue realizations
compared to fuel costs.



- 22 -
8.03      The technical studies associated with the project have served as
useful preparatory ground for future Bank operations in the power sectort and
some of them have contributed to institutional development of PLN. The ENV
system study has paved the way for establishment of the national SHV grid
which is presently nearing completion of its first phase.
Project Implementation and Operating Outcome
8.04      Implementation of the Muara Karang thermal power project was
achieved with an inordinate delay of 22 months for unit 4 and 18 months for
unit 5 (the delays were 20 months for unit 4 and 12 months for unit 5 with
regard to SAR projection) and delay in 150 kV transmission (not covered under
the project) curtailed output from unit 4 in the first year of operation. The
delay was due to a combination of several factors, the most important of which
were (a) delays in finalizing contracts; (b) weakness in construction supervi-
sion leading to misalignment and tardy response from the consultant in final-
izing corrective measures; and (c) unsatisfactory performance of the
contractor for mechanical and electrical works of unit 4 coupled with design
changes.
8.05      The power plant has been operating satisfactorily and has achieved
guaranteed figures of performance. The outage record of the units has been
good.
8.06      PLY continued to make progress in institutional development and
financial performance over the tenure of the project. While a lot has been
done in these fields, more still remains to be done and PLN is making serious
efforts towards maintaining the momentum of progress.
Performance of External Agencies
8.07      The Bank not only continued but also intensified its involvement in
the growth of PL1 and in the development of the power sector.  PLY extended
excellent cooperation to Bank missions and appreciated the Bank's role in its
power sector development.
