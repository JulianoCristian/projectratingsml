Such ratings are now\n            downgraded, showing an unsatisfactory project outcome,\n            unlikely sustainability, and negligible institutional\n            development impacts, accompanied by unsatisfactory Bank and\n            Borrower performances. However, it is worth noting that -\n            and even though private sector development was not a theme\n            under this operation- important economic benefits to the\n            country were recorded as a result of the big expansion in\n            gas, and power production by private enterprises. The Bank\n            played both a catalytic, as well as direct enabling role in\n            bringing this inflow of foreign direct investment to the\n            energy sector, which, by and large, is better positioned\n            than a decade ago, despite major unresolved problems in its\n            parastatal entities. The main lessons drawn from this\n            operational reassessment suggest that: 1) selecting a Sector\n            Adjustment Loan - SECAL - as the lending instrument was a\n            poor choice, particularly in the case of long-gestation,\n            institutional energy sector reforms, given the imperatives\n            of the budgetary balance of payments to quickly disburse\n            funds, and because this erodes ownership of reforms by\n            implementing agencies, precisely because of lack of funding\n            to them; 2) creating new entities is not a solution to the\n            deep-seated problems of corporate governance, and managerial\n            weakness that plague the energy sector; and, 3)  the\n            creation of new entities should not be fostered, unless the\n            Bank is willing to commit assistance to entities evolved\n            from Bank-financed reforms."}, "docdt": "2004-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
