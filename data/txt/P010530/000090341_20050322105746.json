The lessons\n            learned indicate the implementation experience of Nepal\n            Irrigation Sector Project (NISP) has shown that in Nepal it\n            is not administratively advisable to include a stand-alone\n            investment, such as Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project\n            (SMIP), as part of a sector program. For complex design\n            projects, financial management arrangements at least, have\n            to be made simple during the design stage. The failure of\n            the Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research and\n            Extension Project (DOA/AREP) to deliver improved\n            agricultural extension services to Farmer-Managed Irrigation\n            Scheme (FMIS) supported under NISP, has clearly demonstrated\n            the risks associated with relying on separate initiatives to\n            provide services needed for component implementation,\n            especially where close coordination and proper integration\n            between the components are needed. Considerable difficulties\n            remain with regards to the structure and operation of WUA on\n            publicly managed schemes like SMIP. The identification and\n            screening of FMIS for improvement and rehabilitation is a\n            difficult process that requires the use of an objective\n            transparent process, such as those developed under the\n            project. FMIS canals in the hills have been found vulnerable\n            to frequent natural disasters. The experience of M&E in\n            SMIP compared to the FMIS sub-component demonstrated that it\n            is not possible to carry out effective M&E unless clear\n            indications are provided as to how it will be funded, and\n            how it will be undertaken. In sector-wide projects like NISP\n            it is very important that the position of Project\n            Coordinator is filled by a senior experienced officer, and\n            that he or she is kept in post for as long as possible. The\n            full benefit from improvement and rehabilitation of FMIS is\n            only achieved when the investment made includes the\n            provision of technical advice on agriculture and water\n            management, as well as the construction of civil works."}, "docdt": "2005-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
