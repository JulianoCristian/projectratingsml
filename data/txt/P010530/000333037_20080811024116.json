development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the projects included: donors need to\n            work together more effectively, with each working to their\n            comparative advantage, the aim being to achieve a harmonized\n            sector-wide approach that avoids duplication and\n            contradictions. In Nepal this assessment found while it made\n            sense for donors' projects to be geographically\n            differentiated this was at the expense of sector-wide\n            coordination and mutual learning. Do not lose sight of\n            project beneficiaries. Too much attention to water resource\n            policy and management deflected attention from the need to\n            reform public sector management of large-scale irrigation\n            projects and improve service delivery. As a result the\n            longer-term sustainability of the public irrigation\n            subsector and farmers' livelihoods dependent on it are\n            at high risk in Nepal. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\n            are generally better at working with farmers to increase the\n            productivity of small-scale farmer-managed irrigation\n            systems. The project clearly demonstrated that partnership\n            with NGOs in Nepal enabled agricultural productivity\n            improvements in remote locations where the poorest rural\n            communities are located. Greater attention should be given\n            to monitoring and evaluation to ensure informed policy\n            making and decision making. In Nepal the scope of data\n            collection and storage of data on agricultural input and\n            output performance information significantly contracted\n            during the transition from public to private service provision."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
