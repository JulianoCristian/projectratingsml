REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTCRS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF  FINLAND
FOR A FORESTRY PROJECT
1.   I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Finland for the equivalent of TS$20 million to help
finance a forestry project.  The loan would have a term of 15 years, in-
cluding 4 years of grace, with interest at 71 percent per annum.
PART I -   THE ECONOMY
2.   A memorandum on "Current Economic Developments in Finland" (R72-22)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 17, 1972. It brought
up to date the information contained in the report on "Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Finland" (R71-21), dated January 22, 1971.
Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.   Finland's rate of economic growth averaged about five percent per year
during the last twenty years, with per capita GNP increasing at about 4.5
percent annually.  While satisfactory if seen over a longer span, the
growth rate has shown wide variations from year to year. The relatively
large amplitude of cyclical fluctuations is mainly the result of the struc-
ture of the economy. Wood, pulp and paper industry are predominant in
Finnish industrial production and exports, and fluctuations in internatio-
nal demand and prices for these products are larger than the underlying
fluctuations in the economies of Finland's major export markets. In recent
decades, economic development in Finland has been accompanied by diversifi-
cation ofithe structure of industry, thus, the share of wood and paper in-
dustry products has declined from about four-fifths of total exports in
1950 to less than three-fifths in 1970 (i.e. by about 20 percentage points).
Structural diversification is, however, a long-term process, and the
Finnish economy _isstill largely dependent on the wood, pulp and paper
industry.
4.   Recent experience once again reveals this dependence.   After
a strong export-led boom in 1969-1970, economic growth in 1971 was at its
lowest since 1958, with real GDP increasing by only one percent. The dis-
tinct slowdown of growth, from about 8 percent in 1970, resulted mainly from
a sharp decline in export demand; but protracted labor disputes in the metal
and engineering industries and,restrictive monetary measures taken to im-
prove the balance of payments also contributed. Exports declined by 5 percent
in volume and industrial production virtually stagnated. The wood and paper
industry, which exports approximately two-thirds of its production and still
contributes over half of Finland's merchandise exports, suffered not only
from the weakening demand in the West European markets but also from increased
competition from North American producers. Some mills had to close down
temporarily because of marketing difficulties.



5.   Along with the economic recession the employment situation deteriorated.
This was also partly because net emigration of labor came to a halt in 1971
as a result of a slowdown of economic activity in Sweden; the unemployment
rate in that year rose to over 2 percent and to almost 3 percent in the first
half of 1972. Regional differences in unemployment have widened, with the
number of jobless growing fastest in the forest regions of Eastern and Northern
Finland.
6.   Despite the decline in economic activity, price increases accelerated
significantly and the balance of payments deficit on current account rose from
US$239 million in 1970 to US$342 million in 1971.  The trade gap increased by
one-third, largely because of a deterioration in the terms of trade (import
prices increased significantly more than export prices), aind an unusually
large trade deficit with the Soviet Union. Consumer prices increased, despite
controls, by 8.7 percent in 1971, after 3.2 percent in 1970. The major factor
behind the rapid rise in prices was the marked increase in wages followinng an
inflationary wage settlement.
7.   While short-term economic management in 1972 attempts to strengthen the
export-induced economic upturn now under way, long-term policies remain
focussed on broadening Finland's industrial structure and export base.   The
main objectives for this approach are a more balanced pattern of economic
growth and employment, an improvement in the regional and personal income.
distribution and reduced   pressure on the balance of payments.
8.   The Government embarked in 1965 on a long-term program of forest impro-
vement to enable the wood working industry to operate near capacity and to
secure its moderate expansion in the late 1970's (See paragraph 21). The
good export performance of other industries (such as machinery, textiles and
transport equipment) has shown that industrial diversification
in Finland has not been without success and needs to be continued. Although
facing the limitations of a small domestic market, Finland has good opportu-
nities in producing engineering products and specializing in "tailor-made"
products. Relatively che4p labor has been a distinct advantage over other
European competitors. The promotion of labor-intensive industries appears
to offer an important means to stem the outflow of emigrants, and a more
active regional development policy has recently been adopted with the estab-
lishment of a Regional Development Fund (KERA).
9.   In agriculture Finland has been facing problems of overproduction for
years, mainly in dairy products and more recently in pork. Price subsidies
to increase the domestic consumption of surplus products together with
premiums paid for the retirement of acreage and the reduction of production
has become a considerable burden on the government budget. Progress in
inducing farmers to change over to the production of conmodities more in
demand, such as beef, which is less remunerative, is slow an61 the restiuctur-
ing of agriculture depends very much on the ability of farmeis to find work
in industry.



-3-
10. An area of promise appears to be the tourism industry, which has become
a source of net foreign exchange earnings only recently and could greatly
stimulate economic activity in the North and the East. Uncrowded resorts,
spaciousness, and the proximity to the population centers of continental
Europe are advantages from which Finland could derive substantial benefits.
11. The increasing pollution of Finland's lakes, however, would diminish
these prospects, and it is already threatening the country's water supplies.
Two factors which are particularly pertinent to the pollution problem in
Finland are the general shallowness of its lakes and the existence on their
shores of an industry which is a huge consumer of water and a producer of
large volumes of strong, treatment-resistant wastes.  This is the pulp and
paper industry, the principal export industry of Finland. At present3 about
15 percent of Finland's lakes are affected by waste, most of it stemming
from this industry. The industry is presently under an obligation to re-
duce pollution through technical improvements in the production process
and mechanical purification, so that by 1980 waste of organic origin would
be reduced by 30-50 percent of present levels and that of suspended solids
by about 20 percent. The total estimated cost of those measures would be
in the order of US$200 million during the 1970's. For FY 74, a Bank loan
of about US$20 million is envisaged to help finance a pollution control
project which would be part of a comprehensive national program covering
all industrial and municipal water pollution (see paragraph 18).
12. Finland's economic prospects depend to a significant extent on its
relationship with the expanded EEC. Finland's aim in negotiations with the
EEC was to maintain its competitive position in Europe through industrial
free-trade arrangements, while preserving its political neutrality and its
special trading arrangements with the Soviet Union. Finland was particularly
concerned to secure special treatment for paper products3 however, the
industrial free trade agreement that has been reached with EEC makes a
special exception for paper products with gradual reduction in the EEC tariff
over twelve years.
13. During 1967-1971, Finland's annual net inflow of long- and medium-term
capital averaged about US$185 million. The bulk of these funds consisted
of private loans, largely suppliers and trade credits, and international
bond issues. The Government's policy of raising as much of the country's
external capital needs as possible through long-term bond issues. is limited
by the 'smallness- of foreign markets for Finnish issues and the s?mail
size of Finnish companies. Advantage was taken of favorable conditions
in foreign markets to float seven bond issues for a total of US$100
million in 1971. The maturity of these issues varies from 9-18 years and
the interest rate is between'7-9 percent. During the first six months of
1972, four bond issues for a total of about US$88 million have been floated
with maturity varying from 7-15 years and interest from 7 to 8½ percent.
Substantial forign borrowing will be required in the future to support the
changes in Finland's industrial structure pursued by the Government.



14. Although Bank lending has contributed only a small portion (less than
5 percent) to the gross inflow of medium- and long-term capital to Finland,
it has helped to reassure private investors in Finnish issues and has pro-
bably enabled Finland to borrow much more from the international capital
market than it could otherwise have done. Mainly in view of this, and
despite the relatively high per capita income, we intend to continue for
some more years lending Finland modest amounts which, in view of repay-
ments falling due on earlier loans, will not result in any increase - and
may indeed diminish - the Bank's net investment in that country.
15. Finland's total external debt (excluding amounts undisbursed) was about
US$1,400 million on December 31, 1971. External public debt was about
US$985 million and the debt outstanding to the Bank US$127.2 million on the
same date. The debt service ratio on external debt was about 10 percent in
1971 as compared to about 6 percent in 1965, which indicates that Finland
is creditworthy for substantial amounts of long-term debt.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16. The Bank has made sixteen loans to Finland, totalling US$276.8 million,
of which about US$116 million is disbursed and outstanding. Apart from
small amounts for forestry under Loans 21-FI (FY50) and 61-FI (FY52), the
proposed loan would be the first to the agricultural sector. The most
recent loan (US$13 million) to Finland was made in FY71 for a third road
project; the two previous road loans totalled US$48.5 million. Otherwise
Bank lending has been concentrated on industry (12 loans totalling US$215.3
million) through various channels including in the period 1964 to 1971,
the Industrialization Fund of Finland.
17. IFC has made investments in four Finnish enterprises, totalling US$3.15
million. Of these, those in the form of loans have all been fully repaid.
IFC sold its shareholding in Huktamaki-yhtyma Oy in May 1971 and April 1972,
and presently holds shares in Teollistamisrahasto Oy- Industrialization Fund
of Finland Ltd. IFC currently has no projects under consideration in Finland.
Annex II contains a sumiary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
October 31, 1972.
18. The proposed project is the' only one in this year's lending program.
As mentioned in paragraph 11 above, a pollution control project is scheduled
for FY74 which, within a comprehensive national pollution control program,
would cover the needs of the pulp and paper industry for a three or four
year period beginning around calendar year 1974. The objective would be to
organize an industry-wide solution to the pollution problem, while preserving
the industry's competitiveness, and to promote research into improved techniques
of water treatment. Bank funds (about US$2() million would be combined with
national funds in a pool from which industry could borrow for financing part
of the costs of investments for pollution control.



PART III - FORESTRY IN FINLAND
19. Finland has a land area of 31 million ha, of which 19 million ha
(61 percent) are covered by productive forests6 In the north where the
daily temperatures range between -30°C and +20 C, tree growth is extremely
slow and gives way to tundra; in the south, growth rates equal those found
elsewhere in most of northern Europe. Three tree sDecies have economic
importance: Scots pine, comprising 44 percent of the forest area; Norway
spruce, 37 percent; and birch and other hardwoods, 19 percent. Pine
and spruce have always been in demand for pulping and sawtimber, but until
recently birch was considered mainly a firewood tree. It is now, however,
in demand for plywood and pulp (used in mixture with conifers). The time
required to produce a tree suitable for final harvesting varies from 75
years in the south to 200 years in the north. Ownership of forests is
divided between the state (25 percent), forest industrial companies ( 7
percent), about 330,000 farmers with average forest holdings of 30 ha
(65 percent), and communes and parishes (3 percent). Of these, only the
state- and company-owned forests are normally managed commercially. Because
of their small size, the forests owned by farmers do not containrrepre-
sentative age distribution, and it is not usual for individuals to cut as
much as would be possible on the basis of sustained yield (i.e. ensuring
in perpetuity an equal or increasing supply of wood).
20. As mentioned earlier, wood based products manufactured in Finland
accounted for 55% of exports in 1971. Of these, more than two-thirds were
paper products and pulp. Finland's share of world export markets was
9 percent for coniferous sawn timber, 14 percent for plywood, 14 percent
for wood pulp and 15 percent for paper and paper board. The present slow-
down in world demand is expected to end within a year. World demand outlook
for forest products as a-whole, despite the prospects for sharp cyclical
changes, is likely to remain good for some time.
21. The Government attaches high priority to improving the forests because
of the importance of the woodworking industry and its dependence on home-grown
wood. At present the effective cut of about 50 million m is the maximum
that can be allowed on a long-term basis (known as the Natio3al Allowable Drain,
NAD) and even now it is necessary to import some 2 million m a year. For
some years the Government has been sponsoring a forestry improvement program
recommended by the Finnish Forest Financing Committee (MERA) in 1964. The
program is now in its third phase (1971-1975) and consists of seeding and
planting, fertilization, drainage and road building. The financial and ad-
ministrative basis of Government aid for private improvement work is provided
by the Forest Improvement Law of .1967.
22. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is directly responsible for
the administration of state forests and controls operations in farmer and
company-owned forests through a National, two Central and 19 District
Forestry Boards, each with elected and nominated members with knowledge
of forestry or associated industries. In addition, to promote forest



-6-
improvement operations, there are 16 Forest Improvement Districts (FID).
The National Forestry Board (NFB) is responsible to the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Forestry for work in all forests. The Central Forestry Boards
(CFB) are located in Helsinki. The larger CFB, TAPIO, looks after the
Finnish-speaking districts, while the smaller, Skogskultur, is responsible
for the two Swedish-speaking districts.  The 19 District Forestry Boarcs
(DFB), are answerable to NFB and CFBs and regulate harvesting and forest
improvement operations in their districts. Forest Management Associations
(FMA) provide forest owners with assistance in planning, work leadership
and other technical matters under the guidance of CFBs and DFBs.
23. Provincial Boards, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior and
the Government agency for tax collection, are charged with the management
of loans granted under the forest improvement program. The past record
of payments of principal and interest under the loans is highly satisfactory.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24. The purpose of the project is to increase the domestic timber supply
required to utilize the full capacity of the wood working industry and to
permit its moderate expansion. The project was prepared by a committee
consisting of representatives of Government departments and other organiz-
ations associated with forestry and forest industries. It was submitted
to the Bank in April and appraised in May 1972. Negotiations were held
in Washington in November. The Finnish delegation comprised representatives
of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Finland, the National Forestry
Board and the Association of Woodworking Industries and was led by Mr.
Sederloef, Bank of Finland.
Project Description
25. The project forms part of the Government's on-going forest improvement
program (MERA III). While the project would include specific improvement
works in some 60,000 fanmer-owned (about 3 million ha) and 26 company-owned
forests (about 1.2 million ha), the loan would be disbursed for expenditures
on works in farmer-owned forests only. The project works would comprise
(i) seeding and planting of about 136,000 ha to regenerate poorly-stocked
stands, (ii) seedling stand improvements of about 315,000 ha, (iii) fertili-
zation of about 710,000 ha forests on mineral soil and peatland areas,
(iv) drainage of about 550,000 ha peatland, and (v) construction of about
8,o400 km access and extraction roads. Farmers or companies in South Finland
and in the two most southerly districts of North Finland would be eligible
for financial support from the Government to meet part of the cost of
planning and implementation of forest improvement works approved by the NFB.
An additional 31 million m3 of roundwood would be produced over a 20-year
period as a result of increasing the productivity of forests and their
areas through the project works. A loan and project summary is attached
as Annex III. The appraisal report, entitled "Forest Improvement Project -
Finland" (PA-152a), dated November 28, 1972, is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors.



-7-
Project Management and Implementation
26. The strategy and planning of forest improvement works is set out in
the national forestry improvement program. Overall responsibility for the
administration of the program rests with the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry while the National Forestry Board (NFB) and the two Central
Forestry Boards (CFB) would be responsible for project implementation.
The two CFBs would control the operations of the District Forestry Boards
(DFB) and the Forest Improvement Districts (FID). Applications for Govern-
ment assistance would be submitted to the NFB and include a description of
the proposed improvement works, a financing plan detailing Government loans
and any grants and the owner's commitment to repay the loans. On approval
by NFB, the DFBs and FIDs would be responsible for implementation including,
in the case of farmer-owned forests, the organization of, and contractual
arrangements for, a work force (possibly including the farmer himself) to
undertake manual operations and the award of contracts for mechanized
operations and the supply of fertiJizers. In the case of company forests,
DFBs would supervise implementation, including the award of contracts and
the execution of manual work. The existing professional and technical
forestry staff of the Ministry and the National, Central and District Boards
is inadequate to deal effectively with the project and would be strengthened.
Appointment of the staff in the Ministry and the NFB would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan. Assurances that this staff would be
appointed expeditiously were obtained during negotiations.
27, Present arrangements do not provide adequate coordination among
associated organizations in determining national policy, economic planning
and implementing forest improvement programs. A committee, to advise the
Minister of Agriculture and Forestry on all matters concerned with forest
improvement works, would therefore be established.  It would include senior
representatives from the Ministries of Finance-and Agriculture and Forestry,
the'Bank of Finland, and the Forest Research Institute, and an independent
banker or financier. The fo'rming of the committee would also be a condition
of effectiveness of the loan. The Government does not know of any problems
in this respect which might cause delays.
Project Costs
28. The project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $122 million. The
foreign exchange component of the materials and equipment required for the
total project is estimated at about $22 million or 18 percent of the total
cost. The labor component is estimated at 61 percent. Estimates are based
on cost statistics from past forest improvement programs in Finland. No
physical contingency has been applied because of the well'established proce-
dures and cost records of previous programs. A cumulative price contingency
of 5 percent annually has been included.
Project Financing
29.  The proposed Bank loan of'$20 million equivalent would provide 16 per-
cent of total project costs and 92 percent of foreign exchange costs. The
remaining costs would be financed as follows: 20 percent by farmers, 55
percent from budget funds of the Government and 9 percent by companies.



-8-
The contributions of the farmers (which would be collected by the DFBs)
and the companies would provide finance for 25 percent and 77 percent of
the cost of their respective operations. The remainder would be provided
by the Government through loans to both farmers and companies and grants
to farmers.
30. For improvement operations in farmer-owned forests, the DFBs would
pay contractors using their own funds and the contributions collected
from the farmers. On completion of the works, the exact cost of the
operation would be determined and the amount and type of Government aid
involved calculated. Private forest owners are eligible for a grant or
loan, or both, in accordance with the provisions of the Forest Improvement
Law of 1967. The type of assistance is determined by considering the type
of improvement to be made, the farmer's gross income and the locality of
his farm. The lower the income and the slower the rate of tree growth on
his farm, the higher the grant and the more favorable the conditions of
the loan. Loans to farmers would carry interest rates between 3 and 5
percent, repayment periods between six and 23 years, and grace periods
between one and seven years.
31. Loans to companies would carry commercial interest rates (currently
about 8.5 percent), with much shorter repayment and no grace periods. Companies
would not be eligible hor grants.  The regulations governing the loans to
companies would follow in principle the provisions of the Forest Improvement
Law and would provide for the size and conditions of loans for civil works,
manual operations and fertilizer contracts. They are being prepared by the
Government and their publication would be a condition of effectiveness of
the loan.
Procurement
32. Civil works undertakings, comprising road building ($15.9 million) and
drainage ($25.6 million), and the purchase ($12.2 million) of fertilizers
would be bulked into as large orders as practicable. However, because of
the scattered nature of the work in forests throughout South Finland, the
phasing of the project over three years and the substantial number of
relatively small contracts, bulking of contracts in many instances would
not be possible. All contracts of $100,000 or more would be subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Smaller contracts would be subject to Government tender procedures which
are satisfactory. Other operations (including planting and seeding) would
be carried out by direct labor, organized and supervised by the District
Boards in the case of private owners and by professional staff in the case
of company forests. All tender documents for contracts of $100,000 or more
would be subject to Bank approval and recommendations for award would be
submitted to the Bank for comment. For contracts of $25,000 or more but
less than $100,000 the Bank would agree with the Government on standard
documents and procedures for bidding, and the Bankts approval would be
sought only if the Government intended to award a contract to other than the
lowest bidder.



-9-
Disbursements
33. To simplify disbursement the Bank loan would be disbursed for 28
percent of Government expenditures on forest improvement operations only
in farmer-owned forests. Disbursements would be made against expenditurQs
incurred on civil works contracts (including contracts for road construc-
tion and drainage in farmer-owned land), on fertilization and on seeding,
planting and seedling stand improvement.
Economic and Social Benefits
34. The National Allowable Drain (NAD) is the maximum amount of timber
which may be harvested from all Finnish forests on the basis of sustained
yield and is determined annually in respect of all forest in Finland. The
economic justification of the project depends on the fact that, with the
forest improvement works to be carried out under the project, the NAD
would immediately be greater than without the project. It is the substan-
tial quantity of mature forests in Finland that permits harvesting in
advance. The additional NAD, as a result of the project, and cost savings
from the road construction program, have been taken as the project benefits.
The incremental administrative costs for the main project organizations,
the cost of labor employed in the project area, cost of maintenance and
harvesting costs have been included in the total costs. The economic rate
of return would thus be 33 percent, assuming (i) labor employed in the
project area is shadow-rated at 80 percent of current wage rates (in view
of unemployment in the area) and (ii) the estimated international round
wood price delivered at millgate is 70 Finnmarks per cubic meter.  The
economic return would drop to 27 percent if wood prices were reduced to
65 Finnmarks per cubic meter.
35. The mature forests Which are the basis for the favorable economic
rate of return, are largely owned by small farmers. Records of past
improvement operations indicate that only about 30% of the farmers owning
forests would participate in the improvement program. However, it is
extremely unlikely that their forests would contain all the mature timber
ready for cutting. Only part of the benefits of the project would there-
fore accrue to those participating farmers. The balance would be harvested
in the remaining forests in Finland as part of the increased NAD. In order
to ensure sufficient participation of farmers to permit the envisaged
increase of the NAD, a system of incentives of grants and subsidized
interest rates has been introduced and in operation for many year3 (see
paragraph 30 above).
36. There is substantial unemployment and underemployment in the rural
areas of Finland. Forest improvement works with a high labor component
(61 percent in the project) are ideally suited to increase job opportuni-
ties in those areas by affording year-long paid employment. Work in
agriculture, the only alternative in the area, is seasonal for the farmer
and his paid labor because of the long winter.  Moreover, the Government
has an active program to reduce agricultural production, which is in



- 10 -
surplus and subsidized (see paragraph 9 above). The forest improvement
program has been used by Government to relieve umemployment, to reduce
migration to the cities and, through its grant element, to implement its
policy of income redistribution.
PART V  - LEGAL INSTPRUENTS AND AUTHORITY
37. The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Fin-
land, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Sectioh 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
38. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.  I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Performance under all loans has been satisfactory. As under
the previous two highway loans, the works under the third highway
loan are being executed on schedule. The closing date for loan
708-FI to IFF has just been postponed to December 31, 1975. This
will allow IFF to withdraw the funds from the Bank loan at a slower
rate and thus to use funds from other external sources, which it
was able to raise at relatively favorable terms and conditions.
