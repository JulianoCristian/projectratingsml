Given the lack of consensus on reforms, more\n            preparatory activities should have been carried out prior to\n            project approval, and irreversible action, such as enactment\n            of legislation, taken prior to effectiveness; and, 3)\n            designing financial targets should have been considered, to\n            be applicable on a consolidated basis, thus requiring\n            consolidated accounts by Petrobangla, and, compliance with\n            covenants should have required tariff policies, with tariff\n            adjustments necessarily following, i.e. through indexation."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
