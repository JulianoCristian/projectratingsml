I       D Mission: Enhancingdevelopment effectivenessthrough excellenceand independenceinevaluation.                    I
  Aboutthis Report
       The Operations EvaluationDepartmentassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bankfor two
  purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank's work is
  producingthe expected results,andsecond, to help develop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough
  the disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, OED annually assessesabout 25 percentof
  the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those that are
  innovative, large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which
  ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and those that are likely to generate
  important lessons. The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation
  studies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
  Report (a self-evaluation by the responsibleBank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
  PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowing country for onsite discussionswith project staff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
  OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
  PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
  Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


 About the OED RatingSystem
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
 The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-main page.html).
       Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
 current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
 goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy:The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency:The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
 opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
 to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
 better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
 better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
 institutionalarrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
 project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BankPerformance:The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
 supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
 for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance:The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibilityto ensure
 quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
 achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
 Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface


         This is a ProjectPerformance AssessmentReport (PPAR) on the Bangladesh
Second Gas Development project (Cr. 1586-BD) and Gas Infrastructure Development
project (Cr. 2720-BD). The Second Gas Development project was funded by an IDA
Credit o f SDR 112.9 million, approved inApril 1985. Cofinancing o f US$88.2 million
was providedby CIDA (US$26.2 million), DFID (US$38.3 million), DGIS, Netherlands,
(US$15.2 million), andUNDP(US$8.5 million). It was closed inDecember 1993, three
and a halfyears after the original closing date, when anundisbursedbalance o f SDR 28.7
million was canceled. Subsequently, a credit o f SDR 83.4 millionwas approved inMay
1995 to support the Gas Infrastructure DevelopmentProject, which closed on schedule in
June 2000, when SDR 34.5 millionwas canceled. Cofinancing o fUS$26.9 millionwas
provided by DFID (UK).

         This report is basedonthe ImplementationCompletionReports preparedbythe
South Asia Region, (Report no. 16257 o f January 1997 and report no. 21529 o f January
2001), the appraisal documents (Report no. 5353, April, 1985, and Reportno. 13014,
April, 1995) loandocuments, project files and discussions with Bank staff An
Operations EvaluationDepartment (OED) mission visitedBangladesh inDecember 2003
to discuss the effectiveness o fthe Bank's assistance with the government, the project
implementingagencies, and cofinanciers. The collaboration and assistance o f all these
officials are gratefully acknowledged.

         The Bank has beeninvolvedinthe development o fBangladesh's gas resources
for over 25 years andprovided substantial financial support andpolicy advice to the
government for the gas sector duringthe 1980sand 1990s. This report reviewsthe last
two IDA-fundedgas projects inBangladesh at a time when a re-engagement inthe gas
sector i s under consideration after a hiatus o f several years.

         The mission also carried out aperformance reassessmentofthe Energy Sector
Adjustment Credit (1989), which will beissuedconcurrently as a separatereport. It
contains complementary information on institutionalreforms andpricing inthe gas sector
duringthe 1990s.

Following standard OED procedures, the draft o fthe PPAR was sent to the Borrower and
cofinanciers for comments before finalization. The Borrower's response i s attached as
Annex B.

 Summary


         The Second Gas Development Project andthe subsequent Gas Infrastructure
 DevelopmentProjectwere the Bank's last two gas projects so far inthe Bangladesh,
 covering a 15-year period from 1985 to 2000. The projects shared two common
 objectives: alleviation o f the worsening gas supply shortages and strengthening o f the
 institutionalcapabilities o fPetrobangla, the parastatal managingBangladesh's gas sector.
 The first project also sought to evaluate gas reservesto provide abasis for long-term gas
 field development, while the secondproject focused on furtherreforms to improvethe
 enabling environment for private sector participation inthe sector.

         The overall outcome o f Second Gas Development Projectwas satisfactory.
Highlyrelevant objectives were substantially achieved andproject resources were
 effectively utilized. The reservoir engineering study was extremelyvaluable and ledto
the tripling o f the estimate o fBangladesh's provengas reserves. Although complex
project design andrepeatedproblems o fprocurement and contract management ledto
major delays, the project ultimately exceededits production objectives and yieldedhigh
 economic returns. Sustainability is rated as`highly likely, giventhat the installations
fundedbythe projecthave beenoperating satisfactorily for over a decade. However, the
project didnot improve Petrobangla's operational andmanagement capability andthus
institutional development i s ratednegligible.Bank and borrower performance are both
assessed as unsatisfactory.

         The outcome ofthe Gas Infrastructure DevelopmentProjectis moderately
unsatisfactory, despite it highlyrelevant objectives. Physical components were built at
substantially lower cost than appraised, are operated satisfactorilybut only partially
increased gas supplies. Sustainabilityi s rated as likely. Modest improvements occurred in
Petrobangla's ability to deal with environmental and safety matters and the fledgling gas
transmission company was strengthened. Institutionaldevelopment i s rated as modest. At
appraisal there was inadequate attention to sector policy and organizationalreform -
components, actions or loan conditionality to further the private sector development
objective were missing. Government's reluctance to raise gas prices andto complete
asset transfers to the new gas transmission company forestalled project restructuring that
would have enabled the use o fmajor cost savings. As a result, over 40 percent o f the
Credit that could have beenusedfor investmentsinsystemexpansion with high
economic returns, was canceled. As for its predecessor project, the financial and
institutionalweakness o f Petrobangla i s a significant downside risk to overall long-term
sustainability.

        BankandBorrowerperformance is ratedhighlyunsatisfactory. Specifically, the
project was unsatisfactory at entry and supervision was deficient. Government ownership
was low and it was unwillingto find a solution to the stalled transfer o fpipelines to the
transmission company. Financial covenants were ignored and there was no corrective
action on gas prices, despite repeated reminders from the Bank and other lenders.

  The following lessons are drawn from the experience ofthese two projects:

  Indesigninginstitutionaldevelopment components ofprojects, the incentives for
  those directly concerned byproposed changes should be well aligned with the
  project objectives. Inparticular, the staffing andremuneration implications o f
  major institutionalreorganizations (such as the creation o f GTCL), needto be
  well understood and explicitly addressedifreorganizations are to be successfblly
  implemented;

0 Buildinga strong gas industry ofinternationalstandard requires amajor IDeffort:
  better management, greatly increased training, betterremuneration andmore

  The Bank should take a less dogmatic approachto sector reforms andpractice
  greater sensitivityto local socio-political constraints, ifit i s to achieve
  collaborativedialog and succeedinobtaining Borrower `buy-in' to its proposals.

 Background

 1.         Natural gas i s the principal source o f commercial energy inBangladesh,
 accounting for about 40 percent o f the total energy supply andwell over 60 percent o f
 commercial energy consumption. The country's remainingproven andprobable gas
 reserves are already large but could be substantially increased by field delineation and
 infilldrillinginexistinggeological structures, Theratioofreservesto annualproduction
 i s about 38 years, considerably higher than for most gas-producing countries.

 2.         Whenthe Second GasDevelopmentProject (SGDP) was approved inthe mid-
 1980s, the gas industryinBangladeshwas still at an early stage o f development. Six gas
 fields were inproduction, and o f the country's total gas-in-place only a third was
 considered proven due to the modest amount o f delineation drilling.

 3.         By 1985, the development ofthe gas sector hadledto rapidgrowthin
commercial energy use and a progressive decline inthe share o f commercial energy
derivedfrom (imported) liquidhydrocarbons. At that time, amainthrust ofthe energy
policy was to reduce the dependence on oil imports by accelerating the development o f
the domestic gas resources (for power and for fertilizer) and increasing the economy's
absorptive capacity for gas.'

4.          Subsequentdevelopments have shown that the faith inthe country's gas prospects
was justified. Gas productionhas increased tenfold inthe past 20 years, doubling over the
past decade. Almost halfo f all gas producedinBangladesh i s consumed for power
generation, which i s now overwhelmingly gas-based (almost 90 percent). The fertilizer
sector consumes over a fifth o f gas production, while the remainingthirdi s consumed by
the industrial andresidentialusersa2The demand for gas to 2010 i s expected to continue
growing at 6 to 8 percent ann~ally,~             drivenbythe robust growthinpower demand andthe
low level o f accessto electricity inrural areas.

5.          Since 1994, growth inthe Bangladesh gas sector has beenhelpedby foreign
private companies operating under production sharing contracts (PSCS).~Evenso, there
has beenlittle systemic reform over the past 20 years. The sector i s still largely
dominated by the government, acting since the mid-1970s through Petrobangla, a state
holding company with multiple subsidiaries.

6.         Petrobangla (PB) i s responsible for the exploration and development o f
Bangladesh's oil, gas and mineral resources. It has been a statutory body o fthe
government since 1985, operating under the purview o f the Ministryo f Energyand
Mineral Resources. Itholds the shares o f all the state-owned companies dealing inoil,
gas andmineral exploration and development (now nine innumber for gas, plus two for
solid minerals) on the Government's behalf. Inthe mid-1980s the PB Group consisted o f

 three productioncompanies5,and two transmission and distributioncompaniese6An
 exploration company (BAPEX) and natural gas liquidscompany (RPGCL) were set up in
 the late 1980s and the gas transmission company (GTCL) was created inthe early 1990s.

 in1999.


 Project Objectives, Components andDesign

 7.       The Second Gas Development project andGas InfrastructureDevelopment
 project had several common objectives and are treated inthis report as a series. The later
 project has been given greater emphasis than the first inthe analysis because the SGDP
 was completed over a decade ago and the evidentiary trail on it hasbeen somewhat
 overwrittenby the outcomes o fthe GIDP. Furthermore, the legacy o f actions taken by the
 Bank inthe last year o f the GlDP continues to be relevant for any new World Bank
 assistance inthe gas sector.

 8.       The objectives ofthe SecondGas Developmentproject were to (a) increase gas
 supply to reduce shortages; (b) to evaluate the gas reserves to provide abasis for long-
 term gas field development; and (c) to strengthen the operational and management
capability o f the Petrobangla Group companies.

9.        The main project components were:

      0   Gas FieldDevelopment:The initial development ofnortheastern gas fields
          (Kailashtila and Beani Bazar), primarily supplyingthe Dhaka area, through the
          drilling of appraisal wells, together withthe workovers oftwo existingwells at
          Rashidpur (US$23 million).

      0   Gas FieldAppraisals: Initialappraisalwells at four maingas fields (Bakhrabad,
          Titas, Habiganj, and Rashidpur) (US$33 million).

      0   Gas InfrastructureDevelopment:Gas andcondensatetreatment facilities at
          Kailashtila, Beani Bazar, and Rashidpur, a gas pipeline north-southfrom
          Kailashtilavia BeaniBazar and Rashidpur to Ashuganj, and a condensatepipeline
          from Beani Bazar to Kailashtila. (US$174 million)


      0   Reservoir engineeringstudies of eight gas fields.

SGDP Design

10.      The effort to expedite the development o f gas resources inBangladesh andto
bringthe gas to the market inthe shortest possible time, made project designunduly
complex. It was complex and difficult to administer and vulnerable to cascading delays in
implementation-a risk that was not fully appreciated at the time of appraisal:

6. Titas Gas Transmission & DistributionCo., Jalalabadgas Transmission & DistributionCo.

                                                 3


     0   First, the projectwas undertaken without firmknowledgeofthe potential o fthe
         relevant gas fields, information that would beprovidedby the appraisal wells.
         Given the evident potentialo f the Bangladeshi gas fields, it was appropriate for
         the project to incur the risk that this drilling inevitably implied, and the results
         were on the whole very positive.

     0   Second, major components o fthe project were dependent on a sequenceo f events
         with the risk ofcascading delays: (i) drilling o fthe appraisal wells, to be
                                                 the
         undertaken under a contract financed by CIDA (Canada); (ii) evaluation o f
                                                                           the
         these results to determine gas reserves (iii)  the design o f the gas pipelines and gas
         treatment plans; and (iv) the construction o fthese gas treatment and distribution
         facilities.

    0    Third, theresulting size o ftheprojectrequiredsubstantial cofinancing. The total
         project cost was estimated at appraisal atUS$221 million equivalent, o fwhich
         IDAwas to contributeUS$l10millionandbilateral co-financiers (Canada, UK,
         Netherlands and UNDP) a combinedtotal ofUS$83 million. GOB'Scontribution
         was to beUS$28 million. While the cofinanciers cooperated well throughout the
         period o f the project, the numerous agreements that were requiredbetween the
         individual cofinanciers andthe Government, andbetweenthe cofinanciers
         themselves, inevitably added to the complexity o f the project.


11.      Eveninthe absence ofthe procurement problems that dogged this project, a
simpler, multi-project structure would have preferable. The appraisal drilling, analysis of
results and design o f the subsequentinvestments could have comprised an initial
operation, with a second, a follow-on project that could have supported the priority
investments infield facilities, pipelineand gas fractionationbased on fully prepared and
mutually agreed investment plans. This would have permittedeachproject to be prepared
inmore final formpriorto approval, andreducedthe administrative burdenonthe project
entities inBangladesh.

12.     The objectives ofthe Gas InfrastructureDevelopmentprojectwere to: (a)
alleviate the worsening gas supply shortages through partially financing the sector's
priority investments; (b) assist inimplementing further reforms to improve the enabling
environment for private sector participationinthe sector; and (c) develop the gas sector
entities' institutionalcapabilities, particularly inthe areas o f operations and maintenance,
safety, environmentalprotection, accounting, and financial management.

13.     The mainproject components were:

    0   A gas pipelinefrom Ashuganj to Bakhrabad(US$55 million).

    0   A Supervisory Control and DataAcquisition (SCADA) andpipeline
        telecommunication system for the entire Petrobangla Group gas transmission
        trunkline from Kailashtilla to Chittagong(US$30 million).

   0    Three productionwells at Rashidpur gas field (US$17 million).

          develop managerial and technical capabilities o fthe newlycreated Gas

          and safety management system, strengthen Petrobangla's reservoir management
          capability, andimprove the management systems o f the Petrobangla Group; and

 GIDPDesign

 14.      The project didnot include any component, actions or loan conditionality to
 further theprivate sector development objective (para. 12(b) above), althoughthe Bank
 hadhad anongoing dialogwith GOB since the EnergySector Adjustment Credit (ESAC,
 1989-91) on the measuresto improve the enabling environment for private investmentin
 the gas sector. An accompanying PHRDTrust Fundpermitteda wide range o f gas sector
 analysis to be carried out and assistedwith GOB'Spromotionalactivities directed at
 internationaloil companies (IOCs). Advice from the Bank also contributedto the
publication inmid-1993 o f a new petroleumpolicy by GOB, with liberalizedcontractual
terms for production sharingcontracts (PSCs) with international oil companies. The latter
had already begunto invest inexploration before Board approval o f GIDP. It could
therefore be argued that the appraisal process for GIDP had already accomplished a
significant breakthrough inimproving the environment for PSD .Nevertheless, there
remained other sectoral issues which remained unaddressed, but again, these were being
tackled outside the framework o f GIDP.

 15.      For example, preparatory work for a suitable regulatory framework (Le., to divest
parto fthe GOB shareholdings inthe Petrobangla operating companies andthe
replacement o f civil servants on operating company Boards by directors from the private
sector) was expected to be undertakenas part o f an ADB project that was already being
implemented.These factors mayhelpto explainthe omissiono f any specific PSD
component from the design o f GIDP, but it was evidently inappropriate to include an
explicit PSD objectivewithout any accompanying project elements. Objective (b) on
further reforms andprivateparticipationshouldhavebeendropped at the time ofthemid-
term review, or alternatively, the project could have beenrestructured to explicitly
incorporate a component designedto further it, particularly as the actions expected under
the ADB project didnot materialize.

16.       Another significant omission from the GIDP conditionality was a dated timetable
for the transfer to GTCL o fhigh-pressure pipelines from the other operating companies.
This was a contentious issue which was a frequent irritant inthe Bank's relationship with
GOBPetrobangla throughout the 1990s, andwhich was a contributory factor inthe
decisionnot to extend the closing date o f GIDP (para. 57). The IDA-funded North-South
and Ashuganj-Bakhrabad pipelines could not be operated by GTCL inisolation from the
rest o f the high-pressuretransmission system, over which GTCL lacked control. In
addition, full operational responsibilityinthe hands o f GTCL was a sine qua lzon for the
SCADA component o f GIDP.Despite this, the project design didnot include the

                                               5


preparatory steps for pipelinetransfers such as asset valuation, and a study o fthe staffing
and remuneration implications for both the new company as well as the existing
operating companies, which were to `lose' part o f their facilities to GTCL.

 17.     More consultation and a broader debate on the issue o fpipeline transfers to GTCL
withthe staff andmanagement ofthe affected operating companies duringthe appraisal
process may have helpedto smooth the way for these to occur. At the very least, the
Bank would have gained a betterunderstanding o f the reasons for the resistance fi-om the
operating companies and more effort could have gone to finding a solution acceptable to
all parties.

 18.     Inlight ofthe abovepoints, this PPARshares the ICR's assessmentofthe
project's quality at entry as unsatisfactory.


Relevance of Objectives

SGDP

19.      IDA'Spolicy views inthemid-1980swere embedded inthe formulationofits
strategy for the oil and gas sector, which was described as follows inthe SAR for SGDP:

         (a)    to buildup the capability o f GOB inthe formulation o f adequatepolicies;
         (b)    to promote a more efficient operation o f the public sector enterprises inthe
                sector;
        (c)     to encourage the development o f the gas sector by introducingmodem
                technology and field management practices, through the acquisitiono f
                seismic data, appraisal drilling and reservoir studies;
        (d)     to maximize the absorptive capacity o f the economy for natural gas; and to
                support exploration promotion to the intemationaloil industry.

20.     This was a normal IBRD/IDA approach for a developing country's petroleum
sector inthe midto late 1980s, - seeking to enhance the quality and competence o f the
domestic institutions (government and state corporations), supporting key productive
investments by these entities, improvingpolicies (particularly pricing), and encouraging
foreign investment inthe risky exploration for new reserves, but not seeking fundamental
changes inthe industrial structure, organizational fi-amework and ownership o f the
hydrocarbons sector.

21.     Withinthis context, SGDP mainly addressedthe upstreamdevelopment o fthe gas
sector ((c) above) through specific highpriority investments and corporate strengthening
(through training andtechnical assistance). The EnergySector Adjustment Credit, which
was implementedduring 1987-90 (thus overlappingwith SGDP), sought the
strengthening o f the Petrobangla Group bymeans o f an institutionalreorganization, based
on studies carried out as part o f SGDP. Both o fthese lendingoperations had covenants
concerning gas prices. Gas pricing and sector finances are discussed inmore detail inthe
ReassessmentReport for ESAC, which was preparedconcurrently with this PPAR.

                                               6


 22.     The objectives of SGDP were highlyrelevant throughout the project's life and
beyond. They remain so today, twenty years after the project was appraised inmid-1984.
 Expansion o f gas supplies, appraisal o f existing Petrobangla gas fields and strengthening
 o f the Petrobangla Group o f companies are still highsectoral priorities.

 GIDP

23.      GIDP's roots go back to 1990, whenthe project was first identified. It retained its
 `1980s flavor' despitethe 5-year periodto Board approval in 1995. As such, it contained
 little inthe way o f sectoral transformation, such as divestitureo f assets, or private
 financing o f gas pipelines.The Bank team that took over responsibility for the energy
portfolio midway through implementation(in 1998) was uncomfortable with GIDP as
initially designed.

24.      The objectives o f GIDP as spelt out inthe S A R were highly relevant to the issues
inthe gas sector andremainso today. Reformsto improvethe environment for private
investment inthe sector and institutionalcapacity buildingwithin the Petrobangla Group
still deservepriority. However, GIDP should probably have had a stronger sector policy
and organizational reform focus right from the start. These lacunae became problematic
mid-way through implementation. Duringsupervision, the Bankteam attempted to tackle
bigsectoral policy issues without a suitable lendinginstrument or conditionalitywith
which to engage GOB.


Efficacy

SGDP

25.      Despitemajor delays due to the complex project design and repeated problems o f
procurement and contract management (para. 42), the project ultimately exceededits
objective o f increasing gas supply.The ICR states that at the end o f 1995, there were
eight operating wells producing at a rate o f 90 BCF o f natural gas and 0.4 millionbarrels
o f condensate per annum, and estimates at that time assumed a cumulative gas production
from the project through 2007/08 o f 1.8 TCF, double the estimate at appraisal, and also
an increase incondensateproduction. The North-South gas pipeline that was built under
SGDP i s an integral segment o fthe main GTCL high-pressuregas transmission system,
linkingthe Dhaka areato gas fields inthe north east.

26.      The reservoir engineeringstudy carried out under SGDP was extremely valuable
andledto the tripling ofthe estimate o fBangladesh's provengas reserves from 4 to
12TCF. Although ingreat needo fupdating, it remains the sole basis for Petrobangla's
analysis and planningo f field development programs.

27.      However, SGDP only had a minor impact on operational performance o f the
implementingagencies. Covenants to the Credit for SGDP obliged GOBto introduce gas
price increases in 1985 and 1986, with annual adjustments as necessary beginningin
1988. Partial compliance was achieved inFY88, FY89 and FY90, and the covenant was

                                                           7


 deemedcompliedwith inFY92, at which time natural gas prices for all consumer groups
hadbeenbrought up to or above the then estimates o f the economic cost o f gas supply.
 Thereafter GOB was increasinglyreluctant to take actionto maintain gas prices at least
 constant inrealterms andprice adjustments were infrequent and insufficient to
 compensate for inflation. Finances o f the Petrobangla Group sufferedas a result.

 28.      Since SGDP satisfactorily met two of the three statedproject objectives -
 increased gas supply and evaluation o f gas reserves, the efficacy o f the project i s
 evaluated as substantial.

GIDP

29.       The physical components o f GIDP were designedto increase gas supply. They
have partially succeededindoing so. The Ashuganj to Bakhrabad pipeline was
successfully completed at a cost considerably less than appraised. At the time the ICR
was written in2000, gas flows through the Ashuganj-Bakhrabad pipeline averaged under
 100MMCFD, much less than expected at appraisal, due to the unforeseen supply from
the Sangu offshore gas field to Chittagong. However, since then there has been a sharp
increase inthe utilizationo fthe pipelineto supplyDhaka as well as the large new
IndependentPower Producers (IPPs) at Haripur andMeghnaghat. Without this line,
Petrobangla would also be unable to meet the demand o fthe KAFCO fertilizer plant. The
current flow rate i s about 220 MMCFD, or about 50 percent o fthe installed capacity. The
commissioningo fthe Maulavi Bazar field and supply from an additional six wells being
drilledinexisting fields will leadto a further rise inthe flow rate o f about 75-100
MMCFD from 2005. Concerns about the oversizingo fthe pipelinetherefore seem to be
misplaced since such investments are necessarily `lumpy' andtherefore are underutilized
inthe initialyears ofoperation. OEDdoesnot concur withthe ICRratingthat the
outcome o f this Ahuganj-Bakhrabad pipelinecomponent i s unsatisfactory.

30.       Based on the geological and geophysical work undertaken by the reservoir study
bythe firm IKM', the three wells drilledinthe Rashidpur fieldwere expectedto produce
90 MMCFD of gas. The maximum combined flow rate from the wells duringtestingwas
71MMCFD. But once production started, flow rates fell sharply and today they produce
only about 30 MMCFD. Since only four wells hadbeen drilledinthe field prior to GIDP,
the field's geology was poorly understood. Hence, given the technicalknowledge
available at the time o f appraisal, it i s difficult to see how this outcome could have been
avoided. After completing these three wells, it was found that the geophysical/geological                           -
interpretations inthe IKMstudy regardingthe reservoir sands didnot matchthe actual
strata discovered by drilling. This i s unsurprising. Inreality, the three wells drilled under
GIDPwere more inthe nature o f field appraisal wells, rather thanpurelyfor production.
3-Dimensional seismic work to better understandthe geological structure has still to be
carried out on this field8.



7. Carriedout as part of SGDP.
8. The technicalunderstandingof the structure of all of PB's gas fields would be greatly enhancedby a 3-D seismic
program, which shouldbe undertakenbefore furtherdrilling is carried out.

                                                        8


31.       While the outcome is disappointing, it is part ofthe normalrisks inherent inthe
hydrocarbons business and the Petrobangla Group has had a low failure rate so far by
international standards. With hindsight,it appears that it would have beenbetter to award
the contracts for the surface processing facilities only after well performance hadbeen
verified. But giventhe delays to this component, the few instances ofpoor performing
producer wells inthe past and the pressingneed for gas, it i s easy to see why this was not
done. Inany event, the surface facilities can be relocated and usedelsewhere ifthese
wells are shut inand other producers developed instead

32.       The outcome o fthe surface facilities component i s only moderately satisfactory
because the reduced gas flow rates from the Rashidpur wells meanthat these facilities
can only make a modest contribution to the objective o f increasing gas supply in
Bangladesh. However, the ICRrating o funsatisfactory i s notjustified because 300 BCF
o f gas has beenproducedalready. Inaddition, the drilling investment also ledto the
discovery o fpreviously unknown gas sands, which have the potential to increase the
ultimately recoverable reserves from the Rashidpur field.

33.      At the time the ICRwas written, the Supervisory Control andDataAcquisition
(SCADA) component fundedby DflDwas unfinishedbecausethe contractor had gone
bankrupt inthe final stage o f implementationand alternative arrangements hadnot been
made. Hence the outcome o fthis component was assessed as unsatisfactory. Since then,
the physicalworks havebeencompleted, albeit with a 3+ year delay, andthe systemis
now beingtested andput into service. The SCADA systemprovides GTCL with a
powerful, modem, real-time monitoringandcontrol capability over the gas transmission
network. But an essential complement o f the SCADA system i s that GTCL should have
fulloperational authority over all the gas trunklines operating above 900 psi. Thishas
not yet occurred and the outcome o f this component cannot therefore be considered to be
fully satisfactory. At the time ofthe OEDmissionto Bangladesh, at least three such lines
remained with the operating companies and two others hadbeen transferred to GTCL on
paper only, with the latter requiredto pay the original owners to operate them on its
behalf.

34.      As regards GIDP's two `non-physical' objectives, theproject didnot succeedin
promotingreforms to encourageprivate investment ingas'. Progress inimproving the
operational and managerial performance o f the Petrobangla Group was limited(paras.
44-48). Since only one o f the project's three stated objectives - increasing gas supply -
was fully met, the overall efficacy o f GIDP i s rated as modest.




9. However, a PHRD Trust Fundassisted with two investment promotion roundtable conferences hostedby
Petrobangla in 1993 and 1997.They were highlysuccessful and gave a major impetus to the opening o f the
gas sector to foreign private capital for exploration activities. Four production sharing contracts were
signedin 1994-95 directly as a result o f these promotional efforts, two more followed in 1997 and four
PSCs were signed in2000-01.

 Efficiency

 SGDP

 35.       According to the ICR'O, the project has a high ex-post EIRR o f 82 percent, only
 slightly lower thanthe appraisal estimate. Although this review was unable to verify the
 underlying assumptions used inthe ICRto recalculate the ERR, SGDP's higheconomic
 returns appear credible, given the volume of high-value gas and condensate streams to be
 produced over the lifetime ofthe investments. Hence the project's efficiency is evaluated
 as high.

 GIDP

 36.      The ex-post EIRR o f 20 percent as presented inthe ICRvalues project benefits at
 prevailing tariffs" and is satisfactory. The estimate has been derived usingthe same
 'time-slice' methodology as inthe S A R and is only slightly lower thanat appraisal.
 Valuing benefits at international oil prices instead o f at GOB-administered gas prices
 would nearly double the EIRR. The project's efficiency i s assessed as substantial.


 Outcomes

 SGDP

37.       The project was unduly complex, performance was marred bynumerous delays
andcontractual disputes andthe project implementationunit (PIU) didnot work as
intended. Nevertheless, SGDP was successful incarrying out important investments in
field appraisal and development and intransmission pipeline construction that enabled
gas supply to be increased to the main users inthe Dhaka area. It was highlyrelevant to
sector needs, substantially met its objectives and was economically efficient inits use of
investment capital. The overall outcome of SGDP is therefore assessed to be satisfactory.

GIDP

38.       The outcome o f GIDP is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory, despite the high
relevance o f its objectives and its contribution to increasing gas supplies. These do not
outweigh the lack ofprogress inimproving sector policies and the disappointing results
inthe project's equally important objective o finstitutionalcapacity building.




10. Details of the calculations of the EIRRwere not provided inthe ICR, althoughthe SAR methodology appears to
have been followed.
11. The methodologyused inGIDP differsfrom that of SGDP. Inaddition, benefitsunderthe latter were valued at oil-
replacement,not at prevailing tariffs.

 Sustainability

 SGDP

 39.     Thephysicalcomponents dominated the project andare operating satisfactorily,
 over a decade after they went into service. There i s little risk that they will not continue to
be operated satisfactorily for the remainder o ftheir economic life. Project sustainability is
therefore assessed as highly likely.

 GIDP

40.      The physicalassets acquired bythe Petrobangla Group as part o fthe project are
operating satisfactorily. GTCL i s likely to ensure that the A-B pipelinewill beproperly
maintained. Satisfactory maintenance and training arrangements have beenmade for the
nearly-completed SCADA system. The sustainability o fthe project's net benefits i s
judgedto be likely, giventhe proventrack record ofthe PB Group under SGDP.
However, the financial and institutionalweakness o f Petrobangla i s a significant
downside risk to overall long-term sustainability o f the public sector gas industry.


InstitutionalDevelopment

SGDP

41.     At the time ofappraisal, IDAwas aware, as stated inthe SAR, (a) that the record
o fproject implementation inalmost all sectors inBangladeshhadbeen weak, and (b) that
the gas sector hadbeencharacterized by instability inmanagement. IDA - inconsultation
with the other donors supportingthis project - sought to isolate the project from such
difficulties through a "centralized project unit concept", which was intendedto provide
an effective coordination o f the various technical and financial contributions. The idea
was for implementation responsibilityto be entrusted byPetrobangla to an independent
(PIU) placedunder the authority o f a project director satisfactory to IDA. The PIUwas
supposedto have adequate financial and administrative authority, with the project
director reportingdirectly to the Chairmano f Petrobangla.

42.     Inpractice, this arrangement didnot work as intended.There were frequent
management turnovers inPetrobangla andwithin the PIU(four changes each duringthe
most active period- 1988-91). The PIUdidnot have the necessary autonomy to take
decisions, which were routinelypassed on to the highest levels o f Petrobangla and the
Government, often through the use o f committees. Decision-makingthus became
centralized, opaque and time-consuming. This particularly affected procurement
decisions, as witnessed by the habitualdelays, with many o f the about one hundred
supply, work and service contracts awarded beyondthe original bidvalidity period. IDA
was generally satisfied with the quality o fthe biddingdocuments, but problems
frequentlyoccurred inthe subsequentprocessing, andthere were also subsequent
complaints from contractors o f slow payments, as well as other disputes over contracts,
staffing andperformance. Especially inview o f the time that has since passed, it i s

                                                 11


 difficult to passjudgment on the specific individual problems or complaints, but the
 overall picture i s one o f significant and persistent contract management problems within
 Bangladesh (the Government and Petrobangla). These difficulties continuedto prevail
 duringthe implementationofthe subsequentIDA-fundedproject inthe sector.

 43.      The project's modest training efforts had little impact on the institutional
 development o f the Petrobangla Group, which could have greatly benefitedfrom a
 twinning type o f arrangement with amore mature oil and gas corporation from another
 country. There appears to have been a lack o freceptivityto technical assistance on the
 part o f Petrobangla at that time andthe proposal was dropped. The project does not
 appear to have helpedimprove Petrobangla's operational andmanagement capability,
 which was one o f its stated objectives. Hence, the IDimpact i s rated as negligible.

 GIDP

 44.      Theproject's IDimpact i s rated as modest. Significant improvements inGTCL
 (para. 49, and modest improvements inPetrobangla's ability to deal with environmental
 and safety matters as a result o f the project, are counterweighed bypoor IDresults in
other GIDP components. The benefits from the (DflD-funded) TA to improve MIS
 systems, accounting and financial management do not appear to havebeensustained.
Crucial trainingprograms were not implemented.

45.       The three-year twinning arrangement for GTCL with GASCOR (Australia) was
very successful andhelpedto develop the capabilities o fthis new entity, which at the
time o f Board approval o fthe project hadbarelybegunto function. Today, GTCL
transports over 5 B C M o f gas through its pipelines, i s strong inpipeline construction
management, can design transmission pipelinesandpreparebiddocuments without
extemal help. Itrequires further strengthening(such as inSCADA operations) and needs
to be able to improve the service conditions for its staff. Recent moves inthis direction
have beenlimitedto the top management only.

46.      The reservoir management study launched under the project hadthe potentialto
yieldvery significant technical, financial and institutionalbenefits to Petrobangla. The
decision to abandon it after the GIDP loan was not extended was damaging to the
development o fthe sector as a whole. Over three years have been unnecessarily lost since
then.Todaythe lack o fsuch a study is abottleneckto further drillinginPetrobangla's
own gas fields. The decliningproduction from the Bakhrabadfield alonejustifies a
specific study o fthis crucial reservoir. GOB andthe Petrobangla Group as awhole could
havejointly covered the cost from their own resources, given that only US$3million was
needed.

47.     Reorganizationof the gas sector along the lines first envisaged under SGDP and
then under the ESAC has never beenfully implemented. Local vested interests prevented
the merger o fthe two gas producingcompanies into one. Although GTCL was set up in
1993, it still does not own all the high-pressuregas pipelines inBangladesh, due to
resistance to the pipeline transfers from the staff o f the other operating companies.

                                                12


 48.     The long-standing problemofinsufficient operating company autonomy, the
 excessive GOB representation on operating company Boards, its control over
 procurement decisions, involvement inday to day operational matters (such as
 recruitment and the selection o f candidates for training) has not easedto any significant
 extent duringthe past decade. Unsurprisingly, neither Petrobangla nor GOB have been
 keen to reduce their tight control over these entities andpressure from donors inthis
 directionhasbeen to no avail. A Petrobangla-appointed local consultant i s expected to
 report imminently on the institutionalrelationships betweenthe operating companies,
 Petrobangla andMEMR.

 49.     GIDP envisaged amajor trainingprogram for the entire Petrobangla Group, but in
 the endnone ofit was implemented, dueto poor performancebythe consultants who
 designed the program, delays inapprovals by Petrobangla and GOB andthe Bank's
 decisionto close the Creditjust at the time whenthe training was about to begin.
 Fundamentally, this component lacked ownership on the part o fPetrobangla, which
 should have beenmore proactive inthe early years o f GIDP to ensure that the training
 component was carried out expeditiously. Better results might have beenachieved ifthe
 programhadbeen designedon operating company rather than Petrobangla Group lines.

 50.     There hasbeena loss o f skills from the Petrobangla Group duringthe past few
 years, inpart to the private sector for better remuneration, but also because o fthe neglect
ofin-house training, which has suffered due to insufficientprovision for it in
Petrobangla's annual operating budget. Dueto a slowdown inthe capital expenditure
program, mid-levelstaffhave had less exposure to newprojects than their predecessorsin
the 1980s, whenthe Petrobangla Group's operations were expanding more rapidly. No
staff exchanges with IOCs or state oil companies like ONGC or Petronas have taken
place. Petrobangla also faces a problem o f succession planning at the level o f its senior
management. Its PetroleumConcessions Department i s stretched to adequately carry out
its supervisory responsibilities for PSC operations. Inoverall terms, the Petrobangla
holding company seems to be a weaker entity thanbefore the project. Buildinga strong
Bangladeshi gas industry o f internationalstandard inthe coming years will require much
more effort to improve management, greatly increase training at all levels, offer better
remuneration and grant more autonomy to the operating companies.


Bank Performance

SGDP

51.     The over-complex project design and cofinancing arrangementswere principally
IDA'Sresponsibility and contributedto implementationdifficulties. An important
component that was not part o f the initial design, but was decided duringproject
implementation (a gas fractionation plant at Ashuganj) was inthe endnot carried out,
with grave consequences for the subsequent LPGtransport and distributionproject
(Credit 2263-BD). The poor coordination andlack o f realismwithin the Bank ledto the
premature approval o f this new LPGproject. Dueto the failure to construct the Ashuganj

                                                      13


 NGLfractionationplant, this project was ultimatelycanceledwithout beingimplemented
 -- an additionalreasonwhy this PPAR evaluatesBank performance as unsatisfactory.

 GIDP

 52.     The Bank's involvement inthe gas sector duringthe 1990swas extensive and
 varied, with different forms o f overlappinginterventions. Separating the impact o f one
 from another i s difficult and to some degree arbitrary.The assessment i s further
 complicated by the active participation inthe sector o f other donors such as ADB and
 DfLD,which were also pursuingsimilarobjectives. Hence eventhe assigningofcredit for
particular results to one donor or another i s subject to the same risks o f arbitrariness.

 TheBank WasNot SensitiveEnough to GOB'SConstraints on gas exports

 53.     The Bank-GOB dialog on the issue of large-scale gas exports to Indiawas
 difficult. The Bankwas insensitive innot understandingthe political constraints'' faced
byGOB, (regardless o fwhichparty was inpower) andthenwas unwillingto admit that
political factors could be such an obstacle to what the Banktook to be a very
 advantageous arrangement. Only recentlyhas the Bank recognized that such exports
would not yield massive revenues to GOB13.For several years, the Bankpersistedin
arguing that GOB should consider major gas exports, thereby created unnecessary
tensiodfiiction inthe relationship. This also distracted attention from other approaches to
sector development, such as a major pushto develop internal gas markets, particularly in
the West Zone, which was also poorly served with electricity. Bringinggas supplyto the
urban centers west o f the Jamuna River would have had significant economic benefits
and at the same time would have reduced resistance to gas exports. Once the gas
transmission network i s built to serve towns only a short distance from the Indianborder,
this may eventually leadto small-scale exports acrossthe border, ina low-key, non-
political setting.


Staff Turnover Undercut Bank Effectiveness

54.      Theproject sufferedfrom frequent changes inBank staff, most particularlyprior
to the start o f implementation. GIDP was prepared and appraisedby one task manager,
thenpost-appraisedbya secondTM, negotiatedandpresentedto the Boardbyathirdand
then immediatelyhanded over to a fourth TM. Duringthe sameperiod, there were also
three changes o f sector manager. Another change o f TM and Sector Manager took place
around the time o f the mid-termreview (MTR) and the TM changed again before final
closure.

55.      Inthe 2ndhalfo fthe 199Os, theBank's Bangladeshenergyteam at HQwas
predominantlynew. These staff hadno prior involvement inBangladesh, were intune


12. The only realistic market i s India, with which Bangladesh has a politically delicate and complex
relationship ofunequal neighbors with close but difficult ties.
13. The HCU/ECON Gas Utilisation Study (September 2002) estimated a netback value ofUS$l.SO-
2.1O/mmbtu for exports o f 250 MMCFD, yieldingtotal benefits with a NPV ofUS$400m over 20 years.

                                              14


 with the Bank's very pro-privatesector stance o fthat kpoque and were illat easewith
 GIDP, an `old-style' project dominated byhardware investmentsandimplemented
 entirelywithin the public sector. Thiswas a contributory factor inthe decline ofthe
 relationship between the Bank andPetrobangldGOB. Personalities on both sides also
 played a large part inunderminingthe trust and collaborative attitudes necessaryto
 overcome the difficulties inthe dialog arising from the factors mentioned above.

 56.     The quality ofproject supervision appears to have declined after the mid-term
 review (MTR). Despite the clear signs o f a lack o f GOBPetrobanglacommitment to
 meet the project restructuringconditions proposed at the MTR, andthe deteriorating
 sector finances in 1998-99, the supervision ratings inthe PSRs remained unchanged,
when declining performance should have beenflagged to signal that the project was at
risk. Closer involvement inproject supervision bythe fieldofficewould havebeen
beneficial at thisjuncture, but task management responsibility remained at HQuntilthe
very endo fthe project.


Soured Relationships and Differing PerspectivesPrematurely ClosedtheProject

 57.     Meanwhile, Bank-GOB relations inthe sector were souring, even though the
Bankkept open its offer to retroactivelyfinance the eligible costs ofthe W. Zone
interconnector for two years after the MTR.However, GOB was unable or unwillingto
take the necessary actions to unblock the IDA funding. This i s hardto explain. Mutual
antagonisms between Borrower and Bank staff were a contributory factor to the
stalemate.

58.      Six months before the closing date, IDA informed GOB that not only would
theUS$47 million o f cost savings be canceled, but that no extension would be granted
either, despite the recognized importance o f the training and reservoir management
components. GOB'Splea to the Bank to reconsider the matter (inthe interests o f carrying
out these components) shortly before the closing date were to no avail. This PPARwas
unable to find any documentary evidence inthe Bank's archives to show the extent and
type o f intemal debate on this matter andwhether the full implications of the decision to
refuse even a partial extension o f the Credit hadbeenassessedby the Bank.

59.      Inthe lightoftheproject's unsatisfactory quality at entry andthe pointsdiscussed
above, overall BankPerformance i s evaluated as highlyunsatisfactory.


Borrower Performance

SGDP

60.     The poor experience duringimplementation with procurement and contract
management, governmental interference, and lack o f commitment to training and
institutional development are the reasons for rating Borrower performance as
unsatisfactory.

                                             15


 GIDP

 Unsuccessful project restructuring to supply gas to WesternBangladesh

 61.     In1997-98, GOB was keento usethemajor savings underthe projectto construct
 a gas pipelineto the western part of Bangladesh, which was unservedby gas. The Jamuna
 bridgeproject was expected to cover the cost of layinga gas pipelineacross the bridge
 concurrentlywith its construction, but additionalresourceswere requiredto interconnect
 it with the existing transmission network and then extend it to consumers inthe west,
 such as a new IPP inBaghabari. A restructuringo f GIDP was proposed by the Bank at
the time o f the mid-term review inlate 1997, to take advantage o f the savings inthe
 construction o f the A-B pipeline.The proposalwas a rational scheme to expand the high-
pressure network, to serve priority consumers inthe power sector (that would otherwise
have to bumhigher-cost, importeddiesel) and had an attractive ERR. Bank concurrence
 for the reallocationo f GIDP funds dependedupon GOB taking action on transfer o f gas
pipelinesto GTCL and to raise gas prices that hadbeenfrozen for over three years,
thereby declining by 20 percent inreal terms. After a lengthyinterval, duringwhich GOB
took very little actionto meet IDA'Sconditions, it became clear that GOB was not
willing to take politicallyunpopular steps to raise gas prices or to confront the staffo fthe
other PB Group companies affected by pipeline transfers to GTCL. With hindsight, it
also appears that the funding was not crucial to GOB, since the interconnectionto the
West Zone went aheadwithout IDAresources.

Lack of Government commitment toproject goals

62.      GOB was unwillingto find a solutionto the transfer oftransmission pipelinesto
GTCL. It referred the matter to a committee rather thanseekingto break the logjamby
taking the leadto hammer out a solution. This illustrates the lack o f ownership o f the
objectives o f GIDP on the part o f GOB. GOB also didnot take actionto comply with
financial covenants and didnot take corrective action on gas prices, despite repeated
reminders from IDA as well as other lenders. GOB also refused to discuss amajor sector
review on gas that the Bank had undertaken in 1998, on the grounds that it hadnot been
consulted or involved inthe work. While the latter i s true, GOB'Sattitude meant that this
highquality analytical work was entirelywasted.

Petrobangla's shortcomings

63.     Eventhough some o fthe inordinatedelays inproject implementationwere due to
factors beyondPetrobangla's control, it i s apparent that Petrobangla did not act
expeditiously as regards the training program and reservoir management study.
Furthermore, Petrobangla subsequentlyfailed to make altemative arrangements to fund
the trainingprogram andthe reservoir management study duringthe three years since the
IDA Credit was canceled. Itwould appear that the top management o fPetrobangla either
was unconvincedo f the importance o f these activities or was not willing to arrange
altemative funds, either from internal or GOB sources to cover the shortfall.

64.     For these reasons, overall Borrower performance i s assessed as highly
unsatisfactory.

                                              16


 Conclusions

65.      Could the Bank's departure from the gas sector have beenavoided, or the damage
contained earlier? The situationinthe gas sector was not unique.Onthe Bank side, the
perceptionthat the gas sector was unresponsive to change and resistant to reformwas in
keepingwith amore general view heldby the Region's top management that Bangladesh
was a `poor performer'. Total IDA assistanceto the country had declined andthe CAS
 `low case' scenario was the basis for the lendingprogram. This merelyreinforced the
energy team's conviction that it hadto be "firm" insticking to its reform agenda, and that
GOB hadto demonstrate results before IDA funds could flow.

66.      The Bank management's decision not to extendthe closing date even once is
striking, but i s inkeepingwith this frame o fmind.It illustrates the extent to which
relations inthe sector between GOB andthe Bank had deteriorated. The Bank had clearly
lost all patience and one has to assumethat the decision not to extend the Credit was
clearly thought through and was intendedto send a strong signal to GOB o fthe Bank's
dissatisfaction and unwillingness to continue to assist a sector inwhich it hadbeen
present for over two decades. It thus seemedto signify an endto any Bank involvement
inthe sector for aprolongedperiod.Ifthepurpose ofthecancellation was to trigger a
response inthe form o f an internal GOBPetrobanglare-evaluationo f sector
management, it failed to leadto any noticeable alterations or improvements insector
performance.

67.     An alternative approach would have beentojust extendGIDP to cover the
training component andreservoir management studies, both o fwhich would have had a
verypositive institutional development impact. This hadbeenrecommendedbythe
supervision missionjust prior to the decision to maintainthe original closing date. With
hindsight,it mighthave beenpreferable to haveprovided a selective extensionto the
closing date, becausethat would also have kept open the door to a more active
involvement infuture, should circumstances change. Now that IDA i s keento increase
lendingfor infrastructure projects andis once again receptive to the ideaof financing
projects inthe gas sector, it has to recognize that an early re-engagement, inthe absence
o fprogress inpolicy matters since its pullout, would be seen as damaging to its
credibility and limit its effectiveness inseeking reforms.


Lessons

68.     Themainlessons that emerge from the assessment o fthese two projects are:

        Indesigninginstitutionaldevelopment components ofprojects, the incentives for
        those directly concerned byproposed changes should be well alignedwith the
       project objectives. Inparticular, the staffing andremunerationimplications o f
       major institutional reorganizations (such as the creationo f GTCL), needto be
       well understood and explicitly addressedifreorganizations are to be successfully
       implemented;

0 Buildinga strong gas industry ofintemational standardrequires amajor IDeffort:

0 Strong and continuing field office involvement insubstantive project work i s
  more effective than intermittent, long-distance involvement o f HQstaff.

0 Whenthe Bank finds it difficult to justify its support for aparticular sector due to

  Repeated sharp changes inthe Bank'sinvolvement could be damaging to its
  credibility and could constrain its ability to seek policy reforms.

       mid- 1980s, the gas industry in Bangladeshwas still at an early stage of   Agreed

       development. Six gas fields were inproduction,and ofthe country'stotal
       gas-in-place only a third was considered proven due to the modest
       amount ofdelineation drilling.
3.     By 1985, the development of the gas sector had led to rapid growth in Agreed
       commercial energy use and a progressive decline in the share of
       commercialenergy derived from (imported) liquidhydrocarbons.At that
       time, a main thrust ofthe energy policy was to reducethe dependenceon
       oil importsby acceleratingthe developmentof thedomesticgasresources
       Uor power and for fertilizer) and increasing the economy's absorptive
       capacity for gas.
4.     Subsequent developments have shown that the faith in the country's gas Demandof gas in
       prospects was justified. Gas production has increasedtenfold in the past Bangladeshwill continue
       20 years, doubling over the past decade. Almost halfof all gas produced at *e rate of
       in Bangladesh is consumed for power generation, which is now 2010.                        to

       overwhelmingly gas-based (almost 90 percent). The ftrtilizer sector
       consumes 9ver a fifth of gas production, while the remaining third is
       consumedby the industrialand residential users. The demand for gas to
       2010 is expectedto continue growing at 6 to 8 percent annually, driven
       by the robust growth in power demand and the low level of access to
       electricity inruralareas.
5.     Since 1994, growth in the Bangladesh gas sector has been helped by Pembangla                 is     a

    The Second Gas Development project and Gas Infrastructun
    Development project had several common objectives and are treated in
    this report as a series. The laterproject has been given greater emphasis
    thanthe first inthe analysisbecause the SGDP was completed over a
     decade ago and the evidentiarytrail on it has been somewhat ovexwritten
    by the outcomes of the GIDP. Furthermore, the legacy of actions taken
    by the Bank in the last year of the GIDP continues to be relevantfor any
    newWorld Bankassistanceinthe gas sector
8.  The objectives of the Second Gas Development project were to (a)
    increase gas supply to reduce shortages; (b) to evaluate the gas reserves Agreed

     to provide a basis for long- term gas field development; and (c) to
    strengthenthe operational and management capability of the Petrobangla
    Group companies.

10  The effort to expedite the development of gas resources in Bangfadesh     Agreed
     and to bring the gas to the market inthe shortest possible time, made
    project design unduly complex. It was complex and difficult to
    administer and vulnerable to cascadingdelays in implementation a risk
                                                                       -
    that was not fully appreciatedat the time of appraisal:
         First, the project was undertaken without firm knowledge of the
         potential of the relevant gas fields, information that would be
         provided by the appraisal wells, Given the evident potential of the
         Bangladeshigas fields, it was appropriate for the projectto incurthe
         riskthat this drilling inevitablyimplied,and the results were on the
         whole very positive.
     0   Second, major components of the project were dependent on a
         sequenceof events with the risk of cascading delays: (i)the drilling
         of the appraisal wells, to beundertakenunder a contract financed by
         CIDA (Canada); (ii) the evaluationof these results to determine gas
         reserves (iii)the design of the gas pipelinesandgas treatment plans;
         and (iv) the construction of these gas treatment and distribution
         facilities.
     0   Third, the resulting size of the project required substantial
         cofinancing.The totalprojectcost was estimatedat appraisalat $221
         million equivalent, ofwhichIDA was to contribute$110million and

          million. While the co financiers cooperated well throughout the
          period of the project, the numerous agreements that wcrc required
          between the individual c o h c i e r s and the Govcmment, and
          between the cofinanciers themselves, inevitably added to the
          complexityofthe project.
11.  Even in the absence of the procurement problems that dogged this           Agreed
     project, a simpler, multi-project structure would have preferable. The
     appraisal drilling, analysis of results and design of the subsequent
     investments could have comprised an initial operation, with a second, a
     follow-on project that could have supported the priority investments in
     field facilities, pipeline and gas fractionationbasedon l l l y preparedand
     mutually agreed investment plans. This would have permitted each
     project to be prepared in more fmal form prior to approval, and reduced
     the administrativeburdenon the projectentitiesinBangladesh.
12.  The objectives of the Gas InfrastructureDevelopmentprojectwere to          Agreed

14.
     The projectdid not include any component, actions or loanconditionality
     to firrther the private sector development objective (para 12 (b) above), Agreed
     althoughthe Bankhadhadanongoingdialogwith GOB since the Energy
     Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC, 1989-91) on the measures to improve
     the enabling environment for private investment in the gas sector. An
     accompanying PHRD Trust Fund permitted a wide range of gas sector
     analysis to be carried out and assistedwith GOB'Spromotionalactivities
     directedat internationaloil companies(1OCs). Advice fiom the Bankalso
     contributed to the publicationin mid 1993 of a new petroleumpolicy by
     GOB, with liberalized contractual tenns for production sharing contracts
     (PSCs) with internationaloil companies, The latter had already begun to
     invest in exploration before Board approval of GIDP. It could therefore
     argued that the appraisal process for GlDP had already accomplished a
     significant breakthrough in improving the environment for PSD.
     Nevertheless, there remained other sectoral issues which remained
     unaddressed, but again, these were being tackled outside the W e w o r k
     ofGIDP.
15.  For example, preparatorywork for a suitable reguIatoryh e w o r k (i.e.,
     to divest part of the GOB shareholdings in the Petrobangla Operating      Agreed

     companies and the replacement of civil servants on operating company
     Boards by directors from the private sector) was expected to be
     undertaken as part of an ADB project that was already being
     implemented. These factors may help to explain the omission of any
     specific PSD component fiom the design of GIDP, but it was evidently
     inappropriate to include an explicit PSD objective without any
     accompanying project elements. Objective (b) on fbrther reforms and
     privateparticipationshouldhavebeen dropped at the time of the mid-
     term review, or alternatively, the project could have been restructuredto
     explicitly incorporatea component designedto further it, particularlyas
     the actionsexpectedunder the ADB projectdid notmaterialize.

     to GTCL with the staff and management of the affected operating
     companies during the appraisal process may have helped to smooth the
     way for these to occur. At the very least, the

     Relevance of Objectives

19   IDA'Spolicy views in the mid-1980s were embedded in the formulation
      of its strategy for the oil and gas sector, which was described as follows
      inthe SARfor SGDP:
      (a) to build up the capability of GOB in the formulation of adequate
      policies;
      (b) to promote a more efficient operation of the public sector enterprises
      inthe sector;
      (c) to encourage the developmentofthe gas sectorby introducingmodem
      technology and field management practices, through the acquisition of
      seismic data, appraisal drilling andreservoirstudies;
      (d) to maximize the absorptive capacity of the economy for natural gas;
      andto support explorationpromotionto the intemationaloil industry.
20    This was a normal IBRD/IDA approach for a developing country's
      petroleumsector inthe midto late 1980s,     - seekingto                    Agreed
                                                             enhance the quality
      and competence of the domestic institutions (govcmment and state
      corporations), supportingkeyproductive
      investments by these entities, improving policies (particularly pricing),
      and encouraging foreign investment in the risky exploration for new
     reserves, but not seeking fundamental changes inthc industrialstructure,
      organizationalframeworkand ownershipof the hydrocarbonssector.
21.   Within this context, SGDP mainly addressed the upstreamdevelopment         Agreed
      ofthe gas sector ((c) above) through specific highpriority investments
      and corporate strengthening (through training and technical assistance).
     The Energy Sector Adjustment Credit, which was implementedduring
      1987-90 (thus overlappingwith SGDP), sought the strengthening of the
     PetrobanglaGroup by means of an institutionalreorganization, based on
      studies carriedout as part of SGDP. Both of these lendingoperationshad
     covenant concerning gas prices. Gas pricing and sector finances are
     discussedinmore detailinthe ReassessmentReport for ESAC, which
     was prepatedconcurrentlywiththis PPAR.
22.  The objectivesofSGDP were highlyrelevantthroughout the project's life       Agreed
     and beyond.They remain so today, twenty years after the project was
     appraised in mid-1984. Expansion of gas supplies, appraisal of existing
     Petrobangla gas fields anf strengthening of the Petrobangla Group of
     companies are still hi& sectoralpriorities.
     GIDP
23.  GIDP's roots go back to 1990, when the project was first identified. It
     retained its 1980s flavor' despite the 5-year period to Board approval in   Agreed
      1995. As such, it contained -,little in the way of sectoral transformation,
     such as divestitureofassets, or private
      financing of gas pipelines. The Bank team that took over responsibility
     for the energy portfolio midway through implementation(in 1998) was
     uncomfortablewithGIDP as initiallydesigned.

     the issues inthe gas sector i d remainso today. Reforms to improve the      Agreed

environmentfor privateinvestmentinthe sector and institutionalcapacity
building within the Petrobangla Group still deserve priority. However,
GIDP should probably have had a stronger sector policy and
organivltional reform focus right &om the start. These lacunae became
problematic mid-way through implementation. During supervision, the
BanKleam attempted to tackle big sectoral policy issues without a
suitablelendinginstrumentor conditionalitywithwhich to engageGOB.

SGDP.
Despite major delays due to the complex project design and repeated
problems ofprocurementand contract management (para 42), the project     Agreed

ultimatelyexceededitsobjective of increasinggas supply.The ICR states
that at the end of 1995, there were eight operating wells producing at a
rate of 90 BCF of ~ftrralgas and 0.4 million barrels of condensateper
annum, an estimates at that time assumed a cumulative gas production

appraisal, and also an increase h condensate production. The North-
from the project through 2007/08 of 1.8 TCF, double the estimate at

South gas pipeline that was built under SGDP is an integral segment of
the main GTCL high-pressure gas transmission system, linking the
Dhakaareato gas fields inthe northeast.
The reservoir engineering study carried out under SGDP was extremely
valuable and led to the tripling of the estimate of Bangladesh'sproven + Out come of the SGDP
probable gas reserves from 4 to 12 TCF. Although in great need of        hasincreasedthe gas

However, SGDP only had a minor impact on operational performance of
the implementing agencies. Covenants to the Creditfor SGDP obliged
GOBto introduce gas price increases in 1985 and-1986, with annual
adjustments as necessary beginning in1988. Partial compliance was
achieved in FY88, FY89 and F'Y90, and the covenant was deemed
compliedwith in FY92, at which time natural gas prices for all consumer
groups had been brought up to or above the then estimates of the
economic cost of gas supply. Thereafter GOB was increasinglyreluctant
to take action to maintain gas prices at least constant in real terms and
price adjustment were in frequent and insufficient to compensate for
inflation. Financesofthe Petrobangla Group suffered as aresult.
Since SGDP satisfactorilymet two of the thrce statedproject objectives  -
incnased gas supply and evaluation of gas reserves, the efficacy of the
projectis evaluatedas substantial
The physicalcomponentsof GIDPwere designedto increasegas supply.
They have partially succeeded in doing so. The Ashuganj to Bakhrabad     Agree

pipeline was successfully completed at a cost considerably less than
appraised. At the time the ICR was written in2000, gasflows throughthe
Ashuganj-Bakhrabad pipeline averagedunder 100 MMCFD, much1ess
than expected at appraisal,due to the unforeseen supply from the S a p
offshore gas field to Chittagong. However, since then there has been a
sharp increase inthe utilizationof the pipeline to supply Dhakaas we11as

     Meghnaghat.Without this line, Petrobanglawould alsobe unable to meet
     the demand ofthe KAFCO fertilizer plant.The current flow rate is about
     220 MMCFD, or about 50 percent of the installed capacity. The
     commissioningof the Maulavi Bamr field and supply from an additional
      six wells being drilled in existing fields will lead to a further rise in the
     flow rate of about 75-100 MMCFD from 2005. Concerns about the
     oversizing of the pipeline therefore seem to be misplaced since such
     investments are necessarily 'lumpy' and therefore are underutilizedin the
     initial years of operation. OED does not concur with the ICR rating that
     the outcome of this        Ahuganj-Bakhrabad pipeline component is
     Unsatisfactory.
30.  Based on the geological and geophysical work undertaken by the
     reservoir study by the fkm IKM,the three wells drilled in the Rashidpur       Agree

     field were expected to produce 90 MMCFD of gas. The maximum
     combined flow rate from the wells during testing was 71 MMCFD. But
     once productionstarted, flow rates fell sharply and today they produce
     only about 30 MMCFD. Since only four wells had been drilledinthe
     field prior to GIDP, the field's geology was poorly understood. Hence,
     given the technical knowledge available at the time of appraisal, it is
     difficult to see how this outcome could have been avoided. After
     completingthese three wells, it was found that the geophysicaVgeologica1
     interpretations in the IKM study regarding the reservoir sands did not
     match the actual strata discovered by drilling. This is unsurprising. In
     reality, the three wells drilledunder GIDP were more in thenature of
     field appraisal wells, rather than purely for production. 3-Dimensional
     seismic work to better understand the geological structure has still to be
     carriedout on this field.
31.  While the outcome is disappointing, it is part ofthe normalrisks inherent     Agreed
     in the hydrocarbonsbusiness and the Petrobangla Group has had a low
     failure rate so far by international standards. With hindsight, it appears
     that it would have been better to award the contracts for the surface
     processing facilities only after well performance had beemverified. But
     given the delays to this component, the few instances ofpoor performhg
     producer wells in the past and the pressingneed for gas, it is easy to see
     why this was not done. In any event, the surface facilities can be
     relocated and used elsewhere if these wells are shut in and other
     Droducers develobedinstead.
32.  l'he outcome of the surface facilities component is only moderately
     Satisfactorybecause the reducedgas flow rates from the Rashidpur wells
     mean that these facilities can only make a modest contribution to the
     sbjective of increasing gas supply in Bangladesh. However, the IC'
     2ting of unsatisfactory is notjustified because300 BCF of gas has been
     mduced already. In addition, the drilling investment also led to the
-    iiscoveryof previously unknown gas sands, which have the potential to
     ncreasethe ultimatelyrecoverablereservesfrom the Rashidpurfield.
13.  4t the time the ICR was written, the Supervisory Control and Data So far three trunk line
     4cquisition (SCADA) component funded by D b was unfinished transferred.
     xcause the contractor had gone bankrupt in the final stage of
     mplementationand alternative arrangements had not been made. Hence
     he outcome of this component was assessed as unsatisfactory. Since
     hen, the physical works have been completed, albeit with a 3+ year
-    ielay, and the system is now being tested and put into service. The
     SCADA system provides GTCL with a powerful, modem, real-time

monitoringand controlcapability over the gas transmissionnetwork. But
an essential complement of the SCADA system is that GTCL should
have full operational authority over all the gas tnmk lines operating
above 900 psi. This has not yet occurred and the outcome of this
component cannot therefore be considmd to be fully satisfactory. At the
time of the OED mission to Bangladesh, at least three such lines
remained with the operating companies and two others had been
transferred to GTCL onpaper only, with the 1attcr required to paythe
originalownersto operatethemon its behalf.
As regards GIDP's two 'non-physical' objectives, the project did not

EfBciency
SGDP
Accordingto the ICR, the projecthas a highex-post EIRR of 82 percent,      Agreed
only slightly lower than the appraisal estimate. Althoughthis review was
unable to verify the underlying assumptions used in the ICR to
recalculate the ERR, SGDP's high economic r e m s appear credible,
given the volume of high-value gas and condensate streams to be
produced over the lifetime of the investments. Hence the project's
efficiencyis evaluatedas high.
GDDP
The ex-post ERR of 20 percent as presented in the ICR values project
benefits at prevailing tariffs and is satisfactory. The estimate has been  Agreed
derived using the same 'time-slice' methodology as in the SAR and is
only slightly lower than at appraisal. Valuing benefitsat internationaloil

40.  The physical assets acquired by the Petrobangla Group as part of the
     project are operating satisfactorily. GTCL is likely to ensurethat the A-B
     pipeline will be properly maintained. Satisfactory maintenance and        Agreed

     training arrangements havebeen made for the ncarlycompleted SCADA
     system. The sustainability of the project's net benefits is judged to be
     likely, given the proven track record of the PB Group under SGDP.
     However, the financial and institutionalweakness of Petrobangla is a
     significant downside risk to overalllong-termsustainabilityof the public
     sector gas industry.
41.  At the time of appraisal, IDA was aware, as stated in the SAR, (a) that
     the record of project implementation in almost all sectors inBangladesh
     had been weak, and (b) that the gas sector had been characterized by
     instability in management. IDA in consultation with the other donors
     supporting this project    -       -
                                  sought to isolate the project from such
     difficulties through a "centralized project unit concept", which was
     intendedto provide an effective coordinationof the various technical and
     financialcontributions.The idea was for implementationresponsibilityto
     be entrusted by Petrobangla to an independent project implementation
     unit (Prv)placed under the authority of a project director satisfactory to
     IDA. The PIU was supposed to have adequate financial and
     administrative' authority, with the project director reporting directly to
     the ChairmanofPetrobangla.
42.  In practice, this arrangement did not work as intended. There were        Agreed
     frequent managementturnovers in Petrobangla and within the P N (four
     changes each during the most active period 71988-91). The PIU did not
     have the necessary autonomy to take decisions, which were routinely
     passed on to the highest levels of 41Petrobangla and the Government,
     often through the use of committees. Decision-making thus became
     centralized, opaque and time-consuming. This particularly affected
     procurementdecisions, as witnessedby the habitual delays, with manyof
     the about one hundred supply, work and service contracts awarded
     beyondthe original bid validity period. IDA was generallysatisfied with
     the quality ofthe biddingdocuments, but problems
     frequently occurred in the subsequent processing, and there were also
     subsequent complaints &om contractors of slow payments, as well as
     other disputes over contracts, staffing and pcrfonnancc. Especially m
     view of the time that has since passed, it is difficult to passjudgment on
     the specific individual problemsor complaints, but the overall picture is
     one of significantand persistentcontractmanagementproblemswithin
     Bangladesh (the Government and Petrobangla). These difficulties
-continued      to prevail during the implementationof the subsequent IDA-
     fundedproject inthe sector.

     past few years, in part to the private sector for better remuneration, but
     also becauseof the neglect of in-house training, which has suffered due
     to insufficient provision for it in Petrobangla's annual operating budget.
     Due to a slowdown in the capital expenditure program, midhlevel staff
     have had less exposure to new projects than their predecessors in the
     1980s, when the Petrobangla Group's operations were expanding more
     rapidly. No staff exchangeswith IOCs or state oil companies like ONGC
     or Petronas have taken place. Petrobangla also faces a problem of
     successionplanning at the level of its senior management. Its Petroleum
     Concessions Department is stretched to adequately carry out its
     supervisory responsibilities for PSC; operations.. In overall terms, the
     Petrobanglaholdingcompany seems to be a weaker entity thanbeforethe
     project. Building a strong Bangladeshi gas industry of international
     standard in the coming years will require much more effort to improve

     remunerationand grant more autonomyto the operatingcompanies.

51.  SGDP
     The overcomplex project design and cofinancing arrangements were
     principally IDA'S responsibility and contributed to implementation         Agreed
     difficulties. An important component that was not part of the initial
     design, but was decided during project implementation (a gas
     fractionationplantat Ashuganj) was inthe endnotcarriedout, with grave
     consequences for the subsequent LPGtransport and distribution projectI
     (Credit 2263-ED). Thepoor coordination and lack of realism within the
     Bank led to the premature approval of this new LPG project. Due to the
     failure to construct the Ashuganj NGL hctionation plant, this project
     was ultimately canceled without being implemented         --an additional
     reasonwhy this PPAR evaluatesBankperformanceas unsatisfactory.

     and varied, with different forms of overlappinginterventions. Separating   Agreed
     the impact of one fiom another is difficult .arid to some degree arbitrary.
     The assessment is further complicatedby the active participation in the
     sector of other donors such as ADB and DflD, which were also pursuing
     similar objectives. Hence even the assigning of credit for particular

     arbitrariness.
     The Bank Was Not Sensitive Enough to GOB'SConstraints on gas

St@ Turnover UndercutBankEflecdveness
The project suffered fiom fiequent changes in Bank staff, most
particularly prior to the start of implementation,GIDP was prepared and        Agreed
appraised by one task manager, then post-appraised by a second TM,
negotiated and presented to the Board by a third and then immediately
handed over to a fourth TM. During the same period, there were also
three changes of sector manager. Another change of TM and Sector
Manager took place around the time of the mid-term review (MTR) and

In the 2nd half of the 199Os, the Bank'sBangladeshenergy team at HQ           Agreed
was predominantly new. These staff had no prior involvement in
Bangladesh, were in tune with the Bank'svery pro-private sector stance
of that epoque and were ill at ease with GIDP, an 'old-style' project
dominatedby hardware investments and implementedentirely within the
public sector, This was a contributory factor in the decline of the
relationship between the Bank and PetrobangldGOB. Personalities on
both sides also played a large part in undermining the trust and
collaborativeattitudes necessaryto overcome the difficultiesinthe dialog
arising Eromthe factorsmentionedabove.
The qualityofprojectsupervisionappears to have declinedafter the mid-         Agreed

GOBRetrobangla commitment to meet the project nstructuring
conditions proposed at the MTR, and the deteriorating sector finances in
1998-99, the supervision ratings in the PSRs remainedunchanged, when

the Bank kept open its offer to rctroactivelyfinance the eligible costs of Agreed

Six months before the closing date, IDA informed GOB that not only         Agreed

     constructa gas pipeline to the western part of Bangladesh, which was
     unserved by gas. The Jamuna bridge project was expected to cover the
     cost of laying a gas pipeline across the bridge concmtly with its
     construction, but additional resources were required to interconnect it
     with the existingtransmissionnetworkand then extendit to consumersin
     the west, such as a new IPP in Baghabari. A restructuring of GIDP was
     proposedby the Bankat the time of the mid-term review inlate 1997, to
     take advantage ofthe savings inthe constructionofthe A-B pipeline.The
     proposalwas a rationalscheme to expandthe high- pressurenetwork, to
     serve priority consumersin the power sector (that would otherwise have
     to bum higher-cost, imported diesel) and had an attractive ERR. Bank
     concurrence for the reallocation of GIDP funds depended upon GOB
     taking action on transfer of gas  -pipelinesto    GTCL and to raise gas
     prices that hadbeen fiozen for over three years, thereby decliningby 20
     percent in real tenns. After a lengthy interval, during which GOB took
     very little actionto meet IDA'Sconditions, it became clear that GOB was

     This illustrates the Iack of ownership of the objectives of GIDP on the
     part of GOB. GOB also did not take action to comply with h c i a l
     covenants and did not take corrective action on gas prices, despite
     repeatedreminders from IDA as well as other lenders. GOB also refused
     to discuss a major sector review on gas that the Bankhad undertaken in

64.  For these reasons, overall Borrower performance is assessed as highly
     unsatisfactory.                                                            Agreed

     Conclusions
65.  Could the Bank'sdeparture from the gas sector havebeenavoided, or the
     damage contained eadier'?The situationinthe gas sector was not Unique.
     On the Bank side, the perception that the gas sector was unresponsive to   Agreed

     change and resistant to reform was inkeepingwith a more general view
     held by the Region's top management that Bangladesh was a 'poor
     performer'.Total IDA assistance to the country haddeclined andthe CAS
     low case' scenario was the basis for the lending program. This merely
     reinforcedthe energy team's convictionthat it hadto be "firm" insticking
     to its reform agenda, and that GOB had to demonstrate results before
     IDA funds couldflow.
66.  The Bank management's decision not to extend the closing date even
     once is striking, but is in keeping with this frame of mind. It illustratesAgreed
     the extent to which relations in the sector between GOB and the Bank
     had deteriorated. The Bank had clearly lost all patience and one has to
     assume that the decision not to extend the Credit was clearly thought
     through and was intendedto send a strong signal to GOB of the Bank's
     dissatisfaction and unwillingness to continue to assist a sector inwhich it
     hadbeenpresentfor over two decades. Itthus seemedto signifyan end to
     any Bankinvolvementinthe sector for a prolongedperiod. Ifthe purpose
     of the cancellationwas to trigger a response in the form of an intemal
     GOBRetrobangla reevaluation of sector management, it failed to leadto
     any noticeablealterationsor improvementsinsector performance.
67.  An altemative approachwould have been to just extend GIDP to cover
     the trainingcomponentand reservoir management studies, bothof which        Agreed

     would have had a very positive institutional development impact.This
     had been recommended by the supervision mission just prior to the
     decisionto maintainthe original closingdate. With hindsight, it might
     havebeenpreferableto haveprovided a selective extensionto the closing
     date, because that would also have kept open the door to a more active
     involvement in future, should circumstances change. Now that IDA is
     keen to increase lending for infrssmcture projects and is once again
     receptive to the idea of financing projects in the gas sector, it has to
     recognize that an early reengagement, in the absence of progress in
     policy matters since its pullout, would be seen as damaging to its
     credibility andlimit itseffectivenessinseekingreforms.
