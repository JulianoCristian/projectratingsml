Project\n            was reasonably successful in achieving its objectives.\n            However, the project was rated as a \"problem\n            project\" during May-November 1997. Major effort by\n            project management and Bank supervision teams since 1997 led\n            to the achievement of most project outputs. Based on the\n            review of the project implementation experience, lessons\n            learned are include: a) Readiness for implementation is\n            crucial to completion of the project on schedule and\n            achievement of its development objectives. b) Infrastructure\n            projects such as for the provision of drinking water to\n            families are ideal for encouraging responsibility for user\n            group operation and upkeep. c) Where projects leave choice\n            of individual items to be financed to be made during\n            implementation there needs to be a very careful system for\n            screening their sustainability and ranking them so that they\n            can be fully justified as priority needs. d) Close\n            involvement of beneficiaries form project design through\n            implementation is required for easy implementation and\n            improved sustainability. e) Close attention to development\n            of sound plans for operation and maintenance from\n            preparation onwards is necessary in order to have confidence\n            in subsequent project sustainability."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
