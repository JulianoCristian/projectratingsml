   24/7 Water Service to
   3 Cities in Karnataka                                                                    IBRD Results

 Synopsis

   Starting small, 3 cities in northern Karnataka demonstrated that a well-operated water supply company
   could deliver affordable, reliable service in an urban area. More than 175,000 individuals are benefit-
   ing from water supplied directly to their homes, even surprising skeptics with evidence that 20 percent
   less water is being used than before. What had been a burden to collect, primarily by the women in the
   household, was not a convenient commodity of life-sustaining importance.
