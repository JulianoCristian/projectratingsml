was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: continuous water supply (24X7) is achievable in\n            India. However, this requires strong commitment at both\n            local and state levels and should be accompanied by strong\n            pro-poor policies and reform measures. The project proved\n            that a 24X7 supply is achievable even at reduced rates of\n            supply. Introducing new water meter connections and\n            affordable volumetric tariffs that promote water\n            conservation proved essential for ensuring the\n            sustainability of the 24X7 supplies. The project also proved\n            that the poor are good customers and pay bills more promptly\n            than the higher income customers. In designing similar\n            projects, it would be helpful to carry out comprehensive\n            benefit monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2011-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
