assessment of outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, and institutional\n            development impacts substantial. Lessons reinforce\n            conclusions from Rural Poverty Alleviation projects in other\n            states, namely on the importance of achieving a\n            participatory approach among poor rural communities, who by\n            working through their Councils, demonstrated capabilities to\n            decide on their own priorities, i.e., prepare, execute,\n            operate, and maintain their investments. While this process\n            takes a long term to reach full benefits, its value lies in\n            attaining an integrated vision of local development, by\n            communities, who in turn value their local knowledge, and\n            sustain commitments to poverty alleviation over time, by\n            building credibility. Institutional ingredients for success\n            included the political, economic, and social contexts that\n            fostered the formation of local leadership resident in the\n            area, and the popular participation in local development.\n            Further lessons address the need for poverty targeting\n            mechanisms that promote transparency, and minimize political\n            interference in project resource allocation, supported by\n            quality supervision, to systematically monitor and evaluate\n            project implementation; for a diversified technical\n            assistance (TA) that maximizes impact and sustainability, as\n            shown by the collaboration of nongovernmental organizations,\n            rural labor unions, and other entities who assisted in\n            project preparation, and execution; and, the need for\n            rigorous selection in the preparation, TA and supervision of\n            productive subprojects."}, "docdt": "2003-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
