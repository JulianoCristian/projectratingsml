Specifically, the project\n            will: establish a project coordinating unit and a monitoring\n            and evaluation unit within the MOA. It will also strengthen\n            the research capacity at the Sapu Agricultural Station;\n            strengthen the existing Seed Multiplication Unit (SMU) and\n            establish a comprehensive national seed program; assist the\n            reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and strengthen\n            the country's cooperative structure. The project will\n            also support the Government's efforts to phase out\n            fertilizer subsidies by the end of FY88 by financing part of\n            the fertilizer imports. Two special accounts will also be\n            established under the project to expedite disbursement."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
