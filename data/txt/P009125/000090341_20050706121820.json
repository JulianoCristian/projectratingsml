Lessons learned: pilot projects are\n            necessary and useful to test new ways of doing business. In\n            the current government set-up, line ministries have a very\n            limited role in decision making. The Government re-directed\n            some of the savings from rationalization into emergency care\n            instead of using the opportunity to address the overcapacity\n            and duplication in the system of secondary and tertiary\n            care. Further improvements need to be made in coordinating\n            different government organizations involved in health care\n            and support service delivery. Lack of back of baseline data\n            at the beginning of the project impacted unfavorably on\n            monitoring capacities. More emphasis should also be given to\n            long-term sustainability of investments in project\n            management staff, and to integrating this staff as much as\n            possible and as soon as feasible into the ministries and/or\n            their regular, permanent implementation agencies. Computer\n            centers at the rayon level basically conduct census tasks\n            that would be better managed by the rayon administration in\n            line with general statistics and government information needs."}, "docdt": "2005-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
