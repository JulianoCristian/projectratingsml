We refer to the Loan Agreement (Health Project) dated November 16, 1998, between the

Department Chief, Department for External Economic Relations and Foreign Investments,

Karakalpakstan be added to the Participating Regions under the Project. 
 
We hereby confirm the Bank’s agreement to the amendment set forth below. 
 
1. 
Section 1.02(c) of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:  
 
“(c) 
“Participating Regions” means the Borrower’s regions of Syr Darya, Navoi, 
Ferghana, Khorezm and Karakalpakstan and such other regions as may be agreed upon between 
the Borrower and the Bank;”.

Paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 6 is revised to read as follows: 
 
“(c)  
the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to 
$200,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless 
the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equivalent to $100,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the 
Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered
