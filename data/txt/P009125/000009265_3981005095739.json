rural\n            areas; 2) develop a new cadre of medical personnel; and 3)\n            fully strengthen the management and financing of primary\n            health care services, in part through incentive\n            restructuring and decentralization in both financing and\n            providing health care. At the national level the project\n            builds the capacity of the health ministry to evaluate and\n            disseminate results of the pilot countrywide. There are four\n            components including project management. The other three\n            components 1) strengthen primary health care services by\n            providing basic diagnostic, therapeutic, and laboratory\n            equipment, furnishings, medical supplies and laboratory\n            reagents, vehicles, and a packet radio communication system\n            in selected locales, along with equipment, training, and\n            foreign and local technical assistance; 2) develop a faculty\n            department in a medical institute, and training programs for\n            trainers, practicing physicians, and nurses as well as\n            reform medical education while introducing a new\n            accreditation process for medical training institutions and\n            the certification and licensing of physicians; 3) strengthen\n            finance and management by system development and pilot\n            testing rationalization strategies, accompanied by a pilot\n            demonstration evaluation and roll-out. Civil works and the\n            provision of goods and services are also financed."}, "docdt": "1998-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
