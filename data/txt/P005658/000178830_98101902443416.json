services. It also intends to strengthen the capacity\n            of sector institutions to manage and plan urban transport\n            systems effectively; and support the development and\n            implementation of a comprehensive urban transport policy. It\n            consists of: primary road improvements in Greater Tunis;\n            provision of improved bus maintenance facilities, bus stops\n            and terminals in Sfax, as well as a management information\n            system for SORETRAS. Other project components include a\n            pilot national training program for sector personnel;\n            technical assistance; and studies. The project will improve\n            conditions for regional (non-central) travelers in and\n            around Greater Tunis and for SORETRAS' passengers."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
