Greater Tunis and Greater Sfax and increase\n            efficiency in supplying these services. It also intends to\n            strengthen the capacity of sector institutions to manage and\n            plan urban transport systems effectively; and support the\n            development and implementation of a comprehensive urban\n            transport policy. It consists of: primary road improvements\n            in Greater Tunis; provision of improved bus maintenance\n            facilities, bus stops and terminals in Sfax, as well as a\n            management information system for SORETRAS (Societe\n            Regionale de Transports de Sfax - Regional Transport Company\n            of Sfax). Other project components include a pilot national\n            training program for sector personnel; technical assistance;\n            and studies. The project will improve conditions for\n            regional (non-central) travelers in and around Greater Tunis\n            and for SORETRAS' passengers."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
