SECOND URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrover:                   Republic of Tunisia
Beneficiary;                Société Régionale de Transports de Sfax (SORETRAS)
Amorsnt:                    US$33.0 million equivalent, including a capitalized
front-end fee
Terms;Z                     17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate
Onlending;                  The Government would oulend US$6.1 million of the
Bank loan to SORETRAS on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan. The Government would
bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project                     The proposed project would improve the level of
Description;              urban transport services in Greater Tunis and
Greater Sfax and increase efficiency in supplying
these services; strengthen the capacity of sector
institutions to manage and plan urban transport
systems effectively; and support the development
and implementation cf a comprehensive urban
transport policy. It consists of: primary road
improveme.ats in Greater Tunis; provision of
improved bus maintenance facilities, bus stops and
terminals in Sfax, as well as a management
information system for SORETRAS; a pilot national
training program for sector personnel; technical
assistance; and studies. The project would improve
conditions for regional (non-central) travelers in
and around Greater Tunis and for SORETRAS'
passengers. The main project risk is that sector
policy measures may lag behind physical works.
This would be addressed through the technical
assistance and training components to strengthen
sector institutions, as vell as a strong Bank
supervision effort. Particular attention vill be
given to extension of the parking meter program and
realignment of parking charges in downtown Tunis to
restrain traffic and thus relieve congestion
dowatown.

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
SECOND URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     In 1981/82, the Bank carried out an urban transport review, marking
nearly a decade of involvement with urban development and transport in Tunisia
(paras. 2.13-2.17).  The review identified areas where physical investments
and policy actions were warranted to improve the efficiency and performance of
urban transport in major Tunisian cities.  It made a case for a continuing
Bank presence in this field based on;
(a)  the perception  that policy and  institutional weaknesses  were  the
primary obstacles to substantial improvements in the sector;
(b)  the Goverument's declared readiness to consider major changes in the
regulation of the sector (this requiring guidance to assure that
these changes lead to a coherent urban transport policy); and
(c)  the need to carefully select future urban transport investments in
view of limited Governmuent resources.
Accordingly, the proposed project follows an agreed strategy for Bank
assistance (para. 2.18), the overall objective of which is to effectively
build up institutions to manage and plan urban transport systems in Tunisia.
II. THE URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Sector Review l/
1. Background
2.01     By 1980, 55 percent of the Tunisian population of 6.4 million was
urbanized, up from 33 percent in 1956. Greater Tunis alone had 1.2 million
people, and was growing at 6.9 percent annually; second was Greater Sfax
(310,000 people). Urban growth problems include inadequate infrastructure and
services, unemployment and a housing shortage. Remedial Government programs
are aimed at improving conditions in large cities, and developing the
interior. Rural development programs, however, will lack short-term impact,
and city growth will continue adding pressure on urban facilities.
1/  For details,  see Tunisia Urban Transport Review  (Report No. 4225-TUN,
Green Cover; December 22, 1982) and Republic of Tunisia, Transport Sector
Kemorandum (Report No. 4895-TUN; January 12, 1983).



- 2 -
2.02     Urban public  transport, chiefly buses running on city streets, is
vital for the functioning of major Tunisian cities.  In the mid 1970s, when
the last surveys were undertaken, public transport carried about 70 percent of
daily non-walk journeys in Greater Tunis, and about 36 percent in Sfax where
city size, density and topography have favored the use of cycles.  At that
time, there vere about 54,000 passenger cars in the country; since then,
private car trips have grown due to a stagnation in the volume and quality of
public transport services, and a rise in living standards. Car registrations
have been increasing at about 7% per annum, despite stiff import duties and
fuel taxes (retail gasoline prices are almost double border prices (Annex 2,
para. 24)).
2. Issues
2.03     The four critical urban transport issues are: (a) Goveroment policy
for public transport companies; (b) role of the private sector; (c) strategy
for Greater Tunis; and (d) staff and organization of transport-related
institutions.
3. Government Policy for Public Transport Companies
2.04     Outside Greater Tunis, which is served by a combination of bus and
rail services, urban public transport services are supplied by regional
transport companies (SRTs). Problems affecting the SRTs (e.g., poor service
reliability, bus overcrowding and relatively high production costs) reflect:
lack of capital to upgrade fleets and maintenance facilities; low staff
productivity; and Government regulations that constrain staffing, financial
and operational management of the companies.  The key  factor is that the
Government sets overall fare levels and imposes discount fares for school
children, certain civil servants and others. In the past, fare increases vere
not regular and did not follow costs.  Likewise, compensation for revenue
losses due to discount fares was too low, unrelated to actual losses and
followed  a  fitful  schedule.   Operating  with  persistent  and  increasing
financial losses, the SRTs have relied on their freight operations to
subsidize  passenger transport.  However,  freigbt operations, also  heavily
regulated,  have  gradually  become  impoverished  and  their  service  bas
deteriorated.  The SRTs have had to cut capital expenditures for renewing
their obsolete fleets and maintenance facilities, and increasingly, to rely on
short-term Government advances and bank overdrafts to cover expenses.
2.05     In late 1983, addressing the acute financial crisis of the SRTs, the
Government wrote off their public debt as of end-1982, rescheduled their 1983
debt, approved a 16.5 percent fare increase, and injected some capital;
however, these helpful measures provided  only  temporary  relief.  What is
needed is (a) an adjustment to the capital and tariff structure of the SRTs,
to  achieve  and  maintain  longer  term  financial  viability;  and  (b)  the
development of an affordable social policy for public transport. The proposed
project vill therefore provide an action program for SORETRAS, the SRT serving
Sfax (acting as a model for other SRTs), designed to make its urban operations
financially viable, while upgrading its fleet and maintenance facilities; and
technical assistance to the Goverament to develop and implement sound
commercial practices in urban public transport.

4. Role of the Private Sector
2.06     The potential of private urban transport services in general, and
paratransit services in particular, is poorly tapped in Tunisia. The ability
of paratransit operations to adapt to a variety of origin-destination
patterns, volume fluctuations and passengers' ability to pay (while creating
gainful employment and requiring no public subsidy) has been demonstrated in
numerous countries, and could be an attractive complement to the services
available  in Tunisia.   Although  the  Governament  formally  opened  transport
operations to private suppliers in September 1983, past experience has shown
that this is not enough to stimulate entry  to the sector.   The proposed
project  will  address  the  practical  issues  of  increasing  private  sector
involvement,  througu  technical  assistance  to  define  and  implement  an
appropriate policy.
j. Strategy for Greater Tunis
2.07     In Greater Tunis,  radial  trips generated by  the city centre are
dominant, but substantial non-radial travel demand has been stimulated by
recent industrial and housing developments in the south and the emergence of
second-order centres in the north and northwest.  Urban highway and public
transport networks have yet to serve these new travel patterus, or to allow
regional (and inter-regional) traffic to bypass the congested dowatown.
2.08     For a decade, the Government's medium-term strategy for transport in
Greater  Tunis  has  been  to  upgrade   public   transport   services,   and
simultaneously, to use traffic management measures to maximize utility of the
street network and postpone road investments (para. 2.14). Thi' strategy has
been largely successful, and has made it possible for downtown traffic to keep
growing at about 10 percent per annum, with only modest capital expenditures.
For the longer term, the Goverrment chose to invest in a light-rail system
(Métro Léger de Tunis, MLT), designed to operate on a protected right-of-way
on city streets, with priority at intersections (details in Annex 2). A TD 82
million contract for a 30km network was signed in 1980; construction began in
1981. The original schedule called for completion in 1984, but it vill not be
met due to a Government decision in late 1982 to have the 0.75km dowatown link
go underground at an estimated additional cost of TD 26 million (in 1982
prices). A contract for this link has yet to be signed, and completion of the
system will be delayed by two to three years.
2.09     The dowutown street system has now reached capacity.  Traffic volumes
are nearly stable over the daytime period, and stand-stills are common. There
is little off-street parking, and the regulation of on-street parking is still
in infancy; hence, parking problems have reinforced traffic congestion.   In
addition to wasting time and fuel, and worsening air pollution, congestion is
also responsible for the gradual deterioration of the dovutown as a place to
live, work and shop.  Although the MLT will benefit public transport users, it
will affect other road users by closing a number of important streets and
reducing capacity at numerous intersections.



- 4 -
2.10     The Municipality of Tunis bas developed a two-pronged strategy of
(a) selected additions and improvements to arterial roacs (major works to be
carried out by the Ministry of Public Works), to remove regional traffic from
downtown streets and to improve the functioning of an inner ring road around
it; and (b) restraint on downcown-bound traffic through, inter alia, parking
charges.    The  proposed  project  would  support   this  strategy   through
improvements to the arterial network and technical assistance to implement
traffic and parking management plans.
6. Staff and Or&anization of Transport-Related Institutions
2.11     Although the need for a unified urban transport policy is recognized,
regulations and investments are piecemeal and ineffective.  This is due in
part to the lack of coordination among the institutions (national or local)
active in this field; mort importantly, these institutions are short of
trained, experienced staff.  The shortage of transport economists, planners
and financial analysts is particularly damaging; in the Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MOTC), it hinders the development of an effective policy
relating to SRTs and the assessment of the investment programs that they
submit for inclusion in Five-Year Development Plans. Similar problems affect
operational levels as well, notably, bus operations and maintenance, traffic
engineering and traffic law enforcement.
2.12     In response,  the Government  recently  created  an  Interministerial
Committee on Urban Transport, to initiate training programs for the sector,
develop  a  comprehensive  urban  transport  policy,  and  oversee  sectoral
development plans. Technical support to the Committee will be provided by an
Urban Transport Unit  (CTTU),  located in the MOTC.   Implementation of the
training program and the ongoing policy development process will be supported
by the proposed project.
B. Bank Involvement and Strategy in Urban Transport
2.13     The Bank bas been actively involved in both the urban and transport
sectors in Tunisia since the early 1970s.  In the urban sector, the Bank has
approved loans for three urban development, three sewerage and five water
supply projects.  In the transport sector, Bank assistance was provided under
five highway, one railways, and two port projects.
1. Urban Development Projects
2.14     The Bank's  first urban project in Tunisia was the Tunis District
Urban Planning and Public Transport Project ($18 million credit and loan of
August 7, 1973; PCR dated February 26, 1982, not elected for an OED review).
This project financed a major upgrading program for the National Transport
Company (SNT, which serves the capital region) and a substantial traffic
management program in downtown Tunis, and helped establish the Tunis District
(the planning authority for the capital region). The SNT program comprised
renewal and expansion of SNT's fleet and facilities, a financial restructuring
plan, and technical assistance to improve SNT's operations, maintenance and
management.   Although execution of the SNT project componeat vas completed



with a 3-year delay, due to problema in securing land from the Municipality of
Tunis for a bus depot, by the early 19709, SNT operations maintenance were
substantially improved. For the period covered by Bank-Government agreements,
the  SNT was  granted capital and  tariff increases  above  those originally
estimated; thereafter, the financial situation of the SNT began deteriorating
due to the failure of tariffs to keep up with costs, the Government's new
concern with the MLT, and the consequent uncertainty regarding the SNT's
future role. On the non-physical side, the SNT component did not reach its
objectives: schemes to formally relate the amount of financial support that
SNT would receive from the Government to the staff productivity of the company
were not implemented, largely due to weakness of the supervising ministry, the
MOTC.  The Tunis traffic management program was successfully implemented by
the Traffic Management Division especially created in the Municipality.  The
Tunis District had a slow start before it was able to have a significant
influence on the capital region's development, especially as regards housing
and land use; in the last few years, the District has lost a great deal of its
political support and authority.  Overall, the project did not significantly
contribute to the strengthening of technical and institutional capabilities in
the sector, mainly because it did not aim at formal training of local staff.
2.15     The Second Urban Development Project ($19 million loan of May 31,
1979) and the Third Urban Development Project ($25 million loan of January 11,
1983)  are  shelter  projects.   The  Second  Project  includes  upgrading  and
sites-and-services for low-income families in Tunis and Sfax; it also includes
a  small  traffic  management  component  in  Sfax,  technical  assistance  and
training. The project was implemented successfully in Sfax, but expropriation
problems and the poor implementation capability of the Tunis Municipality
resulted in delays in execution there.  The project is now expected to be
completed by 1985.  The Third Project continues the sites-and-services and
upgrading approach, extends it to cities of the interior (Le Kef, Jendouba),
and supports the restructuring of the sector institutional framework to permit
the "wholesaling" of projects.
2.16     In support of the proposed project, the Third Project provides funds
for: an adviser to the CTTU (para. 2.12); updating the Greater Tunis highway
master plan; studies to design interim improvement programs for the urban
operations of the Sfax and Sousse SLTs;  and four important policy-related
studies. These studies deal with productivity, fares and finances of SRTs;
involvement of private transport operators; parking management in central
Tunis;  and development of a pilot  training program for the sector.   The
recoomendations of these studies will be implemented through the technical
assistance and training component of the proposed project.
2. Highway Projects
2.17     Of the five highway projects in Tunisia, the First (1971, US$24.0
million; PPAR No. 2772, December 26, 1979) and the Second (1976, US$28.0
million) were for construction and improvement of about 500 km of primary and
secondary highways.  The Third (1978, US$32.0 million) and the Fifth (1982,
USS35.5 million) concentrate on rural roads and agricultural facilities.  The
Fourth (1980, US$36.5 million) provides for maintenance and rehabilitation of
the road network. These projects include studies and technical assistance for
policy development in the intercity transport sector, and for strengthening
inst,tutional capability of the Ministry of Public Works (HEQ).  The early
projects experienced long delays due to land expropriation problems, lack of



counterpart funds, incomplete project preparation and MEQ's inexperience.
Under subsequent projects, MEQ accumulated requisite engineering experience
and implementation ùas improved, although some delays in providing counterpart
funds are still experienced. Progress on the policy side has lagged; however,
a Transport Planning Unit bas now been established in MOTC, and work on
transport  coordination,  taxation  and  tariffs  (financed  under  the  Fourth
Project) vill be carried out in parallel with the initiatives regarding urban
transport to be financed under the proposed project.
3. Bank Strategy
2.18     The strategy for continuing Bank assistance in urban transport is
based on: (a) adopting a sectoral perspective (vith physical components in
several cities, and vorking with national institutions); (b) emphasizing
policy  and  institutional  development;  (c)  strengthening  linkages  with
non-urban transport projects; (d) blending expatriate cechnical assistance
with formal training of local staff; and (e) conceiving Bank assistance as a
stream of projects, providing the continuity necessary to assure that
policy-making becomes an effective, vell monitored process.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Main Features
3.01     The three overall objectives of the Bank's assistance in the urban
transport sector in Tunisia are: (a) to improve the level of urban transport
services offered to users, and increase efficiency in supplying these
services; (b) to strengthen the capacity of sectoral institutions to manage
and plan urban transport systems; and (c) to develop and implement a
comprehensive urban transport policy. These objectives are being addressed
simultaneously under Bank financed urban and highway projects as shown in
Annex 1.
3.02     Under the proposed project, the first objective vill be addressed
through:   (a)  selected  investments  in  primary  roads  in  Greater  Tunis,
complemented by traffic restraint through parking charges; and (b) an
improvement program for the urban division of SORETRAS in Sfax.
3.03     The institution-building objective will be addressed through a pilot
training program for technical, professional and managerial staff in the
sector, and through technical assistance to help manage this program.
3.04     The policy objective vill be addressed via technical assistance to
the NOTC to implement policies developed under the Third Urban Project.
B. Pro ject Description
3.05     Tthe project has three components: (i) primary road improvements in
Greater   Tunis,   (ii)   public   transport   improvements   in   Sfax,   and
(iii) institution building.



1. Primary Road Improvements in Greater Tunis
3.06     The transport planning concept developed for central Tunis calls for
an integrated package of road improvements and traffic management measures, to
be implemented in conjunction with the start-up of the MLT in the second half
of the 1980s. The road improvement part of the package would (i) establish a
bypass to the downtown area for through-traffic (thus relieving its streets
from all non center-bound 'traffic); and (ii) achieve a more adequate
distribution of downtown-generated traffic over entry/exit points, the
capacity of which on several major links vill be severely limited by the MLT.
Traffic management measures (notably, parking charges) will improve access to,
and use of the downtown area by car; decrease traffic congestion; and restore
a better fit between land uses and transport modes.
3.07     The Tunis component of the project (detailed in Annex 2) would
include:
(a)  Primary  Road  Improvements:  grade  separation  of  intersections,
widening and/or realignment of major road links located in a corridor
east of the downtown area (Nap IBRD 18020R), hereafter called the
eastern bypass, each element of which was part of the Greater Tunis
Highway  Master  Plan' produced  in  1976 and updated  in 1983  (for
complementary traffic management measures, see paras. 3.10(c) and
4.10); and
(b)  Professional   Engineering   Services:   about   225   man-months   to
(j) prepare detailed engineering for road links to be executed in the
second  and   subsequent  years   of  project  implementation;  and
(ii) supervise construction for all the road improvements.
2.  Public Transport Improvements in Sfax
3.08     In addition to measures designed to make SORETRAS Urban Division
financially viable (para. 5.14), an improvement program will also be
financed.   Its objectives are to decrease operating costs and improve the
coverage, frequency, reliability and comfort of public transport services in
Sfax, thus shoring up its competitive position vis-à-vis the private car.
3.09     The Sfax project component (detailed in Annex 3) would include the
following five elements:
(a)  Bus Maintenance: construction and equipment of a 250-bus maintenance
facility in the industrial district being developed near the new
fishing port;
(b)  Improvement of Bus Stops and Terminals: (i) erection of about 100 bus
shelters:   (ii)   peving   of   Yaiti,  areas   at   'us   Scops;
(iii) improvement to the bus depot at Zeghm; and (iv) reorganization
and paving at Bab Jebli, Enfants de Bourguiba, and Dalkar bus
terminals;
(c)  Professional Engineering Services: about 30 man-months to complete
detailed preparation of the bus maintenance facility (see (a) above),
and to supervise its construction;



- 8 -
(d)  Management Information System:  purchase of computing hardware  and
software, initially for (i) management of schedule and duty rosters,
(ii)   spare   parts   management,   (iii)   cost   accounting,   and
(iv) integration of cost and financial accounts; and
(e)  Technical Assistance; to SORETRAS  (3 experts  for about 1.5 years
each), to introduce new work practices in operations, maintenance and
administration, and subsequently provide intermittent follow-up.
3. Institution Building
3.10     This component (detailed in Annex 4) would include:
(a)  Training Program; implementation of a pilot national training program
(the design of which is financed under the Third Urban Project)
including; (i) two-year university-level training in transport
engineering and economics for four persons, (ii) workshops/seminars
for about 30 professionals (some of these workshops addressing
specifically the issues of traffic enforcement and related police
training, (iii) training for three trainers in bus maintenance, (iv)
short traineeships for about 36 people, and (v) public information
campaigas.
(b) Technical assistance to the MOTC: (i) 30 man-montbs for coordinating
and evaluating the training program; and (ii) up to about 52
man-months of technical assistance for future project preparation and
for the follow-up of policy studies related to productivity, fares
and finances of SRTs and involvement of private transport operators
(para. 2.14).
(c)  Technical  Assistance  for  Traffic  Management;  33  man-months  of
technical assistance to the Municipality of Tunis for implementing
gradually, as construction of the MLT permits, (i) a traffic
engineering  plan,  including  one-way  street  system,  signs  and
markings, channelization of intersections, and signals (the detailed
design of which, coammissioned by the Municipality, is underway and
expected to be completed in late 1984); and (ii) a parking management
plan (the design of which is financed under the Third Urban Project).
(d)  Transport Planning Study for Greater Tunis:  this study  (about 14
man-months) would assess urban development, transport demand and
related  investments  to the year 2000.   It vill  include  (i)  the
collection  of  up-to-date  demographic,   economic  and   transport
demand/supply   information,    (ii) consideration   of   multi-modal
investment alternatives and related policies, and (iii) development
of transport/land use modelling capability in the Tunis District. In
connection with points (i) and (ii) above, computer hardware and
software would be provided separately to the District, witn about 5
man-months of technical assistance; and
(e)  Transport Planning Study for Greater  Sfax:  the objective of this
study would be the integration of public transport, highway and
traffic management plans with the Greater Sfax urban development plan
for the 1990-2000 period; the study would involve about Il man-months.

4.02     Basis for Cost Estimates.   Baseline costs  are  in  December  1983
prices. Cost estimates are based either on preliminary engineering or sketch
designs for civil works, and functional specifications for equipment. All
these estimates were checked against contracts recently awarded or older
contracts awarded for similar purposes. Costs for road improvements in Tunis
include land acquisition.
4.03     About 280 and 175 man-months of professional and teclinical assistance
services respectively (training program excluded) would be provided under the
project (detail in Annex 6).
4.04     Continîency  Allowances.   Physical  contingencies  represent  17.8
percent of total baseline costs, with averages of about 20 percent for civil
vorks and 15 percent for equipment, respectively.   Price contingencies on
local and foreign currency cost cowponents have been estimated in accordance
with Bank forecasts of local and international inflation: i.e., 9.0 percent
and 7.5 percent respectively, in 1984; 8 percent and 7 percent in 1985; and 8
percent and 6 percent thereafter. Estimates of price contingencies (over an
implementation  period  consistent  with  the  regional  average  disbursement
profile for the highway sector) come to about 39 percent of baseline cost plus
physical contingencies; more precisely, nearly 42 percent as regards the local
cost component and nearly 36 percent as regards the foreegn one.  Total
contingencies amount to about 64 percent of baseline costs.  Further details
are in Annex 6.
B.  Financing
4.05     A Bank loan of US$33.0 million (Table 4.2) would finance the foreign
exchange cost component of (i) civil works and equipment, (ii) studies and
professional services, and (iii) part of the training and technical assistance
services (about 24 percent of its total cost, or 32 percent of its foreign
cost), and (iv) the front-end fee.  In the aggregate,  the Bank loan would
approximately cover 90 percent of total foreign exchange cost, or 40 percent
of  total  project  cost.   The  Government  of  Tunisia  and  SORETRAS  would
contribute TD 31.3 million (US$45.4 million, or 55 percent of total project
cost) to cover nearly 99 percent of local currency costs. The contribution of
the Government (essentially through the MEQ budget) is within the envelope
estabished in the Sixth Development Plan; the ability of SORETRAS to make the
necessary contribution will be ensured by the financial action plan to be
implemented under the project (para. 5.14). Cofinancing, in an aggregate
amount of about US$ 4.1 million (or about 5 percent of total cost), would be
provided by bilateral and other multilateral sources for training and
technical assistance (para. 4.07, and Annex 4, Table 4), covering nearly 58
percent of the cost of this component (against 18 percent by the Government,
and 24 percent by the Bank).

4.06     Financing Arrangements.  The loan would be made to the Government at
the standard variable  interest rate with a repayment period  of  17 years
including four years of grace. Of the proceeds, $0.08 million would repay the
front-end fee, $6.1 million (see Annex 6) vould be on-lent by the Goverument
to SORETRAS, and $26.8 million would be channelled by means of budgetary
allocations.  Bank financing for SORETRAS would be passed on as a subsidiary
loan at terms and conditions similar to those assumed by  the Goverument
itself; ratification of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
SORETRAS vould be a condition of effectiveness.  The foreign exchange risk
would be absorbed by the Government.
4.07     At the time of appraisal,  the Government confirmed its deaire to
obtain financing for training and technical assistance outside the Bank loan.
Preliiminary contacts vere made locally with a number of bilateral and
multilateral  sources,  which  confirmed  that  prospects  vere  favorable.
Assurances  vere  obtained  at  negotiations  that,  in  vie«  of  the  crucial
importance of the training and technical assistance component for the
improvement of sectoral management, the Goverument, by Marcb 31, 1985 at the
latest, will have finalized arrangements with such sources, and if this cannot
De done, will have secured some alternative financing (out of its own
resources, if necessary).
C. Execution and Maintenance
1. Execution Arrangements
4.08     DGPC will be responsible, through. its Tunis regional office, for the
execution of the Greater Tunis primary road component; SORETRAS vill be
responsible for executing its improvement program; and implementation of the
institutional   component   (which  MOTC   will   coordinate)   will   be   the
responsibility of MOTC, the Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax, and the Tunis
District (Annex 5).



- 12 -
4.09     Of the agencies assuming major responsibility for execution of the
project, the DGPC Tunis office and SORETRAS are staffed adequately; moreover,
DGPC has substantial experience, and SORETRAS has demonstrated its high level
of motivation and its capability to mobilize its staff. The Directorate for
Ground Transport in the MOTC is less well staffed, organized and experienced
(paras. 5.05-5.07), and provision has been made under the proposed project for
it to receive substantial technical assistance to help implement the national
training program (through which skills of the MOTC staff itself will be
upgraded) and the sector policy. Further details are in Annex 4.
4.10     The  parking  study  financed  under  the  Third  Urban  Project  and
commissioned by the Tunis District, will develop a parking management plan for
downtown Tunis (within Anneau des Boulevards) to complement primary road
improvements (the eastern bypass) to be done under this project.  The plan
will comprise:
(a)   a location plan for parking of different types and durations;
(b)   a five-year implementation schedule for the above plan;
(c)   a  schedule  to  raise  parking  charges  to  a  level  where  private
investors will find it profitable to supply off-street parking; and
(d)   arrangements for the administration and enforcement of the parking
plan.
Once the plan is developed, its implementation will be the responsibility of
the Tunis Municipality, namely its Technical Services Department (while the
decision-making power lies with the city council). Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that the Goverrnment will cause the Municipality to prepare and
present to it and the Bank for approval, by May 1, 1985, a draft of the
parking management plan, including measures concerning extension of the
parking meter program in downtown Tunis and the realignment of parking meter
rates, and implement the agreed upon parking management plan in accordance
with a timetable satisfactory to the Bank.
4.11     The maintenance cost of the new road links established in the Greater
Tunis area is within the budgetary and technical capacity of the DGPC Tunis
regionai office.  These links constitute a relatively small increase of the
network already maintained by the regional office, which has recently
increased  its  maintenance  capacity.   As  regards  the  future  SORETRAS
maintenance facility, the financial measures to be taken to put SORETRAS
gradually back onto a sound financial footing (para. 5.14) and provision of
technical assistance will ensure that maintenance is effectively as well as
efficiently carried out.
2. Status of Project Preparation
4.12     Because Viaduc de la République (a sub-component of the primary road
works in Tunis) should be of a very substantial cost and because previous cost
estimates were uncertain due to difficult soil conditions, completion of
preliminary engineering documents for the Viaduc vas required and obtained
before negotiations. Preparation of detailed engineering and bidding



- 13 -
documents for the road works in Tunis for the first year of project
implementation (Pénétrante Sud sub-component) and completion of preliminary
engineering for all other sub-components have also been done.
4.13     To avoid future delays in the execution of the SORETRAS component,
official transfer of land to SORETRAS for construction of its maintenance
facility, and awarding a civil works contract to complete land reclamation and
preparation at the site of the above facility, vere required and obtained
before negotiations.
3. Implementation and Disbursement Schedules
4.14     The implementation schedules for physical comporents (Annex 5) vere
discussed  and  agreed  with  the   two  responsible   executing  agencies;
implementation of the entire project is expected to last about 5.5 years. The
schedule for the Tunis primary roads component (77 percent of base cost of the
project) is shorter than either the regional average diabursement period for
highway projects (7 years), or the average disbursement period for all Bank
projects in Tunisia (9 years).  No disbursement profiles exist for similar
Urban Transport projects in EMENA. Since historically disbursement profiles
have  been  longer  than  initial  engineering  estimates  (due  often  to
administrative delays and unforeseeable technical problems), a seven-year
disbursement period vas adopted for the proposed project (Table 4.3).

and the amounts expected to be disbursed for various categories are shown in
Table 4.4 (detail in Annex 6). The loan closing date would be June 30, 1992.

D. Procurement
4.16     Civil works for roads in Greater Tunis (estimated total base cost of
TD 22 million, or US$32 million; see Table 4.1) will be carried out as for
other  Bank-financed  highway  projects,  by  unit  price  contracts  after
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Both Tunisian and foreign contractors are expected to bid for the works;
contractors  will be  prequalified.   Works will be grouped  in  lots  of an
estimated cost of at least TD 0.5 million (US$0.7 million). Contractors vill
be  allowed  to bid  for one  or more  lots  in  combination.   Contracts  for
constructing the SORETRAS maintenance facilities and improving bus stops and
terminais in Sfax (estimated base cost of TD 2.9 million or $4.1 million),
vill also be procured througb ICB, and after prequalification for the
maintenance facilities. The Bank will review bidding documents for all vorks
of $1 million and above.
4.17     Bank-financed equipment for SORETRAS maintenance facility (base cost
of US$1.2 million) will also be procured through ICB in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Bids will be invited against minimum specifications, and judged
on the basis of cost, delivery time and quality of after-sales service. Local
suppliers wiii take advantage of the couventiona'i  5 perceut preference margin
or exemption of actual custom duties, whichever is less. All bid documents
vill be reviewed by the Bank prior to award.  Because of the modest cost
involved, other equipment (the management information system for SORETRAS
(US$0.2 million) and the urban information system for the Tunis District



- 15 -
(US$0.1 million)) will be procured througb contracte awarded after obtaining
at least three quotations from suppliera and taking into account the
availability in the country of spare parts and maintenance services.
4.18     Bank  financed  technical assistance will be  provided  by qualified
consulting firms or individual consultants as appropriate, appointed on the
basis of terms of reference and conditions acceptable to the Bank and in
accordance with the Bank guidelines for the LIe of consultants. Otherwise,
the services vill be financed by bilateral or ocher multilateral sources, vith
consultants qualifications and experience and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank.
E. Accounts and Audit
4.19     For  the purpose  of  Bank-financed  Itighway  projects,  the  internal
accounting system in MEQ -- the same as  in all other ministries -- vas
reviewed and found adequate as regards certificates of accuracy as well as
completion  and  control  of  project-related  financial  transactions.   The
proposed project presents no special feature that would require that either
MEQ or MOTC adopt special procedures. As under previous projects, independent
auditing will be done by the Contrôle Général des Finances, whose status is
acceptable to the Bank.
4.20     Being a  public  enterprise  run  as  a  commercial  entity,  SORETRAS
maintains commercial accounts.   Because of SORETRAS'  statute and financial
accounting  procedures,  its  accounts  are  best  audited  by  independent,
commercial auditors.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, for the
duration of the project, SORETRAS will present to the Bank every year,
separate operating accounts for their freight and passenger services, vith its
passenger accounts further subdivided into urban and intercity components.
4.21     Government regulations  require that SORETRAS'  accounts be audited
every three years; the most recent audit, for 1981, vas presented to the Bank
and found satisfactory.  Agreement was reached during negotiations that audits
for 1982 and 1983 would be prepared and presented to the Bank by September 30
and December 31, 1984, respectively.  For both SORETRAS and the Government
(DGPC,  MOTC,  and  the  Municipalities  of  Tunis  and  Sfax,  and  the  Tunis
District), assurances were obtained at negotiations that, staring with 1984
accounts, financial statements will be presented vithin six months, and
audited statements within nine months, after the end of each fiscal year. In
the case of government agencies, separate accounts will be maintained to
record project expenditures, the main items of these accounts corresponding to
the loan categories.
F. Progress Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.22     Progress o£ project execution will be communicated to the Bank by
means of progress reports submitted at regular intervals, the first one by
April 30, 1985, and subsequent ones every four months. Assurances to this
effect vere obtained at negotiations. Of particular importance vill be the
monitoring of the effects of (i) opening the eastern bypass, on traffic
volumes entering/exiting the center of Greater Tunis; (ii) introducing new
parking regulations and charges; and (iii) the SORETRAS improvement program.



- 16 -
Policy-related studies financed under the Third Urban project, will be sent to
the Bank for review as they are completed. The Government will also prepare a
project completion report vithin six months of the loan closing date.
4.23     A set of indicators for monitoring the physical progress of project
implementation and for evaluating performance (inter alia for SORETRAS) is
provided in Annex 7. Assurances were obtainel at negotiations that SORETRAS
will report on those indicators by April 30 of each year, and take remedial
action as necessary to meet the targets.
G. Supervision Requirements
4.24     While  few  problems  are  expected  in  the  execution  of  physical
components of the project, much greater attention will need to be paid to the
preparation and implementation of policy measures, whether of significance for
a particular area (e.g. Greater Tunis) or a portion of the whole sector (e.g.
the urban public transport subsector, as in the SORETRAS/Sfax test case). It
was estimated that the Bank should make a commitment to the folloving minimum
supervision effort: 15 man-weeks in FY85; 12 man-weeks in FY86; 12 man-weeks
in FY87; and 8 man-weeks per year thereafter.
V. IMPLEMENTATION AGENCIES
A. Ministry of Public Works (Ministère de l'Equipement)
5.01     The NEQ is responsible  inter alia for planning,  constructing and
maintaining the national highway network, including links that pass through
urban areas; it is also responsible for developing and enforcing highway and
traffic engineering design standards.
5.02     Its Highway Department (Direction Générale des Ponts et Chaussées,
DGPC) has had substantial experience in highway construction (including 5
Bank-financed projects since 1969), varying from major new roads to feeder
roads, as well as in road rehabilitation and maintenance. It has about 35,000
employees, of which more than 50 engineers and about 360 technicians. It has
6 headquarters divisions (see organization in Chart 1), as well as an active
network of regional offices whose main duty is to execute routine road
maintenance. The Studies Division of DGPC is capable of handling planning,
design and bidding for small projects. Local consultants, or joint ventures
of local and foreign firms, are used to prepare and supervise medium-size and
large projects.
5.03     While DGPC is relatively well staffed with highway engineers, it is
quite short of transport economists, and has no traffic engineers. DGPC has
shown some interest in urban transport (e.g., by financing transport studies
for Sfax and Sousse), but has no capability for urban transport planning and
mauagement, nor for supervision of consultants in this area.



- 17 -
5.04     Studies f inanced under  the Four.h Highway  Project have  laid  the
foundation for the development of DGPC in policy and planning; the project
also includes technical assistance to help DGPC and the MOTC develop a unified
sectoral policy for intercity transport (particularly, in the areas of market
entry, fares, taxation, and intermodal investment priorities). As for matters
related to urban transport planning and traffic engineering, DGPC staff vill
benefit  from  participating  in  the  training  programs  included  in  the
institution building component of the proposed project.
B. Ministry of Transport and Communications
5.05     The MOTC was  created  in  1974  to assume  responsibility  over  the
planning and management of the country's transport sector. It vas reorganized
in 1981 along modal lines (Chart 2), and an intermodal coordination unit vas
established in the Cabinet; ten regional offices vere also created, but are
still poorly staffed and rather inactive. Little modal coordination, however,
is effectively exercised, because operating agencies like SNCFT, SNT, Tunis
Air and others hold a solid advantage of size and experience over the MOTC.
This has led to sizeable investments in railways and international transport
(air and shipping), and relative neglect of urban and intercity road
transport. As SRTs and/or transport modes (defined by vehicle technologies)
were  dealt  with  on  an  individual  basis,   this   impeded  an   urban,
geographically-defined focus.
5.06     As  the  chief  regulator  of  road  transport  companies  in  public
ownership and steward of Caisse Spéciale de Compensation des Transports
Routiers,*-  the MOTC has been ineffective in preventing the slow financial
decay of the SRTs and the deterioration of their services (resulting from low
fares and inadequate compensation for discount fares), while potential private
suppliers of transport services vere discouraged from participating (paras.
2.04-2.06). Also, the staff of the MOTC has been too inexperienced to develop
and implement a comprehensive transport policy, in the face of political
pressures and limited financial resources.
5.07     The  MOTC  capabilities  to  manage  and  plan  the  transport  sector
effectively are being addressed by several Bank projects (detail in Annex 1).
Three policy related studies of direct concern to the MOTC (each to take six
months at the most), are financed under the Third Urban Project (para. 2.16),
and will be implemented under the proposed project:
(a)  a study to provide an analytical basis to help the Government develop
a policy vis-à-vis publicly-owned transport companies, under which
(i) sectoral goals will be set, (ii) costs for achieving these will
be estiuated in the light of observed staff productivity and other
resource  costs  in  the  sector,  (iii)  funding  and  performance
obligations will be set out, and (iv) an annual contracting process
between the transport companies, the MOTC and the municipalities
concerned will be established;
lJ  Restructured in  late December 1983  into Caisse de Compensation et de
Solutien des Transports Routiers, with expanded funding and a broadened
scope (see Project File, item B.ll).



- 18 -
(b) a atudy to (i) identify operating and financial characteristics of
existing private transport operators in Tunisia (particularly, shared
taxis),   (ii)   analyze   related   Government   regulations,   and
(iii) propose actions (regulatory and other) to facilitate private
operators involvement in providing urban transport services; and
(c) a study to (i) identify in detail manpower required to operate,
manage and plan urban transport systeum in Tunisia, (ii) design a
pilot  training  program  involving  vehicle  operators,  maintenance
personnel, and financial and managerial staff of transport companies,
traffic engineers and technicians, traffic enforcement personnel, as
well as transport planners and economists, and (iii) propose
directions for longer-term development of local training institutions.
Assurances vere obtained at negotiations that, for the purpose of supervising
these studies and implementing their recommendations, the Government vill
respectively maintain the Interministerial Committee on Urban Transport and
the CTTU (para. 2.12), vitb membership, and staff and facilities satisfactory
to  the Bank  througbout  project execution period.   The staffing and work
program of the CTTU were discussed at negotiations and found satisfactory to
the Bank.
5.08     As regards training, submission of a draft training program (to be
produced by the atudy mentioned in para. 5.07 (c)) and a plan of training
activities proposed for implementation in 1985, both satisfactory to the Bank,
and appointment of a training administrator and an expatriate adviser to belp
implement  the program, will be conditions  of effectiveness.   Furthermore,
assurances were obtained at negotiations that a detailed implementation
achedule for the complete national training program, fully endorsed by all the
departments and agencies which vill carry it out, vould be prepared and
furnisbed to the Bank for review by September 1, 1985, and thereafter
implemented accordingly. AS regards studies (a) and (b) mentioned in para.
5.07, assurances were obtained at negotiations that the MOTC will present to
the Bank for its review the results of the studies by September 1, 1985 and
June 30, 1985, respectively, agree with tbe Bank on related action programs,
and implement these programs in accordance with timetables satisfactory to the
Bank.   Technical  assistance  would  be  provided  under  the  project  for
implementation and follow-up of the actions concerning these policies.
C. Regional Transport Company of Sfax (SORETRAS)
5.09     Société  égionale  de  Transports  de  Sfax  (SORETRAS),  90  percent
publicly owned, bas three separately managed divisions for urban passenger
services,  intercity passenger services, and freigbt.   The proposed project
focusses on the urban division of SORETRAS. With its staff of 900 and a fleet
of about 160 buses, it now carries about 30 percent of daily non-walk trips in
Sfax; down from a 36 percent share in the late 1970s. This decline follows
from the fact that buses are overcrovded and old, and services unreliable.
Production coats are high, due to Ci) a highly peaked demand pattern; (ii) the
obligation to serve long routes reaching into low-density areas; (iii) the
inadequacy of maintenance facilities and equipment; and (iv) inefficient
organization and work practices.



- 19 -
5.10     The  urban  division   of   SORETRAS  has   embarked  on  a   fleec
reneval/expansion program involving the purchase of  164 vehicles over the
1984-1991 period, which will bring the fleet to about 242 units by 1991.
Commitment has been made for this program to be financed 80 percent by local
banks,  and the rest by SORETRAS.   The proposed  fleet purchases have been
reviewed and found satisfactory  to the Bank.   Improvements  in maintenance
facilities and in route structure for urban services of SORETRAS will be
addressed under the proposed project, which will also include technical
assistance to introduce new operational and maintenance practices and
improvements  in  management   (para.   3.09).   Agreement  was  reached  at
negotiations that the three specialists needed in the above fields will be
appointed by SORETRAS by March 31, 1985.
5.11     In spite of annual fare increases in 1981 through 1983, SORETRAS'
operating  revenue  from  urban  passenger  services  bas  not  covered  direct
operating expenses since 1980;
1980       1981        1982       1983 a/
Operating Revenue (TD'OOO)           2,791       3,205      3,738       4,375

a/ Estimate
b/ Total expenses minus depreciation and interest
5.12     While fare increases have lagged behind inflation, the key reason for
the sbortfall in revenue is that 40 percent of SORETRAS passengers (mostly
school children) pay discount fares. The Government has a formal obligation
to compensate SORETRAS for revenue losses due to these fares, from Caisse
Spéciale de Compensation du Transport Routier; botb levels and timng of
payments, however, were rather unsatisfactory (for SORETRAS income statement,
see Annex 3, Table 1). The consequences for the urban division of SORETRAS
have been serious. The accumulated accounting deficit at the end of 1983 vas
to be TD 2.4 million, and would be much more if depreciation vas based on
revalued assets; the 1984 deficit (before compensation) is forecast to reach
TD 2.2 million.   The division has been surviving by cross-subsidies  from
SORETRAS freight operations, short-term borrowing, and by delaying payments to
suppliers, Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS) and the State (taxes).
None of these measures can continue indefinitely.
5.13     In 1980,  accumulated  losses  already  exceeded  the  social  capital
invested in SORETRAS, and by the end of 1982, tbey vere four times bigher (see
balance sheet in Annex 3, Table 2). The company bas also a severe cash flow
problei., partly due to bigh accounts receivable.  The most critical issue,
however, is the staggering amount of short-term debt; in 1982, short-term debt
amounted to TD 7.8 million, of which 4.3 vere payable to CNSS and other state
institutions.  In September 1983, the Council of Ministers decided to vrite
off the public debt of SRTs (including SORETRAS) as of the end of 1982. This
vould still leave the company vithout cash and vithout mechanisms to upgrade
its aged plant and fleet.



- 20 -
5.14     Financial Action Plan.  The Government has recognized the necessity
for taking measures with a longer-term effect on the financial health (and
performance) of SORETRAS and other SRTs. Using SORETRAS as a test case, a
plan to make its urban division financially viable by 1989 vas developed and
agreed at negotiations (details are in Annex 3). The working ratio (direct
operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating income) vas selected
as a measure of performance of the plan, under which: (a) SORETRAS would
retain its sales tax for years 1984-88 (inclusive), evaluated at TD 2.8
million, to be used for capital investments only; (b) the Government vould pay
annually full compensation for revenues SORETRAS loses because of discount
fares; payment of compensation for the first three quarters of 1984 is a
condition of loan effectiveness; and (c) SORETRAS vould before October 31 of
each year, starting in 1984, assess its financial situation and submit to the
Government a proposal to increase passenger fares, to help the urban division
of the company keep its working ratio at no more than 0.79 to 1 in 1985; 0.76
to 1 in 1986; 0.73 to 1 in 1987; 0.71 to 1 in 1988; and 0.70 to 1 in 1989 and
subsequent years. Thereafter, the Government and SORETRAS vould review this
proposal vith the Bank and, promptly after such review, the Goverument vould
enable SORETRAS to increase fares and/or take other measures satisfactt ry to
the Bank to attain the above ratios.  Assurances vere also obtained that
SORETRAS vould submit to the Bank for review, by September 30 of each year,
its investment plan and financial projections for the next five years; this
investment plan vould include, inter alia, a fleet reneval and expansion
program to be carried out in parallel vith improvements included under the
proposed project.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. General
6.01     Investments  under two project components  -- namely,  primary road
improvements in Greater Tunis and public transport improvements in Sfax --
account for nearly 75 percent of the project base cost. These vere evaluated
both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively,  as  reported  below.   The need  for
training, technical assistance and studies is directly related to major policy
and institutional objectives of Bank assistance in the sector and is not
included in the economic analysis.
B. Evaluation of Primary Road Improvements in Greater Tunis
1. Qualitative Evaluation
6.02     Within the broad urban transport context, independent undertakings in
public  transport,  highways  or  traffic  management,  compete  for  scarce
resources. In the Greater Tunis area, the bus network will (in the next few
years) be scaled down and reoriented to complement the light-rail system
(MLT), and traffic management methods are already being applied; thus, it is
the highvay element of the urban transport system where investments have been
missing.  The evaluation described below was directed at choosing the best
possible composition for a bighway package, given the investments conmitted in
public transport and the related traffic management strategy adopted by the
Municipality.



- 21 -
6.03     Technical objectives which road improvements vill address draw on two
perceived needs:
(a) that the transport network functioa efficiently for regional (not
center-bound) travel; and
(b) that a transport/land use balance in the central area be restored.
8
6.04     By constructing and/or upgrading various road links constituting the
eastern bypass to the downtown area, the project will improve conditions for
regional (and inter-regional) travel for all highway-based transport modes.
(This complements the impact that the MLT project, on a similar time schedule,
vill  have  for  the  rail-based  public  transport  users).   In  addition  to
transport   cost  savings  (paras.  6.06-6.07),  the  project  vill  change
accessibility patterns, and thus affect urban development, particularly on the
urban fringe. It is not practical to evaluate in a precise form the level and
distribution of these impacts, but they are expected to benefit people making
longer interperipheral trips, in agreement with urban development policy
developed by the District de Tunis.
6.05     As for  the impact on the central area,  the bypass  will  divert
through-traffic away from the downtown network and Ahneau des Boulevards, and
improve vehicular access to the region's hub. Complementary traffic restraint
measures (e.g. parking charges) are designed to reduce downtown congestion and
are expected to benefit business, shopping and cultural activities in the
downtown area.
2. Economic Evaluation
6.06     Project benefits consist of savings (relative to a base network) in
vehicle operating costs and passenger travel time, achieved as a result of the
road improvements.  Costs were 1983 base costs, net of tax.  Analyses were
carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the entire eastern bypass vas
treated as a single investment. Assuming a 15-year project life, the economic
rate-of-return (ERR) for the whole package is 36  percent.   A  sensitivity
analysis was carried out to identify the combinations of cost increases and
benefit reductions which would bring the ERR to the cut-off point of 10
percent; the results show that the whole package is attractive under all
likely scenarios (Annex 2, paras. 30-32).
6.07     In the second stage of the evaluation, the bypass was sub-divided
into five slices, and each of them was successively tested in terms of its
incremental rate-of-return. Under the base assumptions, rates-of-return for
different slices vary from 17 percent to 73 percent, with Viaduc de la
République giving the lowest rate. A sensitivity analysis, similar to that
carried out in the first stage of the evaluation, confirms that the
rates-of-return obtained for the base case are robust (Annex 2, paras. 32-33).



- 22 -
C. Evaluation of Public Transport Improvements in Sfax
6.08     In  order  to  isolate  the  benefits  due  to  the  SORETRAS  project
component from those due to the concurrent SORETRAS fleet reneval/expansion
prograr, it vas assumed that the number of passengers carried by SORETRAS
would be the same in the "with" and "vithoutl" project situations. The only
benefits are then savings in:
(a)  capital  investment  for  fleet  (because  bus  availability  would  be
increased in the "with" project case, due to the improved performance
of maintenance; i.e. less buses would have to be bought in the "with"
case to serve the given level of patronage); and
(b)  operating  costs  (because,  to  the  more  efficient  maintenance  and
operations in the "with" situation, would correspond Lesser needs of
new staff than in the "vithout" situation).
Investment costs included base costs (net of tax) for the whole Sfax
component, except the improvements to bus stops and terminals which were
assumed to take place in both scenarios.  For elements vith useful lives
extending  beyond  1996,  appropriate  salvage  values  vere  estimated.   The
resulting ERR for  this  component  is 29 percent.   Further details  on  the
procedure and the related cash-flows are in Annex 3.
6.09     A sensitivity analysis was carried out for the folloving assumptions:
(a) maintenance benefits do not occur (ERR = 21Z);
(b) benefits related to operations do not occur (ERR = 14%);
(c) fleet-related savings are not achieved, i.e. bus availability does
not improve (ERR = 18%); and
(d) investuent costs increase by 30 percent (ERR = 20%).
The ERR is the most sensitive to benefits in operations, i.e. to the number of
drivers and conductors per bus in peak service.  If any two of the above
assumptions are met simultaneously, the project would become uneconomical.
There vill be a need, therefore, to closely monitor throughout the project the
productivity of operations and maintenance staff of SORETRAS, and to take
corrective measures as necessary (list of monitoring indicators is in Annex
7). Agreement was reached at negotiations that, in compliance with the higher
levels of performance that SORETRAS is to reach in the years to come, SORETRAS
vill endeavor to contain its manning ratios along the lines assumed in this
evaluation.
6.10     The  true  beneficiaries  of  this  component will  be users  of  the
SORETRAS urban services, since these services vill improve in frequency,
reliability,  convenience and comfort.   This will be particularly  true for
school children, vho account for 10 million trips per year (about 27 percent

of all trips, but 60 to 80 percent in peaks) and pay discount fares. The cost
of the project will be partly borne by the users, but in greater part by the
national government which vill pay compensation for discount fares and
contribute  capital  to  SORETRAS,  until  the  company  reaches  financial
self-sufficiency in the late 1980s.
D. Overall Rate-of-Return
6.11     The average ERR for the project, veighted by the base costs of the
Tunis and Sfax components, is 35 percent.
E. Project Risks
6.12     The main project risk is that implementation of sectoral policy may
lag behind that of physical vorks.  The technical assistance and training
components of the project will help minaimize this risk. In addition, a number
of agreements vere reached at negotiations, linking policy-related actions
with milestones in the project schedule and setting specific target dates
(paras. 7.01(i), (ii), (viii), (ix) and (x); and 7.02(ii) and (iii)). The
main guarantee against these risks, however, is the Government's commitment
(evident in a number of decisions it has receatly taken) to changes in
transport policy, aimed at improving the SRTs' situation, and for others, at
increasing private involvement in public transport services.
6.13     Specifically concerning transport improvements in Greater Tunis, the
major risk is that the highway construction wili be carried out vithout
implementation of the complementary traffic restraint measures (i.e., parking
charges). The consequences of this vould probably include: (a) a substantial
increase in car travel throughout the Greater Tunis area, with attendant
increases in pollution and noise; (b) continuation and increase of downtown
congestion, worsening the lot of pedestrians, paratransit and buses operating
in mixed traffic, and uitimately, working to the detriment of the diverse
activities located in the center.
6.14     The risk described above is acceptable on  the folloving grounds;
(a) a parking meter program has been introduced in Tunis at the Municipality's
own initiative; and (b) the program has been a success in operational and
financial terms; it has received reasonable public acceptance and no
enforcement-related problems bave been reported. All care vill be taken that
the extension of the metering  program and  increases in  tariffs are vell
prepared and gradual, with due concern for the interests of downtown
residents. The progress of the program will be well monitored (Annex 7).
6.15     As for the public transport improvements in Sfax, and vith reference
to benefits as defined in the economic analysis, the risk is that the growth
in bus passengers may be slower than predicted, because of competition from
the private car and privately-provided transport operators. In such a case,
the depot would be slightly underutilized for urban-related activities in the
early years.



- 24 -
6.16     In fact, demand estimation in the preparation studies vas based on a
conservative rate of traffic growth, and past experience in Tunisia suggests
that there is substantial latent demand for urban public transport. Entry of
private operators into the market is expected to affect only the outlying,
low-density portions of the longer SORETRAS lines where the sma}ler vehicles
generally favored by these operators give them a comparative advantage. This
vould lead to re-deployment of larger vehicles on more profitable and
under-served urban routes, rather than cause a loss of traffic. This risk is,
therefore, low and vell-worth taking.
VII.  ASSURANCES OBTAINED AT NEGOTIATIONS AND REOOMMENDATION
7.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following points:
(i)  the Government, by March 31, 1985 at the latest, will have finalized
arrangements for cofinancing of the training program and technical
assistance, or (if cofinancing arrangements cannot be made) secured
alternative financing for that purpose (para. 4.07);
(ii) following completion of the parking management study for dowatown
Tunis, but not later than May 1, 1985, the Government will cause the
Municipality of Tunis to present to the Bank an action plan for
extending the parking meter program throughout the dowatown area a-nd
for  aligning  parking  tariffs  in  the  light  of  the  study,  and
thereafter, to take all the necessary actions to implement the agreed
course of action in accordance with a timetable satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 4.10);
(iii) SORETRAS will present to the Bank every year separate operating
accounts of its freight and passenger services (para. 4.20);
(iv) DGPC, MOTC, SORETRAS, the Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax, and the
Tunis District will present to the Bank not later than six and nine
months respectively after the end of each  fiscal year,  financial
statements and audited accounts recording expenditures under the
project (para. 4.21);
(v)  DGPC, MOTC, SORETRAS, the Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax, and the
Tunis District will present to the Bank every four months, progress
reports (the first one by April 30, 1985) reviewing the progress made
in the execution of the project component under their responsibility
(para. 4.22);
(vi)  SORETRAS will submit to the Bank, by April 30 of each year, a report
on its performance as measured against agreed upon indicators (para.
4.23);
(vii)  the  Government  vill  respectively  maintain  the  Interministerial
Committee on Urban Transport and the CTTU, with membership, and staff
and facilities satisfactory to the Bank throughout the project
execution period (para. 5.07);



- 25 -
(viii) folloving completion of the training study and the two policy studies
for urban public transport, the Government vill present to the Bank
for review, drafts of a training program and of action plans for
reforming sector policies, and thereafter during project execution,
vill implement the agreed programs and courses of action in
accordance vith timetables satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.08);
(ix) SORETRAS vill appoint technical assistance experts before March 31,
1985 (para. 5.10);
(x)  the Government and  SORETRAS vill  take all necessary measures  to
implement the financial action plan agreed upon during negotiations
in accordance with a timetable satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.14);
and
(xi) SORET&AS vill submit to the Bank for review, by September 30 of each
year, an investment plan and financial projections for the next five
years, of scope and detail satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.14).
7.02     The folloving vould be conditions of Loan Effectiveness:
(i)  Ratification of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and SORETRAS (para. 4.06) covering that part of the Bank Loan to be
passed on by the Government to SORETRAS;
(ii)  Subnission  of  a  draft  national  training  program  for  the  urban
transport sector, and a specific plan of training activities for
1985, and appointment of a training administrator and an expatriate
advisor to help run this program (para. 5.08); and
(iii)  Payment by the Government to SORETRAS of the compensation for losses
due to social tariffs over the January 1 - September 30, 1984 period
(para. 5.14).
7.03     Subject to the above conditions, the project is suitable for a loan
of US$33 million to the Government of Tunisia on standard Bank terms.

TUNISIA SECOND URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
PRIMARY ROAD IMPROVEMENTS IN GREATER TUNIS
A. Context
1.       With about 1.3 million people in 1983, Greater Tunis is not only the
capital of Tunisia but also its most important urban centre.  Its population
is groving at about 6.9% per year and is not expected to show any slowdown in
the years to come. Greater Tunis dominates the whole country by more than its
sheer size; it also contains most of the country's secondary and tertiary
sector employment (including the Government), the largest port, airport and
university as vell as the most complete and diversified socio-cultural
equipment in the country.
2.       Until the mid-1970s, Greater Tunis evolved along a strong development
pattern, in which (i) rapid residential growth continued in North and
Northwest outskirts of the metropolitan area, and less so in the South, and
(ii) employment growth occured primarily in the downtown area and the South.
Starting in the mid-1970s, efforts were made to promote development of housing
programs in the South, and industrial parks in the Northwest and North. These
efforts were only half successfui; job creation in the target areas lagged
behind. Thus, during peak periods, the traffic pattern in Greater Tunis is
highly dominated by work-related trips generated by the centre and, to a
somewhat lesser degree, by the southern industrial complex.
3.       Transport problems faced by Greater Tunis are more serious than those
affecting other urban areas in the couatry, but rather typical of growing,
dynamic cities elsewhere.   On the periphery,  orde-ly road development has
lagged behind urban growth, altnough plans have existed for nearly a decade;
this is particularly true for the quickly urbanizing areas in the north and
northwest, where construction of arterial roads should be an urgent task while
options are still open and right-of-way costs still reasonable.   Downtown
Tunis poses a different set of problems. The centre is both the chief travel
generator  in  the  region  and  the  main  corridor  for  regional   (and
inter-regional) through-traffic.  The main highway arterials in the region are
radial, but access to the centre is difficult due to the location of the
impenetrable Medina, requiring a substantial amount of circumferential travel
in the inner city.  One ring route is available for this purpose (Anneau des
Boulevards), but it remains an underdeveloped corridor of variable width and
traffic standards.  Righ-capacity, limited-access roads enter Tunis frou the
north and the south, but their interconnections are poor. The central link of
the main north-south route (GP8-Z4), located east of downtown along the shore
of the Lake of Tunis, includes several major at-grade intersections which
limits its effectiveness both as a through-road and as a feeder/distributor to
the dowatown area.   No such route exists west of the centre.  Within the
downtown area (as defined by Anneau des Boulevards), there is little



- 28 -               ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 18
functional specialization of streets, trading off movement vs. access. Recent
counts in the downtown show that traffic volumes remain fairly stable from 7
a.m. to 7 p.m., rather than show the customary two-peak pattern. This is due
in part to a two-session work day (also applicable to schools). The heaviest
traffic loads appear in the last three hours of the above period, when
end-of-work trips overlap with shopping and social trips.  In the evening,
long back-ups of traffic are common at key intersections (e.g., with Avenue
Bourguiba). The competition for space between buses, moving cars, parked cars
and pedestrians i8 fierce, and illegal behavior abounds in the face of weak
traffic law enforcement.  Staggering of work hours for Governnent employees,
introduced in 1983, appears not to have had much effect.
4.       In the downtown area, traffic conditions have not deteriorated too
rapidly thanks to an integrated, computer-controlled traffic signal system
encompassing 50 intersections, which was installed in the mid-1970s as a key
feature of a comprehensive  traffic management  program.   The  program also
included a network of bus-only lanes (fallen into disuse in early 1980s),
pedestrian-only  streets,   a  one-way  circulation   system  and  geometric
improvements at key intersections. These measures allowed traffic to grow at
8 to 10% per annua over the intervening years, without large-scale road
investuents.
5.       A key measure missing from the above traffic management program,
however,  has  been  parking  control.   Until  early  1980,  there was  little
off-street parking space in Tunis, and on-street parking was not regulated.
Parking meters were first installed by the Municipality in 1980, on a trial
basis, at key locations (e.g., Place de Barcelone, Avenue Bourguiba).  The
experience proved successful in that it nearly doubled the utilization rate
(even at a low tariff of DT 0.100 per hour) and was financially profitable.
The program has since expanded in an incremental faahion to about 1,000
metered spaces in 1983, and another 500 spaces are planned for 1984.  Yet,
there is no clear policy as toa (i) the use of parking charges and time
controls as traffic management tools; (ii) extent of area coverage; and
(iii) methods of administering and enforcing the program.
6.       The principal victim of traffic growth in Tunis has been public
trinsport, still the principal mode for the majority of inhabitants of the
Greater Tunis area in spite of the growth of car ownership in recent years.
The hard-won privilege of operating SNT buses on reserved lanes progressively
waned,  mainly  because  of  the  lack of Government  commitment  to effective
traffic law enforcement. Authorities have been paying much more attention to
creating a new, technologically advanced, public transport system, the Métro
Léger de Tunis (MLT), than to the needs of the bus company (SNT), although bus
services would continue being essential for the whole area.
7.       The first phase of the MLT,I/ a 30km long light-rail network on a
protected alignuent using city streets (with priority at intersections), is
being built as a tri-lateral German-Austro-Tunisian joint venture, most of
which is financed by suppliers and a German Goverument credit.  Completion of

ANNEX 2

the surface portions of the system is expected late in 1984, but completion of
the link through the downtown area (which the Government decided in late 1982
to have constructed in a tunnel) may take an additional two to three years.
The first phase network is Y-shaped, leading from Ben Arrous (in the south) to
Bardo (in the west) and Ariana (in the north) (Map IBRD 18020R). An access
link will also be constructed from the main line in central Tunis to a depot
at Tunis-Marine. Two subsequent phases (20- and 30km-long, respectively) were
proposed for the next decade, but no further studies or commitments have been
made. The MLT, together with the Tunis-La Goulette-La Marsa (TGM) railway
line, will be operated by Société du Métro Léger de Tunis created in 1982.
8.       Preparation studies,  carried out in 1975-77,  forecasted MLT daily
traffic at 60,000 passengers (about 20 million per year) in 1981, vith a
volume of 11,000 passengers per bour per direction, and frequencies of 60
trains per hour on the link most loaded in the network.   Using operating
forecasts (made in 1977), staff vages and energy prices, direct operating
costs of the MLT (at an assumed level of 20 million trips per year) vould
reach approximately TD 5 million (in 1983 terns), corresponding to about TD
0.250/trip. This operating cost is comparable to that of bus services in
1983, as vell as to the current level of bus receipts (about TD 0.200/trip);
the MLT, therefore, should be able to cover its direct operating costs.
9.       The impact of MLT vill be manifold.  Firat, it will greatly alter the
demand for travel by bus, and will necessitate a thorough restructuring of the
SNT bus network (the related study is already underway). It is also expected
to tap considerable latent demand for public transport (para. 20(d)).  Some
passengers  vill  transfer  to  the  MLT  from  using  cars;  others  will  make
additional trips, because area coverage or travel speed vill have improved, or
completely new connections will be offered.   Second,  the impact of MLT on
street traffic will also be considerable; (a) along some major arterial roads
in Tunis (Map IBRD 18020), right-of-way for other vehicles will be reduced or
entirely taken away; and (b) wherever MLT intersects important arterials at
grade, there will be a loss of capacity of 50% or more.
10.      hetween the "normal" traffic growth and the impact of the MLT on the
demand and street capacity, a situation has developed where significant
investments in road infrastructure in Greater Tunis is warranted, both to
provide reasonable vehicular access to the central area, and to ease
conditions for regional (and inter-regional) travel not generated by the
centre. The most urgent of these investments vill be provided under the
proposed project.
B. Project Content
il.      The choice of specific investments to be included in the project was
made easier by the existence of:
(a)  a Righway Master Plan for Greater Tunis, developed in 1976, which
tested the adequacy of a primary road network for the capital region
and assigned priorities among various links therein (para. 19); and



-30-                  ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 18
(b)  a draft traffic management plan (commissioned by the Municipality of
Tunis),  to  be  implemented  gradually  over  the  MILT  construction
period.   The key feature of this plan,  still in draft stage,  is
traffic  restraint  by  dividing  the  downtown  into  Gothenburg-type
traffic cells without direct vehicular access from one cell to
another; the plan also identified a road improvement program common
to all proposed traffic management alternatives.
12.      Top priority vas assigned to establishing North-South bypasses to the
city centre, to "drain" the downtown street network of all through-traffic and
to permit better distribution of the downtown-generated traffic over available
points of entry or exit. Since the central section of Tunis (composed of the
old Medina and the "modern city") is caught between the Lake of Tunis on the
East and the Lake Sedjoumi on the West, possible North-South passages could
only be found on the banks of the two lakes. Portions of a bypass along the
Lake of Tunis were constructed as early as 1974 (Voie Z4, between GP8 and
Avenue Habib Bourguiba).  Neither the geometry, nor intersections and other
access/exit points of this road were of the standard necessary for a major
urban bypass.   The proposed  project  concentrates  on  improvements  in  this
corridor, hereafter called the eastern bypass.
13.      The improvements (also shown on Map IBRD 18020R) consist of;
(a) Construction of an interchauge at the current intersection of GP8 and
GP9 (at present at-grade and signalized), with a connection to Voie
X2;
(b) Completion of a second carriageway for Voie X2 (currently a two-lane
section) between GP10 and GP9, over a 1.3 km distance;
(c) Construction of an overpass on Voie Z4 at Rue Cyrus-le-Grand (Palais
des Congrès), where there is no intersection at present;
(d) Construction of an overpass (Viaduc de l'Avenue de la République),
about 500 meter long, along Voie Z4 over both Avenue Bourguiba and
Line 1 of the KLT network (which connects the MLT network with both
the TGH terminal and the depot at Tunis-Marine);
(e) Upgrading of Voie Z4 from Viaduc de la République to the intersection
with GP1 (from the present 7m carriageway, to a full 2xtwo-lane
section), over a 1.6 km distance;
(f) Completion of a second carriageway on Voie Z4, from the intersection
with GP1 to Mégrine (to achieve a full 2xtwo-lane section, where only
a single 7m carriageway exists at present), over a 2.5 km distance;
(g) Construction of Intercommunale Sud (2xtwo-lane section) between GPI
and Voie Z4, over a 0.7 km distance; and
(h) Construction of Pénétrante Sud, 1.9 km long, connecting Sortie Sud
and Voie Z4; this will include two interchanges (one at each end) and
an above-grade crossing of the SNCFT lines.

C.  Proiect Costs
14.      Cost  estimates  include  land acquisition,  civil works, as vell as
execution studies and services to supervise execution (see Table 1). Detailed
breakdowns of local and foreign cost components, by item of expenditures, are
shown in Tables 2 and 3.
D. Land
15.      Land   vill   need   to  be   purchased   (through  negotiations   or
expropriation) to make the whole program possible, and this might involve
either purchase costs higher than expected, and/or delays. The latter concern
should not be excessive since (a) DPC has already identified the land and
owners concerned, and has undertaken to negotiate with these landowners; and
(b) it was agreed that, should negotiations proceed for three months and
remain unsuccessful, access to the land would then be secured through
expropriation (which requires a decree making the land public property under
the power of eminent domain, and leaves it to public courts to decide on
appropriate compensation of landowners) and civil vorks would commence.  Land
costs and/or expropriation compensation will be covered by Covernment
counterpart financing.
E. Economic Analysis
16.      The  economic  analysis  of  primary road  transport  improvements  in
Greater Tunis was built around a computer-based, traffic simulation model
which, for any specified road network configuration and origin-destination
travel pattern, produced estimates of peak hour vehicle kilometres and vehicle
hours over the whole network. These estimates, expanded to annual kilometrage
and hours, were used to estimate costs of vehicle operation and travel time of
passengers (usually called "user costs") for that configuration. The benefit
of one road configuration relative to another vas defined as the difference
between the annual user costs of the two; cost was defined as the difference
in the respective construction costs. (Since few entirely new links appear in
the proposed investment program, maintenance costs were not considered.)
17.      The key  conceptual  limitation of  the analysis was that the same
travel pattern was assumed for all network configurations. Traffic could have
different routes (and speeds), but the total number of trips over the network,
and the origin-destination pattern remained the same. The selection of the
investment program was thereby reduced to a cost minimization problem. This
limitation cannot be removed until a data base of a substantially different
quality  (and  quantity)  becomes  available,  in  addition  to  much  more
sophisticated tools for travel demand analysis.
18.      The  following  sections  summarize  the  principal  aspects  of  the
procedure:   (a) traffic simulation;  (b) user costs; (c) construction costs;
and (d) testing procedures and results. Further details are in item Dl of
Project File.

Traffic Simulation
19.      In 1976, the design of a Highway Master Plan for the Greater Tunis
area vas commissioned by the MEQ. A traffic simulation exercise vas caxried
out as  part  of  the design process.   Its  chief characteristics  vere  the
folloving.
(a) The networt representation was coarse-grained: the area was divided
in 46 internal and 6 external zones; ouly arterial hi.gpways were
included (e.g., the model had no links within Anneau des Boulevards).
(b) Peak-hour (rather than 24-hour) traffic was modelled.
(c) The trip generation model was of a trip-ends type, calibrated on 1975
socio-economic and traffic data and using a linear function of
population, secondary and tertiary employment (vithout a constant
term).
(d) No trip distribution model was used; travel forecasts were developed
using a matrix maaipulation (Fratar) technique, vith growth rates
computed from appropriate zonal production and attraction forecasts.
These were based, in turn, on zonal forecasts of socio-economic
variables. Since the trip generation model apparently overestimated
trips, substantial manual adjustments to the origin-destination table
were required.
(e) Forecasts of external trips (those from external zones to internal
zones, and vice-versa) were developed outside the model, using a
straightforvard trend technique.
Cf) All trip tables vere in terms of passenger-car-equivalents (pce) per
hour; passenger car equivalency factors vere; 3.0 for buses and
trucks, and 0.75 for cycles.
(g) Modal split was handled implicitly through adjustments for traffic
composition.
(h) The traffic assignment model allowed up to 4 routes between any pair
of zones; it also permitted substantial overloads of individual links
(in excess of 200%).
tj) Impact of the Métro Léger de Tunis (MLT) on demand forecasts and on
link capacity at intersections was not reflected.
(k) Speed-volume relationsbips vere three-piece linear, with particularly
sharp alope where the traffic volume varies between 85% and 120Z of
capacity (to account for queueing at bottlenecks).
20.      The following adjustments were made to the 1976 model to make it more
useful for the purpose at hand:



ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 18
(a)  The network vas represented in finer detail in the corridor(s) under
study (particularly for intersections), to permit incremental testing
of improvements (paras. 33-34 below).
(b)  Traffic forecasts were developed for 1986. assumed (for the purpose
of this analysis) to be the first year of operations for all the
improvements proposed under this project. The actual implementation
schedule for the project (Annex 5) calls for the completion of
various parts of this component at different times, from 1987 through
1989. The inclusion of these in the analysis was not practical. The
simplifying assumption adopted actually leads to an underestimate of
benefits.
(c)  Since the trip generation model, run with forecasts of socio-economic
variables for 1986, clearly overestimated the amount of travel in
Tunis in that year (checked against 1983 traffic counts on the
eastern bypass corridor), the origin-destination table was manually
adjusted in the light of data from annual, area-wide, automatic
traffic counts which are carried out routinely by the MEQ.  These
gave an average traffic growth rate of 5.6Z for the whole area in the
1975-83 period, but 6.5Z along the eastern bypass. The latter rate
vas assumed to hold over the 1983-86 period. The resulting total was
77,000 peak hour trips (in pce/hr) in 1986, about 27S less than the
total previously predicted by the model.
(d)  The above f orecast did not reflect the impact of the MLT on modal
split. A manual adjustment of the trip table was therefore carried
out, in which proportion of trips that vould shift to the MLT, for
any zonal interchange, depended on the proximity of the origin and
destination zones  to MLT lines.   Shift from cars as well as from
buses to the MLT was estimated. Area-wide traffic composition also
had to be adjusted. The MLT was estimated to decrease the number of
peak hour trips on other transport modes by 361.  The terms "with
MLT" and "without MLT" used later in this text, refer to 1986 traffic
simulations carried out with origin-des.ination tabeis with, and
vithout these changes in modal split.
(e)  Since the MLT will intersect a number of arterial roads at grade, and
will have priority therein, the link speed-volume characteristics at
such locations were adjusted to reflect capacity reducti.as.
(f)  For the purpose at hand, speed-volume relationships fro-.4 the original
simulation were adjusted to prohibit link overloading beyond 20%, and
to  insure  that  travel  speed would not fall when  traffic volume
increased from capacity to 20S above capacity.   These adjustments
were meant to prevent overestimation of link travel times (and thus,
of benefits as vell), and to reflect a conservative approach to the
appraisal of the program under examination.
21.      The   adjusted   traffic   model  vas   run  vith  various  network
configurations (paras. 29-34 below). For certain configurations, runs were

made both twith MLT" and "vithout MLT".  For each configuration, the model
produced estimates of pce-kilometres and pce-hours per peak hour.
22.      Peak bour pce-kilometres and pce-hours produced by the simulation
model were expanded to annual values vith reference to observed 1983 traffic
patterns. The 24-hour traffic counts in the corridor under study revealed a
peak period varying from 6 to 9 hours depending on the location; similar
counts in the central area show a continuous  12-hour peak.  Since traffic
peaking characteristics of the dowatown Tunis are rather unique in the region,
the duration of 6 to 9 hours is more representative of the conditions
tLiroughout the arterial network.   A  6-hour  peak  period  (not necessarily,
continuous) was adopted as a base value in the analysis; an annualization
factor of 300 was also adopted. An alternative value of 4 peak hours per day
was used in the sensitivity analysis, representing a minimum minimorum case.
23.      User Costs.  User costs included vehicle operating costs and travel
time of passengers. The following vehicle operating costs were used:
Vehicle Operating Costs b/
Vehicle Category                   TD/vehicle-km         TD/vehicle-hour
buses and trucks                              0.269                    4.14

b!  Item Dl in the Project File gives details of sources, assumptions and

24.      The distance-related component of vehicle operating costs included
fuel, oil, tires,  and  maintenance.   Time-related  vehicle  operating  costs
included salaries of operating personnel (applicable to buses, trucks and
taxis), vehicle capital costs, and insurance. All costs vere 1983 financial
costs minus taxes. In the case of fuel costs, this approach may have led to
underestimating user cost savings and, therefore, benefits since domestic
retail prices minus taxes (i.e., ex-refinery prices) are lower than border
prices;

25.      The above vehicle operating costs were veighted to get unit operating
costs in pce-terms. The assumed traffic stream composition after adjustments
for the impact of the MLT vas: 7.5Z buses; 5.8% trucks; 68.1X cars; 14% taxis;
and 4.6% two-wheel vehicles. The resulting costs were: TD 0.06 per pce-km,
and TD 1.15 per pce-hour.
26.      Travel time of passengers vas valued at one-third of the average vage
rate, for all peak period travel. The lack of a videly accepted approach for
travel time valuation, and the type of data available in this exercise, make
strong arguments  for  adopting  this  simple  assumption,  a  combination   of
villingness-to-pay and marginal productivity approaches.
27.      Average individual vage in 1983 in the Greater Tunis area vas TD 123
per month (inflated from 1977 datum of TD 68 per month, from the household
survey carried out by District de Tunis). Assuming 180 hours of vork per
month gives a wage of TD 0.683 per hour, or TD 0.228 per person-hour of travel
time. Average vehicle occupancies in Tunis are (excluding salaried personnel);
50 for buses, 2 for cars, 1 for taxis and cycles. Average occupancy in the
stream, weighted by modal proportions (from para. 24 above), is 5.3 persons
per vehicle, or 4.24 persons per pce. This results in a value of time of TD
0.97 per pce-hour.
28.      Economic  Costs.   Under  the  proposed  project,  the  eastern  bypass
component consists of 8 elements (para. 13). These vere grouped into 5 slices
for the purpose of incremental tests of economic feasibility (Table 1). For
each of the sub-components, two types of economic costs were estimated
(Table 4):
(a) base costs of land, construction and supervision costs, net of taxes
(estimated at 18% of costs in Table 1), spread over a 3-year
construction period, vith completion at the end of 1985; these costs
were used for computing rates-of-return for the component as a whole;
and
(b)  equivalent (end-1985) construction costs, derived from those in (a)
using a discount rate of 10% per annum; these costs were used for
first   year   rate-of-return   calculations   in   the   incremental
(slice-by-slice) analysis.
29.      Estimation of Benefits.  A total of 14 traffic model runs for 1986
vere made, testing 12 network configurations and two trip tables (with and
without the MLT). TaDle 5 gives the resulting pce-kilometres and pce-hours.
For any pair of network configurations, benefits of the configuration with
higher construction costs vere computed by multiplying the difference in
pce-kilometres and pce-hours between the two configurations with appropriate
annual user costs.
30.      Test of the bypass as a single investment package.  The first series
of tests were run for the package as a whole, against a reference network.
The latter was defined as a combination of the actual 1983 Greater Tunis road
network, plus all the roads under construction or firmly commaitted.

31.      The base  case for the calculation of the economic rate-of-return
(ERR) for the eastern bypass assumed:
(a) uniform stream of annual benefits over the life of the project;-L'
(b) travel time benefits included; and
(c) daily peak period of 6 hours.
A  sensitivity analysis  was carried out by excluding  travel  time related
benefits, decreasing the daily peak to 4 hours, and assuming increasingly
adverse construction costs and user benefits, in order to push the ERR for the
project to the cut-off point of 10%.  Results are shown  in Table 6 and
summarized here:
a        b        c         d
Base Costs                       36       24        25       15
Costs + 25%                      29       19        20       12
Base Costs; Benefits - 50%       18       10        il        5
Costs + 25%; Benefits - 25%      22       14        14        7
a = 6-hour peak, travel time benefits included (the base case).
b = 6-hour   " ,                       excluded.
c = 4-hour   " , e                     included.
d = 4-hour   " e                       excluded.
32.      The project is economically attractive under all likely scenarios.
It fails under a combination of the most pessimistic assumptions only, e.g., a
four-hour peak period, travel time benefits excluded, costs up by 25% and
benefits down by 25%, all taken together.
33.      Incremental  tests  of  slices.   The  second  series  of  economic
computations were carried out to test whether each of the slices in the
eastern bypass could be justified on its own merits. Neither the level of
aggregation of the traffic model, nor demand and network data are of the type
needed to produce reliable results in these detailed tests. Furthermore, only
the first-year rate-of-return (FYROR) vas calculated for each pair of
alternatives. The results should, therefore, be treated as illustrative only,
and indicative of correct timing, rather than of total economic returns on
each increment.
1/ Several alternative approaches for estimating benefits for years 1987
through 2000 were developed. The uniform-stream case was judged the most
reasonable. For details, see item Dl in Project File.

34.      Each pair of the tested network configurations differed by one slice
ouly. Since the slices in this analysis vere interdependent, and incremental
tests  give  different  results  depending  on  the  order  of  testing,  a
combinatorial approach was adopted. The results are shown in Table 7. FYRORs
for the base case vary between 17% and 73X, confirming that each slice is a
worthwhile investient.  A sensitivity analysis, similar to that carried out
for the first stage of economiç evaluation (para. 32) indicates that, of the
five slices, Viaduc de la Repu>.lique is the only one which becomes marginal
when travel time benefits are excluded, having a FYROR of 10% or less,
depending on other assumptions (Table 7). However, even this sub-component
has acceptable FYRORs for most of the cases tested. Since the FYROR is only
a surrogate for the ERR and only indicates correct timing of the construction
rather than total economic returns, these results mean that Viaduc de la
République should be the last slice to be constructed under the project.
Since the actual project implementation schedule calls for the Viaduc
construction to end in late 1989-early 1990, this sub-component can be
considered as fully justified.

TUNISIA
PUBLIC TRANSPORT IMPROVEMENTS IN SFAX
A. Urban Setting
1.       With a population of about 225,000, Sfax is the second largest city
in Tunisia.  Combined with the neighboring communities, it composes Greater
Sfax, an urban area of 120 km2 and 310,000 people.  It lies on flat, coastal
terrain and suffers from seasonal floods.  The port is the most important
generator of jobs in Sfax, providing a major exit for phosphate exports and an
entry for 40% of the fish caught in Tunisian waters.  The rich agricultural
hinterland of Sfax is known for its olive oil and alfalfa. The city employs
about 77,000 people and has a large population of secondary school and
university students (28,000 and 5,000, respectively).
2.       The physical pattern of Greater Sfax is fan-shaped, with the modern
city squeezed between the Medina and the port. The street system is strongly
radial, with only three ring roads available for motor vehicle traffic; other
circumferential   links   are   irregular,   unpaved  and   poorly   connected.
Development densities are relat ively high within a 4 km  radius  from  the
downtown, and drop sharply thereafter.
B. SORETRAS
3.       Société Régionale de Transports de Sfax (SORETRAS) is owned 37.5% by
the national government, 52.7% by the local (regional) government, the rest
(9.8%) being in private ownership.   It provides urban passenger  transport
services in Sfax, as well as freight and interurban passenger services. Each
of  SORETRAS'  divisions  has  distinct  facilities,  staff,  management  and
operating accounts; in practice, however, the crossing of divisional lines is
frequent.  In late 1981, the Government announced a shift in policy, whereby
large public transport enterprises such as SORETRAS would be broken into
smaller ones along functional lines (i.e., by separating freight from
passenger operations, and/or urban from interurban services).  So far, this
was done only for SNT in Tunis, the decision for other SRTs is still pending.
Unless otherwise noted,  the following  account deals with SORETRAS' urban
division only.
Services and Patronage
4.       With a staff of 900, SORETRAS operates a fleet of 159 buses on 19
urban, fixed-route lines, which add up to a service network of about 190 km.
Nearly 98% of traffic comes from 15 radial lines, which converge to the Medina
in three well-located, but poorly developed terminals; of these, 11 lines go
far into the suburbs (with an average length of 9 km), and 4 have a more urban
character  (average  length of 6 km).   The remaining 4  lines  follow more
circumferential  itineraries.   There are no  lines  serving  inter-peripheral
trips directly. The average trip length of SORETRAS passengers is about 6 km.



ANNEX 3
- 46 -               Page of 20
5.       In 1983, SORETRAS has carried about 44 million passengers, compared
to the following ridership in previous years;
Year     1972   1974    1975   1978   1980   1981   1982
Passengers  34.8   31.8    35.0   35.7   38.0   42.0   42.0
(millions)
The 1974 dip vas due to a 30Z fare increase, introduced vithout any
accompanying improvement in quality of service. There are no data to explain
either the stagnation over the 1975-78 period, or the jump from 1980 to 1981.
SORETRAS' chief competition does not come from cycles (which carry about 32%
of daily non-walk trips in Sfax),  but from cars and valking.   Data  from
partial surveys indicate that bus share of non-walk trips went from 36Z in
1976 to 31% in 1981.  SORETRAS estimates that this decline was due to the
increased use of the car, of which there are 10,000 in Sfax, with
registrations growing at 13% per annum over the last six years. Since many of
the suburban trips are captive (distances being too long for walking),
competition with other modes takes place in the intermediate-length urban
travel market.   Unfortunately,  past operating policies and  fare structures
have discriminated exactly against these trips.
6.       Looking at the quality of services offered by SORETRAS as a possible
explanation of a low rate of 3.5% annual growth in patronage from 1975 to
1983, the folloving points emerge;
(a) Buses are old (7.5 years on the average at the end of 1983) and
overcrowded  (the  average  load  factor  during  peak  periods  in
approximately 115%; for some lines, it reaches 140%).  Many people
who use the bus for the morning in-bound trip, make the return trip
on foot; the fleet made available for service in the evening peak is
20 to 30% less than in the morning.
(b) Services are unreliable. Average bus availability is low and varies
widely because of frequent breakdowns in service, the latter related
to poor conditions of roadways, vehicle overloading and the lack of
preventive maintenance. Thus, the actual frequencies are much lower
than those shown on schedules, with about 85% only of scheduled rune
actually  taking  place.   Furthermore,  passengers  &long  the  urban
portions of longer suburban lines cannot count on getting on for the
inbound trip, since most buses arrive from the periphery already
overloaded. Very few longer lines have half-way turn-back loops.
7.       Other aspects of service are better.  Travel speeds are reasonably
high, even during peak periods: 20.2 kWmh average for longer lines, down to
14.7 km/h for the shorter ones. (The level of street traffic in Sfax is still
low, and most problems are caused by the lack of segregation between cycles
and other motor vehicles.) Average distance between bus stops is low at 300m,
but these stops lack the basic equipment (e.g., signs and schedule
information, paved areas and shelters for user protection).

Page 3 of 20
8.       SORETRAS serves a difficult demand pattern.  About 27% of all trips
are made by school children and students, with a sharp annual low in the
June-September school vacation period. The daily traffic pattern shows three
peaks, with the sharpest in the morning when journeys to work overlap with
school-related travel. The latter accounts for as much as 60-80% of the peak
hour traffic.  The mid-day peak is due to a two-hour break in the work day, a
great majority of Sfaxians returning h.ome for lunch.
Fleet and Operations Staff
9.       SORETRAS fleet as of end of March 1983 consisted of the following:
TIpe               Number           Averate ARe (years)
Fiat 411                          32                     13.8
Fiat 418                          15                      9.7
Pegaso 5023                       64                      3.8
Ikarus 260                         5                      8.5
Ikarus 280 (articulated)          43                      5.3
TOTAL                   159                      6.9
Sixty newly purchased articulated buses were to arrive before the end of 1983;
32 older vehicles (including some 16.5 years old) were to be retired. Thus,
SORETRAS vas to start 1984 with a fleet of 187 buses.  With the most recent
purchase of buses, all articulated, 55% of the fleet should be of this type;
this should lighten considerably the burden of sharp peaks in demand.
10.      The average retirement age of SORETRAS buses in the last five-year
period vas high -- at nearly 13 years --, reflecting the inability of the
company to renew its fleet regularly. The age of buses and the proliferation
of bus types have resulted in difficulties (and higher costs) for maintenance,
as well as in longer periods spent out of service.
11.      Bus  purchases  are  controlled  by  the  MOTC.   Bids are  advertised
internationally, with a preference given to local suppliers. Bid evaluation
is carried out by a commission whose membership includes (in addition to MOTC)
the Central Bank, Prime Ministry and representatives of bus companies.  The
commission selects 4 suppliers for 4 bus models, and a unit price contract is
signed for two years, which serves as a prototype contract for individual
companies.
12.      In 1982, the SORETRAS fleet covered 7 million km, which gives a low
usage of about 165 km per available bus per day, no doubt due to the sharp
daily  and  seasonal  peaks  in  the  demand  for  SORETRAS  services.   Bus
overloading, however, contributes to a reasonable productivity of 1,000
passengers per available bus per day.



ANNEX 3
- 48-                 Page 4 of 20
13.      The operations staff is 530 people, of which 515 are drivers and
conductors; this alone vould give a mediocre productivity of 4.75 staff per
available bus. Unfortunately, the staff log an additional 50% in overtime.
The problem can be traced not only to day-by-day variations fn the number of
buses available for service and to breakdowns en routes but also to poor
scheduling of vehicles and operating staff.
Maintenance Facilities and Staff
14.      SORETRAS urban buses are maintained in two locations (of 28,500 and
5,200 m2 in area at Zeghm and Picville respectively), both of which are shared
with coaches for inter-urban transport.  While the first depot is on land
leased f rom Domaine Maritime for 99 years, the latcer is On a privately owned
site.
15.      Maintenance activities take place in poor conditions (both open air
and covered) with old or insufficient equipment, and inadequate safety and
hygiene.   The fact  that buses  are parked overnight and between peakS in
downtown ter-inals or on streets poses further difficulties for maintenance
(and operations). Preventive maintenance hardly exists; files are inadequate,
and work practices archaic.   Particularly poor is  spare parts management:
there are several physically remote stock rooms, and information processing is
manual; spare parts purchasing is lengthy, administratively complicated, and
lends itself to great variations in unit prices.
16.      SORETRAS employs 309 maintenance staff who, in additiOn to normal
hours, log in 20% overtime; this is a high ratio of 1.94 staff per bus (2-33
when overtime is included).
17.      The overall situation resulting from the above problems, in addition
to  high  costs,  is  the  poor  effectiveness  of  maintenance.   Average  bus
availability is only 72%; buses spend 70 days per year out of service, and
breakdowns are frequent (21 per 10,000 km).
Fares and Finances
18.      SORETRAS fares are based on a zonal system and, following a 16.5%
increase approved in September 1983, range from TD 0.150 to TD 0.250. Fare
hikes of a like magnitude were approved in both 1981 and 1982, but were not
sufficient to offset inflationary rise in costs during the period 197S-81
(urban fares vere frozen nationally) and subsequent years. Particularly large
have been Government-imposed wage increases (25.5% in 1981; 14% in 1982; with
another increase imminent).
19.      Actual revenue per passenger is much lower than the fare structure
would suggest, the reason being that only about 60% of SORETRAS passengers pay
full fare:

School children, who make up about 27% of the market, contribute only about
TD 0.027 per trip; another 9-10% of passengers get a f ree ride (SORETRAS
staff, soldiers, etc.), and another 3-4% are also enjoying various discounts.
20.      The Government has a formal obligation to compensate SORETRAS for
revenue losses due to discount fares, from Caisse Spéciale de Compensation du
Transport Routier; but it has only provided partial satisfaction, both in
terms of level of payments and their timing. SORETRAS income statements for
the last four years show that compensation has been largely unrelated to
actual losses (Table 1). In 1982, school children made about 11 million trips;
assuming an average length of 6 km for school trips (as for the rest of
SORETRAS passengers), the company should have earned about TD 1.4 million in
this  market.   Instead,  the  combined  revenue  from  school  fares  and  the
compensation (which in that year vas higher than usual) amounted to TD 0.9
million; a net loss of TD 0.5 million in that year alone.  In 1983,  these
losses have been estimated to reach TD 1 million.
21.      The  consequences  for  the  urban  division  of  SORETRAS  have  been
serious.   Since  1981,  revenues  have  not  even  covered  direct  operating
expenses.  The accumulated accounting deficit at the end of 1983 is TD 2.4
million and would be much more if depreciation write-offs were based on
revalued assets. The 1984 deficit (before compensation) is forecast to reach
TD 2.2 million. The results for the entire company (i.e., including urban and
interurban passenger services, and freight services) are shown in the balance
sheet (Table 2). SORETRAS has survived by going into short-term debt, and by
delaying payments to suppliers, Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale and the
State (taxes).
22.      In 1980 already,  accumulated  losses exceeded  the  social  capital
invested in SORETRAS, and by the end of 1982, they were four times higher.
TIe company has also a severe cash flow problem, partly due to high accounts
receivable;  the  critical  issue,  however,   is  the  staggering  amount  of
short-term debt.  In 1982, short-term debt amounted to TD 7.8 million and
consisted of:



AMNEX 3
-50-                  Page 6 of 20
(a) accounts payable to suppliers
of materials and services:                            TD 0.6 million
(b) accounts payable to Caisse Nationale
de Sécurité Sociale and other
state institutions:                                   TD 4.3 million
(c) loans maturing within one year,
used to purchase vehicles:                            TD 1.9 million
(d) cash advances from the MOF,
due within one year:                                 TD 0.9 million
In Septeme-er 1983, the Council of Ministers decided to write off the public
debt of SRTs (including SORETRAS) as of the end of 1982 (refering to item (b)
.i>ove). This move is positive (in that it will remove the accumulated losses
of  SORETRAS  from  its  balance  sheet),  but  it  is  insufficient:   a  more
fundamental action is required to provide SORETAS with cash and means for
upgrading its aged plant and fleet. Such action will be provided under the
improvement program described below.
C. Improvement Program
23.      A five-year improvement program for SORETRAS will consist of:
(a)  action plan for financial restructuring of the urban division of
SORETRAS;
(b) fleet renewal and expansion;
(c) restructuring of the service network;
(d) construction of new bus depot and purchase of maintenance equipment;
(e) upgrading of bus terminals and stops;
(f) installation of a computer-based management information system; and
(g) introduction of improved work methods in operations, maintenance and
management.
The proposed project will contribute to items (c) through (g) of the above
program, while the implementation by the Government of a f inancial action plan
(item (a)) is covenanted under the projéct.   Assurances  were obtained at
negotiations that the Government will authorize commercial loans needed for
item (b). The implementation schedule for physical components of the action
program is presented in Annex 5.
Financial Action Plan
24.      The purpose of this plan is to make the urban division of SORETRAS
f inancially viable by the late 1980s. Since the available balance sheet of



-51-                 ANNEX 3
Page7of 20
SORETRAS covers the entire company, it would not be meaningful to express
objectives of the financial plan for the urban division in terms of standard
indicators  (e.g., debt-equity or liquidity ratios).  Instead, working ratio
(direct operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenue, the
latter net of taxes) was adopted as a measure of performance, agreeing on a
ratio of no more than 0.7 to 1 as a goal for the urban division of SORETRAS to
be achieved in 1989 and maintained thereafter.  If this goal is achieved, the
excess of operating revenues over direct operating expenses vill suffice to
cover interest and principal payments associated with investment portions of
the above action program and prior obligations of SORETAS, as well as generate
funds for subsequent replacement and expansion of productive assets of the
company.
25.      The financial action  plan  involves:  (a) retention  by SORETRAS of
sales taxes due to the Government for years 1984-88 (inclusive), to be used
for capital investments only; (b) annual payments by the Government to
SORETRAS of full compensation for losses due to discount fares; and (c) annual
fare increases to reflect inflation. Table 3 shows a financial forecast for
the scenario in which this action plan is implemented. The key numerical
assumptions include; (i) traffic growth of 5.5% per annum; (ii) annual fare
increases to cover inflation (at 9% in 1984; 8% in 1985 through 1987; and 7%
thereafter), plus three increases on top; 5% in 1985 and 1986, and 3X in 1987;
(iii) retained taxes from 1984 to 1988 (evaluated at 8% of fare revenues) in
the aggregate amount of about TD 2.8 million; and (iv) annual compensation
amounting to about TD 21 million from 1984 to 1991 (an average of TD 2.63
million annually). Liquidity problemas in early years are minor and vill be
handled using funds from SORETRAS freight activities.  Further details are in
the Project File, items C.2.(f) and (g).
26.      Compensation payments in Table 3 were computed by multiplying  the
forecast annual trips to be made by school children with the price difference
of monthly passes for school children and tnose for the general public.  à
more precise and equitabl- method for estimation of compensation payments vill
be developed under a forthcoming policy study of SRTs (para. 2.14 in the main
text). Actual compensation payments may differ from those in Table 3 either
because the method of calculation is different or because actual discount
trips  are different from the forecast.  Likewise, retained  taxes and  fare
increases may be different from those built into Table 3. Therefore, rather
than set fixed targets for compensation payments and fare increases, it was
agreed to establish a set of vorking ratio limits for years 1985 through 1988
(in addition to 1989 qnd onward as described in para. 24 above). The working
ratio is not to exceed 0.79 to 1 in 1985; 0.76 to 1 in 1986; 0.73 to 1 in
1987; and 0.71 in 1988. Somewhat more strict working ratios, corresponding to
values given in Table 3, vere set up as desirable targets and included in the
system of SORETRAS performance indicators (Annex 7).
Fleet Reneval and Expansion
27.      The fleet renewal program is based on the estimate that the patronage
of SORETRAS will increase by 5.5% per year through the end of the decade.



- 52 -                  ANNEX 3
Page 8 of 20
Since historic growth rates are about 3% with deteriorating services, the
above estimate  is  conservative.   The  related  program  for purchasing (and
retiring) buses is shown in Table 4.  The fleet will increase to 242 in late
1991, from 187 in early 1984.   The proportion of articulated buses in the
fleet vill increase from 27% at present to 60% in 1991, which should ease
scheduling problems in peak periods. Assuming that buses will be retired at
10 years (down from nearly 13 at present), average age of the fleet at each
year's end will be as follows:
Year            1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991
Average Age (years)   7.2    4.5    4.8    4.2    3.9    4.6    4.8    5.2    5.3
Network Restructuring
28.      The  objectives  of network restructuring are to:  (a) improve the
level of service for medium-length and short trips (where the competion with
other modes is strong, and nearly 70% of SORETRAS non school-related revenues
are collected); (b) improve service for inter-peripherai trips; and (c) reduce
the congestion of the downtown streets (where buses are currently parked at
night  and  between  peaks).   These  will  be  achieved  by:   (a)  a  sharper
delineation between urban and suburban network (essentially, through setting
up new, shorter lines); (b) extension of radial lines beyond the centre; (c)
increase in circular and tangential lines for direct inter-peripheral travel;
(d) improvement of transfer arrangements; and (e) provision of bus parking in
the new maintenance facility (para. 30(c) below). Measures complementary to
network restructuring are also proposed, including (a) the modification of the
zonal fare system  (to simplify it, and to shift the relative burden onto
longer, highly peaked trips); and (b) the introduction of reserved bus lanes
in the inner city.
Stops and Terminals
29.      This element of the action program includes:
(a) a 30% reduction in the number of bus stops in the outlying portions
of the bus network;
(b) erection of about 100 bus shelters, paving of waiting areas, and
posting of route and schedule information at bus stops;
(c) creation of parking for cycles near important bus stops;
(d) upgrading of the (western) downtown terminal at Bab Jebli on a
right-of-way reduced from 7,000 m2 to 5,000 m2 (a reduction made
possible by eliminating bus parking in off-peak periods); channeling
will  be  improved  and  bays  will  be  redefined;  facilities  and
information for waiting passengers will be provided; and the terminal
will be integrated better with the nearby Medina and future urban
development in Zone des Martyrs;



ANNEX 3
- 53 -               Page 9 of 20
(e) upgrading of the (northern) downtown terminal Enfants de Bourguiba,
along similar lines as above;
(f) upgrading of the (southern) terminal at Place Dakar, to reflect its
new role of a pass-through station, rather than a terminus.
Maintenance Facility
30.      A new maintenance facility will be constructed in the Zegbm area
(near the new fishing port), on a lot of approximately 84,000 m2 to be leased
for 99 years from Domaine Public Maritime.  (The present depot at Picville
will be demolished, and the land returned to its private owner). The facility
will serve for:
(a) maintenance of urban buses and service vehicles;
(b) repair and overhaul of buses and coaches;
(c) parking for all urban buses, between peak periods and overnight; and
(d)  administration and staff facilities of SORETRAS urban operations.
31.      The depot will include:
(a) service station (for refueling, washing and cleaning);
(b) open air parking for 250 buses (105 standards and 145 articulated);
(c)  operations  centre  (covering  1,300  m2)  including  administrative
offices and quarters for operating personnel;
(d) workshop centre (9,160 m2 on ground level, and a 820 m2 first-floor)
consisting of: (i) central stockroom; (ii) workshop for preventive
maintenance, light repairs and emergency repairs; (iii) workshop for
major repairs and body work; (iv) workshop for engine overhaul, for
both urban end interurban buses.
The number of bus spaces in the workshop centre will be as follows:
Pits          Ground
standard   articulated  Spaces  Total
Emergency Repairs and
Preventive Maintenance         6             9          1     16

Management Information System
32.      This element of the program would involve designing, purchasing and
installing  computing  hardware  and  software  for  a  real-time  management
information system, initially for the following high-priority purposes:
(a)  vehicle   (purchasing,   maintenance,   retiring)   and   spare   parts
management;
(b)  vehicle  scheduling  and  personnel  rosters,  for  operational  and
salary-related purposes; and
(c) general and cost accounting.
Technical Assistance
33.      A  two-phase  program  of  technical  assistance  will  be  provided,
including one expert for operations, one for maintenance, and one for
management (each for about 1.5 year); this will amount to about 54 man-months
at a base cost of TD 434,000 (US$630,000 equivalent). The program will be
divided into two phases:
(a) the first phase (1985-87, inclusive) would take 90% of the technical
assistance effort and involve the introduction of new methods in
operations, maintenance and administration, in parallel with the
network  restructuring,  the  construction  of  the  depot,  and  the
provision of the new computer-based management information system.
(b) follow-up phase in the 1988-89 period.
D. Economic Analysis
34.      The  comprehensive  action  program   described   above  will  have
far-reaching impacts:
(a) it will greatly improve the type and quality of urban transport
services offered by SORETRAS;
(b) it will decrease average operating costs of the enterprise (on a per
passenger basis), both in terms of direct operating costs (staff and
materials) and capital (fleet-related) costs; and
(c) it will have an impact on other divisions of SORETRAS (freight and
intercity passenger services) as well, the degree of which will
depend on the amount of joint use of the new facilities.
35.      The key impact will certainly be on the demand side, due to improved
services; SORETRAS patronage will be much higher with these improvements than
without them. Evaluating demand changes, and sorting out the economic impact
on the community due to the above program, vould require data and analytical



ANNEX 3
Page 11 of 20
tools which are not available.  It is therefore of interest to evaluate the
effect of only one part of the action program, with maintenance-related
investments as the kev feature.   To do  this,  a minimum-case approach  to
economic  evaluation vas designed,  in which the chief assumption was that
SORETRAS would serve the same volume of passengers in both "with" and
"without" project situations. This essentially means that the number of buses
available for peak service would be the same, but  total fleets would be
different.  In the "without" scenario, the resources used for operations and
maintenance (in terms of staff per peak bus and per bus, respectively), and
the effectiveness of the maintenance function (i.e., bus availability) would
remain at the present level. "With" the project, the level of staff resources
and the performance would both be improved. The net result of these would
produce benefits in terms of direct operating costs (because fewer staff per
bus would have to be hired to match the increase in fleet size), and in terms
of capital costs (because fewer buses would have to be purchased to serve the
specified level of demand).
36.      Two sources of potential benefits were not considered in the analysis:
(a)  longer life of the fleet (due to improved maintenance); and
(b) benefits to non-urban activities of SORETRAS (i.e. the use of any
spare workshop capacity to maintain intercity coaches).
Investment Costs
37.      Costs used in this analysis were constant 1983 base costs (Table 5).
net of tax.  The following tax rates were used: site preparation, 21%; civil
works, 18%; equipment,  30%; studies, 8%; technical assistance,  13%.  Costs
were spread over a 3-year implementation period according to the schedule in
Annex 5. Costs of the entire package were included except for those for the
bus stops and terminals sub-component, which is common to both scenarios.
Useful life was assumed ta be 30 years for buildings, 20 years for the on-site
services, and 15 years for equipment. Since the period of analysis was until
1996, pro-rated residual values were included.
Benefits
38.      Benefits from capital cost savings were computed from the following
hypothesis on bus availability:
1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991
With Project        0.72   0.75   0.75   0.75   0.78   0.81   0.82   0.83   0.85
Without Project    0.72   0.75   0.75   0.75   0.75   0.75   0.75   0.75   0.75
Table 6 shows the fleets in the "with" and "without" situations, derived from
the above assumptions.  Detailed estimations were made to 1991 (inclusive).
Thereafter, the effective fleet vas assumed to grow at the same rate as the
peak demand (5.5% p.a.).  The cost of extra buses needed in a given year was



- 56 -                 ANNEX 3
Page 12 of 20
assumed to be incurred at the end of the previous year. Capital cost savings
for the "with" project situation were computed using 198Z costs (net of tax)
of TD 34,900 for a standard bus, and TD 62,000 for an articulated bus.
Residual values of the extra buses (a disbenefit to the "with project"
situation) were computed with a declining balance method, using a rate of 20%.
39.      Benefits due to savings in direct operating costs were based on the
following efficiency factors for the two situations:
(a) number of operations staff (drivers and conductors) per bus in peak
service:
1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991
With Project        4.8    4.8    4.6    4.4    4.3    4.3    4.3    4.3    4.3
Without Project     4.8    4.8    4.8    4.8    4.8    4.8    4.8    4.8    4.8
(b)  number of maintenance staff per bus:
1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991
With Project         1.9    1.6    1.5    1.5    1.4    1.3    1.2    1.2    1.2
Without Project     1.9    1.6    1.5    1.5    1.5    1.5    1.5    1.5    1.5
Average SORETRAS wages for maintenance and operating personnel were used to
value  staff-related benefits,  on  the assumption  that markets  for vehicle
mechanics and bus drivers in Tunisia work reasonably well.   In 1983 terms,
these wages were TD 3,212 per operating staff, and TD 2,348 per maintenance
staff.   Benefits  were  computed  using  the  above  efficiency  factors,  the
appropriate (mid-year) fleet estimates, and staff wages.
40.      The new maintenance  facility at Zeghm will slightly increase the
amount of "empty" kilometrage, relative to the old depot at Picville.   The
additional operating costs are quite low, relative to other costs, and were
disregarded in the analysis.
41.      Since the existing facilities of SORETRAS barely handle the current
f leet of under 200 buses (while the new depot has a capacity of 250), it was
assumed that,  in the "without project"  situation,  SORETRAS would have  to
enlarge and upgrade its present depot at Zeghm.  Costs of this were estimated
at TD 500,000 and included as a benefit for the "with project" case.
Results
42.      The  cash f low f rom  the above  assumptions  is  in  Table  7.   The
resulting economic rate-of-return (ERR) is 29%.  A sensitivity analysis was
carried out assuming that any one of the three benefit categories might not
materialize and that investment costs were underestimated by 30% (Table 8).
Without benefits related to operations, the ERR falls to 14%; without
maintenance cost savings, ERR is 21%; and without fleet-related savings, it is
18%, all other things equal. If costs increase by 30%, the ERR falls to 20%.
It is therefore vital to monitor staff levels and overtime (particularly
drivers and other operational staff), and insure that they follow the
performance objectives set herein.

TUNISIA SECOND URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
INSTITUTION BUILDING COMPONENT
1.       One of the most serious problems faced by the urban transport sector
in  Tunisia  is  the  severe  shortage  of  professionals  and  higher-level
technicians trained in the various fields related to urban transport, i.e.
transport planning, engineering, economics, traffic and parking management.
To  address  these  problems,  the  project  includes  an  institution-building
component,  comprising  training,  technical  assistance  and  studies;  this
component amounts to TD 3.5 million in base cost (Table 1), or about 10% of
proje'ct cost (see also Table 4.1 in the main text).
A - CONTENT
1. Training Program
2.       A study, financed under the Third Urban proiect and scheduled to be
commissioned by the MOTC before late March 1984, will develop a pilot national
training program along the lines of the tentative program designed during
appraisal.  This tentative program is sulmarized in Table 2.
3.       Under this program, the project would finance 6 different activities:
(a) training of future professionals (at the university level): through
granting 4 two-year scholarships to Tunisian graduates to get a
relevant specialization abroad, and retaining the services of two
expatriate professors for two years each (preferably, on the basis of
one semester a year);
(b) workshops for cadres already in the field of urban transport: to
involve about 12 participants every time, over 1 or 2 weeks ("short"
and "long" duration workshops); 6 long duration workshops and 22 of
short duration, to cover topics such as transport administration,
management, economics, planning, traffic and parking management,
police enforcement, etc...
(c)  training  local  trainers:  this  training  would  call  for   the
mobilization of 3 foreign trainers, each for 2 years in total; but
also purchase of pertinent equipment and training of the Personnel
Directors of local agencies active in the sector;
(d) training in local, operational agencies: each time for a period of
about 3 weeks; training to involve nearly 40 people (6 managers, 9
medium-level "operations" cadres, 9 medium-level "control" cadres,
and 12 higher level technicians);



ANNEX 4
- 66 -               Page 2 of 7
(e) demand analysis and information: through market studies (3) and
publicity/information campaigns; and finally,
(f) monitoring and post evaluation of the whole effort.
2. Technical Assistance
4.       This sub-component includes:
(a)  technical assistance to the MOTC:
(i) one expert for a total of about 2.5 years, to help manage the
national training program; and
(ii) expert services (up to 4.3 man-years in total) to help implement
the sector policy (as it relates to SRT management, tariffs of
public transport, involvement of private operators, etc.), and
prepare new projects.
(b) technical assistance to the Municipality of Tunis; one expert for
about 2 years plus .75 year of short-tern experts to assist in
implementing the traffic and parking management plans;
(c) technical assistance to the Tunis District; for its information
management system (purchase of computer hardware and software and
about 5 man-months of advisory services), to help monitor urban
development in the area and build up analytical planning capability
(para. 5 below); details are in Table 3.
3. Studies
5.       This sub-component includes studies to develop transport plans for
the Greater Tunis and Greater Sfax areas. These studies (for which outline
terms of reference have been written; item D.2 in Project File, Annex 8),
would adopt a year 2000 horizon and concentrate on strategic choices in
highways and public transport development. In the case of Greater Tunis, the
transport study will be used as a vehicle to build up the capability of the
Tunis District to use computer-based transport planning models.
B. FINANCING
6.       In the past, the Goverament of Tunisia has been most able to obtain
financing  from bilateral  (or  other multilateral,  e.g.  UNDP)  sources  for
training and technical assistance.  Since this cones cheaper than financing
from the Bank, as much as possible of the training and technical assistance
program should be supported by such sources.  A list of nine such possible
sources of financing was drawn up: the UNDP, and the assistance programs of



- 67 -
ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 7
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.   Preliminary contacts with seven of these
agencies confirmed that funding should be available; the more readily so, as
some bilateral-assistance programs have already been sensitized by experts and
firms involved in project preparation and whose services Tunisian authorities
would like to see extended. Where new activities will be undertaken (e.g.
assistance to MOTC for policy implementation), there is no bilateral source of
financing identified, and the government and the Bank would have to join
efforts to assume the financing.
7.       The same (as for the new activities referred to above) would go for
the studies (para. 5) to be undertaken under the proposed project.
8.       These  various  sources  of  financing being  mobilized  as presented
above, the cost of training and technical assistance would then be covered as
follows (for detail, see table 5).
