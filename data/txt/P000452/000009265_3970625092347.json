to\n            ensure the efficient delivery of necessary inputs and\n            extension to livestock producers, thus reducing diseases and\n            pasture degradation, increasing livestock production and\n            exports, and improving the standard of living of herders.\n            It will:  (a) strengthen the National Federation of Central\n            African Livestock Producers (FNEC) to further develop its\n            input delivery and pastoral organization and to increase the\n            number of herder associations.  It will also; (b) assist the\n            Livestock Service (LS) in its vaccination campaigns against\n            the main epidemic diseases; the reorganization and\n            strengthening of its extension, research and pastoral\n            settlement activities; and the restructuring of its\n            personnel and financial organization to sustain these\n            activities on a long-term basis. Finally, the project will;\n            (c) rehabilitate feeder roads in the Livestock Communities\n            to improve the herders access to markets; and (d) reinforce\n            management capabilities during project implementation."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
