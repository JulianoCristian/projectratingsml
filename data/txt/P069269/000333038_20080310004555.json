Development Project\n            for Paraguay will continue to support - through a\n            decentralized, participatory and bottom-up development\n            approach - (i) small productive income-generating and\n            community development subprojects for poor communities, and\n            (ii) capacity-building of local institutions and beneficiary\n            organizations in the identification, design and\n            implementation of these activities. The additional financing\n            will support the following three components: (a) Community\n            development sub-projects. Grants for small-scale\n            demand-driven sub-projects prepared and submitted by groups\n            of eligible beneficiaries. sub- projects will include income\n            generating sub-project,  as well as community development\n            sub-projects for activities that will complement productive\n            investments. (b) Capacity-building and institutional\n            development. Strengthen local community's capacity to\n            design, implement and monitor community development\n            activities and to facilitate their participation in overall\n            project implementation. This component will support\n            services, training and organizational development, and the\n            implementation of a participatory monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system. (c) Project management, monitoring and\n            evaluation. Support the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to\n            coordinate the technical and administrative aspects, oversee\n            implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Project,\n            and to carry out specialized studies. These studies will\n            include at least the following: (i) social and economic\n            inclusion; (ii) base line studies; (iii) additional sector\n            specific studies. The main change is an expansion of the\n            scope of the Project, as part of the process of scaling up\n            the poverty impacts, to include an additional five\n            Departments - Caaguazu, Central, Cordillera, Guaira and\n            Paraguari. The additional Departments will expand the\n            project's reach to about 60 percent of the\n            country's overall population, and expand his target\n            population of the project close to 60 percent of the\n            country's population living in extreme poverty (up from\n            the approximately 15 percent of the country's\n            population in extreme poverty targeted under the Ongoing\n            Project). The Mid-Term Evaluation as well as recent social\n            monitoring reviews indicated that the sub-projects funded\n            during the ongoing Project increased beneficiary incomes.\n            Existing data from a recent impact evaluation show\n            substantial changes in outcome variables for participants.\n            There has been a significant improvement in economic\n            variables of participants, compared to non-participants,\n            particularly regarding (i) wellbeing, (ii) employment, and\n            (iii) asset ownership. Other benefits include better\n            participation in schooling, more confidence in community and\n            stronger measures of social capital."}, "docdt": "2008-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
