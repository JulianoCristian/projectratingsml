Some lessons learned\n            included: to be more effective a community-driven\n            development (CDD) approach needs to link income generating\n            activities with efforts to improve social inclusion. The\n            various qualitative and quantitative analyses undertaken\n            demonstrated that the project had tangible economic\n            achievements while staying true to a participatory,\n            bottom-up model. While not without complications in\n            execution, the project's achievements show that\n            bringing beneficiaries and their communities more centrally\n            into development processes will not sacrifice either\n            efficiency or productivity, as some CDD critics assert. It\n            is important to create and maintain simple and accessible\n            social accountability mechanisms to increase the likelihood\n            of long-term project sustainability and build trust among\n            beneficiaries. Such instruments that community members can\n            use to hold managers, decision makers, and the project\n            itself to account, like participatory monitoring and regular\n            web publication of project documents, make project processes\n            transparent, as well as identify areas for improvement. Such\n            systems that clarify resource allocation, make clear\n            participation opportunities, and provide channels for\n            citizen feedback, help achieve development goals as well as\n            build the public's confidence that the Government and\n            its partners can be both inclusive and evenhanded in its\n            provision of services. It is important to build upon\n            existing institutional arrangements and try to strengthen\n            them even if creating new systems from scratch would appear\n            to facilitate project implementation in the short term. For\n            long term viability of income generating development\n            initiatives, it is important to be connected to locally\n            developed systems because such organizational structures,\n            like local development committees, if properly supported,\n            can be a hub that connects public institutions, local\n            government, business, civil society and citizens, and\n            grounds a project in the long run."}, "docdt": "2009-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
