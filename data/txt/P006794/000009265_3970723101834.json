      Colombians living in the poorest areas along the Pacific\n            Coast; (ii) assisting 250 communities with access to piped\n            water supply and to waste disposal; (iii) strengthening the\n            rural water supply subsector through technical assistance to\n            INS, and the preparaion of a National Rural Water Supply\n            Plan; (iv) introducing systemic changes in the organization\n            and provision of health services through decentralization of\n            service delivery and integration of all health activities at\n            the lowest level; and (v) providing a cost-effective service\n            delivery model covering 14% of the population which would be\n            replicable to the entire sector. Achievement of these\n            objectives would be supported by (a) the construction and\n            expansion of health care facilities, water systems and\n            latrines; (b) a training program; (c) the implementation of\n            timely information systems on service statistics and cost\n            data; and (d) a set of policy and research studies. The\n            project is expected to reduce mortality and morbidity of\n            women of childbearing age, infants and children, to increase\n            contraceptive prevalence and make significant changes in the\n            way the health sector is organized and provides services."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
