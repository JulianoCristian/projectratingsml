REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE

ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE

FOR THE
INDUS BASIN PROJECT

REPORT AND RECOMN11DATIOUS OF TIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR TIDE INDUS BASIN PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
development credit to thle Islamic Republic of Pakistan in an amount in various
currencies equivalent to $58.54 million.
PART I - BACKGROUND
2.        At a meeting of the Executive Directors of the Bank held on
March 31, 1964, authorization was given to the Bank to sign the Indus Basin
Development Fund (Supplemental) Agreement, 1964, (No. 1). At this meeting I
made a statement about the importance of this Agreement and the events leading
up to its conclusion. A copy of this statement wras circulated to the
Executive Directors on April 9, 1964, (Sec. M 6h-73). The Supplemental
Agreement was signed by the Government of the United States of America and by
the Bank on March 31, 1964, and becarne effective on April 6, 1964, when it was
signed by the other six Parties - Australia, Canada, Germany., New Zealand,
Pakistan and the United Kingdom.
3.        Section 2.01 of the Supplemental Agreement sets out the additional
contributions to be made to the Indus Basin Development Fund (the Fund) by
each of the Contributing Governments and by the Bank; these amounts were
arrived at by dividing the total additional financing of $315 million in the
same proportions as the previous contributions made by each of the Parties to
the Fund.
4.        Section 2.C4 of the Supplemental Agreement provides that the Bank
share may be covered by a Bank Loan and/or an IDA Credit, "as may be
determined between the Bank and the Association". The shares of all of the
Contributing Governments other than the United States will be provided in the
form of grants,and the share of the United States will be met partly by a
grant and partly by a loan which I am assured will be provided on the most
favorable terms permitted by the United States Congress. I have consistently
urged rnembers of the Consortium to provide aid to Pakistan on as favorable
terms as possible because of Pakistan's heavy burden of external debt. In
the circumstances I recommend that the whole of our supplemental contribution
should be in the form of an IDA Credit.



5.        The Association has already made fourteen credits to Pakistan,
totalling $_79 million. The proposed credit would increase the total of the
Association's credits to Pakistan to $237.5 million.  OP the $179 million of
earlier IDA Credits, six credits totalling $87.5 million were signed recently
and are not yet effectivre. Of the $,91.5 million of effective credits,
$1.8 million had been disbursed on May 31, 1964.  Disbursements are seriously
behind schedule only in the case of the $1 million credit for the Dacca/Demra
Irrigation Project, but this project is now progressing satisfactorily.  For
most other IDA Credits a slow start of disbursements was to be expected since
the projects required further detailed engineering and other preparatory work
before disbursements could be commenced.
6.        The Bank has made twenty loans to Pakistan in the amount of
$361.2 million. The status of these loans on June 30, 1964, was as follows:
$ millions
Total loans, net of cancellations                  361.2      *
of which repaid                                49.7
Total outstanding                                  311.5
Amount sold                  16.6
of which repaid         9.2                     7.4
Net amount held by Bank                            304.1
* Includes $62 million not yet effective.
Of the $299.2 million of effective Bank Loans, $122 million was undisbursed cn
May 31, 1964. Of the undisbursed portion $83.3 million are on account of the
$90 million Indus Basin Loan made in 1960 (Loan No. 266 PAK).
7.        The arrangements contained in the Indus Basin Development Fund
Agreement, 1960, (circulated to the Bank Executive Directors on March 23, 1964,
as Annex 2 to R. 64-31) provide in effect that the AIministrator of the Fund
is to make calls for non-rupee funds upon the various contributors pro rata
on the basis of seimi-annual estimates of expenditures (except in theTcase of
New Zealand and Pakistan whose semi-annual contributions are pre-deterimined),
and that the United States and the Bank may from time to time agree between
themselves as to the ratio between their respective non-rupee loan contri-
butions.  In fact up to now, by agreement between the United States Government
and the Bank, the bulk of the calls on non-rupee loan funds have been met out
of the United States (DLF) $70,000,000 loan which should be fully disbursed
after the next call is made on October 1, 1964. Disbursements on the Bank
Loan No. 266 PAK have been correspondingly slow, as indicated above.



- 3 -
8.        In view of my recommenrdation that the supplemental Bank/IDA
participation in the Fund be in the form of the proposed IDA Credit and after
consu'tation with the United States Governrent as to their wishes and
intentions with respect to their supplemental loan contribution, I recommend
that:
(a) as between the Bank and the Association, future calls by the
Administrator of the Fund on account of the Bank's original and
supplemental contrioutions be met first from the proposed IDA Credit
until it is fully disbursed and thereafter from the Bank Loan
ITo. 266 PAZ, subject to the right of the Bank and the Association to
agree otherwise;
(b) the Bank agree with the United States Government that the present
apportionment continue to apply until the DLF loan has been fully
disbursed, presumably by next October, and thereafter all calls by
the Administrator of the Fund for non-rupee loan funds be met from
the proposed IDk Credit and the Bank Loan iNo. 266 PAK until the
aggregate disbursements from the Bank/IDA loan funds have reached
$88,COO,00o equivalent; this is the amount provided in the Indus
Basin Agreement of 1960 for contributions to the Fund from the $90
million Bank Loan of 1960, the balance of that loan being reserved
for capitialized interest and coimmitment charges. Further calls of
non-rupee loan funds would be apportioned by future agreement between
the Bank and the United States Government or, failing such agreement,
on the basis of the original &C : 70 ratio.
9.        If disbursements proceed in accordance with these recommendations,
it is estimated that the proposed IDA Credit would be fully7 disbursed by about
April 1, 1966.
PART II - DESCRIPTIOIN OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT

Total      34C.9
The preparation of bid documents for these projects is in hand, and all
contracts for the works presently contemplated should have been awarded by
September 1965.



14.       In addition to the costs set out above, $994.4 million equivalent has
been committed by the Fund in respect of remodelling of existing canals and
barrages, services of consulting engineering firms, the Tndus Special Study
and other miscellaneous items.
15.       Execution of the works already under way is proceeding satisfactorily.
The first link canal system, joining the Chenab to the Sutlej River, (the
Trimmu-Sidhnai-Niailsi-Bahawal Link) should be completed on schedule by
March 31, 1965. The Mangla Dam Project, by far the largest undertaking, is a
few months behind schedule, but is expected to be completed about July 1, 1968,
which is one year before the required completion date.
16.       A sched-ule has been set up for the execution of projects for which
contracts have not been let so that all of them may be completed by M4arch 1970,
the end of the Transition Period. It is a reasonable expectation that this
schedule can be met.
17.       Including the cost of land, consulting engineers and other related
services, commitments have nci been made by the Fund for $939.8 million
equivalent, or almost 75 per cent of the estimated cost of the program of
works. Disbursements are averaging just over US$ 100 million equivalent a
year, and up to May 31 of this year, they totalled US$ 377.3 million equiva-
lent, or nearly 30 per cent of the total estimated cost.
18.       Progress on the Special Study of the lWater and Power Resources of
West Pakistan provided for in Section 5.01 of the Supplemental Agreement has
also been satisfactory. The initial phase has been completed providing
information on the present status of the development of water and power
resources of W-fest Pakistan which has enabled the drawing up of detailed terms
of reference for the Study. The Study proper has now commenced, and five firms
of consulting engineers have been appointed by the Administrator of the Fund
to carry out the investigations. Of these, twlo are American, two are British,
and one is Dutch. The first group of experts arrived in Pakistan in May, and
subsequently there has been a rapid build-up of staff. Close liaison with the
Pakistan authorities is being maintained. Dr. Pieter Lieftinck, who is in
charge of the Study has already made several trips to Pakistan.
PART IV - LEGAL MISTRUNEDNTS AND LEGAL AITTHORITY
19.       Attached is a draft Development Credit Agreement between the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Association (No. 4). The draft conforms
generally to the pattern of the Association's Development Credit Agreement and
contains covenants similar to those undertaken by Pakistan under the Loan
Agreement with the Bank of September 19, 1960, for Loan No. 266 PAK.

20.       Attention is drawn to paragraph (g) of Section 1.01 which defines
the project by' reference to thie nrovisions of Sections 4.G1 and h.02 of the
1964 Supplemental Agreement. Under Section 2.03, withdraw7als shall be made
from the Credit Account as and when requested by the Administrator of the Fund
in accordance with the Indus Basin Development Fund Agreement, 196C, to cover
all or part of the Bank's share of the estimated disbursement of the Funid;
the Bank and the Association shall determine by agreemrent at the time of each
request by the Administrator what portion of the Bank's share will be paid out
of the Credit Account and wihat portion will be paid out of the Bank Loan No.
266 PAX.  Also attached is a draft letter (No. 5) from the Bank and the
Association to the Government of Pakistan expressing their agreement for the
time being to disburse first the proposed credit and tiereafter the amounts
still undisbursed of the Bank Loan No. 266 PAX.
21.       The recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V
Section i(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association is attached (No.6).
PART V - COMPLIAN4CE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREE14ENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECO1RIEINDATIONS
23.       I recommend that the Association make available a development credit
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $58.54 million for a term of
fifty years, with a service charge of 3/4 of one per cent per annum, and on
such other terms as are specified in the draft Development Credit Agreemnent,
and that the Executive Directors adopt a Resolution to that effect in the
form attached (No. 7).
