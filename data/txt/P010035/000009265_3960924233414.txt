MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject:     Project Completion Note on Pakistan
Indus Basin Supplemental Credit (Cr. 60-PAK)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Note on Pakistan Indus
Basin Supplemental Credit (Credit 0060-PAK)" prepared by the South Asia Regional Office.
The Credit, approved in 1964 and fully disbursed by 1967, represented the Bank's
share of the 1964 Supplemental Agreement to the Indus Basin Development Fund, co-financed by
Pakistan and seven donors, and which the Bank supported through Loan 266. The Note clarifies why
there is no PCR on this Credit. In 1976, the Region and OED agreed that the report Pakistan--A
Review of the Indus Basin Proiect. 1960-1975 (No. 1122a-PAK) would take the place of a PCR for
Ln. 266 (and by implication for Cr. 60), since it provided a detailed and comprehensive assessment
of the results achieved under the Bank's contribution to the Indus Basin Development Fund. The
Supplemental Credit cannot be evaluated separately from the program to which it contributed, it is
not rated and will not be audited.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
Indus Basin Project, 1964 Supplement Credit
(Credit 60-PAK)
1.          The "Indus Water Treaty 1960", governing the use of the waters of the Indus river
system, was signed in September 1960 by India, Pakistan, and the Bank. Signature of the Treaty
marked the end of a critical and long-standing dispute between India and Pakistan. At the same time,
Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and
the Bank agreed to create an Indus Basin Development Fund of almost US$900 million to finance
the construction of irrigation and other works in Pakistan which would enable the country to use and
develop the share of the Indus waters allocated to it under the Treaty. The Bank's contribution
consisted of a loan of US$90 million (Ln. 266-PAK, Indus Basin Project), including US$10 million
for capitalized interest and other charges not payable to the Fund.
2.          In 1964, a Supplemental Agreement came into force under which Australia, Canada,
Germany, New Zealand, the U.K, the U.S., and the Bank agreed to contribute an additional amount
of US$315 million in foreign exchange for the financing of the Indus Basin works in Pakistan (divided
in the same proportions as the previous contributions). Pakistan undertook to provide the rupees
required to finance local costs not covered by the rupee contributions under the 1960 agreement.
The Supplemental Agreement provided that the Bank's contribution could be a Bank loan or an IDA
credit, or both. The Bank and IDA decided that because of Pakistan's burden of external debt this
contribution should be in the form of an IDA credit. They also decided that future calls by the
Administrator of the Indus Basin Fund on account of the Bank's original and supplemental
contributions would be met first from the IDA credit until it was fully disbursed and thereafter from
Ln. 266-PAK
3.          Credit 60-PAK, in the amount of US$58.54 million, was approved on July 16, 1964,
signed on July 21, 1964, and became effective on September 14, 1964. The Fund Administrator made
the first call for a contribution from the credit in September 1964 (repeated in December). With the
sixth call in June 1967 the credit was fully disbursed, and withdrawals from Ln. 266-PAK resumed in
December 1967.
4.          It quickly became clear that loan disbursements for Ln. 266 (and therefore interest
and other charges) would lag behind original expectations as a result of the 1964 arrangements to
provide the Indus Basin Fund with additional resources, and the 1965 agreement with the United
States on the sequencing of the Bank/IDA and U.S. loan contributions. Revised estimates indicated
that the last disbursement would occur when the last call was made on the balance of the Indus Fund
available to finance the Tarbela Project. Therefore, the Bank decided in mid-1968 to extend the loan
closing date from September 30, 1973, to December 31, 1975 (and the deadline for using the portion
allocated for interest and other charges from April 1, 1968, to October 1, 1970).
5.          A report Pakistan: A Review of the Indus Basin Project. 1960-1975 (No. 1122a-PAK,
April 1976) reviewed achievements towards the original objectives of the Indus Basin Development
Fund Agreement of 1960. The report was prepared by Bank staff and consultants after field visits
in 1975, and incorporated the findings of previous missions, including a review of irrigation and
drainage (Vol. II of a Special Agriculture Sector Review, No. 922a-PAK, 1976), and missions in 1968
and again in 1969/70 to review the Action Program included under Cr. 60, the Supplemental
Agreement. The report concluded that the Indus Basin works have fulfilled their basic replacement



objective (from the diversion of water to India) and provided a very small increment of water, that
the growth in water supply, especially through tubewells, had a significant impact on agricultural
production, and that the increase in power supply had been very cost effective.
6.          Since this report was a comprehensive effort to assess the results achieved under the
Bank contribution to the Indus Basin Project and its Supplemental Credit, management in the Region
and in OED agreed that a PCR would not be prepared for Ln. 266 (memorandum of December 9,
1975). Although the memo does not mention Cr. 60, the Credit provided supplemental funding to
achieve the Indus Basin objectives and cannot be evaluated separately from Ln. 266.
