industrial activities grow in a more\n            environmentally-friendly fashion; 2) help remediate\n            contamination from past mining activities for which the\n            state accepts liability, including remediation activities\n            that help facilitate private investment in the mining\n            sector; and 3) assist in attracting non-project resources\n            for investments which are not eligible for financing under\n            the project in mining communities, in order to address\n            urgent environmental problems, e.g. for potable water and\n            sanitation. The project will include the following\n            components: 1) studies to support the development of the\n            regulatory framework, which will include basic data\n            collection and policy development implementation; 2)\n            laboratory upgrading for the implementation of a program to\n            foster development of credible laboratory testing services\n            in Bolivia; 3) remediation investments, which will be done\n            on a pilot basis and only for those eligible subprojects\n            comprising priority environmental management measures; and\n            4) technical assistance and training to support\n            environmental management in mining."}, "docdt": "1995-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
