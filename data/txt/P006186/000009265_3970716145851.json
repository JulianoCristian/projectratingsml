assessment (EA) of the mining and industrial\n            (manuafacturing) sectors in Bolivia. The EA served as the\n            basis for preparing the proposed Environment, Industry and\n            Mining Project supported by IDA. The project: a) supports\n            the implementation and refinement of a regulatory framework\n            to assure that privately-led mining and industrial\n            activities grow in a more sustainable fashion; and b) help\n            remediate pollution stocks for which the Government will\n            accept environmental liability, including as a result of\n            agreements reached with private investors in the mining and\n            hydrocarbons sectors under the Capitalization Program.\n            Environmental audits for major mining and hydrocarbon\n            properties are either underway or will be commissioned\n            shortly, and are expected to be completed in 1995.\n            Presently, the mining and industrial sectors seem to pose\n            relatively little threat to the primary areas of high\n            ecological sensitivity, although the baseline data is very\n            limited. The most immediate concern is alluvial gold mining\n            in the Amazon. Also, industrial activity in Santa Cruz and\n            Cochabamba are of potential concern because these also drain\n            into the Amazon."}, "docdt": "1995-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
