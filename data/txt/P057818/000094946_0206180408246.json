   development. The project's three main components will:\n            1) continue reforms in the banking sector, including the\n            privatization of the Savings Bank (SvB), and further\n            strengthening of the banking regulation and supervision\n            systems; 2) consolidate, and strengthen the bankruptcy, and\n            debt resolution framework; and, 3) foster reform\n            implementation of the non-bank financial sector, including\n            the development of the regulatory, and supervisory framework\n            for the insurance development, and privatization of the\n            Insurance Institute of Albania (INSIG). While project\n            benefits will far outweigh risks, these remain, namely\n            political, macroeconomic, and capacity constraints. To\n            mitigate such risks, key legislation will be passed prior to\n            Board presentation; steps are being taken under different\n            operations to address the country's energy crisis; in\n            addition, the International Finance Corporation has agreed\n            to proceed with a pre-privatization investment in INSIG,\n            while SvB's privatization is already advanced, which\n            minimizes financial risks. And, while capacity building\n            should not be underestimated, substantial technical\n            assistance is being provided to minimize this risk."}, "docdt": "2002-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
