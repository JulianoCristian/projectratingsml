Lessons learned suggest\n            the following. The provision of timely and sufficient\n            technical assistance (TA) was part of the strategy for the\n            financial sector reform program, which was instrumental in\n            supporting the project preparation and implementation,\n            whose. The early availability of these resources facilitated\n            the design of an operation with strong up-front\n            conditionality, and, also served to reinforce the\n            Government's commitment to the program. The attention\n            paid to project design led to development of a challenging\n            program with realistic outcomes, focusing the program on\n            capacity building and implementation. This focus also proved\n            helpful in keeping the reform program on track, as it\n            facilitated good measurement of achievements over time.\n            Moreover, although synergies can be realized by involving\n            other members of the Bank Group, extra care needs to be\n            taken in project design to avoid real and perceived\n            conflicts of interest: while retaining the Insurance\n            Institute of Albania (INSIG) in the program was important\n            for the overall development of the financial sector, the\n            Bank's options in pursuing conditionality related to\n            INSIG were limited, as a potential conflict of interest\n            could have resulted from IFC's eventual privatization investment."}, "docdt": "2005-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
