Credit and Project Summar
Borrower:          Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
Beneficiary:       National Water Supply and Drainage Board (WDB)
Amount:            SDRs 32.1 million (US$37.0 million equivalent)
Terms:             Standard
Relending Terms:  The Covernment would relend US$21.4 million equivalent of
the credit proceeds to WDB at a 12 percent interest rate,
repayable over 24 years including 2 years of grace, while
US$15.3 million equi,'alent would be made available as
equity.  The Coverment would bear the foreign exchange
risk. (The Government would retain US$0.3 million equiv-
alent to implement the low-cost sanitation component.)
Project:
Description:       The project seeks to improve water supply and sanitation
services, public health and sector management by rehabili-
tating and augmenting water supply, sewerage, sanitation and
drainage systems in the Amparai, Anuradhapura and Colombo
areas, while strengthening WDB's financial management, and
enhancing its operations and maintenance capacity. The
primary benefits expected to accrue to the areas' popula-
tions, about 40 percent of whom fall beLow the poverty
threshold, are improved services, a decrease in waterborne
diseases, savings in health care :osts, improved worker
productivity, and a favorable enviro.nmental impact. The
project faces no special risks, although achieving the
objectives would depend upon a growing capacity for sound
financial management by WDB.

WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
A. SECTOR BACKGkOUND
1.01    Sri Lanka's urb'  population is currently about 3.4 million or 21.5%
of the total population of about 15 million. The growth rate of 2.5% per
annum is low by regional comparisons (e.g., 3.9% for India). Government
projections estimate urban population growth of about 2.4% per year during
1981-91, increasing the urban share to about 23.2%. The slow growth of urban
areas is based on solid achievements. Birth and death rates are lower in Sri
Lanka than in any other country of its income class; welfare, education and
health standards are relatively high and are widely spread. Sri Lanka has
better social indicators than countries with comparable income Levels.
Between 1960-81. Life expectancy at birth increased from 62 to 69 years,
infant mortality rate per thousand declined from 7i to 43 and adult literacy
increased from 7'Z to 85%.  1/ These indicators place Sri Lanka above the
average performance of upper-middle income economies. However, this out-
standing performance has not been maintained in the adequate provision of
water supply and sanitation ser.ices.
1.02    Existing levels of service vary widely in Sri Lanka and consequently
statistical averages may be misleading. The most reliable data obtained from
the 1981 Hou5ing Census indicate that 26% of the urban population received
piped water through house connections and a further 23% used public taps.
The remaining urban population reLied on shallow wells and other water sour-
ces. In rural areas about 2% of the populatior had house connections, 4% used
standpost suppLies and the remainder (representing about 75% of the total
population of Sri Lanka) ob-ained water from wells and other surface sources.
Regarding waste dIsposal facilities, of the total 1981 urban population, some
17% had flush toilets, 65% had other forms of latrine, and 18% had no service
at all. in rural areas 2% had flush toilets, 64% had other forms of latrine,
and 34t had no service. The available data suggest only marginal improve-
ments in service levels in rural areas during 1971-81, while the situation in
urban areas may have deteriorated somewhat.
1/ The average figures for low income economies over the same period are:
life expectancy, 41 and 50; infant mortality rate, 163 and 124; adult
literacy, 23X and 40%.



-2-
1.03    The Government of Sri Lanka (CSL) supports the goals set by the 1976
Habitat Conference and the 1977 United Nations (UN) Conference 1/, to supply
all communities with adequate water and sanitation services by 1990.
However, in 1980, the targets of the International Drinking Water Supply and
Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD) Plan were revised by CSL which limited its objec-
tives to provide adequate water suppiies to 100% of urban and estates popula-
tions and 50% of the rural population by 1990. The remaining 50% of the
rural population would be provided with water during 1991-95. GSL also aims
to provide sanitation facilities to 100% of the national population by 1990.
During 1980-85, CSL invested approximately Rs 5,600 million (US$225 million)
towards capital imporovements in the sector, representing about 5% of the
total national capital expenditure budget. This reLatively high percentage
indicates GSL's commitment to the IDWSSD targets. It is slightly higher than
the percentage allocated to the sector in other countries in South Asia
(e.g., about 4Y in India during 1980-85).
B. SECTOR iNSTITUT IONS
1.04    Responsibilities tor the development and maintenance ot water supply
and sanitation systems rest with various ministries, departments, corpora-
tions, and boards (Annex 1).  'the two most important organizations, espe-
cially in thle iurban areas, are the Nationai Water Supply and Drainage Board
(WDB) and the urban  c-cal authorities.  In the rurat areas, the Ministry of
Health and WDB are The kev organizations.  In .ne estates sector, t1he Sri
Lanka State Planriat ir Corporation and the Janatha Estates Development Board
are the leadirg,  nstitutions.  WDB, the major agency in the sector, accounts
for about ?0".    investments and 90% at operations.
C.  SECTOR DEVFLOPHENT CCONSTRAINTS
1.05    In June 1984, IDA, in close colLaboratron with GSL and WDB, completed
a Water Suppvy and Sanitation Sector Study (Report No. 4190-CE) which iden-
tified major sector development constraints and outlined a strategy to
address them.  To provide adequate levels ot water supply and sanitation
throughout the country, and to meet the 1980 GSL approved IDWSSD Plan
coverage targets (para 1.03), would require significant investment during
1981-1990. The Study indicates that while levels of capital investmerts in
the sector have grown significantly in recent years (WDB's assets increased
from Rs 360 million in 1979 to Rs 3900 million In 1983), the sector continues

to face inadequate financial, managerial and human resources for sustained
long-term viability. Since 1978, there has been an impressive response from
foreign donors to assist GSL in its endeavors to improve service levels.
Hovever, in the past, CSL sometimes embarked on projects without adequate
consideration of priorities, availability of local funding, and future opera-
tion and maintenance costs. In instances, projects were overdesigned and
supervision of construction by technical staff was inadequate. GSL and WDB
have recognized these shortcomings in overall sector management and during
1984 and 1985 have developed the necessary institutional, financial and
operational framework to ensure viability of future sector investments.
1.06    Specific constraints which need to be addressed in formulating a
future sector development strategy are the lack of: (a) adequate institu-
tional and operational capacity of WDB, (b) sufficient recurrent revenues in
the sector as a whoLe, and particularly in WDB, to properly operate and
maintain existing and new investments, (c) available capital funds from local
and foreign sources, and (d) adequate capacit:  ot the local construction
industry. The choice of appropriate technology and service levels also must
be addressed. Extensive use of handpumps in rural areas, and more modest
service levels in the urban areas would be a practical approach for water
supply. Low cost waste disposal systems as developed by the UNDP Global
Project CLO/78/006 would be appropriate for meeting sanitation needs by the
end of the decade. These approaches involve low capital and recurrent costs
for operation and maintenance.
D. SECTOR DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
1.07    The objectives which guide GSL's sector investment strategy include:
(a) institutional development: to improve overall sector management
practices through strengthening the policy, management and
operational framework, particularly of the WDB;
(b) financial strengthening: to adopt and implement realistic
financial and commercial management practices in the sector
and appropriate capital financing plans and pricing policies; and
(c) increased operating efficiency:  to direct investments towards
rehabilitation of existing plant and equipment, increase
utilization of existing systems capacity, improve operations
and maintenance and introduce cost control measures.
1.08    GSL's Public Investment Plan for I985-89 indicates an average annual
capital budget of Rs 1200 million (US$44 million) for investments in the
sector, representing about 4.5% of the total annual capital budget. Backlog
of capital works and additional investments required to satisfy increasing
dema.d and the service coverage targets justify both past and proposed sector
investment levels. In February 1985 GSL formulated its overall sector



-4-
investment  priorities through a ten-year (1986-95) sector Macro  Investment
Plan (MIP) (Annex 2), retlecting 'he above development  obiectives.   The total
size of the MIP is currentiv estimated at Rs 8560 milLi;n  (US$312.0 million).
The annual investmentsi aire based on commitmerit  i on eXi. ing schemes arid
estimates on future priority schemes.   Annual  investments  in the early years
range between Rs  WOO miVlion - 1200 million, i,radualy  reducine t-o about Rs
400 million  in the outcr  years (1994-1995) tor which speicitic  investment
priorities are yet to be tuily identitjed.   The M wi  'll   ue updlated annually

subsidy requirements tor WDB from GSL. To arrest this deteriorating trend,
WDB took several cot rtct ive steps from Januarv 1, 1984 when it introduced a
comprehensive Finaricta1 Recovery Program (FRP). The positive impact of the
FRP has been signiticant :n containing WUB's operating deficits and in laying
the basis for achieving financial viability of the sector (paras 1.16-1.18).

1.15    Furthermore, mainly due to (a) inadequate pricing policies prior to
1984, (b) poor finanLial management practices and (c) weak management (in
contrast with technical/engineering) capacity of WDB, significant improve-
ments in its finances and operating efficiency were not achieved as
originally expected.  The financial position of the Wl;B has been tradition-
ally weak.  WDB is presently in violation of the financial covenant of the
Second project (Cr.  1041-CE) which requires it to meet all operating expen-
ses and depreciation and earn a minimum rate ot return ot 8% on net fixed
assets in oreration in IDA tinanced project areas only.  GSL and WDB have
recognized that to extend, operate and maintain water and sanitation serv-
ices, appropriate pricing and financial management practices must be adopted
and operating efficiency must be improved.  deginnin,, January 1984, WDB
embarked upon a FinanciaL Recovery Program (FRP) to address these problems
and to achieve compliance with the financial covenant under the Second
*roject (Figure 1.1).
i:nancial Recuvery Program
-16    The FRP includes a serie; ot  nterrelated technical, tinancial,
a)erational and administrative measures. with the common objective of improv-

WDB's cash collection covered only aboiut 2% *at Its total expenditures and
about 10% of its operating costs.  BY end 1985, rhese percentages increased
dramatically to about 85% and 140% respectively. Monthly cash collections
have been steadily increasing from less than Rs 2.0 million prior to 1984, to
about Rs 8.0 million in January 1985 and about Rs 20.0 million in August
1985.  Collections reached about 65. .-f hi: ings in 1985, compared to 45% in

1.17    In November 1985, WDB introduced a computerized financial management
system and an improved accounting system, which now provide detailed revenue
and cost information on a quarterly basis tor each of its major individual
schemes (in aggregate totalling about 90% of WDB's production capacity).  To
effectively utilize these newly introduced management tools, WDB has also
taken measures to strengthen its statting by appointing a Finance Manager, a
Commercial Manager and an Assistant Commercial Manager to improve its commer-
cial functions and operating systems and procedures.  Various cost control
measures such as leak detection and repair, are also underway.  In addition,
WDB's senior management is now formulating an incentive program for its
operating staff wherebv emplovees would be rewarded for improved financial
performance of their instalilations.  This program is expected to be intro-
duced by end 1986.
1.18    The cumulative ettect ut these measures have been signiticant.  WDB i
net losses (after depreciatior And interest costs), subsidized bv direct and
indirect GSL grants, which escalated trom about Rs 34 million in 1980 to
about Rs 140 million in 1983, were cJntained at about Rs 125 million in 1984
and Rs 100 million in 1985.  Under the proposed project initiatives through
the FRP would continue to be strenl.hened and, new revenue enhancement and
cost control measures would be introduced (para 2.06). WDB is expected to
eliminate its operating defici-t bY end 1986, and will be able to meet the
financial covenant under the Sec.-nd pro)ject (paras 1.15, 2.10) by 1989.
1.19    There is also a ctlse* '-tkape hetween tne tinance and operations ot
urban local authorities and other goVernrment agencies and those of the W)B.
The Local authorities are s:gnltican't bulk water  isers, who have been con-

because of inadequate riran-al ane inst.tut,unat capacity of the ioca.
authorities.  These tactorc turrtter burden WDBds financial resources and
stretch its management resources and would be gradually corrected under the
pr.,posed project (paras 2.05-2.0b).  Broader institutional and resource
mobilization issues will a'so need to be addressed as necessary factors for
water supply and sanitation sec;or deveilopment.  The Bank Group's Sri Lanka
Urban Sector Report (No. 4640-CE, June 1984), which reviews management and
financial issues ot local governmen's. and the proposed Municipal Managemefit
Project, being processed in parallel, designed to strengthen management and
finances of urban local author;ties, are particularly relevant.

F. RATIONALE FOR CONTINUED IDA SUPPORT
1.20    GSL and WDB have demonstrated their seriousness of purpose in improv-
ing management, finances and operations of the sector by adopting and
implementing various policy and procedural reforms as described above. Con-
tinued IDA support for the sector investment program will further contribute
towards the achievement of key sector objectives: improved financial perfor-
mance, better operation and mainterance of facilities, and improved project
implementation capability of WDB.  _xperience gained in the First and Second
projects and the sector work undertaken recently will also provide the basis
for our continuing involvement. During the investment program formulation
the following have been already achieved: (a) the adoption of appropriate
service levels and options; (b) the design of least cost systems; (c)
improvements in WDB performance in maintaininp, distribution svste-s and
reducing waste; and (d) improved rinancial performance of WDB.
G. THE URBAN WATER SUPPLY ANI) SANITAF!' 'NVESTMENT PROGRAM
1.21    In identifying and appraising rhe pr-'pcsed *roj ect, a ten year
(1986-95) Urban Water Supply and Sanitat inn in.v,rtment Program was formulated
in detail, keeping with the priorities set  crt In the MIP (paras 1.09-1.10).
This Program has been subjected to a consistent se; ot appraisal criteria
agreed with IDA.  WDB-level tinancing plans har.e been based on the nature of
specific projects (irrespective of their f unding sonirce), and on overall
tinancial and operational targets for the WD8's entire operations. The total
size of the Program is flexible, sub ect t,O tne availability of GSL and donor
resources.  The Program amounts to about US$155.0 million.  The underlying
financial principle (paras 2.08, 2.09) determinling *he size and content of
the Program, would require WDB to take all necessary measures to improve
operating efficiency and to generate adequate revenues to cover all opera-
tions, maintenance and working capital requirements by 1987, and by 1989 also
to meet debt service or depreciation, whichever is higher.
1.22    The proposed Program is to be executed during 1986-95.  The principal
elements are illustrated in Maps IBRD 19498, 19499, 19500, 19501, 19502; and
described in Annex 3. The Program includes: (a) rehabilitation, extension
and improvement of water service facilities in and around Colombo, (b) exten-
sions to sewerage system in greater Colombo area, (c) storm water drainage in
Colombo and a study of the maintenance and rehabilitation requirements of the
overall canal and drainage conveyance system, (d) rehabilitation of a tumber
of water supply schemes in areas other than Colombo, (e) on site sanitation
facilities in Colombo and elsewhere and improved surface drainage and paving
in areas which cannot economically be served by water-borne sewerage systems,
(f) leak detection and waste control programs and improvements in WDB's
operational efficiency, and (g) technical assistance to support WDB's
institutional development efforts.



-10-
H. DONOR SUPPORT
1.23    To help finance the Program, CSL has sought the support of various
external aid agencies. To implement necessary institutional improvements,
GSL has recently received funding from the United States Agency for Interna-
tional Development (USAID) for a five-year Technical Assistance project to
assist WDB in strengthening (a) investment planning and programming, (b)
financial and accounting practices, (c) operations and maintenance, (d)
commercial operations, (e) water quality control, and (f) health education
and community development efforts. This project, which commenced from April
1, 1985, will reinforce GSL's efforts in improving sector management. Given
the commonality of interest between the USAID project and IDA's sector assis-
tance objectives, there has been and continues to be close liaison between
IDA and USAID project staff. The respective IDA and USAID financed projects
would be mutually supportive, complementary and pursue a common underLying
sector development strategy. GSL has also requested the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) for a credit of US$30.0 million equivalent towards financing
discrete components of the Program. ADB would support rehabilitation of
water supply systems in five towns outside the greater Colombo area.
1. FINANCING OF THE lNVESTMENT PROGRAM
1.24    WDB's investment Program in urban areas of about Rs 4250 million
(US$155.0 million) during 1986-95 is expected to be financed as follows
assuming that about 65% of costs (net of ducies and taxes) are financed by
donors:
(in millions)
GSL Funds          Donor Funds           Total
Rs      US$        Rs        US$       Rs        US$
IDA Supported Project       761.0   27.8       1014.0   37.0        1775.0   64.8

1.25    The above financing plan indicates the need for obtaining an addi-
tional Rs 674 million (US$24.6 million) from external sources to finance the
entire Program. The financing plan reflects maximum GSL counterpart fund
availability, and the shortfall will eventually need to be met by external
aid agencies. GSL is actively exploring additional financing from aid agen-
cies for this purpose.

C.  PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
2.03    T'otal project cost is US$b4.8 mi lion, including US$5.2 million for
physical contingencies, US$16.3 million tor price contingencies, and US$7.8
million for duties and taxes (Tabile 2.1). Costs are based on WDB's and its
consultants' estimates (adjusted to December 1985 base) prepared after the
completion of the preliminary design. of the major project components. The
base costs reflect WDB's experience of the ongoing Second Sri Lanka Water
Supply and Sewerage Project and other similar recent projects. The following
physical contingency factors have been used: 10% for water supply and
sewerage equipment and works at Colombo and Colombo storm drainage exten-
sions, 15% for rehabiLitation equipment and works outside Colombo because of
the greater degree of uncertainty of these components, and 10% for consult-
ancy services. Total physical contingencies represent about 12% of base
costs. To provide for inflation during project implementation the following
price escalation rates have been used: for local expenditures, 10% for 1986
and 1987, 9% for 1988, 8% for 1989, 7.6% for 1990 and 4.5% for 1991 and
thereafter; for foreign expenditures 7% in 1986 and 1987, 7.5% in 1988, 7.7%
in 1989, 7.6% in 1990, and 4.5% for 1991 and onwards.

In aggregate, totaL project costs would be financed as foLlows: about 33%
amounting to Rs 585 milLion (US$21.4 million) as loan, and about 66% amount-
ing to Rs 1175 million (US$42.8 million) as grant to WDB tor water supply
schemes. About 1% of total project costs, amounting to Rs 15.0 million
(US$0.6 million) wiLl be passed on as grant by CSI. to the Common Amenities
Board for implementation of the Low-cost sanitation component. The loan
would be for 24 years at 12% per annum (compared to 9% under the Second
project), with a grace period of two years for repayment of principal and
capitalized interest. Assurances to this effect were obtained at nego-
tiations (para 2.09).
D.  WDB'S FINANCE AND OPERATIONS
2.05    WDB's financial position and improvements which are being achieved
under the FRP, are described in detail in paras 1.16-}.18. rable 2.2 sum-
marizes salient features of WDB's past financial pertormance and prospects
for the future. Detailed financial projections, including Income and Expen-
diture Statement (1985-95), Sources and Applications ot Funds (1985-95) and
the underlying assumptions are included in Annexes 6, 7 and 8 respectively.
Due to lack of reliable engineering records and valuation information, fixed
assets information cannot be accurately established at present. Conse-
quently, no balance sheet has been provided. WDB is in the process ot
preparing a fixed asset register and updating its engineering records and a
reliable balance sheet will be prepared by December 31, 1989. WDB is operat-
ing in a deficit situation, relying on GSL subsidies to meet operating short-
falls. The present poor financial position is a reflection of cumulative
effects of inadequate financial, management and operating practices in the
1970's and early 1980's. The fundamental problem of WDB's finances cannot be
resolved by revision of tariffs alone, but more importantly immediate atten-
tion is given to improve WDB's operating efficiency and commercial management
practices. Priority attention is being given towards repair of a large
number of faulty meters and rectification of illegal connections and large
numbers (currently about 10,000) of billing complaints. By far the greatest
financial problem (Table 2.2) being faced by WDB is inadequate cash flow to
cover operations snd maintenance requirements. To address this problem,
WDB's improved billing, collection, arrears management and cost control
measures are having a positive impact (Figure 1.1). A phased program has
bean prepared and agreed to settle all outstanding dues to WDB from the ULAs

by 198Q. All ULAs are now remaining current in their monthly payments to
WDB. WDB has signed agreements with 3 latgest defaulting ULAs on a phased
payment program to recover arrears and negotiations are under way with the
remaining ULAS. In addition, efforts under the ongoing UNDP financed/IDA
executed project, to be followed up by the proposed Municipal Management
Project, aimed at improving finances of the UlAs, wiLL directly assist ULAs
to meet their financial obligations. These and other continuing initiatives
under the FRP (Fig. 1.1) will ensure continued improvement in WDB's finan-
ces.
2.06    The tulL impact ot the FRP will be felt bY WGB when it becomes fully
up-to-date in biLlings, criticallv analyses its receivables portfolio and
writes otf bad debts not likelv t be recovered. In essence, 1986 would be a
year to "clean up" the books.  There ha-) Been a marked reduction in WDB's
reLiance on GSL subsidy in the rucent years.  "SL', subsidies decLinied lrom
about Rs 140 miLliorn In 1983 to Rs 1',5 -nl! !n in 1984 and about Rs 100
million in 1985, representin.e _36_, 84'. and 4?"' ot its operations and main-
tenance costs respectively tjr each .t  hese years.  By 1986, WDB will be
able to generate adequate tuldau, t. eiirnata  is operating deticits. However,
from 1986, WDB will continu,e tO reCeive specitic CSI. contributions for cover-
ing operations and maintenaore costs tr r               -er,vcos 'kich as s(eweratge and rural
water systems, tor which it dces not have diri-ct revenue venerati1ng
authority.  During project implementation WDB will e radUaly handover opera-
tions and maintenance responsibilities tor local water supplv and sewerage
distribution systems to respective ;cal auit.horit i s.  WDB has already com-
menced a technical assistance and tra nin.' t)rogram to help the Local
authorities to take or thesp: tuncrin,ns.    hough  hese measures, WDB's
dependence or GSL subsidy wi'l  he ;r-a. r    v eLiminated towards completion of
the project.  Although WDRB wi  r   ' n. e t,, ;hcw rnet "accounring" loss (atter
depreciatinn and interest), trtom 1987    w.L begin to generate operating
surpluses, contriburing prugressi1slv towards aebt service.  WDB's debt
service coverage (in the past .t  this r,t repaid any debL service obligations)
will improve prcgressiveiv fr-om 1987 (40% cOsverage) to full coverage by 1989
(104% coverage).  Although the immediate emphasis is on eliminating WDB's
operating deficits and to gradually start ouiLding surpluses, real tariff
increases of about 10% (over and above inflar;on rates) will be needed in
1987 and 1988. Thereafter, annual increases will. be needed to at least keep
pace with increasing cost of operation,.  Under the proposed project WDB
would undertake a review of its tariffs (to be completed by end 1986) to
implement a more tational tarif'f struc'iire f'rom 1987.
2.07    The many technical, institutional and financial actions which will
need to be taken during project implementation to achieve the overall. Linan-
cial objectives, are included in an Operational Action Plan (Annex 16 and
para 2.26).  Key actions are (Action # correspond to those in Annex  16):
(a) WDB will undertake a system control study of Colombo's water supply
and transmission systems  j imcnrove system efficiency and reduce



-18-
costs of operations (Action #18);
(b) WDB will evaluate the economics of recycling wastewater from water
treatment plants (Action #22);
(c) WDB will implement a leak detection and repair program (Action #25);
(u) WDB will undertake a review of investment priorities, institutional
arrangements and financial practices to be adopted in rural water
supply and sanitation (Action #30);
(e) WDB will formulate a financial incentive scheme for its regional
management, linked to better performance at the operating level
(Action p42);
(f) WDB will gradualLy hand over operations and maintenance
responsibiLities for sewerage operations to urban local authorities
(Action ;t43); and
(g) CSL will introduce procedures to control indiscriminate private
extraction of grou:.dwater (Action #45).
E. FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
2.08    OveraLL financiaL objectives would apply to WDB's total operations
and investment program, of which the project is a part. WDB will take neces-
sary measures so that operationaL efficiencies are achieved and adequate
funds are generated to cover opprations and maintenance costs, debt service
or depreciation, whichever is higher, and working capital requirements for
its ovorall operations. These measures will involve continuing progress with
the FRP and will include timely adjustments to tariffs, improved billing and
co.Lection, improved processing of compLaints and reductions in the size of
bad and doubtful debts, focussing initially on the larger non-domestic con-
sumers. WDB wilL continue to increase water sales through an active consumer
connections program, enhanced by publicity and connections incentive schemes,
and will improve its operating efficiency throuyh various cost control
measures.
2.09    WDB will not be able to meet the above financial objectives
(para 2.08) with immediate effect. However, there would be progressive
improvement so that the requirement will oe met by 1989. Assurances were
obtained that GSL will provide specific budgetary support annually to WDB
towards making cash shortfall to cover debt service payments; the specific
amounts of budgetary allocations to be agreed in advance when the annual
budget is set. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that WDB will take
all necessary measures to improve operational efficiency and generate ade-
quate funds to (a) cover operations, maintenance and working capital require-
ments from 1987 onwards and (b) also cover debt service or depreciation,
whichever is hibher, from 1989 onwards. Assurances were obtained at nego-
tiations that CSL will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with WDB
indicating that WDB will adopt the following general financial principles for
its investments, irrespective of underlying funding sources, such that in
aggregate:



-19-
(a) urban water supply programs would be financed on a mixture of
50% grants and 50% loans from GSL,
(b) sewerage investments would be financed by 100% GSL grants,
(c) rural piped systems would be financed by a mixture of loans
and grants, normally on a 15% loan and 85% grant basis from GSL,
(d) rural non-piped systems would be financed by 100% CSL grants,
(e) technical assistance expenditures would be financed by 100% GSL
grants, and
(f) the GSL loan component will be at 12% per annum interest rate
payable over 24 years on the basis of an equal annual repayment of
principal and interest.
2.10    An exact rate of return assessment for WDB is not feasible, given
the current absence of reliable fixed asset valuations in the baLance sheet.
However, rough estimates suggest that the financial objectives for WDB's
total operations would be equivalent to a financial rate of return of about
3%-5% on revalued fixed assets by 1989. Analysis of WDB's operations indi-
cate that the rate of return for its operations in the greater Colombo area
is expected to be around 8Z-10% on revalued net fixed assets (the rate of
return would be correspondingly lower for operations in other parts of Sri
Lanka, reflecting the generally more rural nature of these operations). Hence
the financial objectives and related covenant under the proposed project
would satisfy the existing covenant under the Second project (Cr. 1041-CE)
by 1989, while also addressing the need for sector-wide financial improvement
and discipline.
F. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Status of Project Preparation
2.11    WDB and its consultants have completed preliminary engineering
designs and cost estimates for the major components of the investment
program. All major contracts have been identified and detailed designs and
tender documents for priority components are at an advanced stage of prepara-
tion. The Bank financed components, contracts and cost estimates are listed
in Annex 5. Additional consultants are to be appointed by May 1986 to sup-
port WDB's design teams to expedite preparation of tender documents for
priority works. WDB plans to award contracts for priority storm drainage
works by September 1986 and for other works shortly thereafter. Prequalifica-
tion of firms is already under way for major contracts. Retroactive financing
from December 1, 1985, not exceeding US$285,000 is included for project
related expenditures for consulting services for (a) the preparation of
detailed designs; (b) preparation of tender documents; and (c) evaluation of
contractors' prequalification for major contracts.

Colombo Seierage
2.12    Completion of two ongoing contracts for ocean outtalls and major
sewage pump stations, financed by the Saudi Fund for Developmetnt (SFD), are
essential for the full utilization of investments made under Cr. 1041-CE.
Assurances from GSL were obtained during negotiations to ensure the timely
completion of these contracts.
Land Acquisition
2.13    Land acquisition will not present major problems on this project
since the major emph.sis of the project is on the rehabilitation ot existing
facilities and most of the required land is owned by WDB.  CSB brnu.wht to
negotiations satisfactory evidence that outstanding land purchase arrange-
ments have been satistactorily completed.
ImpLementing Agencies
2.14    The principal agencies active in the 3ectcr and rhoir   -wrer-- lat ion
are given in Annex 1.  WDB is the key implementing agency.  'he L.ow- )st
sanitation component will be executed by the Commotn Amenit i'X Ko ard under the
auspices of the Urban Development Authority.  Annrex 10 tn:(arIs  r he
organization chart of WDB.
2.15    The project would be within WDB's implementat ion capacl V.  In 1989,
the peak year for expenditure, the proiect wou.d represent ahout  72% of WDB's
total investments at a level no higher than have been historicai ly achieved.
WDB has amply demonstrated its capability to design and manage the implemen-
tation of major works under the first and second IDA tinanced projects.
WDB's design and Pro ject management capabi'iity wilh be turtther strengthened
under the proposed project through consultant assistance supporting WDB's
design and implementation supervision teams.  The design 1)t certain discrete
components is also being undertaken by local and internationaL consulting
consortia.
2.16    The Common Amenities Board (CAB) currently undertakes a rolling
program of sanitation rehabilitation and improvements in government owned and
private sector 'slum gardens'.  CAB would implement the low-cost sanitation
component under this project.
Procurement
2.17    Procurement arrangements are summarized in Annex ;1.  All major
equipment supply and civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines,
with the exception of contracts referred in para 2.19 below. Consultan! y
services would be recruited in accordance with IDA guidelines.  In evaluating
the bids for equipment and materials, local manufacturers participa,.ing in



-21-
international bidding would be given a preferential margin equal to 15% of
the c.i.f. costs ot the competing imports, or the existing rate of customs
duty, whichever is lower.  A preferential margin of 7 1/2% would be allowed
for local ^ontractors in evaluating civil works bids.  It is likely that most
if not all of the ccntraLcts ror equipment and materials supply and major
contracts for civil works; wnuld he won by foreign contractors or local firms
in collaboracion witt turei.'n partners in view of lack of local expertise.

-22-
2.23    The proceeds of the proposed credit of US$37.0 million would be
disbursed over approximately nine years. Ar. estimated disbursement schedule
is shown at Annex 14 and the amounts of disbursement by category is given in
Annex 15.
2.24    Disbursements would be made as follows:
(a)  Civil works (including construction materials), 32%;
(b)  equipment, vehicles and materials;
(i) directly imported, iOO% ot foreign expenditure;
(ii) localLy manufactured, 100% ot local expenditure,
ex-factorv procured by international bidding; and
(1iL) locaLly procured bOt;
(c)  con i>il -ants' servicesi, site investigation and training, 100%.
Disbursements tur small civL1 works co)ntracts tor less than equivalent of
US$20,000 each, force account worKs, and small locally procured items would
be made ag.ainst statements ot expenditure (SOE), certified by WDB. Supporting
do,,cumentation tor items disbursed againsc SOEs would be retained by WDB and
made available for [L)A review ipun request. All other items would be fully
documented. A retroactive tinancing ot US$285,000 is included to cover start
'pt cost !t consultants' serv ices.
2.25    A Special Account ot US$2.3 mil'ion is proposed for the Project
representing about tour months ot estimated !DA tinanced expenditures.
Assurances were obtained at negottations to this effect. The Special Account
would be replenished based on the required documentation for eligible reim-
bursemen' expenditures and would be operated in accordance with terms and
condotions satistactory to IDA.  The Special Account would be audited in
accordance with standard IDA requirements.
Operational Action Plan
2.26    A number of interrelated project activities would be undertaken by
WDB with a commrn aim to improve its operating efficiency and financial
viability. Because of their importance, these activities have been grouped
intG an Operational Action Plan and included at Annex 16. The components of
this plan were discussed during project appraisal and the timing of their
implementation was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that progress on this plan would be reported in
WDB's normal quarterly reports and that the plan would be annually reviewed
and updated in a manner satisfactory to IDA.



-23-
Project Reporting and Supervision
2.27    The project will be monitored by performance and program indicators
to aid WDB in controlling and developing the efficiency of its operations.
The monitoring criteria are set out in Annex 17 and assurances were obtained
at negotiations that such information would be reported to the Bank for
review within six months of the end of each quarter. WDB would continue to
report to the Bank for about five years after project completion, and would
be responsible for preparation of the project completion report. It is
estimated that about 90 staff-weeks of IDA supervision would be required
during the implementation ot the project.
Accounts and Audits
2.28    WDB will provide annual audited financial statements on its total
operations, including supplementary intormation on separate project accounts.
Audits will be conducted by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Audit
reports would include a management report on internal control, income and
expenditure statement, sources and uses of funds and balance sheet. These
reports will be submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of each fiscal
year. In addition, when IDA reimbursements are requested through Statement
of Expenditures (SOE), independent auditors, acceptable to IDA, will annually
certify that underlying data fully support these requests. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that WDB will follow these audit practices.
C. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Health Benefits and Environmental Impact
2.29    Benefits from improved potable water supply and sewerage cannot be
easily quantified. Sri Lanka has a relatively high incidence of water borne
diseases such as typhoid, hepatitis and diarrhea; about 40% of hospital beds
are occupied by patients with these diseases. Improvements in health arising
from water supply improvements have a direct economic impact in so far as the
workforce will be more productive. There would be savings in health care
costs. Favorable environmental impacts would also arise from enhanced sewage
disposal capability in the Greater Colombo area, and from selective improve-
ments in drainage in Colombo at times of flooding.
Benefits for the Urban Poor
2.30    Sri Lanka has an equitable income distribution by comparison with
other countries of corresponling per capita GNP. The urban poverty thrpshold
for Sri Lanka is US$136 or approximately Rs 3,700 per capita per annum.
Social surveys conducted in the principal areas covered by the proposed
project have ascertained the household incomes of the population. Overall,



-24-
some 40Z of the project area population have incomes below the poverty
threshold.  It is estimated that about 35% of project cost would directly
benefit the poor.  The urban poor will also benefit indirectly from general
improvements in the quality, pressure and distribution of water supply at
standpost outlets, drainage and low cost sanitation investments.
Least Cost Solutions
2.31    The engineering feasibility studies have examined alternative options
including careful examination of potential sources, transmission methods and
utilization within the rontexts ot the established networks.  Designs have
been reviewed to ensure least cost solutions, including the most economic
network configuration, sizes, and priorities for upgrading.  Pret'erred
programming of works have been arrived at in order to S           DLt WDb'S implementa-
tion capability.
Economic Analysis
2.32    An economic anaLysis (Arnex 18) has t)eer: )ert.'rmed on the water
supply components of the proposed pro lect "s"no i!crcmeniaL revenues, incLud-
ing revenues which would have otherwise been  iosL lt the systems were not
rehabilitated.  Revenues have been used as the surrogace me:asure ot benefits.
Incremental operation and mainternance casts were derived from the technical
feasibility reports and have been adjusted for a 2°' per annum real efficiency
improvement over the period 1986-2000.  Revenues have been obtained from the
linancial analysis, and retlect a 10  real increase In taritts in years 1987
and 1988.  Thereatter it has been assumed that there w.l  be a 1% per annum
real increase ;n gross revenues *o retlect increas;ng consumption,. in addi-
tion to annuai tariff adjustments to kee? up with projected intl.ation uf
costs.  The analysis was pertormed in c nscant (r 985) prces tor 1985 - 2005.
2.33    The water supply comporent of ;he pro jecc , representIng about 60% of
total project costs, realizes an economlc rate of return (ERR) ot 12% at
market labo- rates.  with shadow labor rates ot 70% of market rates, the ERR
rises to 16Z.  These ERR's are consistent with expected benefits, bearing in
mind that the project focuses primarily on the rehabilitation and augmenta-
tion of existing water supply facilities.  In addition, the calculated ERRs
do not capture unquantifiable benefits such as health improvements.
2.34    The average incremental cost (AIC) of water under the project ranges
from Rs 2.2 to Rs 2.8 per 1,000 liters, using market and shadow labor prices,
and discount rates between 10% and 16% to represent the opportunity cost of
capital.  The i)resent WDB tariff structure has metered rates of Rs  1.0-5.5
per 1,000 liters for domestic consumers and Rs 5.5-15 per 1,000 liters for
commercial and tndustriai users.  Overall, the present average tariff amounts
to about Rs 3.4 per 1,000 liters which compares favorably with the range of
AICs and average cost of production and supply of aboutr Rs 2.5 per 1,000
liters.



-25-
Affordability
2.35    Part of the technical feasibility and socio-economic survey work was
designed to throw light on likely levels of take-up of new and improved
supplies given existing and projected ability and willingness to pay. Average
monthly household bill for water supply will range between Rs 70-Rs 90. The
affordability analyses indicate that the consumer household expenditures for
water supply and sewerage will be in the average about 3X of total household
expenditures, after real tariff increases have been implemented to achieve
WDB's financial targets (para 2.06).  This percentage is within the generally
accepted range for affordability.
Risks and Safeguards
2.36    This project is well within the technical and administrative
capahility of WDB.  The project involves conventional technology concentrat-
ing on rehabilitation and augmentation ot existing tacilities.  The project
largely consists of upgrading existing networks.  New facilities will be
provided in accessible locations with well known and understood ground coridi-
tions.
2.37    The principal risks are related to the financial health and the
financial management practices ot WDB. WDB's ability to secure revenues to
ensure satisfactory operation and maintenance would be critical to the
viability of the investment program.  The FRP is making good progress, bt
needs to be closely mornitored and further refined.  The on-going USAID tech-
nical assistance project will also strengther financial management of WDB.
There is a commitment within GSI. to turn WDB around and to make it an
organization which has a reduced call on the national budget to cover operat-
ing deficits, and eveiitually no deficit at all.  The signs are positive that
there will be significant improvements in WDB performance but persistent
monitoring and management actions wiLl be required throughout the implementa-
tion of tne program to ensure that these expectations are realized.
Ill. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
3.01    The foLlowing principal agreements were reached at negotiations:
(i)   WDB will take all measures as necessary to covet its opera-
tions, maintenance and working capital requirements from FY
1987, and also cover its debt service or depreciation,
whichever is higher, from FY 1989 onwards (para 2.09).
(ii)  GSL will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with WDB to
comply with the .inancial arrangements and terms for financing
the investment program as specified (pazas 2.04 and 2.09).



-26-
(iii) GSL will take all necessary measures, satisfactory to IDA, to
complete the Colombo sewage ocean outfall and pump station
contracts (para 2.12).
(iv) GSL will open a Special Account (para 2.25).
(v)   GSL and WDB will discuss and review progress on the implementa-
tion of an agreed Operational Action Plan satisfactory to IDA
to improve operational, institutional and financial performance
and to enable GSL and WDB to comply with the agreed targets.
The Action Plan would be reviewed and updated annually between
GSL, WDB and IDA (para 2.26).
(vi) WDB will submit, within six months from the end of each
quarter, performance and program measurements according to
agreed monitoring criteria (para 2.27).
(vii) WDB's accounts will be audited annually by auditors satisfac-
tory to IDA and audit reports wilL be forwarded to IDA within
nine months of the end of WDB's fiscal year (para 2.28).
3.02    Retroactive financing from December 1, 1985, not exceeding US$285,000
is recoitnended for project related expenditures for consulting services
(para 2.11).
3.03    Condition of credit effectiveness would be the signing of a sub-
sidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to IDA, between GSL and WDB.
3.04    The proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$37.0 million
to CSL, on standard terms.

SRI LANKA
WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS
The following organizations are active in the sector:
National Water Supply and Drainage Board (WDB)
1.      WDB is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Local Government,
Housing and Construction (MLGHC). It was formed in 1975 out of the Depart-
ment of Water Supply and Drainage. WDB is the leading institution in the
development of all urban and rural-piped water supply schemes, urban sewerage
schemes, and rural non-piped water supplies based on drilled wells. The
distribution and operation aspects of a large proportion of schemes have been
the responsibility of the local authorities, although WDB has been assuming
increasing operational responsibilities in recent years. However, in the
long term, operation and maintenance would devolve again to the local govern-
ments when these authorities have developed adequate financial, technical and
institutional capability. (One of the objects of the Municipal Management
Project.) Meanwhile it is anticipated that WDB s.ill continue with a major
role in this function. WDB has separate units for planning and designs,
project implementation, groundwater development, and training. Operation-
ally, WDB is divided into eight regions with the WDB headquarters at Rat-
malana, near Colombo; the eight regions are administered by Regional ManaRer'
whose offices are located in the field. Historically, the regional otfice),
had only minimal capabilities f - field investigations, project design, and
logistical supply, almost all functional support and decision making was
centralized at headquarters. However, in line with GSL sector objectives,
WDB is devolving more autonomy to the regions which are being strengthened
administratively and supported by the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) Technical Assistance project which commenced in April
1985 to assist the sector and particularly WDB in strengthening (a) invest-
ment planning and programming, (b) financial and accounting practices, (c)
operations and maintenance, (d) commercial activities, (e) water quality
control, and (f) health education and community development efforts. The
Board is headed by a chairman and exe-utive responsibilities are held by a
General Manager. An Organization Chart of WDB is given in Annex 10.
Department of Local Government
2.      Local authorities receive administrative and technical assistance
from the Department of Local Government. Headed by a Commissioner who
reports to MLGHC, the Department provides the administrative channel through
which technical and financial aid is made available to Municipal, Urban, and
District Councils for water supply and sewerage development. In the rural
areas, the Assistant Commissioner for Local Government, who is located at t>
district headquarters, is the direct link between the staff to assist with
minor water supply and sanitation efforts.



-28-
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4
District Development Councils (DDC)
3.      In general, DDCs are responsible for establishing and maintaining
water supplies and sanitation facilities. The DDCs usualLy obtain S0% (or
more) grant funding for water schemes from the Local Loans and Development
Fund. WDB designs and constructs piped schemes and depending on circumstan-
ces, either WDB or the DDC handles operation and maintenance. The respon-
sibility for collecting water rates to pay for production and operating costs
will generally rest with whichever authority is responsible for the distribu-
tion of the water to the consumer. Non-piped community water supplies are
free, and the DDC retains full responsibility for any necessary maintenance.
DDCs sometimes will contract with WDB for maintenance and repair services
which they themselves cannot provide.
Department of Buildings; Division of Public Health Engineering
4.      This organization designs and constructs water supply and sewerage
schemes for hospitals and other Covernment o(ttice-;.  't is located at MLGHC.
Local Loans and Development Fund
5.      Also located within the MLGHC, the? Locai Tlans and Development Fund
provides loans of 50% to 100% of capital costs -o local authorities for water
supply schemes.
Common Amenities Board
6.      The Common Amenities Board is headed by a Chairman who reports to the
MLGHC through the Urban Development Authority (UDA). This Board is respon-
sible for the provision of water supply and sanitation facilities to "vested"
gardens as well as to slums and shanties in urban areas.
Department of Public Health Services; Office of Environmental and
Occupational Health
7.      The Office of Environmentai an' Occupational Health is w:thin the
Ministry of Health. It is responsible for the promotion of urban and rural
sanitation programs and for various health education activities. It also
monitors some piped and non-piped water supplies. National Programs for
bucket latrine conversions and water seal latrine construction are carried
out under grants to individuals and with technical advice from Public Health
Inspectors.

Water Resources Board
8.      The Water Resources Board was originally intended to provide advice
on all matters concerning the country's water resources, but in 1977 its
powers were redefined to include responsibilities for investigation and
exploitation of groundwater and wastewater management. Now located within
the Ministry of Lands and Land Development, the Board functions solely as a
groundwater investigation and data collection unit. In this capacity, and in
collaboration with foreign aid agencies, it has become increasingly involved
in integrated rural development projects and groundwater resources studies.
Together with information gained from the WDB groundwater programs, these
will eventually provide basic information for the compilation of regional
hydro-geological maps.
Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC)
9.      Headed by Chairman who reports to the Minister for State Plantations,
SLSPC is responsible for the development. operation, and control of all water
supply and sanitation facilities on the plantations under its jurisdiction.
SLSPC recently decentralized control to four regional boards which determine
their own development and operational program. WDB has a supervisory respon-
sibility for water supply development on SLSPC plantations.
Janatha Estates Development Board (jEDB)
10.     JEDB is headed by . Chairman who reports to the Minister for Janatha
Estates Development. The structure and operation of JEDB are similar to the
structure and operation of SLSPC. As in the case of SLSPC, JEDB has four
autonomous regional boards, and independent estate superintendents. WDB has
a supervisory responsiblity for water supply development on Janatha estates.
Mahaweli Development Board (MDB)
11.     MDB is headed by a Chairman who reports to the Minister for Mahaweli
Development. MDB is responsible for a multi-faceted program of agricultural
development and resettlement in the Dry Zone. Under this program 900,000
acres will be developed and 220,000 farming families resettled. Very little
water supply and sanitation work has been undertaken by MDB to date. The
main efforts in the Mahaweli area have been undertaken by UNICEF, WDB, and
the Ministry of Health.
Greater Colombo Economic Commission
12.     This is an autonomous body which, with the assistance of WDB,
provides water supply and sewerage services to the Free Trade Zone north of
Colombo.

13.     This body is under the auspices of the Ministry of Lands and has as
its objective the priority allocation of water resources throughout Sri
Lanka.
Storm Drainage Provisions
14.     Four organizations are actively engaged in the provision of surface
drainage facilities in the Greater Colombo Municipal Area. These are:
(1)  The National Water Supply and Drainage Board - design and
implementation,
(2)  Colombo Municipal Corporation - operation and maintenance,
(3)  Ministry of Highways - road drainage and maintenance, and
(4)  Land Reclamation Development Corporation - canal maintenance
and tlood control.
The Land Reclamation Development Corporation comes under the purview of the
Ministry of Lands; the other agencies operate under the MLGHC. To meet the
clear need for closer coordination of these activities, GSL has appointed the
Urban Development Authority (UDA) to chair a coordinating steering committee
on stormwater drainage while retaining the existing roles of various
authorities outlined above.

WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
WDB's Urban Investment Program
Introduction and Background
1.      The previous two projects, supported by IDA credits 709 and 1041-CE,
have provided and extended water service and sewerage tacilities in the
Greater Colombo Municipal Area including the urban developments extending to
the North and South of Colombo.  The sector development proposals were iden-
tified from Master Plan and Feasibility Studies  i Water Supply and Sewerage
Services for the Southwest Coastal Area.  These studie<, (subsequently
referred to as the UNDP Master Plan Studies) and the resulting reports, were
prepared in 1972 by consulting engirneers 1  t-nder contr3ct to the World
Health Organization (WHO), as executing agency for t.he United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).  Parts ot the Master lllan and Veasibility Reports
were revised in 1979 by engineering cons.iltants 2'  Ander contract to WDB, tto
reflect population levels and conditions at that t Lme.  Since tinancial
resources, and the iromlementation capaci v o, t he x.c-rnment agenclei were
restricted, the report recommendations were impiemeote,  in st.a?,es. with
priority given to areas of high populatior  oevsirv ard ,freater need.
Colombo Water Supplv_System
2.      On completion of the ongoing Se' -nd '-  .anka W.ter Supply and
Sewerage Project (Credit 1041-CE), antlLipat-d ar?ou.nd October 1986, the
supply of piped water will extent to abotor ISf i m)    the great.er Colombo

with a treatment works:  Flow gravitates to ColJmbo via a battery ot two
500 mm, two 750 mm and one 840 mm diameter mains.
4.      These two headworks have been supplemented more recently by a river
intake on the Kelani Ganga at Ambatale some 10 km east of Colombo with a
modern treatment works.  The Kelani Ganga has an extensive upland catchment
area to the east of Colombo and discharges to' t.he Indian Ocean close to
Colombo. The treatment works at Kalatuwawa and Labugama are currently being

refurbished and the works at Ambatale are being extended from 250 mld to 320
mld. All three works should be completed by 1986/87. The gravity supplies
to Colombo combine with pumped tiow tr)m Ambatale and feed major reservoirs
at Elie House and Maligakanda within the city and Dehiwela to the south which

appreciable improvemcnts in pressures and various direct connections have
been made to the incoming trortik Mains.

Dehiwela/Mt. Lavinia, Morai.;wa ard Panadura and Towns East - Kotte and Kolon-
nawa were, for the mrist r ar, :nstailed in the 1950's and are generally in
good condition apart from internal corrosion due to poor pH control of the
acidic source water.

the Kelani Canga receives piped water but only 18% of the capacity has been
taken up in 1985.
11.     Metering.  Domestic metering was introduced in 1984 and there are
presently some 70,000 mnetered connections although about half of the popula-
tion rely on standposts or private wells. Initial difficulties with faulty
meters and connections are being addressed by WDB although low pressures in
many areas inevitably result in poor meter accuracy, usually to the benefit
of the consumer.
12.     Water Quality.  ChLorination is carried out at the three head works,
Labugama, Kalatuwawa and Ambatale.  Residual chlorine levels of 0.6 mg/l are
normally prescribed. Further chlorination is carried out at major service
reservoirs. Supplies ot chlorine gas are sometimes interrupted and bleach
solution is used as an alternative. New chlorination equipment is being
installed and chlorine residual should be more closely controLled in the
t uture.
13.     The pH )t treat.ed water from Ambatale appears surprisingly consistent
at 7.2.  Values ot b.0 to 6.8 were noted in the Japanese Rehabilitation
report tor Kalat~uwawa which is lower than the tigure of 7.2 recommended for
the local waters Lo avoid corrosion problems.
Water Resources and Demand
Resources
14.     The i.aBugama and Kalatuwawa sources have been developed to their full
potential, at present supplying about 136 mld although this figure is
expected to increase to around 147 mid after rehabilitation of the treatment
facilities and improvements in operating efficiency. The present yield of
the Kelani Canga source is estimated around 190 mld; this would increase to
314 mld in 1986 on completion of the augmer.tation works under Credit 1041-CE.
It is therefore estimated that the total reliable yield of three sources from
1986 will be around 461 mld.
Demand
15.     The existing and predicted water demands in the Greater Colombo
Municipal Area are summarized in the following table. The adopted figures
are based on field data obtained in 1985 from 40' property connections and a
number of standpost outlets together with an analysis of WDB's meter reading
records for 1985. Average per capita figures of 169 and 154 lcd have been
adopted to calculate the 1985 demands for Colombo Municipal Corporation (CMC)
and the areas outside Colombo respectively. Unaccounted water is reported



-35-
ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 14
around 322 in CMC area and 20% outside the city limits where the distribution
systems are more recent, resulting in an average ot 26%.
16.     From the table it can be seen that the anticipated water demand is
expected to increase sharply through 1990 (largely as a result of the exten-
sion of services to the townships at towns North and East).

17.     As a result of anticipated reduction in per capita consumption stand
posts from the present figure of 128 lcd to 90 lcd by the use of more effi-
cient outlet valves and a reduction in unaccounted water by more efficient
leakage control measures from 24% in 1990 to 22% in year 2000, the overall
demand is expected to increase at a mcdest rate of 0.7% p.a. during the
decade through 2000.  It is also seen that the available supplies (after
completion of Ambatale extensions) would meet anticipated demand beyond 1990.
Even by year 2000 the average per capita water availability for the 2.21
million population anticipated at that time, is only reduced to 126 lcd
compared with 142 lcd enjoyed by the 1990 population.

Colombo Sewerage System
18.     Prior to the implementation of the on-going sewerage project financed
under credit 1041-CE and the Saudi Fund for Development, about 80% of the CMC
area was served by an old sewerage network, dating back to the early 1900's,
with about 50X of the houses connected to the system. Small sewage treatment
plants, which were part of the original system and served the northern and
southern drainage areas of Colombo became inoperative and were taken out of
service in 1956. Since this date untreated sewerage has been continously
discharged to the lower reaches of the Kelani Canga and to the sea. As the
population in the service area increased the conveyance systems became
heavily overloaded as a result of increased flow and lack of maintenance.
19.     The works financed under the ongoing project, which are expected r
be commissioned in late 1986, will rehabil;tate and improve existing pump
stations and conveyance system, expand the sewerage conveyance system in
Kolonnawa and Mount Lavinia areas and provide disposaL facilities by the
construction of two ocean outfalls.
20.     Municipal Council and WDB Ordinances required owners of premises
located within 100 feet of a public drain or sewer to connect to the drain or
sewer and to convert any existing facilities within the p-emises to a form
suitable for use with the public system. These ordinances have not been
enforced since the old CMC system is grossly overloaded, WDB's system is not
yet operational. Moreover there has been a general reluctance for property
owners to connect to the system because of the relatively high cost of doing
so (Rs 3,500-7,500 or US$135-285) and the absence in the past of any
mechanism for financing such costs. This issue is being addressed by GSL
under the ongoing IDA project by the provision of grants.
Sewerage Operation and Maintenance
21.     Operation and maintenance responsibilities for sewerage facilities
are poorly defined. In Cotombo the practice appears to be that following
commissioning, the CMC takes over responsibility for trunk and feeder sewers.
But CMC lacks the technical capability to operate the pumping stations and
other works and, by default, these responsibilities have remained with WDB
with adverse consequences for WDB's total di.ect costs. In accordance with
CSL sector policy CMC should take over all sewerage operations and main-
tenance responsibilities as soon as is practicable (by no later than 1990).
The WDB should take steps to train CMC staff or otherwise transfer know-how
to CMC for pumping and other works operations. Similar steps will need to be
taken in other local authority areas as sewer facilities are installed. CSL,
in consultation with WDB, CMC and other concerned local authorities would
need to adopt a policy of gradual transfer of O&M responsibilities to local
authorities ar,d advise IDA of its program to achieve this.

21. Existing Colombo Stormwater System
General Overview
22.     The existing stormwater system in Colombo comprises a network which
drains either to the canals or, un the westward side, directLy to the sea.
The *rainage system consisting of underground pipes, culverts and open chan-
nels was largely constructed from 1908 onwards. The canal system largely
consists of unlined channels, detention basins and control structures.
23.     Substantial areas around the outskirts of CoLombo used to drain to
marshy land. However, with the expansion of the city over the years, the
marshy land has been filled and developed in an unplanned manner often seal-
ing the drainage outlet and without regard to the canal flood levels. The
Urban Development Authority and the land Reclamation and Development Corpora-
tion have controLLed the leveli t!r construction.  However, many drainage
provisions are inadequate, and oermanent dwellings are below the flood level.
24.     The existing draLnage system has been extended without any overall
planning strategy.  Consequently probLems have not always been solved and in
some instances no stormwater drainage tacilities have been provided.  The
traditional construction of side channeLs to roads provided an effective
method of stormwater disposal.  However, in some places these have been
covered or filled with no alternative drainage arrangements provided giving
rise to flooding problems and aftecting the rehabilitation of the highways.
25.     Rapid growth of Colombo has resulted in shanty development along the
canal banks with cornsequent risk from flooding.  In these areas solid waste
is deposited in the canals due to inadequate collection arrangements. An
overall assessment and the deveLopment of a future strategy is now required
to relieve and rehabilitate t" present overloaded drainage system.  This
strategy must be coordinated between the various responsible authorities to
ensure that a fully integrated workable system is formulated and constructed.
Interdependence of the Drainage System and the Canal System
26.     An important aspect of stormwater disposal in Colombo is the inter-
dependence of the drainage and canal systems.  With the exception of the
western 3eaboard which drains to the sea and the extreme northern area which
drains to the Kelani Ganga, all the drainage of Greater Colombo flows into
the canal network.  The water levels in the canals are therefore very
relevant to the operation of the drainage networks within the city, and
integrated in any overall drainage development plan.



-38-
ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 14
Organization and Management
27.     There are four principal authorities responsible for stormwater
drainage within Greater Colombo Municipality.
1. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (WDB) is responsible
for the design and implementation of stormwater drainage schemes.
2. The Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (LRDC) is respon-
sible for land drainage and flood control as well as the maintenance
of the canal system.
3. The Colombo Municipal Corporation (CMC) is responsible for the opera-
tion and maintenance of the stormwater drainage sysLem together with
the provision of road and building drainage for schemes carried out
under its control.
4. The Ministry of Highways (MOH) is responsible for the provision of
road drainage for schemes under its control.
28.     In addition the Urban Development Authority (UDA) deals with building
approval including stormwater drainage provisions. Other authorities
involved to some degree in stormwater drainage are The Common Amenities Board
which deals with drainage in slum upgrading programs, the Canal Development
Board which deals with some minor canaLs and the National Housing Development
Authority which includes drainage as part of its rehousing schemes.
29.     The development of an effective stormwater drainage strategy requires
a single authority with an overall coordinetien role. A recent GSL Cabinet
decision appointed the UDA as the coordinating body. The UDA will chair the
inter-agency Steering Committee on stormwater drainage which will coordinate
the numerous elements of future drainage developments. It is anticipated
that the roles of the existing authorities would be retained in terms of
implementation and maintenance. The WDB would be responsible for the design
and implementation of stormwater drainage schemes up to the connections to
the canal system, implementation of canal improvements and maintenance would
remain the responsibility of the Land Reclamation and Development Corpora-
tion.
30.     Adequate funding is necessary for the successful improvement and
maintenance of the stormwater drainage system. All proposed drainage
schemes, maintenance and rehabilitation work schedules should be reviewed by
the Steering Committee to allocate budgets and monitor performance to ensure
that the stormwater drainage system is upgraded, maintained and developed in
a planned manner.



-39-
ANNEX 3
Page 8 of 14
Maintenance
31.     Colombo Municipal Council is responsible for maintenance of the
stormwater drainage system within the Municipality up to the connections to
the canals, the outfalls into the sea and Biers Lake. The maintenance of the
canals is the responsibility of the LRDC. Maintenance of the stormwater
drainage system has not been carried out on a planned basis; problems have
only been tackled on receipt of complaints. Colombo is essentially low lying
and minimum gradients are necessary on the drainage system to obviate the
need for pumping stations.  The deteriorating road system, lack of a street
cleaning program and inadequate solid waste collection result in siltation
and blockage of the stormwater drainage system. Therefore a planned main-
tenance program is necessary to prevent the build up of silt in the system
and surface flooding.
Organization of CMC Drainage Department
32.     The organization of CMC Drainage Department is briefly outlined as
follows:
33.     The CMC Department has seven district offices directed by the
Municipal Engineer.  The Water Supply & Drainage Department is run by the
Deputy Municipal Engineer and the Superintending Engineer (Drainage) is
responsible for the foul sewerage and stormwater drainage systems supported
by seven District Engineers (Drainage). Each District Office has a main-
tenance gang of 15-20 laborers and two larger construction gangs are main-
tained.
34.     The CMC owns one gully emptying vehicle which is usually employed
emptying septic tanks and there is no cover for breakdown and vehicle main-
tenance time. At present gullies and roadside ditches are emptied by hand.
There is an urgent need for improvement of CMC maintenance methods. Planned
maintenance schedules and records are also necessary for reference purposes.
Further gully emptiers are required to facilitate the regular maintenance of
road gullies and roadside ditches.
35.     Sewer cleaning equipment was acqi ired by WDB under Credit 1041-CE.
The equipment is employed on the foul drainage system which is maintained on
a planned basis with every sewer length being cleaned approximately once per
annum. The equipment is not used efficiently since the winches are too heavy
to be moved to site by hand and there is therefore a need for vehicle for
each truck loader winch to facilitate their movement between sites. In
addition CMC need additional steel drain rods to maintain its sewer cleaning
program. Thi3 equipment needs some modification for use on the stormwater
drainage system to cope with varying manhole construction and size. Care

will also need to be exercised in the use of such powerful equipment on the
stormwater system to avoid structural damage. A more appropriate method of
clearing silted stormwater drains is the use of high pressure jetting and
suction vehicles. However, this equipment is sophisticated and difficult to
maintain and it may be appropriate to use such equipment on a contract basis.
The condition of the existing system and the extent of the problems of silta-
tion need to be assessed in order that a decision can be taken whether to
employ jetting procedures and the scope of any contracts determined.
Canal Maintenance by Land Reclamation and Devel2kpent Corporation
36.     The maintenance of the canaL system and the Beira Lake around
drainage outlets has also been neglected resulting in siltation, growth of
salvinia and water hyacinth. A program ot canal dredging is in progress,
under the control of the LRDC as part of the New Capital City Drainage
Project. Progress is, however, slow due to the lack of funds and the exist-
ence of shanties along canal banks making dredging operations difficult. The
existing 1.8 m diameter Mutwal tunnel from Main Drain to the sea is com-
pletely blocked at both the inlet and outlet ends. As this is a primary
outlet from North Colombo it is particuLarly important that this tunnel
should be regularly maintained.
Storm Drainage Records
37.     The records of the existing stormwater drainage system are kept by
the CMC on sets of linen prints. The survey drawings were produced around
1949, changes and additions to the drainage system have not always been
recorded with the result that there is no up to date comprehensive record of
the existing stormwater drainage system.  The linen prints are also suffering
from constant use over many years to the extent that some areas are now
un-readable and some sheets are missing. In addition it is not known at
present whether and to what degree the sewers are silted, blocked off or
built over. This information is of vital importance if a planned maintenance
program is to be formulated.
38.     An aerial survey of Greater Colombo has recently been completed for
WDB and the sewerage and water distribution systems have been recorded on
survey plans based on existing drawings supplemented by field data. A
similar record of the storm drainage system is required as a prerequisite in
the management of the system. This issue is now being addressed by WDB under
the ongoing Credit 1041-CE.

Anuradhapura Water Supply System
39.     The regional centre of Anuradhapura, locate, about 170 km to the
northeast of Colombo, was the first town developed under the Urban Develop-
ment Authority commencing in 1956. The new town population was estimated
around 20,000 in year 1981 and projected to reach 35,000 by 2001.
40.     The existing water supply system serves both domestic and institu-
tional demands. Domestic supply is provided from both property connections
and standpost outlets.
41.     At the present, water for the town is abstracted from the Nuwarawewa
reservoir which provides ample and satisfactorv raw water resources for
foreseeable requirements. However, at the present time due to defects in the
pumping, treatment and distribution syscems, the supplv is restricted to two
periods per day each of two hours duration.
42.     This whole scheme requires rehabilitation and augmentation to provide
a reliable water supply for present and futture requirements.
Amparai Water Su Pp-y _Systerm
43.     Amparai is a regional center situated about 30 km to the east of
Colombo with a present population estimated around 20,000. The present water
system dates from the 1950s and provides a supply through property connec-
tions and stand-post outlets. The present supply system is quite unsatisfac-
tory and requires complete rehabilitation for the following reasons:
(a) the water quality in Amparai Reservoir, used for many years to
provide the source of supply has deteriorated to such an extent that
it is untreatable. This source was abandoned in 1983 and a
temporary supply is now being obtained from Kondavattavan reservoir;
(b) the treatment facility installed as a temporary measure in 1983
relies on an obsolete clarification process which operates
unsatisfactorily. No filtration is provided;
(c) treated water pumps are in very poor condition;
(d) storage is inadequate;
(e) the distribution system has deteriorated beyond repair due to the
corrosiveness of the water; and
(f) leakage is reported in excess of 50% of production.

SRI LANKA
WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Maor Ass   tions Underlyin  the Financial. Proections
INCOME AND EXPENDITURE STATEMENT
1.      The Income and Expenditure Statements contain 1984 audited data and
1985 estimated data based on provisional figures to 30 September 1985 and the
WDB's 1986 budget, modified to reflect the start of proposed project.
Projections are for 1987 onwards. Projections incorporate the financial
consequences of the capital expenditure programmes of Annex 2.
Revenues
2.      Cross revenues from piped water sales from new projects have been
determined from technical consultants' estimates of connections and volumes.
The tariffs are assumed to be increased in 1987 and 1988. These two years
are assumed to have a 10% per annum real increase in tariffs ie. over and
above the rate of inflation and subsequently to at least keep pace with
inflation.
3.      Sewerage facilities and operations are assumed to be wholly trans-
ferred to local authorities in 1990.
4.      Prom 1986 a system of specific grant financing of the WDB's
non-revenue earning services is assumed to be introduced, This system will
consist of GSL specific contribution to cover the operating deficit on these
services and are shown as revenue to the WDB.
5.      Bad and doubtful debts are a major concern at the present time.  WDB
are taking active steps to reduce bad debts to reasonable proportions from
the unacceptable current leveis of about 65% of gross revenues for domestic
consumers and 30% for non-domestic. The Income and Expenditure Statements
assume that bad debts will be 10% of gross revenues for all new water supply
projects. As regards existing projects, a target rate of bad debts of 10% of
gross revenues has been assumed to be achieved progressively from the exist-
ing levels over a three year period starting in 1986.
Operations and Maintenance Costs
6.      Operations and maintenance costs for the water supply components of
the proposed project were estimated by consultants for the years following
commissioning, making due allowances for expected growth in demand. Data on



-61-
ANNEX 8
Page 2
O&h costs for rural schemes currently underway were obtained from WDB.
Existing operations and maintenance costs were provided by M/S Ernst and
Whinney, consultants to WDB under the USAID project. Analysis by Ernst and
Vhinn-y of recent movements in the prices of the elements of O&H costs (chemi-
cals, materials, labour, electricity, etc.), has revealed that although they
have differed somewhat, overall O&M costs have been rising at about the rate
of general price inflation. It has been assumed that O&H costs would con-
tinue to rise at the expected rate of inflation, with the appropriate
increases built into the projections for increases in service provision.
7.      However, a further factor has been built into the projections to
reflect continuing management pressure for efficiency improvements. That
allowance is a 2% per annum reduction in the estimated O&M costs, starting in
1987.
8.      Local authorities in urban and rural areas have been assumed to take
over full responsibility for water supply distribution, operations and main-
tenance at a progressive rate of 20% per annum, starting in 1990. Sewerage
operations and maintenance costs are assumed to transfer fully to local
authorities by 1990.
Other Items
9.      Overhead expenditures have been assumed to remain constant in real
terms throughout the project period. This assumption implies significant
real efficiency improvements by WDB, given the scale of projected increases
in WDB operations.
10.     Due to lack of reliable engineering records and fixed assets data, no
projected balance sheet has been provided. Fixed asset register and
engineering records are being updated and a fully closed balance sheet can be
expected by FY 1989. Depreciation has been estimated in the statements at
existing rates for all fixed assets currently in WDB's balance sheet.
Straight line depreciation on new fixed assets has been assessed on an
average asset life of 30 years.
11.     Loan interest has been calculated as follows:
(a) On all existing loans as per loan schedules, except that loans
under First Project (IDA Cr. 709-CE) and Saudi Fund credit have
been converted to equity from 1986 onwards.
(b) All new loans to IDB are assumed to be annuities from GSL at 12%
per annum with a 24 year life (reflecting the average life of
fixed assets) and with first payments occuring in the year fol-
lowing the year in which the loan is drawn down.

12.     Working capital requirements each year have been calculated using the
following assumptions:
a) Receivables  : 3 months net revenues.
b) Inventory    : 3 months supply of chemicals (equals 20X of O&M
costs) plus 1 months capital investment.
c) Cash          :  1 months O&M costs plus overheads.
d) Construction
Advances      :  1 months O&M capital investment.
e) Payables      :  1 months O&M costs minus labor.
13.     Working capital changes were derived from these estimates of working
capital requirements. They are shown as memorandum items in the statements.
14.     CSL is shown as the exclusive source funding for WDB.  Accordngly GSL
is assumed to decide on the basis by which any foreign donor funds will be
passed on to WDB. The loan/capital grant mix in any given year has been
