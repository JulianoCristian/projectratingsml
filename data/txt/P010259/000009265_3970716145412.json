The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, high quality at entry is necessary since the\n            quality of project preparation and appraisal seriously\n            affects implementation. Second, the Borrower's\n            procurement processes need to be streamlined, and\n            NWSDB's capacity to deal with procurement related\n            problems needs to be strengthened. Third, donor coordination\n            should be improved to better use limited resources and\n            ensure that each donor's efforts are consistent with\n            the government's long-term sector strategy. Fourth,\n            performance based incentive schemes are necessary to retain\n            better trained staff and recruit competent technical staff.\n            Fifth, training programs should be designed to reorient\n            government officials and improve their skills in community\n            participation in addition to technical and managerial\n            skills. Finally, sector reform is needed to improve\n            operational efficiency and meet future challenges."}, "docdt": "1997-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
