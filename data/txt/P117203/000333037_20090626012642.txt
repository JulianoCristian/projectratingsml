                                        I.INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed SmallholderAgriculture and Social Protection Support Development
Policy Operation (DPO) seeks to complement the Government of Cambodia's efforts to
address weaknesses in smallholder agricultural production and social protection systems
which havecome to lightduringthe FoodPriceCrisis.When highfood and agricultural input
prices hit Cambodia in early 2008, it was clear that existing mechanisms were insufficient to
support vulnerable consumers and farmers. These weaknesses garnered much greater attention
by boththe Government and development partners given the on-going effects o f highfood prices
and as the impact o f the global economic crisis is increasingly felt. The US$13 million DPO -
consisting o f a US$8 million grant from the Global Food Response Program and US$5 million in
IDA credits - is a stand-alone, single tranche operation intended to support key policy actions
which strengthen the enabling environment for direct support poor households. It recognizes the
actions taken by Government to stimulate a supply response amongst smallholder farmers, and to
mitigate the impact on household food consumption among poor and vulnerable populations.
The operation also supports medium-term efforts to improve social safety nets and agricultural
production systems through better policies, strengthened institutional frameworks and improved
transparency and governance.

2.      High food prices and the global economic crisis have threatened to undermine a
decade of strong economic growth and poverty reduction. As o f February 2009, rice prices,
while lower than at the September 2008 peak, remained about 60 percent higher than in January
2008. With food accounting for 60-70 percent o f rural household expenditures, and rice alone
comprising 40-50 percent, the highcost o f food has had a significant impact on rural households,
who represent roughly 90% o f all poor in the country. More recently, the impacts o f the global
financial crisis are being increasingly transmitted to Cambodia through dramatic declines in key
sectors with significant consequences for employment.

3.      These exogenous shocks underlined the need to strengthen the agriculturalsector,
given its potential to absorb redundant labor from other sectors, as well as the country's

been a key driver o f growth in Cambodia, lack o f public investment and low use o f inputs - the
safety net system, given likely rises in under and unemployment. Although agriculture has

lowest in the region - have constrained productivity. Moreover, social safety nets are currently
limited in scope, modality, and coverage- with most programs targeted towards formal sector
workers. Government has had to heavily rely on donors for program funding and
implementation.

4.      The effectiveness of expanded efforts to support smallholder farmers and broaden
safety nets is contingenton addressing relevantgovernanceconstraints.Cambodia still faces
considerable weaknesses in its regulatory and legal environment, and control o f corruption
remains a major challenge which Government has recognized. Accordingly, any additional
investments must be matched by focused efforts to improve transparency and oversight, reduce
discretion and targeting o f assistance and strengthen the capacities and role o f community based
organizations inthe planning, implementation and assessmento f assistance efforts.

issues as a critical component of a coordinated response to multiple exogenous shocks - in
         Government and development partners view the DPO and its focus on governance

particular the fuel, food and financial crises. Preparation o f the DPO was based on extensive
consultation with stakeholders, as well as on a review o f recent analytical work. The latter helped
identify ongoing activities and the key policy and governance gaps which can constrain the
effectiveness o f these activities. The operation therefore reflects a consensus o f views on the
priorities that support and complement the work underway and planned by Government and the
country's main development partners for immediate and medium terms support to agriculture
and social protection.

6.       Governmentcounterpartsalso view the DPO as an entry point for the Bank's future
engagement in agriculture and social protection,two sectors where the Bank had reduced its
engagement over the past CAS period. Both agriculture and social protection are not explicitly
part o f the current CAS, based on the expectation that other donor support would compensate for
the Bank's absence. However, in its current mandate (2008 to 2013), Government has placed its
top emphasis on agriculture as a means to sustain poverty-reducing growth. In addition, the
higher food and fuel prices and the slowing economy have increased the recognition o f the need
to build capacity for safety nets. Government i s therefore looking to the Bank for analytical
work, policy advice, and technical assistance, as well as financing. Its development partners are
looking for the Bank to support better linkage o f agriculture and social protection to the broader
public financial management, public administration reform, decentralization and trade
facilitation agendas which the Bank has prioritized in the current CAS. Beyond this proposed
DPO, there is scope for the Bank to continue to support these sector agendas through analytical
work, policy dialogue, and project / budget financing over the medium-term.



                 11.COUNTRY CONTEXTANDDEVELOPMENT                   CHALLENGES

7.       Cambodia has emerged from three decades of instabilitywith an impressive record
of sustained growth and poverty reduction. While still living in the shadows o f genocide,
social upheaval, civil war, political violence, and international isolation, Cambodia is now
experiencing a period o f peace and stability with an open economy and a fledgling democracy.
The 2008 parliamentary elections were the fourth held since 1983 and saw less violence and
intimidation than previous elections, better technical organization, and open and vibrant
campaigning across the country. Despite claims o f fraud, local and international observers
declared the results acceptable. The Cambodian People's Party (CPP) maintained a monopoly o f
power, by capturing 60 percent o f the votes. Fledgling democracy has been accompanied by high
rates o f sustained economic growth, averaging seven percent GDP growth per year between
1997 and 2007. Over the same period, per capita income doubled from US$285 to US$593 per
year.. Such growth pattern had a profound impact on poverty, which fell from an estimated 47
percent in 1994 to 30 percent in 2007, and contributed to improving human development
indicators. Rapid growth and poverty reduction were accompanied by structural transformations:
integration into the regional and global economy, a gradual shift o f employment from agriculture
to manufacturing, and migration from rural to urban areas.

8.       I t is however uncertainwhether the country will manage to follows its neighbors in


                                            8

achieving middle income status by the next decade, given its narrow economic base and
many governance challenges. Economic growth has been heavily reliant on garment, tourism,
construction, and agriculture, with very little diversification beyond these sectors: garment
products account for 88 percent o f all exports; agriculture suffers from limited investment and
low use o f quality inputs. Broadly speaking, growth took place in a notably weak, though
improving, regulatory and governance environment: the country ranks 135 out o f 181 (150 in
2008) in the Doing Business 2009 rankings', and 166 out o f 180 in the 2008 Corruption
Perceptions Index elaborated by Transparency International' (162 in 2007). Given the country's
post-conflict legacy, institutional capacity remains extremely weak. Poverty incidence, while
rapidly declining, is still much higher than that o f its neighbors, and income inequality has
grown. Moreover, the past year has shown how vulnerable the country i s to exogenous shocks,
particularly rising food and fuel prices and the global economic crisis which has slowed global
trade and investment flows to the country.



    A. RecentEconomicDevelopments and MacroeconomicOutlook

9.      Cambodia's economy has achieved a remarkable decade of rapid growth, but
considerable risks have emerged over the past 18 months. Between the improvements in
political stability (around 1998) and 2007, GDP growth averaged ten percent. This performance
relied on four sources o f growth: rapid garment export growth, strong tourism receipts,
continuing construction boom, and volatile but increasing yields in agriculture. Growth was
underpinned by an open trade regime (exports have increased by 23 percent per annum since
1998) and a favorable investment regime for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI remained above 6
percent o f GDP in recent years). Risks have emerged however over the past 18 months,
including: (i)a slowdown o f growth caused by spillovers from the global financial crisis; (ii)
higher inflation; (iii)possible strain on the bankingsector as the economy slows down.

10.     Spillovers from the global financial crisis are worsening the economic outlook in
2009. Cambodia is particularly vulnerable to spillovers from the global financial crisis given its
narrow production base, concentration o f exports by product and destination, and dependence on
external inflows: the economy is expected to contract in 2009, with growth projected at -1.0
percent o f GDP. Three out o f four engines o f growth are substantially exposed to spillovers from
the global financial crisis. Garment exports in February 2009 were 23 percent down from the
year before, consistent with weak retail sales in the United States (around three-quarters o f the
market). Tourist arrivals are also turning negative (minus 7 percent in February 2009 compared
to February 2008), and many hotels are running at 20-30 percent capacity, below break-even
point. Construction activity and foreign investment are also slowing rapidly as external investors
cut back and financing conditions tighten: property prices in and around Phnom Penh are
reportedly down as much as 25 percent from historic highs in mid-2008, after rising 50-100
percent in the preceding year; and construction projects approved in Phnom Penh in February
2009 declined by 14 percent comparedto the same period in 2008. On the other hand, agriculture

performed well in 2008, although the fall in global agricultural prices (in particular for cassava
and rubber) may limit fbrther gains this year. Beyond the projected contraction in 2009, the
outlook for 2010 i s also highly uncertain, hinging critically on global and regional growth
prospects.

11.      Inflation increased between late 2007 and mid 2008, but has now slowed down.
Inflation pressures intensified in the second half o f 2007 and first half o f 2008 because o f rising
commodity prices, a weakening in the U.S. dollar against major currencies, and domestic
demand pressures (a rapid credit expansion since 2007 and high growth in the construction and
real estate sectors). The RGC responded with a mix o f tighter monetary policy (doubling the
reserve requirements) and conservative fiscal policy (with the fiscal deficit excluding grants
reduced from 2.9 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 2.2 in 2008). These policies, combined with a
radically different external environment, brought inflation down from 26 percent inMay 2008 to
13 percent in December 2008.

12.      The real exchange rate has appreciated relatively to other garments exporters. The
National Bank o f Cambodia has continued its policy o f maintaining a stable bilateral exchange
rate o f the Cambodian riel against the US. dollar in 2008. This has led to a real appreciation,
initially caused by domestic inflation and then by the appreciation o f the dollar. This combined
effect has caused a significant deterioration o f the real exchange rate o f Cambodia against that o f
other garments exporters.

13.     The current monetary stance is seen as broadly appropriate, but conditions have
tightened rapidly, bearing close watch. Bank reserve requirements have been recently
decreased from 16 to 12 percent following a rapid tightening o f liquidity conditions due to
capital outflows in late 2008. This decrease was combined with the creation o f an overdraft
facility by the National Bank o f Cambodia (NBC) to increase liquidities and the adoption o f new
prudential regulations to tighten supervision (new minimum capital requirements, strengthening

o f loan classification standards and bank licensing procedures). Under the current baseline, broad
money is expected to increase by only around 2 percent in 2009, with weak capital inflows
significantly constraining liquidity growth. As a result and also reflecting demand conditions,
private sector credit growth is expected to expand by only 5 percent (year-on-year) in 2009.
Although all performance indicators in the banking sector are strong (including a low ratio o f
Non-Performing Loans), the rapid development o f the sector combined with the rapid slowdown
ineconomic activity requires close supervision by the NBC. Inaddition, the supervision capacity
o f the N B C has been stretched by the recent entry o f a number o f commercial banks. Bank
resolution plans are also being formulated to provide a solid framework for dealing effectively
with troubled banks.

14.     Fiscal policy continues to underpin stabilization efforts, but the fiscal space
available to respond to the economic downturn is limited, requiring accelerated
disbursements of ODA. The overall 2008 deficit (excluding grants) is expected at around 2.2
percent o f GDP, against an official target o f 4.2 percent and an outturn o f 2.8 percent in 2007.
Revenues in 2008 continued to rise (including as a share o f GDP), owing to a buoyant domestic
economy and improved tax and customs administration; but they remained low (at 12.1 percent
o f GDP in2008) and have begunto fall in2009 (inJanuary 2009, revenues were 7 percent below
the January 2008 levels). In view o f the near-team outlook, a countercyclical easing o f fiscal
policy is being adopted in 2009. Cambodia approved a 2009 budget with an overall budget
deficit o f 4 percent o f GDP, while the IMF subsequently recommended enlarging the deficit to
4.8 percent o f GDP and to finance this expansion through accelerated disbursements o f official
development assistance (ODA).

15.     Although the current account deteriorated in 2008, it was largely financed and is
expected to decline in 2009. The current account deficit (excluding official grants) increased
from 5.9 percent o f GDP in 2007, to 10.9 percent in2008, largely because o f higher prices o f oil



                                                   11

(and to a certain extent higher volumes o f imports, both construction or equipment goods and
consumption goods). This deficit was financed by continuing good performance in mobilizing
external assistance and attracting foreign investment. As a result, international reserves increased
to more than US$2 billion (more than 3 months o f imports). In2009, the current account deficit
was decreased sharply, with lower prices o f oil (and despite the slowdown inexports o f garments
and tourism). On the financing side, foreign direct investment is also expected to decrease
sharply while external assistance levels would be maintained. As a result, a small decrease in
international reserves i s expected.

16.      Overall, the macroeconomic policy framework has been supportive of sustained
growth and low inflation. In2008, in the face o f rising prices and some signs o f overheating,
the fiscal and monetary policies were tightened. In 2009, with the real sector slowing down
sharply in a context o f receding inflation risks, the policy mix was loosened to contribute to
stabilizing the economy. In parallel, actions are being taken by the central bank to monitor the
stability o f the financial sector. It should be noted however that, in a dollarized economy with a
small public sector, the authorities have few instruments to respond to the major economic
shocks faced in recent months.

17.       Given longer-termprospects, Cambodiacurrently faces a moderaterisk of external
debt distress (December 2008 joint IMF/WB Debt Sustainability Analysis, DSA). Inthe DSA,
no thresholds are breached under the baseline scenario and standard stress tests and alternative
scenarios, except one boundtest. However, this benign outlook i s subject to substantial downside
risk, as shown inthe DSA, inthe event of a prolonged economic downturn, butthe likelihood of
debt distress remains moderate. Under the baseline scenario, the public external debt (projected
at 27 percent o f GDP at end-2008) should decline steadily over the medium term. The debt
service-to-exports ratio is expected to stay below 3 percent. These results presume that external
borrowing would gradually move toward less concessional terms and no resolution o f external
debt arrears with either the RussianFederationor United Statestakes place.


     B. Povertyand Vulnerability Profile

18.       Sustained economic growth over the last decade contributed to raise living
standards and reduce the poverty rate from 47 percent in 1993-94, to 35 percent in 2004
and 30 percent in 2007.3 Despite impressive poverty reduction, one out o f three individuals
continues to live below the poverty line, and poverty incidence largely remains a rural
phenomenon. While poverty rates decreased in both urban and rural areas, inequality and the
urban-rural divide increased between 1993-94 and 2007. Less than one percent o f the population
in Phnom Penhwas deemed to be poor in2007, compared to more than twenty percent in other
urban areas, and almost 35 percent in rural areas, where approximately 80 percent o f the
population lives (Table 3). While inequality in Phnom Penh has decreased, it has increased in
other urban and rural areas - leading to an overall increase in inequality from a Gini coefficient


 It is difficult to measure the longterm fall inpoverty in the country as awhole with precisiongiventhe lack of a
baseline survey in 1993/4 that covers all Cambodia, as at that time the survey was only able to cover around two-
thirds ofthe rural population.

19.     Improvement in living standards, implied by decliningpoverty rates and rising per
capita consumption is manifest in various indicators. The food share of total household
expenditurehas fallen significantly across all consumptionquintiles, and the quality of housing
and ownershipofkey assets have risen.Broadlyspeaking, women as well as men have benefited
from economic expansion andrisingaverage consumption,as significantnumbers of young rural
women have found employment in the new garment industry and improvements in primary
education have started to close the gender gap in literacy among younger age groups. The
povertygap-the average distance by which the consumptionofpoorhouseholdsfalls belowthe
consumptionpoverty line - also declinedthroughout the country: from a projected 12percent in
1993/4to 9.0 percent in 2004, to 7.2 percent in2007, signifyingthat those who remainbelowthe
povertyline increasinglyexperience less severepoverty.

20.     Risingincomes and gradual improvementsin service delivery havestartedto reflect
in improved education and health outcomes. While Cambodia's human development
indicators still lagthose of neighboringcountries, its healthand educationministrieshave made
significant improvements in core systems: developing sector-wide strategies; aligning policy,
planning, budgeting and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) processes toward these strategies;
and gradually reorienting priorities in a pro-poor direction. These improvements have led to
impressive results in many areas. Findings from the 2005 Cambodia Demographicand Health
Survey (CDHS), for example, show significant progress on a number of output and outcome
measures relative to the previous (2000) CDHS: higher rates of childhood immunization and
births attended by a trained professional; dramatic rise in exclusive breastfeedingof children
under six months; falling fertility rates, better childhoodnutrition, and significant improvements
inchildhoodsurvival (infantmortalityrates fell from 95 to 65 per 100,000 live births, andunder-
five mortalityfell from 124to 83); and remarkably success in arrestingand reversingthe spread
of the HIV epidemicandtuberculosis.

21.     Several health and nutrition indicators remain however at critical levels.According
to preliminary results from the 2008 Anthropometric Survey carried out by the Cambodia
National Institute of Statistics, women are seeing improvement in both chronic and acute
indicators of malnutrition: the percentage of women shorter than 145cm of height decreased
from 7.2 percent to 6.3 percent between 2005 and 2008, and that of women with a low body
mass index decreased from 19.1 percent to 16.1 percent. However, among children under five

years o f age, rates o f moderate or severe wasting (low weight-for-height4) was found to be
roughly the same as observed in 2005 (8.9 percent compared to 9.4 percent inNovember 2005,
and 6.4 percent expected for November 2009). This suggests no improvement in malnutrition
over the last three years; or, more probably, that progress made between 2000 and 2005 (when
rates declined from roughly 16 percent in both rural and urban areas to 8.3 and 8.7 percent,
respectively, in rural and urban areas) may have continued through to 2007, but with rates rising
again in 2008. When disaggregated at the urban-rural level, rates o f moderate or severe acute
malnutrition are similar (9 percent in rural areas and 8.5 percent in urban ones, in November
2008. Some nutritional indicators also slightly deteriorated between 2005 and 2008. The number
o f children o f 6-48 months o f age consuming essential food items (, inparticular vegetables rich
inVitamin A, freshmeat and fish decreased by between 10and 15percent inurban areas, yet by
only between 2 and 7 percent in rural areas. These figures suggest that the diet o f children in
urban areas has been affected more than those in rural areas, thus highlighting the need for
nutritional based assistance to cover both areas.

22.      In the short to medium term, further progress in poverty reduction will require
significant improvements in the productivity and profitability of smallholder agriculture.
Agriculture is the primary occupation for 72 percent o f rural households, and for approximately
90 percent o f Cambodia's poor. Rice remains the most important crop for the poor, accounting
for 84 percent o f their agricultural revenues and providing over 75 percent o f the calories
consumed by the poor. As in low-income countries worldwide, growth in the agricultural sector
i s likely to provide the greatest impact in terms o f poverty reduction. Rice yields have steadily
improved over the past ten years (Figure 1) and have contributed to reductions in rural poverty.
However, they remain the lowest in the region, and both yield and area growth has slowed in
recent years. Fortunately, there i s significant scope to increase rice productivity, which would
have an immediate impact on poor household incomes: Cambodian farmers have the lowest rates
o f utilization o f improved inputs (seed and fertilizer) and irrigated land inEast Asia, and there i s
scope for significant improvements in marketing chains that would improve product quality,
prices and potentially farmer's margins. Estimates o f supply response based on data from the
Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) indicate short-term (fertilizer as only variable input)
supply elasticities o f 0.26 for wet seasonpaddy and 0.33 for dry seasonpaddy, comparable with
other Asian countries.




4 Wasting (low weight-for-height) is an indicator of acute - that is, current or recent    - malnutrition that
responds rapidly to declining food intake. By contrast, stunting (low height for age) i s an indicator of
chronic (that is, persistent) malnutrition that has occurred at some point in the child's life with long-term
effects on his or her growth.

23.     The sustainability of agriculturally led growth and poverty reduction will require
significant improvements in the development of integrated agricultural supply chains.
Although smallholders clearly dominate agricultural production in Cambodia, with few
exceptions, they remain weakly integrated into value-added agricultural markets. In large part
this reflects very limited agribusiness investment inthe downstream links of the supply chain -
agglomeration and storage, processing and export marketing - in favor o f investments in
plantation-type approaches focused on raw material production which has generated considerable
land conflict. This approach i s contrary to evidence worldwide, including in Cambodia', which
clearly indicates the productivity and profitability advantage o f smallholder production for most
crops, particularly in countries with abundant rural labor. However, increasing integration o f
food markets at the global, regional and, increasingly, local levels, highlightsthe needto develop
integrated supply chains which can efficiently link smallholder productivity advantages to
market information, technology and capital through mechanisms which reduce transactions costs
such as farmer organizations and contract farming. In addition, favoring options which focus on
labor-intensive approaches i s important given Cambodia's needs to productively absorb the
annual increase in employment-aged population which i s currently peaking at up to 300,000 new
workforce entrants each year, while limitingthe need for significant expansion o f its agricultural
area at the expense o f its forest and other natural resources.



    C. The Food Price Crisis and Economic Slowdown

24.     As an open economy with few effective trade barriers, Cambodia was highly
exposed to the rapid worldwide increase in food and fertilizer prices of 2008. Food prices
rose by 33 percent, driving inflation to 19.7 percent, its highest level since 1995. The price o f
rice, the country's staple food, rose even more substantially, from 1,511 Rielskg in January

2008, to 2,602 Rielskg in April, and 2,874 Rielskg in August, before adjusting to 2,525

the price of high quality rice remained 60% above its January 2008 level. Fertilizer prices more

25.     Simulations suggest that, despite the fact that Cambodia is a net rice exporter,
higher food prices are likely to have increased poverty rates.6The increase in food prices

experienced in 2008 negatively affected more than 70 percent o f the poor, and more than 78
percent o f the non-poor, and simulations suggest that this resulted to a net increase inpoverty o f
up to 3.3 percent. The estimated poverty increase was mainly caused by higher prices of non-
cereal items. More precisely, because many poor households are net rice producers but net food
consumers, the increase in cereal prices alone would have reduced the poverty rate by 0.2
percentage points, but the increase inthe price o f food items overall caused poverty to increase.
The poverty effects also varied geographically: urban areas (excluding Phnom Penh) were the
hardest hit, since most o f its inhabitants are net food consumers; rural areas were hit less hard
because o f the positive effect o f the rise in cereal prices on incomes o f rice producers. The
impact in Phnom Penh remained limited as poverty rates were low to beginwith (0.83%). While
indicative o f overall trends, these simulations do not consider potential substitution effects in
poor households' consumption, and the overall supply response caused by increased food prices
and related likely increase in rural wages that would benefit the landless poor. It i s therefore
likely that the simulated poverty impact represents an upper bound o f the likely effect on
poverty.

26.     Equally important, the increase in food prices had a strong distributional impact,
benefitting net food producers while hurting net food consumers, and stretching the
capacity of the poor to cope with shocks. Overall, it has been estimated that the 33% increase
in food prices observed in2008 lifted 8.1 percent o f poor people out o f poverty, but at the same
time drew 8.3 percent of people who were not poor into poverty. Highprice fluctuations created
therefore an unpredictable economic environment that stretched the capacity o f the poor to plan
and cope with risk, increasing vulnerability. Highrates o f movements in and out o f poverty call
therefore for scaling up and restructuring safety net interventions, the latter because beneficiaries
o f assistance that had been identified as poor before the crisis do not necessarily correspond to
the "post-crisis" poor.

27.     A survey conducted in 2008 by the Cambodia Development Resource Institute
(CDRI) providesfurther evidence that the increase in food prices has been detrimental to
the welfare of many Cambodian households. The survey, which is nationally representative,
estimates the number o f food insecure individuals in Cambodia at about 1.7 million, with most
concentrated around the Tonle Sap lake region and in the plains zone.7 The survey documents
that food insecure households are o f larger size, and are also more likely to be landless than the
average rural household, and thus more likely to be adversely affected by the increase in food
prices. As regards coping strategies, evidence indicates that poor families are most likely to
switch to less nutritious foods, face increase indebtedness and reduce food intake, all o f which
have serious mediumand long-term impacts on child and family health and economic resilience.

28.     The current financial crisis is also having a significant impact on Cambodian
households, with expectations that poverty will increase in both absolute and relative
terms. GDP growth in 2009 is expected to be -1.0 percent, compared to 7.0 percent forecast in
April 2008. In per capita terms, the latest GDP growth projection is o f negative 2.5 percent,

compared to 5.5 percent forecast in April 2008. Projections based on these figures indicate that
poverty rates, as measuredusingthe international poverty line o f $1.25 per day (2005 purchasing
power parity), will rise, rather than (as earlier forecasts) continue to fall but at a slower rate than
in the past. The result is thus a forecast rise in poverty in absolute terms: the negative GDP
growth forecasts for 2009 suggest a 1.0 percent increase in poverty for 2009, so that poverty in
2009 will be 3.2 percentage points higher than what was expected a year ago. Such an increase in.
the poverty rate will correspond to an absolute increase inthe number o f poor people o f 200,000
individuals.

29.     The impacts of the financial crisis are particularly felt by non-agriculturalworkers
in Phnom Penh and rural areas. The Cambodian Institute o f Development Studies estimates
that construction will lose over 62,000 jobs between 2008 and 2009, while the textile industry
has already lost 50,000 jobs. In light o f these job cuts, redundant urban workers (especially
garment and construction workers) may struggle to find alternative sources o f employment, and
possibly fall into poverty. The crisis may have a particularly adverse effect on the rural landless
and the land poor, since these primarily depend on income from daily wage labor in
neighborhoods and migration.

30.     The crisis is also increasing pressure on the agriculture sector to absorb the
spillover effects from urban areas. Employment in agriculture is expected to increase by as
much as 800,000 jobs between 2008 and 2009 due to the increase in subsistence farming by
retrenched workers from other sectors.* Job losses among urban workers and unskilled, off-farm
migrant workers both within Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand will also put pressure on
their rural families which are losing remittances, a critical source o f cash income for purchase o f
farm inputs and to manage the two to three months pre-harvest season when many households
face rice shortages.

31.     The Government's response to the food price crisis and the slowing economy
includes a focus on (a) immediate measures to mitigate the high price of food and
agriculturalinputson vulnerable households; and (b) mediumterm measuresto strengthen
smallholder agricultureand broadenthe coverage, rangeand governance aspects of safety
nets for vulnerable households. The response is characterized by both immediate and medium-
term aspects, reflecting the social impact o f the continuing highprice o f food and the worsening
economic effects o f the global financial crisis. The response also reflects the growing
acknowledgement o f the structural and institutional weaknesses in agriculture and social
protection,to be addressed in order for the country to weather future shocks more effectively and
to sustain the country's track record o f economic growth.and poverty alleviation.

    A. ImmediateResponses

32.     As food and agricultural input prices dramatically spiked in early 2008,
Government took several emergency fiscal and trade measures to mitigate the impacts on
Cambodian households and farmers Government institutedpay and allowance increases for
several groups, including the basic salary for civil servants and retirees by 20 percent (roughly
equivalent to US$30-US$40 per month), allowances for teachers by 10 percent, and salaries for
garment workers by 6 percent (in exchange for the suspension of the one percent minimumtax
on garment producers).The family allowancewas also doubled. Inan attempt to stabilizeprices,
GreenTrade, a state owned company, purchasedapproximately300 metric tons (MT) ofrice that
was then sold at subsidizedpricesfor as low as 30 percent below the prevailingmarket price in
urban markets in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. Although the subsidy was relatively limited in
scale, the release was complemented by similar releases byprivatemillerswho receivedlow cost
credit to buy larger stocks to stabilize flows of riceout of Cambodia. Government also adopteda
temporary lifting of the ban on pork imports which reduced the price of pork at the consumer
level. As internationalfertilizer prices rose rapidly, in May 2008 Government exempted import
duty and VAT on importedagriculturalinputs.

33.     On March 23,2008, the Governmentfollowed other Asian exportersin imposingan
export ban on rice, but was the first exporter to lift the banwith positive impactson global
rice markets. The original decision was taken with the aim of ensuring adequate domestic
supply and stabilization of rice prices following export curbs imposed by India, China, and
Vietnam. The export ban had the immediate effect of reducing the domestic price of rice by
about 10percent.The downside, ofcourse, was further limiting globalsupply and contributingto
the rapid increase of international rice price to record levels. By the end of May 2008, the
Government liftedthe ban as soon as itwas anticipatedthat the followingharvestwould ensure a
surplus above domestic requirements. Reflecting the psychological dimensions of the sharp
climb inriceprices, the liftingofthe banby Cambodiawas immediatelyfollowedby rice futures
tumbling by 50 cents per 100 pounds to below US$20, an important contribution to calming
internationalmarketsg

34.     Government expanded its own programs of targeted food distribution and
agricultural input support, and mobilized additional donor resources for these pro-poor
interventions. In September 2008, Government established the multi-ministerial Food
Emergency Working Group to coordinate direct assistance to vulnerable households and
smallholder farmers. Government committedto contribute to the World Food Program (WFP)
2,000 MT of rice for three years, and subsequently increased its contributionfor 2008 to 3,000
MT in light of the severity of the increase in food prices. Food has also been distributed to
roughly 342,000 beneficiariesfrom 200 communes inthe eight provincessurroundingthe Tonle
Sap Lake with support from the ADB-financedEmergency FoodAssistance project. The project
has an overallbudget envelope o f US$40.08 million, o fwhich Government co-financedUS$5.08

million, and is now supporting the implementation o f a food- and cash-for-work assistance
program o f approximately US$18 million to help poor households in food insecure areas cope
with the next lean season. Improved rice seed was also purchased and distributed to 10,000
farmers in2008, and Government and ADB are also preparing additional distribution o f seed and
fertilizer to approximately 200,000 small farms (below one hectare) in the same Communes
around the Tonle Sap lake where rice distribution occurred. Further donor support includes
AusAID grant assistance o fAU$4.0 millionto WFP; FA0 support for distribution o fagricultural
inputs; and acceleration o f other donor (US, Japan, France, EC) emergency assistance through
NGOsoperations.

35.      Government is also reviewing its strategic approach to food supply security.
Through the Food Emergency Working Group, Government is planningto develop a food supply
strategy, drawing upon international experience. With support from ADB-funded technical
assistance, as well as commitments from the World Bank, FA0 and WFP, a workshop i s planned
in mid-2009 to undertake participatory analysis of Cambodia's vulnerabilities and options in
terms o f national, regional and global mechanisms for ensuring adequate food supply at times o f
market or production volatility.

36.      Government is now undertaking immediate measures to respond to slowed
economic growth from the spillovers of the financial crisis. InJanuary 2009 the Government
announced that the profit tax holiday, introduced in 2006 only for garment factories registered
before 2005, would be extended to all garment factories for both 2008 and 2009. Starting
January lst, 2009 the Government also suspended the monthly turnover tax o f 1 percent on all
garment factory expenditures, which include raw textile imports and worker salaries. On
February 5, 2009, the Prime Minister also announced at the Third Cambodia Economic Forum
the introduction and adoption o f a stimuluspackage as a response to the global financial crisis. In
addition to decreasing the Bank reserves requirements for loans from 16 to 12 percent, the
Government adopted a counter-cyclical fiscal policy and increased planned public investments in
transportation, irrigation, agriculture, reducing manufacturing costs, and safety nets. Measures in
agriculture include, among others, increased 2009 budget allocations for improved seed
distribution, registration o f farmer associations and for operation and maintenance o f irrigation
schemes; an increased credit line o f US$I8 million through the Rural Development Bank (RDB)
to private rice millers, input supplier and farmer associations; and strengthened oversight o f
quality and price o f imported fertilizers. On safety nets, Government i s considering the
implementation o f a "cash-for-training" program mostly targeted to young people and laid-off
garment workers. While the effectiveness o f some o f these measures remains to be evaluated, it
signals the Government's commitment to respond to a deteriorating economy with both growth
enhancing and safety net measures.


    B. Medium-Term Programand Strategy

37.     The Government's medium-term, five-year Rectangular Strategy, Phase 11,
finalized in September 2008, was heavily informed and influencedby the increase in food
prices and the current economic slowdown, and puts strong emphasis on both agriculture
and social protection. The Rectangular Strategy highlights as Cambodia's first challenge to
invigorate "[tlhe agricultural sector, which consists o f 30 percent o f the total GDP and accounts


                                             20

for 60 percent o f total employment, still suffers from low yield and has not become the leading
sector yet." The strategy also explicitly recognizes the creation o f social safety nets as a priority
with strengthened support to vulnerable groups. This in itself is a major accomplishment since
social protection has traditionally been left out o f Government's strategic frameworks and policy
dialogue with donors, leavingthe real economy and strong growth to "take care" o f poverty.
38.     Government's strategy is specific in terms of the measures to be taken to improve
agricultural performance. Inorder to address this challenge, Government has put forward the
following measures in translating its Rectangular Strategy into the National Strategic
Development Plan (NSDP): continue enhancing agricultural productivity in order to increase
yields; continue focusing on the use o f advanced technologies; increase public investment in
rural development, agriculture research and dissemination services; establish a quality and
sanitary standard, laboratories, quality certification for agriculture export, promote farmers'
understanding on productivity and quality through training programs, education, and by
establishing an agency to monitor and evaluate food's quality; and, build the refrigeration and
transport infrastructureto serve the export market.
39.     The Strategy for Agriculture and Water (SAW) provides a sectoral approach to
support implementation of the Rectangular Strategy and NSDP. Government, working
closely with development partners in the context o f the Technical Working Group for
Agriculture and Water (TWGAW) i s preparing a more detailed sectoral investment plan for
agriculture which can be supported through programmatic approaches. However, the five
program areas o f the SAW need to be complemented by progress on cross-cutting governance
reforms in public expenditure management, public administration and decentralization reforms,
and legal and regulatory approaches to input supply, farmer organizations and trade facilitation
and agribusiness investment.

40.      Strengthening the performance o f smallholder agriculture will also be critical in
determining the outcome o f the on-going tensions in land allocation priorities. In the past,
Government policy associated growth in the agricultural sector with expansion o f larger scale
agriculture, including the leasing o f large areas o f state land for "economic land concessions"
(ELCs). Most ELCs encountered significant resistance from local villagers who were using the
land for cultivation, grazing and other purposes, and in some cases the ELCs were used as a
means to access forest resources in the guise o f "land clearing".         While Government has
gradually reemphasized the role o f smallholders as a driver o f productivity and export growth
through contract farming, nucleus estates and partnerships between ELCs and "social land
concessions" distributed to the landless poor, the relative importance placed on the large scale
vis a vis the smaller scale production approaches in land allocation and public investment
priorities, will depend on demonstration o f the ability o f the smallholder sector to respond
rapidly to price incentives, and success in developing efficient, integrated supply chains which
allow Cambodia to compete internationally infood markets.

41.     In responding to the current crises, Government has been careful to ensure that
immediate measures align to its medium term strategy by addressing key governance
constraints. Complementary measures are being taken to strengthen the enabling environment
for smallholder agriculture to sustain improvements based on immediate actions. As a result, the
response includes policy measures focused on incentives for smallholders to use improved inputs
to raise productivity through improved transparency and oversight o f fertilizer markets, and


                                             21

strengthening capacity amongst farmers, industry and the public sector to increase knowledge
and ensure quality o f fertilizer and other inputs. It also strengthens the legal framework for
farmer associations and farmer water user communities to carry out their multiple roles in
facilitating technology transfer, access to inputs and credit and marketing. In addition,
recognizing the need to strengthen private sector marketing chains, specific measures are
targeted at improving investment incentives and access to financing for agricultural processing
and marketing firms.

42.      Government's actions are well targeted to the identified constraints in each of the
key areas impacting smallholder agricultural production. Recent analysis of fertilizer
markets has indicated that while the number o f registered suppliers i s increasing significantly
(from about 3 major suppliers in 2005 to 27 in 2008), increasing competition, risks remain in
terms o f consistency o f quality and pricing due to fragmented distribution channels over which
importers have little control. Similarly, current registration o f farmer organizations i s based on
an expectation that each organization will become a full cooperative with a complex set o f
regulations and accountabilities which are beyond the capacity o f most emerging groups.
Similarly, Government has identified the constraint on financing to agricultural processors and
input suppliers as key intermediaries in the supply chain as a major constraint in expanding
access to credit and inputs more broadly to smallholders as occurs in agricultural supply chains
in most major exporting countries. Government has also prioritized irrigation development as
critical to both support intensification o f agriculture on the existing cultivated land area, as well
as to reduce the high variability in production which undermines investment by farmers in
improved inputs and diversification, as well as by processors and marketers in export oriented
value added.

43.     The foundations of Government'scommitmentto alleviatingpovertythrough social
protectionare laid out in the Rectangular Strategy. Priorities include the promotion of good
governance in the provision o f safety nets through strengthening institutional capacity and
cooperating with development partners, as well as the extension o f social services and
emergency relief programs. The Rectangular Strategy also emphasizes the importance o f social
protection systems for vulnerable groups, through the promotion o f child welfare and youth
rehabilitation, as well as o f quality public service for the handicapped and disabled people, and
the implementation o f veteran and Government officials' retirement through pension schemes.

44.     Government engagement in social protectionwas reinstated in the second phase of
the Rectangular Strategy, presented in September 2008. Among other issues, Government
sets out to improve working conditions for workers and employees, enforce the existing Social
Security Law, implement benefit and pension schemes for people with disabilities and their
dependents, ensure protection o f those covered by the Labor Law; and make available to all
employees insurance coverage against workplace accidents. Government also intends to continue
to strengthen support to people with disabilities and families o f veterans, as well as retired civil
servants and veterans through implementing a comprehensive pension system under the National
Social Security Fund.

45.     In the NSDP midterm review, elaborated in November2008, Governmentexplicitly
recognizes as a challenge for the nextyears to providesafety nets to the poor duringtimes
of inflationary stress, particularly through targeted subsidies and tax relief on essential


                                              22

commodities, as well as targeted labor intensivework like food for work programs. The
NSDP midterm review recognizes that increasing inequality, evident in the form o f increasing
disparities in growth o f income, consumption levels, and economic opportunities between urban
and rural areas as well as high and low income groups, can be addressed by more and focused
attention to rural areas and agricultural productionand by ensuringthat adequate safety nets exist
to arrest a slide back o f low income groups into poverty. On March 12, 2009, in the opening
address o f the 2009 Cambodia's Outlook Conference, the Prime Minister also recognized the
potentially significant impact o f the crisis on sectors that have driven growth, and the intention o f
the Government to protect and support vulnerable groups. These are identified as being poor
rural families with reduced income and increased burden o f unemployed family members
returning from urban cities; small and micro-enterprises that deliver services in urban areas in
support o f industries negatively affected by the crisis; the already poor, employed and under-
employed whose opportunities will be lost as economic activity contracts; and young people
entering the labor market in a contracting economy with few prospects o f employment.
Government aims at providing support to these groups through employment and livelihoods
interventions, and through the implementation o f programs such as food relief and cash transfers.

46.      The development of safety nets remains, however, hinderedby a rangeof issues,the
main ones being the lack o f a comprehensive Government social protection strategy, weak
institutional capacity in social protection (reflected in the absence o f a designated Government
agency responsible for social protection), the lack o f a set o f strategic policies and programs
necessary to address the countries' main vulnerabilities, and low capacity within Government to
implement such policies and programs. In particular, the lack o f a well formulated social
protection strategy as well as the absence o f a designated Government agency have led safety net
interventions in Cambodia to be fragmented and uncoordinated, thus reducing the effectiveness
o f Government's efforts in this field. Government has had to rely heavily on donor support for
financing but also for implementation, thus limiting the development o f institutional programs
and capacity.

47.      Government has been undertaking actions aimed at addressing some of these
constraints, but much remains to be done in this direction. At the second Cambodia
Development Cooperation Forum (CDCF) held in December 2008, Government designated the
Food Security and Nutrition Technical Working Group (FSN TWG), led by the Council for
Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) with support from the WFP, to review existing
social protection interventions and to propose a strategy for social protection development. This
exercise represents a first step towards improving the Government's ability to respond to crises,
through the identification o f gaps in coverage in existing safety nets and relevant capacity
limitations. The Government's decision also represents a first step towards having one clearly
designated agency responsible for social protection. However, it is not clear at the moment
whether CARD has the mandate, resources and capacity necessary to become the long term
safety net implementing and coordinating agency, and a clear roadmap towards the designation
o f such an agency remains to be defined.

48.      As part of its renewed effort in social protection, Governmentis also expanding its
targeting system for safety net assistance, the Identification of Poor Households Targeting
Programof the Ministry of Planning. Government is working to expand the coverage and use
o f its official, large-scale Identification o f Poor Households Targeting System, implemented by


                                                23

the Ministry o f Planning (MOP) and supported by the German government through German
Technical Cooperation (GTZ). The Identificationo f Poor Households Targeting system consists
o f standardised national procedures used to identify poor households throughout rural areas in
Cambodia. Between 2007 and the end o f 2009, more than 7000 rural villages will have been
covered by the Identification o f Poor Households Targeting System procedures, whether
implemented by the Ministry o f Planning or its partner organizations. The Identificationo f Poor
Households Targeting system i s mostly used by Health Equity Funds (HEF) to target assistance
to the poor. Where available, it has also been used for food distribution under the ADB supported
Emergency Food Assistance project, and for targeting land distribution recipients. There i s
evidence that the Identification o f Poor Households Targeting system has improved targeting and
governance o f Health EquityFunds, by allowing them to reach the poorest households in a more
transparent and cost-effective manner.loThe Identificationo f Poor Households Targeting system
i s participatory: the identification process i s carried out by village representatives, with the
support and supervision o f the commune council, as well as district-level representatives. Village
representatives are responsible for conducting household interviews, assessing household
"poverty scores" according to the information gathered through the interviews, and preparing
draft lists o f poor households. Draft lists are then displayed in public locations, so that villagers
are able to view them and possibly complain during or following the village consultation
meeting, held before the final list o f poor households is submitted to the commune council. The
whole process i s coordinated by the provincial Department o f Planning, in cooperation with the
provincial Local Administration Unit. The Ministry o f Planning provides training at the
provincial level, monitors implementation and gives ongoing technical support. The
Identification o f Poor Households Targeting targeting system allows more rapid processing and
objective targeting o f assistance, and the issuing o f Equity Cards enhances the ability o f poor
households to access services and assistance by various programs. Health Equity Funds also
maintain a post-identification mechanism for households that have fallen into poverty after the
pre-identification phase: such a post-identification system acquires increased relevance in times
o f crises as many households that were originally not identified as poor may fall into poverty."

as post identification systems address exclusion errors (Le. covering people who fell into poverty), but not inclusion
errors (Le. covering people who have been lifted out of poverty). Based on current plans, the ID Poor targeting

inthe context ofGovernment's priorities at the time ofCAS preparation (CY2004).

50.     Since the April 2008 Progress Report, several factors have contributed to the
increased priority of agriculture and social protection for Bank support to Cambodia,
building on the CAS'S governance-focused and human development pillars. In terms o f
agriculture, the most recent Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) covering the period FY1999
to end o f CY2006 cited agriculture as "a sector where the Bank under-invests in Cambodia, a
view shared by RGC". In response, the CAS Progress Report committed to "continue targeted
work on constraints to agricultural diversification and productivity increases." An important pre-
requisite to Bank engagement in the sector was accomplished in early 2007 with the formal
adoption by Government o f the Strategy for Agriculture and Water. Similarly, Government's
overarching October 2008 Rectangular Strategy Phase I1 placed the highest priority on
agricultural development, with specific sectoral policy focus and objectives that aligned well
with those inthe Strategy for Agriculture and Water, indicatinga good level o f consensus among
Government and donors. In the context o f the food and financial crisis, the development o f the
agricultural sector gained increased relevance within the broader poverty reductionRMDG
objectives which the CAS supports. Importantly, both Government and donors see continued
Bank support as critical for development o f a programmatic framework which links the
agricultural development strategy to the cross-cutting governance pillars prioritized inthe CAS -
specifically public financial management and public administration reform, decentralization and
demand for good governance, land management and trade facilitation. This agenda will be
supported through follow-on work in the context o f the upcoming Integrated Fiduciary
Assessment and Public Expenditure Review(IFAPER) planned for FY10.

51.     In the case of social protection,the succession of the food, fuel and financial crises
increased Government demand for Bank support. The crises significantly elevated the
priority o f Government to strengthen and broaden social safety nets to avoid significant
deterioration o f the poverty reduction achievements o f recent years. The crises highlighted the
limitedness o f both mechanisms currently available to reach the poor, and o f Government
capacity in designing and implementing safety net programs. The Bank's key role in the
development o f programmatic support for the health and education sectors, and extensive global
experience with a wide range o f safety net modalities have led Government to seek Bank support
in the preparation o f the Government's social protection strategy and o f potential options for
safety net interventions.

    B. Relationshipto Other Bank Operations

52.     The DPO directly complements the Bank Group's growing support to rural-based
poverty reduction and development of social sector services. The DPO complements IFC's
recently launched SME Development in Selected Agri-SectorsNalue Chain Program in
Cambodia, with financing from the European Commission, which provides technical services to
key private sector actors inthe rice and other export oriented agricultural value chains. The DPO
prior actions improve the policy context for private sector input dealers, farmers associations and
investors inrice milling and marketing -all priority areas for the IFC program. IDA and IFC are
also exploring additional, follow-on joint activities, including improved private sector financing
o f agriculture/agri-business, attracting export oriented investors, private technical services for
farmer associations and FWUCs, and strengthening the organization o f input suppliers to
improve industry self-regulation as appropriate. The DPO support to agricultural inputs and
services also complements the systematic land titling in rural areas under the ongoing Land
Management and Administration Project (LMAP) - supported by IDA, CIDA, Finland and
Germany, and the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development Project which
supports distribution o f state lands to smallholders. Similarly, the Bank's overall land dialogue in
Cambodia, supported through the PRGO has emphasized support to smallholder land access over
granting o f large plantations, however the enabling conditions for successful smallholder
agriculture are generally poor given limited, project focused, public support and inadequate input
and output markets. Strengthening rice production and the basis for rice exports, will also
complement the Bank supported Trade Facilitation Project and related PRGO policy dialogue in
which private sector pressures for improving trade logistics and administrative procedures has
focused almost uniquely on the garment sector which i s an important urban employer, but has
shallow linkages to the broader economy and hence constitutes a much more limited and largely
foreign investor dominated constituency for reform compared to the broader agricultural sector
inCambodia.

53.     Social protection elements of the proposed operation are aligned with the Bank's
engagement in strengthening social services. Inparticular, this operation's efforts to promote
the expansion o f harmonized and objective mechanisms targeting the poor, and their adoption
across interventions, i s aimed at improving governance and transparency o f pro-poor
interventions that go beyond safety nets, and is expected to benefit the Bank's Second Health
Sector Support Program as well as the Cambodia Education Sector Support Project.



    C. AnalyticalUnderpinnings

54.     The Cambodia GFRP operation draws upon various pieces of analytical work
undertaken by the Bank and others. Inthe analysis on the effects of the food price increase,
the operation draws on several efforts to analyze the impacts and prioritize responses. At a very
broad level, a Bank study o f the cross-country impacts o f the increase in food prices estimates
that in Cambodia a 10 percent increase in the price o f rice raises national poverty rates by 0.5




                                              26

percentage points - and increases poverty in both rural and urban areas.12 A country specific
study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) assesses constraints to an
effective supply response by smallholder farmers, and identifies access to inputs, particularly
fertilizer, as the primary constraint to improved productivity, followed by limited irrigation
infra~tructure.'~Detailed analysis o f the seed and fertilizer value chains14 has supported
verification o f key issues o f price and quality variation, as well as identifying the risk points for
focused policy and technical interventations. The constraints to greater market integration o f
smallholders through mechanisms such as contract farming, and impediments to increased
private investment in agriculture were assessed in the 2008 Bank Country Economic
Memorandum - Sources o f Growth report and the Agrarian Structure background paper which
placed these constraints inthe context o f land access issues in Cambodia. Another study, carried
out by the Cambodia Development Resource In~titute,'~assesses the impact o f rising food prices
on producers and consumers, especially within vulnerable groups, and identifies opportunities
and obstacles for farmers to benefit from the universal increase in agricultural prices. This work
i s complemented by the IFC sponsored analysis o f key agribusiness value chains which has
identified the importance o f financing constraints to rice mills as an impediment to developing
the export industry. Additional Bank analytical work is assessing the policy, institutional and
logistical issues governing informal and formal trade flows o f rice amongst Cambodia, Vietnam
and Thailand inorder to anticipate the relative incentives for formal and informal exporters.

55.      The preparation of the operation also relied on a 2006 Bank study on Managing Risk and
Vulnerability in Cambodia. The study highlighted the main shortcomings o f Cambodia's social
protection system: assistance i s concentrated on the formal non poor segment o f the population,
and its effectiveness i s hindered by the scarcity o f resources available and the poor targeting
mechanisms. The Cambodia Food Insecurity Assessment, l6based on the 2003/2004 Cambodian
Socio Economic Survey, provided background material on food security, and the GTZ sponsored
assessment o f the Identification o f Poor Households Targeting implementation provided an
important basis for policy dia10gue.l~The operation also drew on the analysis and priorities
identified in the 2006 Cambodia Poverty Assessment in relating the immediate actions to
medium term priorities for poverty reduction,"               and on the 2008 Anthropometric Survey in
gaining information on the nutritional status o f Cambodian~.'~Finally, as a basis to assess the
likely impacts o f the financial crisis, the operation relied on a study elaborated by the Cambodia
Instituteo fDevelopment Studies, which provides estimates on the number o f laidoff workers by

                                V. THEPROPOSED          OPERATION


     A. Overview of Operation

56.      The operation consists of a one tranche Development Policy Operation @PO) of
US$13 million (US$5.0 million equivalent IDA Credit and US$8.0 million GFRP MDTF
Grant) to address critical constraints to household food security and smallholder
agricultural response identified in the context of the food and financial crises. The
development objective o f the proposed DPO is to address the weaknesses in smallholder
agricultural production and social protection systems which have come to light during the Food
Price Crisis. The policy pillars which support this objective are: (i)Accelerate smallholder rice
supply response; (ii)Expand safety net support and improve its governance through better
targeting; and (iii)Strengthenthe oversight of, and learning from, crisis response actions. A DPO
i s considered the most appropriate instrument as it supports the ongoing Government efforts to
respond to the crisis supporting expansion o f fiscal space through accelerated ODA
disbursements, while at the same time supporting critical governance oriented policy and
institutional reforms in support o f smallholder agriculture and expansion o f social safety nets. In
addition, by reflecting policy areas which are high on the agenda o f all stakeholders, it
contributes to the collective efforts o f Government, private sector, NGOs and donors to support
poor households to manage and overcome the impacts o f the food and now financial crises.

57.      This operationwill contributeto Government'sefforts to improvethe transparency
and governance of its pro-poor interventions in response to the crises. In support o f
smallholder agriculture, governance measures include improved oversight and transparency in
regulation o f private fertilizer markets which are generally viewed as unreliable in terms o f
pricing and, particularly, quality assurance. The operation will also support strengthening o f the
role o f community-based agricultural producer associations to better balance their market power
intheir engagement with input and product markets, includingcontract farming, and to advocate
effectively in policy making. In social protection, the support o f the Government efforts to
expand coverage o f the Identificationo f Poor Households targeting system, and to link additional
programs to it, will permit more precise and transparent channeling o f assistance, and reduce
scope for rent-seeking by separating the selection o f beneficiaries from the provision o f benefits.

58.      AusAID is providingtechnicalassistancefunding for follow-up analyticalwork and
capacity building in support of the agricultural productivity and safety nets results. In
agriculture, the technical support will focus on strengthened oversight and public information in
fertilizer markets, strengthening the enabling legal framework for farmer associations to operate
on behalf o f their membership in multiple roles, development o f smart subsidy pilots for

agricultural inputs based on effective technical support and input market development, and
monitoring o f directed agricultural credit efforts and identification o f options to support
expanded private bank financing o f agribusiness. In social protection, the technical assistance
will support the Government in improving implementation procedures and feedbacklcomplaint
mechanisms o f the Identification o f Poor Households targeting system. The technical assistance
will also support labor market and safety net analyses, which are necessary to deepen knowledge
on vulnerability and improve safety net responsiveness, the development o f a safety net and
social protection strategy, and the potential piloting and evaluation o f new safety net
interventions incritical areas addressing main vulnerabilities inCambodia.

59.     The proposed operationalso represents an initialstep for a longer-termengagement
aimed at strengthening food security and resilience to shocks through enhanced
agricultural productivity and safety nets. There is a growing interest in Government and
among donors to improve agricultural productivity o f the poor and existing social protection
interventions to better respond to highvulnerability and continued food and nutritional insecurity
o f poor households, and to improve responsiveness to crises. As these areas are highlighted in
the Government's Rectangular Strategy, it is expected that this interest will outlast the current
food and economic crises. Inthis way, continued technical assistance and evaluation results from
piloted interventions may be used for the design and implementation o f programs aimed at
strengthening vulnerable household resilience to shocks. The definition o f the Bank's continued
support to smallholder agriculture will, in large part, be defined through the results o f the
upcoming IFAPER analysis and related studies which will form the basis for agreement with
Government and partners in the TWG Agriculture and Water on the specific areas where the
Bank's assistance can best complement ongoing efforts and contribute ot realization o f an
increasingly programmatic approach which links the sectoral strategy to Government's broader
reform agendas in results based public expenditure, public administration, decentralization and
climate change. In social protection, the development o f a review o f existing safety net
interventions and o f a social protection strategy will allow identifying gaps in coverage o f
Cambodia's main sources o f vulnerability, such as the pressing nutrition challenge, and initiating
a dialogue about further operational support.

60.     Measuresto promoteimprovednutritionare being integratedintothe mediumterm
agenda. Since the proposed operation concentrates on short-term, policy-focused interventions,
the scope for quickly building on existing nutritional programs i s limited. However, in the
context o f preparation, several opportunities to strengthen nutrition in both social protection and
smallholder agriculture interventions were identified and are being proposed for integration into
the follow-on pilot activities for safety net innovations and agricultural input support, such as a
conditional cash transfer mechanism tied to nutrition, and provision o f vegetable and fruit seeds
and nutritional education to rural households.

    B. Pillar I:AccelerateSmallholderRice Supply Response

61.     Government has taken several, key actions to increase the productivity of
Cambodia's smallholder-basedrice economy to able to supply domestic and international
food needs.
62.     Objective 1: Increase smallholder yields through improved access to and
transparency of seed and fertilizer markets. Cambodia's rice farmers, dominated by
smallholders (over 90% o f rice farms are under 2 hectares) have steadily increased their yields
from an average o f 2.1 metric tons per hectare (MTha) in 2000, to 2.6 M T h a in 2008. This
improvement has been based largely on increased efforts in land management resulting from the
end o f factional conflicts over the past ten years, increased but inconsistent improvements in
security o f land tenure - particularly in the traditional rice growing areas, gradual dissemination
o f improved seed varieties, and some results from investments in irrigation rehabilitation.
However, this yield remains well below potential farm yields based on introduction o f improved
soil management, including fertilizer.        Accordingly, Government has set a goal o f raising
average yields to 3.0 M T h a by 2013 through, inter alia, enhanced access o f smallholders to
quality fertilizer and seed inputs. However, a major constraint to farmer adoption o f fertilizers i s
the absence of effective quality control and labeling with a widespread view that much of the
fertilizer sold in markets is adulterated. Accordingly, in order to stimulate increased use o f
appropriate fertilizer by farmers in the face o f rising international prices, in May 2008,
Government instituted and maintained a suspension o f VAT and import duties on organic and
inorganic fertilizer to reduce prices to farmers. Government is complementing these actions by
distributingimproved seed and vouchers for subsidized fertilizer to smallholders (less than one
hectare o f cultivated land) in the Tonle Sap area with support from ADB and FAO, and
requested assistance to develop "smart subsidy" pilots with assistance from the World Bank and
AusAID, for promoting appropriate use of inputs (seed and organic and inorganic fertilizer) for
productivity and nutritional balance, combined with technical assistance. However, as fertilizer
markets were relatively concentrated inthe past, and the fertilizer sold to farmers was frequently
adulterated or counterfeit, the sustainability o f these measures is dependent on establishing
confidence o f farmers in the private fertilizer markets in Cambodia. Recent analysis o f the
fertilizer value chain (see Annex 5) has identified the key risk points, and preliminary analysis o f
fertilizer samples indicates significant variation in chemical content relative to labeling.
Inorder to strengthenthe credibility ofprivate fertilizer markets inCambodia:

[Prior Action 11Establishing aprice and quality oversight mechanismfor monitoringfertilizer
prices and quality that includes random sampling for price and quality tests throughout the
supply chain, as well as improvedfarmer information and labeling in Khmer.

63.     As a result o f these efforts, it is expected that by 2010, both price and quality variations
will be reduced compared to the baseline survey values. In addition, given clear evidence that
after improved use o f inputs, irrigation provides the strongest boost to smallholder productivity,
Government has also assigned for the first time in its 2009 budget, a specific allocation for
operation and maintenance, and in conjunction with the planned IFAPER, will review options for
developing an institutional mechanism for managing funds which responds to technical and
governance priorities, including strengthening the role o f irrigationusers.



                                               30

64.     Objective2: Strengthenthe role of community based farmer organizationsto access
inputs and credit, technical support and markets and policy inputs. Government's
Rectangular Strategy clearly recognizes that in a country dominated by smallholders,
competitiveness will depend on reducing transactions costs in input, output and policy making
markets through enhanced collective action. In particular, current legal interpretations require
separate registrations o f farmer organizations depending on type o f service being provided such
as for water management, marketing or credit access. Government has an existing Royal Decree
on Agricultural Cooperatives which sets the criteria and process for becoming registered farmer
association, and Government recently increased the budget to support MAFF's registration o f
associations by 60%. However, the pace remains relatively slow - an average o f 2 associations
registered per month per province on average     -  given the immediate importance o f registration
for accessing Government supported inputs, credit and technical assistance. Government has
also identified several legal inconsistencies in the recognition o f different forms o f farmer
associations by different Government institutions, which limit their potential role and services,
including access to credit and voice in policy formulation. Government and stakeholders have
confirmed that there is ample scope to accelerate registration through broader interpretation o f
the existing legislation to recognize pre-cooperative organizations which can provide members
with experience and access to services inparallel with the broader legal review process. Inorder
to address these shortcomings,

[Prior Action 21 Accelerating the registration of farmer organizations based on an additional budget
allocatedfor thispurpose.

65.     Government has also prepared a program for review and possible revision o f the legal
framework to address constraints, which limit their role in supporting development o f the
smallholder sector, while advancing consultations on the most recent draft Subdecree on Farmer
Water User Communities (FWUCs) prior to submissionto Council o f Ministers for adoption.
66.     Objective 3: Improve price incentives through expansion of official rice exports.
Cambodia's production has met or exceeded domestic demand in every year since 1995. This
has provided new opportunities for export oriented production, and in fact, an estimated 1.3
million MT o f paddy move through neighboring countries unofficially, including for export to
third countries. Analysis is on-going regarding the incentives driving the unofficial rice export
markets - primarily through Vietnam and Thailand to identify differences in enabling
environment and policies. Government i s committed to increasing the proportion o f exported
rice which i s sold officially into international markets as a means to improve incentives to
smallholders, and i s working closely with the private sector to pursue a goal o f 2 millionMT per
year. Recognizing the damage o f its export bans to international markets and its own credibility
as a supplier,

[Prior Action 31 Lifting the ban on rice exports through Inter-Ministerial Prakas No. 105.
MOC/SM2008 of April 9, 2008, on Authorization of Exports of all Kinds of Dry Season Rice Grown and
Harvested in Geographical Areas of Prey Veng,Kandal and Take0 Provinces.

67.     A major constraint to achieving the export goal is the limited investment inhigher quality
milling facilities in Cambodia, which serve as the key interface between smallholders and
markets interms o f quality standards and input supply.Accordingly, Government i s also revising

its Investment Law to classify agribusiness investments more favorably in terms o f fiscal
incentives, and has agreed that its Rural Development Bank will work closely with the World
Bank and AusAID in assessing Government's current directed credit efforts and in identifying
alternative means to expand private bank credit to agribusiness, an effort which i s also being
supported by the LFC through its EU-funded S M E Agribusiness Value Chain program which
includes support to the Rice Miller's Association o f Cambodia.



    C. Pillar 11:Expandsafety netsupportand improveits governancethrough better
        targeting

68.     Government has taken important actions to expand, harmonize and improve
governance and effectiveness of safety net interventions in both the short and medium
term.
69.     Objective 1: Expand support of emergency interventions for poor, food insecure
households. Increased food prices affected many land-poor people in rural areas. The
Government reacted promptly to the increase in food prices and quickly mobilized its own and
development partners' resources:


Government expanded support to safety net interventions by:

    i. [Prior Action 41 Signing on April 24, 2008 a Memorandum of Understandingwith the World
        Food Programmefor theprovision during three (3) years of two thousand (2000) metric tonsper
       year of ricefor, inter alia, schoolfeeding andfood for workprograms
    ii. [Prior Action 5' Initiating implementation of emergency safety net assistance in two hundred
        (200) communes through a onetime rice distribution @om October 29 to November 5, 2008) and
        a two (2) yearfood and cashfor workprogramfor 2009 and 2010.

70.     In response to worsening food prices in 2008, Government decided to contribute to the
WFP an additional 1000 metric tons, increasing the overall 2008 contribution to 3000 metric
tons. The rice distribution program and the food- and cash for work program are implemented in
the context o f the ADB-supported Emergency Food Assistance project, but Government has
provided a substantial financial contribution (US$5.08 million out o f a total o f US$40.08
million), and the project is to a large extent implemented using Government structures (with
support o f independent consultants). Government i s currently finalizing the design o f the food-
and cash for work program (Le. identifying subprojects, contractors, and target beneficiaries),
which should be inplace for the 2009 lean season. The interventions target food vulnerable areas
and poor households, either by making use o f the Identification o f Poor Households targeting
system or by including a project-specific targeting component. Transparency and good-
governance o f the interventions has also been sought by including independent monitoring o f
implementation by NGOs, and by establishing a central hotline for recording and addressing
complaints. As a response to the financial crisis, Government i s also considering expanding
further support o f existing safety nets and the implementation o f new safety net interventions in
urban areas, in particular for laid-off workers from the Garment, Construction, and Tourism




                                               32

sectors, and for the youth entering the labor market. Implementation arrangements are however
still under discussion.
71.      Objective 2: Improve governance and effectiveness of safety net interventions
throughthe useof consistentand transparenttargeting. Safety net and pro-poor interventions
are increasingly adopting objective and harmonized pre-identification targeting procedures for
delivering assistance (as opposed to more arbitrary case-by-case selection) as they improve cost-
effectiveness and governance o f aid administration. Pre-identification can also help improving
the effectiveness o f emergency safety net interventions: according to both Government and
Development Partners, the emergency rice distribution program implemented under the ADB-
supported Emergency Food Assistance project performed better (Le. was subject to less
complaints) in areas where it had been able to target assistance to holders o f identification cards
issuedunder the Identificationo fPoor Households targeting system.
72.      Government has therefore mandated the use o f the Identification o f Poor Households
targeting system (the largest and most recognized targeting system in place) in appropriate
emergency interventions supporting the poor. The Ministry o f Planning has also initiated
consultations on and submitted to the Council o f Ministers a draft Sub-Decree mandating the
use o f Identification o f Poor Households Procedures for Identificationo f Poor Households as the
national targeting system, and the use o f the ID Poor data for appropriate safety net
interventions. The adoption o f the Identificationo f Poor Households targeting system will allow
improvements in the governance o f safety net interventions as: (i)It i s a systematic approach
with standard procedures and criteria for identifying poor households; (ii)It separates the agent
who carries out the targeting from that who carries out the distribution o f benefits, hence
minimizing the possibility o f bias and favoritism during program implementation; (iii)
Community involvement in the identification process, as well as the established feedback and
complaint mechanisms, allow for a transparent and participatory identification process. The
adoption o f the Identificationo f Poor Households targeting system by multiple programs should
also reduce the relative costs o f targeting. Between 2007 and the end o f 2009, more than 7000
villages will have been covered by the Identification o f Poor Households procedures, whether
implemented by the Ministryo f Planning or partner organizations. In an ideal situation, pro-poor
interventions should attempt at using only a few targeting systems (albeit with some flexibility
and allowing for ex-post qualification mechanisms to correct for exclusion errors and the
specificities o f the program), as this would minimize costs o f usage.
73.      A relevant bottleneck for the adoption of the Government's Identification o f Poor
Householdstargeting system by programs other than HealthEquityFunds, which operate at local
level, is its limited geographical coverage. Government i s however mandating its expansion to
3000 additional villages in2009:




                                             33

Government implements effective targeting of safety net interventions by:

    i. [Prior Action 61 Expanding the roles and responsibilities of the National Food Security
         Task Force to ensure and monitor the application of the Identijkation of Poor
        Households Targeting System in the distribution of food and agriculture materials to
        poor households and of cash andfood for work program under the purview of said Task
        Force.
    ii. Initiating consultations on and submitting to the Council of Ministers a Draft Sub-decree
         mandating the use of the procedures for Identijkation of Poor Households as the
         national targeting system and the use of the ID Poor data for appropriate safety net
         interventions.
    iii. Mandating the expansion of the ID Poor targeting system to cover 3000 additional
         villages

74.      This operation has also permitted initiatinga dialoguesupportingthe development
and harmonizationof safety nets. At the second CDCF held in December 2008, Government
mandated the FSN TWG, co-led by CARD and WFP, to review existing social protection
interventions and prepare a strategy for social protection development. Given the limited scope
o f existing public safety net interventions, and the previously limited interest from Government
for developing safety nets, such a mandate signaled increased Government recognition o f the
need for safety nets, and represented a major step forward towards the development o f
Government-implemented safety net interventions (as opposed to donor-implemented) tailored to
the Cambodian context. Subsequently, at the February 3,2009 meeting ofthe FSNTWG, CARD
proposed to review social protection interventions and develop a social protection strategy by
December 2009. The Bank team took actively part in the dialogue, and is providing technical
support to CARD and WFP to review, in consultation with FSN TWG stakeholders, existing
safety net interventions and prepare a strategy for social protection development.



    D. Pillar 111: Strengthenoversight of, and learningfrom, crisis responseactions

75.      As emergency responses and crisis policy actions being taken have broad
implications for Cambodia's agricultural and social protection agendas, Government
recognizes the need to ensure good-governance and effective implementationas well as to
ensure broad-based learning amongst stakeholders as input to the medium term
development agenda.

76.      Objective 3: Improved governance and effectiveness of Government emergency
response and crisis policy actions. Crisis policy actions are coordinated by the Food Crisis
Coordination Committee led by MEF. The committee had initially only a monitoring and
coordination role in the context o f the ADB-supported Food Emergency Assistance Project, the
largest response to the food crisis, but its function has been expanded to oversee the crisis actions
relatedto smallholder agriculture and social protection inresponse to the economic slowdown. In
order to ensure that the crisis policy actions benefit smallholders and the poor, and to determine
the need for any complementary actions or field support, its monitoring and evaluation role

needs to guarantee a transparent and effective implementation of the crisis actions, and to
providethe basis to support bothenhancedpreparedness for future shocks as well as inputto the
medium term sectoral agendas. Accordingly, the Food Crisis Committee, with support from
ADB, established an independentmonitoringsystem basedonNGOmonitoringto oversee target
group selection,distributionof food and inputs, organizationand management of cash- and food-
for-work program,and compliancewith fiduciary requirements.The FoodCrisis Committeewill
prepare quarterly implementation reports that will include progress in the implementation of
smallholder agriculture and social protection policy actions, to be shared and discussed with
stakeholders inthe contextofthe TWGAW andTWGFSN, andpostedonMEF'swebsite:

[Prior Action 71Establishing a monitoring andpublic reporting mechanism on the implementation of
activities under the overview of the National Food Security TaskForce; (a) said monitoring mechanism
and the resulting quarterly reports to cover, inter alia, distribution of fertilizer and seed to smallholders,
registration of farmer organizations, measures to improve rice exports, safety nets for food vulnerable
households, and application of the Identification of Poor Households Targeting System; and (3) said
quarterly reports to be publically disseminated,including through the Ministry of Economy and Finance
website and through technical workinggroupsfor agriculture, water,food security and nutrition. .


                              VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

    A. Implementation,Monitoring,and Supervision..

77.      The operation has been developed by Government's Food Crisis Committee,
coordinated by MEF, and which includes, inter alia, MAFF, MOWRAM, MOP, CARD,
MRD.Inthe context of the proposedoperation,the committee is responsiblefor workingwith
the Bank and other stakeholders to develop the proposed operation, as well as to monitor
achievement of prior actions. Individual line ministries are responsible for the specific prior
actions and benchmarks under their jurisdiction. In terms of follow-up implementation and
related benchmarks, the Food Crisis Committeewill also prepare quarterly reports to be shared
with TWGAW and TWGFNto monitorprogress towards anticipatedresults.The TWGs provide
the forum for Government's technical ministries, donors and other stakeholders to identify
additional policy and implementation actions which require their support, including activities
whichwill be supportedthroughthe AusAID-WBpartnership.

78.      Evaluation will take place in the context of an ImplementationCompletionReport
to be prepared by the Bank and the Food Crisis Committee, approximately 12 months
following the operation's disbursement.The ICR will assess the implementationof the prior
actions, progress on benchmarks and complementary activities, and the broader sectoralresults
achieved, with indicationsofthe role ofthe prior actions.

     B. Povertyand SocialDimensions

79.      The proposed operation is expected to improvethe effectiveness and poverty focus
of the Government's responseto the food and financialcrises. The measures supported by the
operation are expected to achieve this goal by improving income generating processes o f
smallholder agriculture suppliers, expanding safety net interventions, and by improving the
ability o f Government to target social interventions.

80.      The DPO prior actions 1 to 3, which are focused on increasing agricultural
productivity, are expected to increase overall agricultural output, reduce food prices,
increase food consumptionand support reductionin poverty. Current analysis o f the impacts
o f agricultural productivity increases in developing countries21 has estimated that for Cambodia,
an increase in agricultural productivity o f 7.6% (in the case o f rice, the dominant crop, this
would be an increase in average yields from current 2.6 M T h a to 2.8 MTha) would increase
overall agricultural output by 6.9% and lead to a reduction o f food prices o f 6.2% and increase in
food consumption o f 2.9%. The impact on poverty i s estimated as a reduction o f 3 percent based
on a US$1 per day poverty line. The estimated reduction inpoverty would be much higher based
on the average (rural and urban) national poverty line which is closer to the equivalent o f
US$0.50 per day. Analysis o f agricultural production was carried out based on the 2004
household survey and the 2007 update in order to determine the factors which have the greatest
impact on agricultural productivity and incomes. Production function analysis22indicates that
fertilizer has, by far, the most important impact on productivity (elasticities o f 0.22 to 0.45
depending on crop type) with just a 25 percent increase in fertilizer use across crops, equivalent
to increased expenditures on fertilizer o f US$8 per hectare (wet season rice) to US$40 per
hectare (cash crops) needed to attain the 7.6% productivity increase. The DPO supports policy
actions focused on increasing access to quality fertilizer as the most expedient means to increase
agricultural productivity.

81.      Analysis also confirms that the poverty reduction benefits of the DPO supported
reforms should be sustainable, given the high returns at the individual farm level. Cost
benefit ratios were derived from the production function equations to estimate the returns to use
o f improved inputs. Fertilizer demonstrated the highest estimated marginal returns in terms o f
Riels o f additional output value for an additional Riel o f fertilizer cost. Returnswere consistently

high(see Table 4) under a wide range of input and output price scenarios. These figures suggest
that assisting smallholders to integrate appropriate fertilizer and improved seed use into their
farming systems will provide sustainable payoffs. These returns are significantly increased with
access to irrigation and credit - areas which the DPO policy actions also support.

82.         Simulations suggest that the level of assistance provided through the interventions
implemented as part of Prior Actions 4 and 5, if perfectly targeted to the poor, could
reduce the poverty impact of the food price crisis by one to one and the half percentage
p0ints.2~The food distribution program under the ADB-supported Emergency Food Assistance
Project distributed 35Kg o f rice rations to poor rural households, for a total amount o f
approximately US$8.3 million. Simulations suggest that, if perfectly targeted, US$5.0 million o f
aid conveyed through such a program would reduce the poverty impact o f increased food prices
in rural areas from 3.29 to 2.48 percent, and that US$lO.O million of assistance could reduce it
further to 2.21 percent.24 Similarly, if US$lO.O million in aid were distributed in transfers
equivalent to the value o f lOOKg o f rice25to poor rural households (i.e. the maximum amount
given to each household by the WFP in its food for work program), the poverty impact o f the
crisis would be reduced from 3.29 to 1.87 percent.

83.         Poor targeting can however significantly reduce the effectiveness of safety net
responses to the crises. The worse the targeting, the more funds are required to achieve the
same poverty reduction impact. As an example, simulations suggest that, under perfect targeting,
ifUS$lO.Omillionassistancewere distributedintransfersequivalentto thevalue of35Kgofrice
(as under the ADB emergency project) in rural areas, the poverty impact o f the crisis would be
reduced by 1.08 percentage points (from 3.16 to 2.4 percentage points, see Table 5: Mitigation
effect o f different levels o f aid). Yet, should a fifth o f the households receiving this assistance
not actually be poor, the poverty mitigation effect would reduce to 0.83 percentage points, from
3.16 to 2.33 percentage points, (see Figure 4: Impact o f aid on change in poverty rate under
different levels o f aid leakage).

84.      Steps being taken through Prior Action 6, aimed at expanding and increasingthe
use of the Identificationof Poor Households targeting system will contribute therefore to
povertyalleviationby focusing moreassistanceprogramson peoplein need. These measures
will increase the cost efficiency o f interventions by reducing inclusion errors, thus opening up
fiscal room for expansion, increased level o f benefits, or implementation o f additional programs.
However, for the Identification o f Poor Households system to have a high impact on poverty
mitigation, it is crucial to maintain a post-identification mechanism and to update regularly the
list o f households entitled to an ID Poor card, in order to allow the inclusion o f households who
fell into poverty after the identification process occurred, and to exclude households who fell out
o f poverty. Without such update mechanisms, the poverty mitigation impact o f safety nets can be
reduced significantly. As an example, simulations suggest that if distributed to individuals who
were poor before the crisis, a total o f US$lO.O million in assistance inrural areas would mitigate
the poverty impact of higher food prices by 0.4 percentage points.26 If, however, the same
assistance were delivered to individuals who were found to be poor after the crisis, the mitigation
effect would rise significantly to 1.08 percentage points.



    C. EnvironmentalAspects

85.      The policy and institutional actions supported under the proposed operation are expected
to result in significant, positive effects on the environment through their support o f measures
which should reduce the current pressures for rapid and anarchic agricultural expansion. In the
absence o f measures to improve agricultural productivity and provide alternative employment to
the rural poor in times o f crisis, the poor will continue to view expansion o f the agricultural
frontier into forested and even protected areas as the sole means o f livelihood support. The prior
actions o f the proposed operation are expected to result in enhanced incentives and capacities for
smallholders to intensify labor allocation on existing cultivated areas, and to expand safety net
activities such as food and cash for work, which provide an alternative to agriculture for the most
vulnerable. At the same time, improving the labeling and knowledge for fertilizer use can help
to reduce the often higher than required amounts currently applied due to uncertain quality and
poor labeling, as well as limited understanding o f efficient application rates.

86.      Interms ofthe capacity of Government and local communities to implement the existing
environmental safeguards associated with input distribution under the programs implemented by
Government with ADB and FA0 assistance, in the case o f ADB, an environmentally focused
agricultural N G O - CEDAC - has been contracted to support technical dissemination to farmers
as well as monitor use o f inputs in conjunction with Government extension staff, while FA0
technical staff support extension agents and communities in a similar manner. In the case o f
small scale civil works under food or cash for work programs, a check list is used. Moreover, the
Rural Investment and Local Governance Project also supports capacity building for commune
implementers and provincial oversight. The Bank is further supporting subnational capacity for

environmental screening, assessment and monitoring through an on-going Institutional
Development Fund Grant with the Ministry o f Environment, and is considering expansion o f
these activities under a proposedenvironment project inFY2011.



    D. Collaborationwith IMFand OtherDonors

87.    Although the IMFdoes notcurrently havea PovertyReductionand GrowthFacility
operation in Cambodia, the IMF and Bank work closely together in monitoring and
advocating pro-poor growth policies with Government. This is reflected in the recent IMF
Article IVYas well as in Government    - donor  meeting statements, which highlightthe need for
enhanced attention to agricultural growth and for the development o f an effective social
protection system in order to mitigate the impact on the poor o f internal and external shocks to
the economy.

88.    The proposed operation was developed through close cooperation with other
donors, building on existing Government-donor coordination mechanisms. The proposed
policy actions and benchmarks as well as the proposed follow-on activities, including the
IFAPER and pilots - were identified in consultation with the TWGAW and TWGFN to ensure
that they support a broader donor consensus on support to Government. The donor members o f
the TWGsprovidedclear guidance on the issues and sequencing o f actions which would be most
useful in advancing the broader agendas around agricultural and social protection support. In
addition, given the importance o f the ADB's Emergency Food Assistance Project, preparation o f
the DPO and identification o f follow-up actions has been carried out in close consultation with
ADB staff to ensure a consistent and supportive approach with Government on crisis actions.
Similarly, the missions have worked closely with GTZ's technical support for development o f
the Identification o f Poor Households system, and the relevant UN technical agencies,
specifically WFP, FA0 and UNICEF in discussing specific measures to support food and
nutrition safety nets and smallholder agriculture.

89.     Importantly, the programof actions and follow up supportactivitiesof the proposed
operation has been identified through joint work with AusAID, who has committed
fundingfor technicalassistance. Giventhe interest o f Government, donors andNGOsto ensure
that the immediate actions link effectively to the medium term agendas formulated by the TWGs,
AusAID has worked closely with the Bank to identify a series o f further analytical and capacity
buildingwork. The technical assistance would support effective implementation o f prior actions,
as well as address related policy and institutional constraints which require additional assessment
and buildingo f consensus on reform actions.


    E. LessonsLearned

90.     This GFRP operation draws upon lessons learned globally by the World Bank, as
well as within the Cambodian context by Government and development partners, both in
the donor community and in civil society. The main global lessons include the application o f
good practice principles on conditionality (Box l),    as well as experience from past crises on


                                             39

poverty alleviation and safety net interventions, especially on what relates to leveraging
resources and usinga commonly agreed results framework for monitoring and evaluation.
91.     In terms of the Cambodian context, the operation builds on the experience in the
development and dialogue for the StructuralAdjustment Credits, Poverty Reduction and
Growth Operationsseries, and various sectoral programs.For all these, governance reforms
have been identified as critical to sectoral progress. However, effectiveness o f reforms is fully
dependent on Government ownership o f the results framework and consensus across a wide
range o f stakeholders (Government, private sector, NGOs, donors) on the priority actions to be
taken. In cases where this consensus has been reached or has deteriorated, achievement o f
actions and implementation o f reforms has consistently been delayed or undermined.
Accordingly, although the proposed operation highlightscritical and at times sensitive reforms,
it has been based on broad stakeholder consultation and feedback, and is presentedas support to
ajoint Government and development partner agenda inthe relevant areas.

     F. ParticipationandConsultations

92.     Preparation of the DPO relied on consultation with civil society organizations
representingsmallholder farmers,NGOsand the privatesector, as well as directfield visits
to safety net beneficiaries and discussions with food deficit and smallholder farm
communities. Both group and individual meetings were held together with stakeholders
representatives, and covered technical and governance reform priorities, as well as proposed
prior actions and benchmarks. The priorities identified in these meetings were presented to
Government and donors, in order to support prioritization o f proposed policy actions and follow
up activities. Interms o f smallholder agriculture, farmers and NGOsplacedparticular emphasis
on strengthening the role o f farmer associations, and encouraged acceleration o f the registration
process. These groups also raised concerns regarding the quality o f agricultural inputs and their
misuse. The private sector prioritized the need to build Cambodia's reputation as a reliable
exporter o f quality rice through supportive policies for export and investment in rice milling. In
terms o f social protection, communities and NGOs emphasized the lack o f sufficient resources
and continued need for assistance to poor vulnerable groups. Both NGOs and donors familiar
with the Identification o f Poor Households system confirmed the advantages of having a
common basis for targeting assistance to the poor. Government has recognized the consistency o f
the DPO's priorities with those stated in its Rectangular Strategy. Government also decided to
ensure that the monitoring process provides information broadly as well as a forum for
exchanging views on lessons learned and other, revealed priorities for achieving the agreed
objectives in smallholder agriculture and social protection.


     G. FiduciaryAspects

93.     Significant progress has been made over the last few years in developing an
improved basis for addressing fiduciary risks. The 2003 IFAPER, which incorporated a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and which was followed by a Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in 2004, concluded that the overall level o f fiduciary
risk in Cambodia was high.Highfiduciary risk is a result ofweak control over public expenditure
execution, which derives from unreliable systems and procedures. The Public Financial
Management Reform Program (PFMRP) was set up by the Government following the 2003
IFAPER.The PFMRP is ledby the Ministryof Economy and Finance (MEF)through the Reform
Committee, and is supported by a number o f the Development Partners (DPs) includingthe World
Bank; the program has formulated as platforms and stages with an aim to strengthen the PFM
system.

94.     The first stage of the PFMRP was just completed. The work under this stage focused
on MEF in improving budget credibility through: (a) adoption and progressive implementation o f
an improved Government revenue policy, revenue forecasting and administration; (b) improved
budget formulation and comprehensiveness; (c) improvements in existing centralized budget
execution systems; and (d) improved cash and bank account management. In addition, a number
o f preparatory activities (Le., legislative enhancement, Chart o f Accounts, FM information system
(FMIS) specification, program budgeting pilot) for later platforms have been implemented. The
reforms under Platform Ihave been a significant factor in: (a) improving revenue performance;
(b) significantly reducing payments made by cash; (c) enacting legislation on budget and


                                               42

procurement;(d) progressiveimplementationof a GFS compliantclassification; and (e) improved
aggregate control of expenditure. Equally important, the implementation of the PFMRP has
further demonstratedthe RGC's commitment to makingprogress inPFMreform and its capacity
to drive change. However, this stage was just a startingpoint, and as yet has only limitedimpact
on reducingthe country fiduciary risk. Stage 11, which was just effective (see below), is focused
on strengthening financial accountability. The achievement of Stage I1 outputs will thus
contribute and help in substantially reducing the country fiduciary risk. In 2007, the External
ReviewPanel, an independent assessment of progress and impactof the PFMRP, consideredthat
the MEF has achieved, throughthe wide range of tasks completedon CAP Activities 1to 11,the
Platform 1objectiveofhavinga `more crediblebudget'27.Transitionalperiodwas agreed inApril
2007 when the preparation for the Platform 2 took place. See Table 6 for a summary o f the
performanceevaluationfor Platform 1.

95.     The objective o f Stage 11, which became effective in fiscal year 2009, as the formulation
o f the Platform 2 planning for which took longer than anticipated due largely to the general
elections, includes further progress on Platform 1 and achievement of Platform 2 activities,
strengthened financial accountability in MEF, Line Ministries and Sub National Government.
This encompasses: (a) clarifying roles, functions and responsibilitiesbetween various levels of
Government and within spending institutionsthrough updating and reviewing laws; (b) further
implementationofthe new budget classificationand new chartof accounts; (c) implementationof
improved budget execution, accounting and financial management information systems; (d)
improved statutory financial reporting and transparency; (e) improved external and internal
auditing and responsiveness to audit findings; (f) implementation of a fiscal decentralization
framework; and (8) capacity development. Achievement of these objectives will result in
progressivelyimprovingcapacity at line ministry and sub-nationallevels and aims specifically at
addressing the key fiduciary risk issues. All line ministries have now prepared detailed action
plans to support achievement of these objectives and established reform cells to facilitate
implementation. DP support in the form of Technical assistance, training and FMIS system
implementationhas been mobilized to support the reform program. Stage 2 also provides for
further preparatory work towards improving comprehensiveness and integration of the budget
through integration of recurrent and capital budgets, strengthening of the program budgeting
system and deepening of the ongoingMediumTerm ExpenditureFramework (MTEF). A second
independent assessment by the ExternalReview Panel is plannedin mid-2009coincidedwith the
2009 IFAPERexercise. See Table 6 for a summary of the performanceevaluationfor Platform2.

audits that have identified several challenges in terms of the revenue collection, cash
management, accounting, and financialreporting.Currentaudit methodologiesare compliance

audit manual has been developed with the supported from the recent closed IDF grant and further
support will be made through the PFMRP, Stage I1 in strengthening audit methodologies and

97.          The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has been subject to a full IMF Safeguard
Assessment. The assessment, completed in March 2004, addressed four broad areas and made
specific recommendations to strengthen: external audit, legal structures and independence,
financial reporting, and internal audit and control. The IMF Country Report No. 09/47, February
2009, commended the Cambodian authorities for maintaining sound macroeconomic policies,
including strong budget performance, against the backdrop o f an increasingly difficult external
environment. The report mentioned that the current monetary stance i s broadly appropriate, but
conditions require close watch to avoid excessive tightening and aggravating risks to banking
system. Sound monetary operations at the NBC also hinge on better internal coordination to
ensure policy consistency. And recently, NBC also requested to conduct an updated safeguard
assessmentas the previous one was since 2004.

98.          Fiduciary arrangements benefit from lessons from the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Operation (PRGO) series. The proceeds o f PRGO Iflowed to the Deposit Account at
National Bank o f Cambodia managed by MEF through the Department o f Investment and
Corporation (DIC), with the recording and crediting o f the amount into the national budget by
the National Treasury was deferred by one year. As a result, the Treasury was only informed of
the deposit and able to record and receipt as part of TSA following the Bank supervision
mission. The issue has been fixed by MEF now to prevent this from occurring in the next DPO
through associating the specimen signature o f the National Treasury inthe Deposit Account, and
to monitor the flow o f funds at NBC, for the purpose o f this operation, a dedicated Deposit
Account will be established (see Table 6 below) and will form part o f the country's official
foreign exchange reserves.

Cambodia, represented by Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF). The total financing i s for an
amount equivalent to US$13 million (US$8 million grant from Global Food Crisis Response
Program -Australia funding, and US$5 million equivalent IDA Credit), on standard IDA terms to
be released in one tranche following approval of the Grant and Credit and notification by the
Association o f the effectiveness. The completion o f the prior actions and the maintenance o f a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework are sufficient to release the tranche.

at National Bank o f Cambodia (NBC) in the name o f National Treasury, MEF on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. The only funds paid to this account would be the proceeds o f the
SASPSO.

101.        Disbursements. Upon notification by IDA o f effectiveness o f SASPSO, and with the
submission by the Recipient o f a withdrawal application, the total financing proceeds will be
deposited by IDA into the dedicated DA o f the Recipient held at NBC. Within thirty days, an
equivalent amount shall be converted into Riel and credited to the National Treasury (NT)
Account available to finance the budgeted expenditure o f the Government. Disbursements will
not be linked to specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. However,

the financing proceeds cannot be used for ineligible expenditures (i.e. to finance goods and
services from the IDA'Sstandard negative list as reflected in the Financing Agreement). If, after
deposit into the Deposit Account, part or all o f the financing proceeds are used for ineligible
expenditures, IDA will require the Recipient to either (i)return the amount to the account for use
for eligible purposes, or (ii)refund the amount directly to IDA. Transactions and balances o f the
funds will be fully incorporated into the Government's accounting records and financial
statements.

the amount received from IDA and deposited in the NBC's foreign currency DA; (ii)the
equivalent amount in Riel subsequently transferred from the foreign currency DA to the NT
Account for the budget support operation. The RGC will provide to IDA a confirmation o f funds
receipts within thirty days o f disbursement and the report extracted from its accounting records,
to show the receipt and transfer o f the funds (including the dates and namednumbers o f the
dedicated foreign currency account inwhich the amount has been deposited and its equivalent in
Riel that has been credited to the National Treasury Account available to finance the budgeted
expenditure o f the Government), the classification o f the grandcredit, the Treasury receipt, and a
bank reconciliation statement with the TSA. The Financing Agreement gives IDA the right to
require the Recipient to audit the Deposit Account through agreed terms o f references. The
Recipient agreed to review, under the Public Financial Management Reform, the future revenue

    I.RisksandRiskMitigation

103.    The primary risks which may impact the achievement of results and objectives
concern governance, capacityand policies. Mitigation and management o f these risks is based
on a combination o f (i)measures being built into implementation and monitoring to increase
transparency, (ii)technical assistance arrangements working with domestic and international
agencies and civil society organizations, and (iii)institutional arrangements aligned to
Government's own priority objectives. These measures build upon mechanisms in existence
and/or which have demonstrated effectiveness inthe Cambodian context. Nonetheless, even with
these efforts, the overall risks associated with achievement of results remains medium to high.

Risksand their assessed importance           Mitigating factors and recommendations
4. Macroeconomic risks:

4.1 slowdown of growth caused by spillovers In view      of the near-team outlook,          a
from the globalfinancial crisis.             countercyclical easing of fiscal policy is being
                                             adopted in 2009. Cambodia approved a 2009
                                             budget with an overall budget deficit of 4
                                             percent of GDP, while the IMF subsequently
                                             recommended enlarging the deficit to 4.8
                                             percent of GDP and to finance this expansion
                                             through accelerated disbursements of official
                                             developmentassistance (ODA).

4.2 Higher inflation.                        The RGC responded to inflation presssures
                                             with a mix of tighter monetary policy and
                                             conservative fiscal policy. These policies,
                                             combined with a radically different external
                                             environment, brought inflation down from 26
                                             percent in May 2008 to 13 percent in
                                             December 2008.

4.3 Possible strain on the banking sector as Bank reserve requirements have been recently
the economy slows down.                      decreased from 16 to 12 percent following a
                                             rapid tightening of liquidity conditions due to
                                             capital outflows in late 2008. This decrease
                                            was combinedwith the creationof an overdraft
                                             facility by the National Bank of Cambodia
                                             (NBC) to increase liquidities, and the adoption
                                             of new prudential regulations to tighten
                                            supervision. Bank resolution plans are also
                                            being formulated to provide a solid framework
                                            for dealing effectively with troubled banks.

  developmentand poverty reduction.

  The NrdionuI S;rateg& Dewloptnent Plan (2006201@, has been formulated using the
  comprehensive Rectangular Strategy of the Royal Government of Cambodia and synthesbe~
  various policy documents (Cambodia Millennium Development Goals, National Poverty
  Reduction Strategy, National Popufation Policy, e&.) and through extensive consultationswcrt
  also held among all stakeholders. The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006-10,
  contained in this document should therefore be consided an operational and guiding tool to
 achievethe said objectives, goals and targets. The NSDP is therefore a practical,resuItorientd

 To ensure a rural focus for p e r t y alleviation, allocations haveto ba more for activitieswhich

  Impnctof the Foodand Fuet, andthe GlobalFinancialCrises

 Although most Cambodiansdependon fanning, and Cambodia isa net exportar ofrice, the rapid
  increase in food and fuel prices in early 2008 had a significant, negative impact on many poor
 Cambodians. Given the highcost of food for the urbanpoor and rural laborers, and the gib in
 pricesfor agricultural inputs, particuhrlyfertiiim, the numberof poor mighthave increasedback
 slightly up to 3%.     In response, the Royal Government undertook a number of m-s,
 including financing of rice for distribution at subsidd prices into key markets to try to
 counteract speoulativepressures, suspension of importduties and VAT on food and agriculhrtel
 inputs, expansionof foodfor work andagriculturalinputdistributionfor the poor,andsuspension
 ofriceexportsinthe face ofhighlyvolatile internationalriceprim.

 The arrival of the global financial crisis may have longer-lasting and broader impacts on
 Cambodia. Being in the economic globalizationmainstream, Cambodia is also affectsdby this
 aisis. Whether the impact will stay for a longer or shorter time depends on external factors,
 particularlyin the US and Europe. When the world's economy        recov~t8,Cambodia's sconomy
 will ais0 pickup. Overall, the cumnt global fmancial and economic crisis has led to Some risks

The Royal Government's priority in this crisis context is to ensure that the devdopment and
poverty reduction achievements of Cambodia over the past two decades are not lost, and to

  Furthmon. theRoyalGovernment is canmittedtoimprovethegovernance andeffeotivene!s of
  its safety net interventionsthrough the useofconsistent and transpsrent targeting. Accordingly, a
  key policy action under the SASPO (Prior Action 6) is to mMdatc the use of the
  Government's IdentificationofPoorHousholds(ID Poor)targeting system (the               and most
  racognhdtargetingsystem inplace) inappropriate emergency interventionssupportingthewr.
  The Ministry of Planning has also initiated consultations on and submitted to the &Unci1 of
  Ministersa draft Sub-Decree mandatingthe use oflD Poor Procedurefor Identifmtionof Poor
  Householdslls the nationaltargeting system, andthe useof IDPoor datafor appmpiatesa@` net
  intcmntions. The adqtion of thc ID Poor targeting system will allow improvements in the
  governance of safety nets interventions as: (i) It is a systematic ntk-based a w h which
  standardp d u ~ c and criteria for identifyingpow Households;(ii)It sepentcsthe agent who
                        s
  carriesout the targetingfrom that who carries out the distributionof benefits, henceminimizing
  the possibility of bias and fworitism during prcgnun implementation; (iii) Community
  involvement in the identification process, as well as the established feedback and complaint
  mechanisms, allow far a bansparcytand participatoryidentification process.The adoptionofthe

1.       Despite improvingtrends, Government budget for the social sector remainslow by
E M standards. Government budget for social ministries increased by half a percentage point
between 2004 and 2009, to 3.1% o f GDP (Figure 4).28However, this proportion remains lower
than the regional level: by comparison, average EAP public spending in education alone was 4.3
percent in2004 (Figure 4).

2.       Given the current budget structure, it is hard to determinethe levelof Government
spending on social protectionand safety nets. The new budget structure, inuse since 2007, has
two chapters (64 and 65) in which there are items labeled as social interventions, namely items
64.5, 65.7 and 65.Sa2' Government expenditure on these items amounted to a total o f
US$18lmillion across all Government agencies in 2008, showing a 55% increase since 2007
(Table 8). Given the level o f aggregation in the budget, it is not possible however to determine
how much o f this amount goes to social protection and safety net activities, and how much to

*'Here  defined as Education, Health, Social Affairs and Veterans, Labor and Vocational Training and Women
Affairs. The RGC also classifies as social Ministries: Information, Culture and Fine Arts, Environment, Public
Worship and Religion (see Table 8). However, for the purpose o f this review, a more conventional definition o f
*'Chapter
social sectors is adopted.
           64.5 is called "Allowances and Social Transfers", and includes: .1 Family 2. Health and birth giving 3.
Death 4. Retirement 5. Demission 6. Work accidents and Invalidity 7. Orphans o f personnel 8. Other 9. Return
Attenuation.    Chapter 65.7 refers to "Social Assistance", which includes 1. Assistance for hospitalization 2.
Medicaments 3. Food and supplies 4. Natural Disaster 5. Research Stipends 6. Local scholarships and research 7.
Scholarships and research for abroad 8. Others. Chapter 65.8 refers to "Subsidies to cultural and social entities",
including subsidies to 1. Communities 2. To orphan centers 3. For travel scholarships 4. For the Red Cross 5. For
sport and culture community 6. To rehabilitation centers7. King affairs (King's charity programs).




                                                              68

other types o f social interventions. Furthermore, nearly all existing Government agencies report
spending on these chapters, though not all are actually mandatedwith a social agenda. The large
observed increase in social spending between 2007 and 2008 i s in fact due to a large extent to
increases in spending by non social ministries, such as Ministry o f Water Resources and
Meteorology, the Constitutional Council, the Ministry o f Industry, Mine and Energy, and the
MinistryofAgriculture, Forestry and Fishery. As a consequence, it is hardto assess whether the
observed increase corresponds to an actual increase in spending on social programs (inparticular
safety nets).

3.      Most social protection spending appears however to target public employees and
formalsector workers, and programsthat are not safety nets. The Ministry o f Social Affairs,
Youth and Veteran Rehabilitation (MoSA), responsible for social security programs for public
sector employees, and the Ministry o f Labor and Vocational Training (MoLVT), responsible for
private sector workers, spent roughly US$35.7m on social interventions in 2008, 98% o f which
was spent by the MoSA (US$35.0). The bulk o f MoSA spending goes towards civil service
pensions and veterans benefits: all retired and disabled civil servants and veterans, as well as
their widows and orphans are entitled to benefits inthe form o f pension and compensation. The
MoLVT on the other hand, is responsible for the National Social Safety Fund (NSSF),
established in 2008, which is set to provide by 2012 all private sector employees o f firms with
more than eight employees with: i)Employment injury coverage, ii)Health insurance, and iii)
Pension coverage. With the introduction o f the NSSF, social spending o f the M o L V T increased
by over 300% since 2007, to roughly US$668 thousand in2008. As o f February 2009, the NSSF
had enrolled roughly 400 firms in the Employment injury scheme, about 250 o f which are
garment factories, covering a total o f roughly 300,000 workers.30

6.           UNICEF is                  also an active development partner supporting the RGC in
implementingsafety net programs. The UNICEF country program spans across various lines
o f social protection, ranging across education, child rights and nutrition. Since 2006, UNICEF
has invested roughly US$16million per year on safety net interventions, and plans to invest an
additional US$l3million for 2009 and 2010, respectively (Table 6).                                                           UNICEF focuses its
attention to six priority provinces: Kampong Speu, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, Kampong Thom,
Stung Treng and Otdar Meanchey.

7.        Government also strongly relies on development partners, mainly WFP and
UNICEF, for support to nutritional assistance. The WFP channels its nutrition interventions
through the Mother and Child Health program, described above. UNICEF supports the RCG in
its National Nutrition Program through the Child Survival Program, by providing nutritional
assistance to mothers and children in the form o f micronutrients, and providing nutritional
education (Le. training mothers on breastfeeding and feeding practices). 31 Despite these efforts
and the progress already achieved, malnutrition levels in Cambodia remain high, and much work
remains to be done inthis area (see the Poverty Profile).

8.       Over the past the RGC has also implemented a program of labor intensivepublic
works (Labor-Based Appropriate Technologies, LBAT) to generate employment through
the improvementand maintenanceof essential rural infrastructure. These technologies are
"pro-poor" in that they provide employment to people living in rural areas and at the same time
contribute to the development o f the country's rural infrastructure. The program's overall goal
was to demonstrate the potential for increasing the direct poverty reduction impact o f the
national road network and mobilize road maintenance funds for the provincial Governments. The
program's purpose was also to pilot-test sustainable decentralized finance and management o f
labor-intensive road maintenance. The RCG implemented this project through two agencies, the
Ministryof RuralDevelopment andthe Ministryof Infrastructure and Roads, and coordinated its
efforts though the Technical Working group on Planning and Poverty Reduction as well as the
Technical Working group on Private Sector Development. The ILO and the ADB have been the
main development partners to this program.

1.      Agriculture remains a major component o f Cambodia's economy. The agricultural sector
accounts for over 30% o f Cambodia's GDP and about 57% o f total employment. Sectoral
performance has improved consistently, if unevenly due to its susceptibility to weather
variations, over the past decade, as agricultural GDP grew by an average o f 4.0% per annum
(Figure l), by labor productivitygrowth o f about 2% per year.

2.      Within the agricultural sector, rice remains the principal source o f growth (over 40%),
and i s the dominant production activity for over 80% o f all farmers, accounting for 84.4% o f
cultivated land, as compared to 9.3% for other food crops (including maize, vegetables, mung
beans, cassava and soy beans), and 6.3% for industrial crops (including oil crops such as
soybean, sesame, groundnuts, as well as tobacco, sugar cane and jute).                         Rice yields have
demonstrated a steady increase over the past ten years, from an average o f 1.6 MT/ha during
1994 to 1997, to 2.3 MT/ha from 2003 to 2007, with 2008 yields reaching almost 2.6 MT/ha.
These increases reflect increased investments in land management and gradual dissemination o f
improved seed varieties developed by the Cambodian Agricultural Research Institute (CARDI)
or through distribution o f seeds from neighboring countries inthe context o f unofficial "contract
farming". Rehabilitation and expansion o f irrigation infrastructure i s also gradually supporting
improvedyields through supplemental irrigation and expanded dry seasonproduction.

1.      Although its share o f GDP is declining, agricultural development remains critical to
poverty reduction. Over 90% o f Cambodia's poor live in rural areas, with agriculture as the
primary source o f livelihood. Almost 85% o f all farms are less than 2 hectares, and the average
farm size among the rural poor is 1.5 hectares. Rice production provides over 80% o f the
agricultural revenues o f poor farmers (73% for non-poor farmers), and 75% o f the total calories
consumed by the poor (65% for the non-poor).                          Smallholders dominate rice production (the

typically twice those o f larger rice farms32(Figure 7).

2.       Diversification of production is important for both income growth as well as nutrition,
however improving rice production i s an important pre-requisite for most farmers to take risks.
Farmers with a higher percentage o f non-rice production generally had higher incomes.
Similarly, Cambodian households generally suffer from an over-reliance on rice-based calories
with significant nutritional consequences, particularly for children from micro-nutrient
deficiencies. However, farmers are cautious in substitutingtheir land and labor into non-rice
crops and livestock production as (i)      rice productioni s generally well understood by farmers; (ii)
it is considered relatively less disease prone than vegetables or livestock; (iii)storage and
marketingrequirements are far simpler; (iv) even incases where the rice cannot be sold at a good
price, it provides an easily storable source o f food security. As a result, at the smallholder farm
level, increasing rice productivity i s required to maintain overall production levels while
allowing release o f land and labor to diversify into potentially higher return agricultural
activities.

3.       Fortunately, there i s significant potential to increase rice production amongst smallholder
farmers without increasing labor or land. While yields have increased steadily in Cambodia,
they remain well below those o f other countries in the region (Table 1). This corresponds to
Cambodia have one o f the lowest rates o f utilization o f improved technology and the lowest
proportion o f irrigated crop land in East Asia. Recent analysis o f agricultural production in
Cambodia33has identified inadequate attention to soil fertility (soil management and fertilizer) -
much lower fertilizer use than its neighbors, lack o f irrigation facilities -only 7% o f the cropped
area i s irrigated, weak agricultural research and extension, poor infrastructure and rudimentary
credit system as the principal constraints to improved yields. Simulations o f yield functions
based on household survey data indicates that the major drivers o f yield improvement are
fertilizer application, irrigation, education, rural roads, electricity and Government agricultural
extension as all significant. These results are broadly consistent across wet season and dry

season production, and to other crops, besides rice. Increased use o f organic and inorganic
fertilizer has the most significant impact on supply if farm level constraints associated with
limited experience, concerns about quality and limited credit access34. Simulations of supply
response to rice price variations from 2004 to 2007 indicate that in the short term (all factors
except fertilizer held fixed), the supply elasticity i s estimated at 0.26 for wet season paddy and
0.33 for dry season paddy in 2007.                      In the long run, with all inputs variable, the supply
elasticities are 0.5 for wet season and 0.8 for dry season rice.

             There is considerable scope to improve the efficiency o f agricultural input markets in
Cambodia. Improved seed production remains concentrated with AQIP, which can meet less
than 10% o f estimated demand. This limited supply structure is also linked to the low level o f
research activity by CARD1 devoted to further evolution o f seed varieties for commercial use.
Accordingly, there is scope to explore both commercial and farmer association-based approaches
for expanding seed supply and linkages with agricultural research. Inthe case o f fertilizer, while
the number of importers has expanded rapidly, with some likely impact in terms of
improvements inquality and lower prices based on competition, highvariability remains an issue
at the retail level due to fragmented supply chains. Accordingly, Government i s strengthening its
oversight o f quality and price throughout the supply chain, while also reviewing reforms to the
import liscencing process which may facilitate development o f more consolidated distribution
channels which can be monitored by major suppliers, as i s already occurring in the case o f
imported organic fertilizer.

4.           Incentives for smallholders to increase rice productivity will depend on improving the
export marketing chain. Growth in rice production has outpaced rice consumption by 1.4% per
year between 1998 to 2008, with Cambodia achieving rice self-sufficiency since 1995. Official
rice exports have grown rapidly from 10,000 MT in 2002 to 450,000 MT in 2006, representing
over 10% o f total production, almost 10% o f total Cambodian exports, and 1.5% o f world rice
exports. High value, fragrant rice varieties account for an increasing share o f these exports.

More recently, neighboring countries have increased enforcement against informal exports from
Cambodia which are seen to undermine efforts to maintain price supports for their domestic
farmers, increasing the needto strengthenofficial export channels.

5.        However, two factors limit Cambodia's competitiveness in rice exports: (i)trade
logistics, standards and facilitation; and (ii)a severely underdeveloped milling sector. The ex-
farm-gate costs o f transport, and time and expenses o f export procedures are estimated at two to
three times the the costs in Thailand and Vietnam35,and there is limited institutional capacity to
support and certify international standards requirements. In terms o f rice milling, mills are
estimated to be operating at only 60% o f capacity due to lack o f access to working capital. The
result i s that a large proportion o f Cambodia's paddy is milled in neighboring countries and re-
exported back to Cambodia. In terms o f meeting quality and quantity requirements for export,
there are only 4 very large, modern mills with capacities over 5 MT per hour able to consistently
meet export quality standards, while there are are approximately 400 "commercial mills" with an
average capacity o f 1.1 MT per hour, and thousands o f very small (average 0.3 MT per hour)
household-based "custom mills" operating for only an hour or two each day36. As a result, the
milling sector is not yet able to assume its required role as an intermediary between farmers and
the marketing chain in terms o f product standards and aggregation, as well as credit and inputs
supply. Key constraints to developing a more export oriented milling sector include the overall
investment climate disincentives for larger businesses, and the limited access to working capital.

6.        There i s a strong consensus amongst Government and key stakeholders on the need to
address the identified constraints to both agricultural productivity and rice marketing in order to
achieve Cambodia's growth and poverty reduction objectives. Inits Rectangular Strategy Phase
11, Government commits to "an integrated approach including increased proper use o f improved
agricultural inputs, agricultural extension, research and development,          construction and
maintenance o f rural infrastructure, especially irrigation network, expansion o f rural credit and
microfinance, agricultural market development, organization o f farmer communities and better
management o f agricultural land.. .Moreover, the Royal Government will create an enabling
environment to attract private investors, domestic and foreign.."            In order to support
implementation o f this strategy, Government and donors in the TWG AW have prepared the
Strategy for Agriculture and Water 2006- 2010, and specific support programs are being
formulated for its implementation. Similarly, NGOs, which have an important role in supporting
agricultural technology transfer, farmer groups, marketing and credit are increasingly
coordinating their work and sharing experience with Government to strengthen the effectiveness
o f the overall efforts, particularly in the context o f more decentralized, community focused
approaches. Similarly, there i s increasing acknowledgement by Government and stakeholders o f
the need to integrate climate change adaptation into the agricultural agenda, given Cambodia's
exposure to weather variability.

7.        While the official policy environment is generally supportive, these priorities are only
gradually being translated into public expenditure priorities. Cambodian agriculture faces few,
official sectoral policy constraints with low and declining import and export tariffs inthe context

sector where the state monopolizes processing, though significant latex is sold across the border
to Vietnam. Government expenditures on agriculture, while increasing slightly as a share of total
budget over the past three years, have actually declined as a share o f agricultural GDP, and
remain amongst the lowest in the region. Budget for the Ministry o f Agriculture, Fisheries and

8.      While donor and NGO support ,the amount of official development assistance (ODA) for
agriculture remains low, relative to Government's National Socio-Economic Development Plan
(NSDP) requirements (Figure 1O)37.            Inaddition, in order to buildGovernment-led, sustainable
service delivery systems, it will be critical to move ODA support to agriculture from the current,
highly projectized approach, to an increasingly programmatic approach which complements
higher budgetary expenditures within a common, results-oriented, medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF).

9.       Inparallel, Government and donors are pursuingthe related land tenure and land access
issues which is a challenging agenda.          The Khmer Rouge destroyed all land records in
Cambodia, and subsequent Governments determined that pre-Khmer Rouge land rightscould not
be verified. Governmenta carried out a one-time assignment o f landplots to all families in 1988,
but without issuance o f title, and Cambodia's working age population has more than doubled
since then without any further significant land allocation efforts. As a result, the vast majority o f
Cambodians have only semi-formal land claims based on registration with local commune
chiefs, and there has been significant encroachment on the "State Lands" which officially
constitute up to 80% o f Cambodia's 18.1 million hectares, resulting in widespread, technically
"illegal" occupation. In order to strengthen land governance, Government has been pursuing
systematic titling o f rural plots since 2001 through the Land Management and Administration
Project (LMAP), supported by the Bank, CIDA, Finland and GTZ. Under LMAP, over 1million
titles have already been adjudicated, but this represents only 20% o f the estimated total plots in
the country. Government has also recently iniated a pilot program for distributing state land to
the poor with land title through the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development
Project (LASED), however the program i s just beginning and it remains unclear the extent to
which provincial and national authorities will agree on prioritizing state lands for distribution to
the poor.       At the same time, Cambodia has pursued agricultural development through an
economic land concession (ELC) program which leases very large tracts o f land (legal limit o f
10,000 has) for 70 years for investments in plantations. There are currently approximately 60
ongoing ELCs recorded by national authorities, and a significant number o f smaller (up to 1,000
has) ELCs granted by provincial authorities. Experience to-date with these plantations has
generally been disappointing due to significant conflict with local, existing land users, and
insufficient screening o f investors, with the result that less than 10 percent o f the ELC area i s
estimated to be in compliance with the production plans. Government i s reviewing the existing
ELCs and has already cancelled three non-performing contracts. However, it is only recently
that Government has recognized that a smallholder based agricultural development approach
may be more effective in achieving both Cambodia's growth as well as poverty reduction
objectives. Government i s therefore closely assessing the smallholder supply response to higher
food prices to determine if there i s a need to revise its land allocation priorities for agriculture
away from ELCs and towards access for smallholders.
