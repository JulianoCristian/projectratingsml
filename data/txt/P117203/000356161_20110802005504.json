was moderate; the Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory; and the Borrower's\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: implementation results need to be identified and\n            expressed as objectively verifiable target indicators. Joint\n            monitoring of the program requires clear indicators which\n            are agreed prior to implementation. While having a parallel\n            Technical Assistance (TA) is desirable to implement agreed\n            actions, the identification of appropriate targets and\n            indicators of the program should be ideally based on prior\n            analytical work.
