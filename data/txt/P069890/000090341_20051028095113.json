Lessons learned\n            from the project: Latvia Programmatic Structural Adjustment\n            Loan (PSAL) was comprehensive and broad based, but the\n            choice of instrument increased flexibility of its\n            application. When there is strong commitment by the society\n            and the Government, the implementation of reforms does not\n            need to be closely tied to the use of resources or to be\n            bound by legal obligations. Programmatic operations with\n            comprehensive institutional reforms require substantial\n            resources for quality supervision. Complementarity of the\n            PSAL with investment operations and coordination with\n            activities of the other donors are critical for capacity\n            building. Interim assessments of programmatic operations\n            should either be open to revaluation at the time of the\n            program assessment, or there should be an opportunity to\n            assess the program as a whole."}, "docdt": "2005-10-24T00:00:00Z"}
