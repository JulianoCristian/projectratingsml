efficiency in the use\n            of public resources, and external assistance with the\n            increasing participation of the private sector, and civil\n            society in decision-making,

satisfactory; and overall Borrower\n            performance is satisfactory. The report cites the following\n            as lessons learned: 1) Choice of lending instrument, the\n            decision to do a two-tranche structural adjustment operation\n            was adequate in view of the possible risks affecting the\n            operation, 2) Client commitment, the successful\n            implementation of the Government's program followed\n            from its ownership and degree of commitment. 3)\n            Institutional capacity, experience with the implementation\n            of the EGRO has shown that the choice of its tranche\n            conditionality was judiciously selective, focusing on those\n            measures that were likely to make the greatest impact, were\n            critical to the successful achievement of the program\n            objectives and enjoyed broad Government support; donor\n            coordination. As mentioned earlier, close coordination among\n            donors in the provision of financial and technical\n            assistance greatly contributed to the outcome of the reform\n            program.
