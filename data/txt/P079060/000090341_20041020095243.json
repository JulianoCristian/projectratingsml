The\n            experience of Programmatic Labor Reform and Social\n            Structural Adjustment Loan (PLaRSSAL I) implies the\n            following main lessons that have been considered in the\n            preparation of the PLaRSSAL II: Strong and sustained\n            dialogue between the Government of Colombia (GOC) and the\n            Bank through joint high-quality sector work on social\n            protection issues and operations is valuable for future\n            operations. Emphasis on outputs and outcomes, rather than\n            inputs and processes, facilitates monitoring and following\n            up of conditions by both the Government and the Bank. A\n            series of operations - SECAL, PLaRSSAL I, and PLaRSSAL II -\n            commits the Government to stay focused on monitoring\n            progress in outputs of key reform measures over a longer\n            time period in a coordinated, formal and systematic way.\n            While the institutional reform is underway, constant\n            collaboration between the GOC, the Bank, and other partners\n            is crucial to developing the new platform upon which the\n            health, education, and social reforms will rest."}, "docdt": "2004-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
