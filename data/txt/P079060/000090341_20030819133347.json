the general\n            government objective of promoting higher employment,\n            increased human capital formation, and strengthened social\n            protection, especially of the poor and vulnerable. This\n            objective would be achieved through more efficient and\n            equitable use of social sector resources, improved\n            regulatory environment and better institutional practices.\n            Following are the project objectives: A) Institution of an\n            effective authority in charge of developing a comprehensive\n            social risk management system to provide efficient and\n            timely protection of the poor and vulnerable against the\n            threats and consequences of illness, unemployment, poverty,\n            and economic volatility. B) Greater access of poor children\n            to ICBF Assistance and Prevention programs through the\n            establishment of an explicit targeting policy and practices\n            to ensure their cost-effectiveness. C) Achievement of at\n            least 95 percent Expanded Program of Immunization (PAI)\n            coverage rate of 0-5 year old children by 2006. D) More\n            advances in the implementation of health system reform,\n            further expanding health insurance coverage of the poor,\n            reducing direct subsidy to public hospitals, and ensuring\n            quality of services of health insurers and care providers."}, "docdt": "2003-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
