3. Program Description

3.1 The Overall Program

1.      The Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment operation (PLaRSSAL)
consists of two single-tranche loans. It supports the general government objective of promoting higher
employment, increased human capital formation, and strengthened social protection, especially of the
poor and vulnerable. This objective would be achieved through more efficient and equitable use of social
sector resources, improved regulatory environment and better institutional practices. A programmatic
approach to Bank assistance was adopted in view of the wide range of objectives supported by the
program and the need for flexibility in the sequencing of activities among the different institutions.

2.      The PLaRSSAL supports the following 2006 goals of the Government of Colombia (GOC), to
which the program's targets for 2004 laid out in Annex I are meant to contribute: (a) institution of an
effective authority in charge of developing a comprehensive social risk management system to provide
efficient and timely protection of the poor and vulnerable against the threats and consequences of illness,
unemployment, poverty and economic volatility; (b) greater access of poor children to Colombian
Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF) Assistance and Prevention programs through the establishment of an
explicit targeting policy and practices to ensure their cost-effectiveness; (c) achievement of at least 95
percent Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) coverage rate of 0-5 year-olds by 2006; (d) more
advances in the implementation of health system reform, further expanding health insurance coverage of
the poor, reducing direct subsidy to public hospitals, and ensuring quality of services of health insurers
and care providers; (e) implementation of labor and training reforms to reduce the wedge between
employers' hiring/training costs and workers' acceptable wages, while improving the social protection of
vulnerable workers; (f) acceleration of education reforms to provide access to good quality education,
especially to basic and secondary schools; and (g) greater transparency and social control of social
programs through their periodic evaluation and greater participatory oversight by citizens.

3.      Bank support for the PLaRSSAL program, which is considered a high priority in the 2002
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), was an appropriate and timely response to the GOC's request for
continued assistance to establish more solid conditions in the country for the sustained expansion of
employment, faster human capital accumulation, and better social protection of the population,
particularly for the poor and vulnerable. First, with slow economic growth, high and rising income
inequality, and widespread unemployment/underemployment, Colombia continues to suffer high levels of
poverty and many children remain vulnerable to malnutrition and ill health. Second, Colombia has
lagged behind other competitor countries in terms of the level and quality of education, undermining its
prospects for greater long-term competitiveness and growth. Finally, the current Administration (2002-
2006) has the political will and capacity to undertake the above-mentioned reform agenda.

3.2 PLaRSSAL I

4.       The first loan in the two-part series, PLaRSSAL I (Loan 7193-CO), approved on September 9,
2003, essentially laid the ground work for PLaRSSAL II. Building on the Social Sector Adjustment Loan
(SECAL),1 the first PLaRSSAL operation focused on: (i) passing Labor Reform Law 789 of December
2002 and starting its implementation by issuing key articles of the law that reduced the cost of hard-to-
employ workers, of overtime pay and of apprentice contracts; (ii) continuing and strengthening
implementation of Decentralization Law 715 (enacted in 2001) to improve education enrolment,
education quality and the use of funds in education and health; and (iii) supporting the development and
implementation of an effective social protection system. Enactment of key regulatory decrees of the
Labor Reform Law and starting their implementation, along with continuation of reforms under (ii) and
(iii) above, would provide the basis for further progress to be achieved in the context of PLaRSSAL II,
currently planned for Board presentation in November 2004.

5.       The full policy matrix is provided in Annex I. Each of these measures responds to the main
sector issues identified by GOC and the Bank and supports the general objectives of the PLaRSSAL
program. The main policy actions were developed through extensive consultation with all relevant
government agencies, including the Ministries of Finance, Social Protection and Education, the National
Planning Department (DNP), which acted as coordinating agency, the National Training Service (SENA),
and the Colombian Welfare Institute (ICBF). The policy matrix drew on extensive and high quality joint
sector work2 and lessons learned from previous social sector operations.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective

6.       ICR Rating: Satisfactory. Overall, PLaRSSAL I was successful in achieving its objectives.
This lending operation has encouraged and enabled the Government to continue and deepen social
reforms, initiate the process of labor reform and begin implementation of its key provisions. As discussed
below, all the measures in the policy matrix (Annex I) that GOC has committed itself to undertake for
phase I of the PLaRSSAL program have been carried out satisfactorily. Moreover, indications are that the
program is going to have a substantial institutional impact and that sustainability of its implementation is
likely for reasons laid out below. One such indication is that the triggers and prior actions for the
PLaRSSAL II operation have now been met without changing the matrix defined in the program
document of PLaRSSAL I, with the exception of one modification (discussed below). In recognition of
the exceptional progress in the implementation of the PLaRSSAL reform agenda, the Government and the
Bank agreed to increase the proposed PLaRSSAL II loan amount by $50 million from $150 million to
$200 million.

4.2 Outputs by components

7.       Annex II presents the objectives, accomplishments, and ICR rating of each component. As
mentioned, all the components have satisfactory rating, except for the subsidized health insurance and



1Social Sector Adjustment Loan Project (7134-CO), approved August 1, 2002.
2Examples of these analytical pieces include: (i) Colombia Poverty Assessment (Report #12673-CO); (ii) Social Safety Net
Assessment (Report #22255-CO); (iii) Colombia: the Economic Foundation of Peace (2003); (iv) Public Training Reform Issues
in Colombia: the Case of SENA (under review by the Government); and (v) Social Sector Efficiency programmatic analytical
work on education and hospitals (on-going).




                                                             3

education components, which are rated highly satisfactory. The following outcomes are noteworthy
examples of PLaRSSAL's achievements:

    · The number of poor (SISBEN 1) children 6 years old or less covered by the Desayunos Infantiles
         (children's breakfast) program reached 322,000 children (50 percent of all SISBEN 1 children) by
         December 2003, against a target of 300,000.
    · The Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) coverage rates of 0-5 year-olds were all above 90
         percent by December 2003, against the target of 90-95 percent targets.
    · The increase in basic and secondary education enrollment was 489,976 students in the period
         2002-2003, a figure higher than the target of 300,000
    · The increase in student/teacher ratio was of 1.8 points--from 26.7 students in 2002 to 28.5
         students in 2003--a progress that met the triggers for PLaRSSAL II.
    · The number of people benefiting from the Subsidized Health Insurance Regime increased by over
         1 million new affiliates in 2003, far beyond the PLaRSSAL I target of 300,000.
    · The number of SENA short-course graduates increased by 450,000 in August 2002-July 2003,
         improving productivity by about 50 percent.

8.       In addition these remarkable outcomes, most of PLaRSSAL I accomplishments are "process-
related outputs." This is because most of the PLaRSSAL I actions are set-up activities intended to be
followed up by PLaRSSAL II. Appropriately, the second phase of the PLaRSSAL program is more
results-oriented and its assessment will be more outcomes-focused.

9.       In the PLaRSSAL II decision meeting, questions focused on the impact of the reform of
the labor regulations. It is too early to make a reasonable impact evaluation. Early indications
suggest that, in general, the reform of the labor laws is beginning to have a substantial positive impact on
training and employment.        Nevertheless, in the course of completing the Program Document of
PLaRSSAL II, the team learned that a few of the Labor Reform Law 789 articles, while fully
implemented, have less than the expected results. Due to bureaucratic barriers, limited lapse time and
other reasons, there has been a low take up of the micro-credit program, the parafiscales waivers for hard-
to-employ workers, and program of cost reimbursements for firm training. It is worth noting, however,
that the GOC has shown its results-management orientation by early identification of unsatisfactory
results, analysis of the factors preventing the outcomes, and re-design of the instruments in order to
produce the desired development outcomes.            The Administration's focus on results, rather than
instruments, allows for rapid and flexible redesign of programs. These issues are discussed in detail in
the PLaRSSAL II Program Document.

4.3 Institutional Development Impact and Sustainability

10.      Institutional Development ICR Rating: Substantial. Annex II also provides an assessment of
the institutional development impact by components. It is not possible to make a scientific evaluation of
the institutional impact of the measures supported by PLaRSSAL I. There are indications, though, that in
implementing its PLaRSSAL I commitments, GOC has begun to bring about notable institutional changes
that are likely to improve the equity and efficiency of labor and social programs. The reasons for rating
the institutional impact as substantial include inter alia: (i) the establishment of the Ministry of Social
Protection; (ii) the approval of the labor reform and issuance of enabling regulations; (ii) improvements in
the definition of roles, responsibilities and regulations for key actors in social protection, training, health
and education; (iii) better coordination among key agencies involved in dealing with these issues; (iv)
further implementation of the decentralization law, including the implementation of the an output-
oriented intergovernmental transfers formula, the reorganization of regional Education Secretariats as
well as the establishment of a national system for measuring student enrolment and learning achievement;



                                                       4

and (v) advances in the development and institution of periodic impact evaluation and citizens'
monitoring of labor and social programs.

11.      Sustainability ICR Rating: Likely. The sustainability of the PLaRSSAL program appears
likely for the following reasons. Since the completion of PLaRSSAL I, the GOC has continued to
progress along their reform path, with no substantial deviations to the program that was described in the
Letter of Development Policy that accompanied the PLaRSSAL I. The Government has continued the
labor and social reform program and met the trigger and prior actions that were anticipated for the second
phase of the Bank program. In fact, the GOC has already achieved them in accordance with the matrix
defined in the PLaRSSAL I program document, with the exception of one inconsequential modification
regarding immunization. Yet, another reason for the likely rating is the Government's clear vision and
ownership of the reforms, the President's popularity, the broad inter-ministerial support, and the strong
political will to implement them (see paragraphs 17 and 18 below).

12.      Aside from the GOC's demonstrated commitment to the reform program and its political will to
implement it, the GOC has undertaken other notable, unanticipated activities (not included in the policy
matrix) that were key to advancing the reform. These activities were a result of the Government's desire
to improve the outcomes of already successful initiatives. These include inter alia the Ministry of Social
Protection's (MSP) decision to: (i) establish stricter quality standards for health insurance companies
than what has been included in the policy matrix; (ii) reform the Social Security Institute; and (iii) seek
legislation that would simplify the process for the transfer of resources from the federal government to the
health insurance companies. The latter is expected to improve efficiency of the process, increase
transparency, and decrease the potential for corruption.

13.      Finally, the likelihood of sustained implementation of the PLaRSSAL agenda would be enhanced
by the proposed Technical Assistance Loan (TAL), which the Government prepared to support the
implementation and deepening of the labor and social reforms. The proposed TAL ($2.0 million)
scheduled for Board consideration in November would provide resources for expertise to continue the
implementation of the reform agenda once the PLaRSSAL operation is closed.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

14.      Consolidating institutional change to build a strong Ministry of Social Protection has not been
easy and has required a gradual approach. First, the MSP has had to deal with the merger of health sector
and labor relations activities in a single integrated framework, when previously these activities were
under separate ministries. Second, the MSP has had to deal with meeting its wide-ranging mandate, while
at the same time proposing major pension and labor reform laws and writing their regulatory decrees and
other normative acts. Third, the MSP has had an enormous coordination challenge not only with different
federal social protection agencies -- SENA, ICBF, ISS and Cajas de Compensación -- but also with
states and municipalities, as most social spending has been decentralized to these entities. Long-term and
continued Bank support through sector work, the SECAL and the PLaRSSAL Program operation have
helped the Ministry identify critical areas of concern and action, and sustain its efforts.

15.      The diverse and wide-ranging objectives of the first PLaRSSAL have been achieved because of
the strong commitment to labor and social reform by all agencies involved during preparation and
PLaRSSAL I execution, the high quality and continuity of Bank staff and the high level of trust it had
built over several years, and the strong leadership role of the DNP. The coordination effort provided by
DNP ensured that all different agencies were involved and responded to a single national priority plan.
This mitigated the risk of having too many objectives addressed in a single operation.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank

16.      Satisfactory. The Bank's performance is deemed satisfactory for the following reasons. First, the
Bank supported an operation that is consistent with the CAS and contributes to the implementation of the
country's development plan. In this regard, it showed good judgment in supporting key GOC objectives
and targets that it is strongly committed to implement. Second, the Bank helped GOC in designing the
policy matrix and selecting the appropriate lending instrument. The programmatic approach provided the
flexibility needed for sequencing activities as well as minimizing the risks and uncertainties regarding the
attainability and impact of some policy measures. Third, the preparation of PLaRSSAL was timely. The
Administration was just initiating its reform program and needed support. Fourth, the Bank gave high
quality technical assistance, both in providing advice and support to the Borrower. The PLaRSSAL drew
on high quality sector work on safety nets, health, labor and training, as well as on lessons learned from
investment operations supporting the development of the social net program (RAS) and the 2002 Social
Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL). Fifth, the Bank vetted carefully the policy matrix to ensure that GOC
has the capacity to implement it. On this point, it prudently advised and convinced GOC on the need for a
TAL to strengthen implementation capacity in certain areas. Finally, the Bank worked hard to ensure that
the Loan was declared effective and disbursed immediately after Board approval to meet Colombia's
financial needs.

Borrower

17.      Satisfactory. The Borrower's performance is also rated satisfactory for these reasons. First,
GOC developed a clear vision and strategy of its labor and social reform agenda. This guided the
preparation and implementation of the operation. Second, the Administration ensured that its policy
commitments could       be achieved as scheduled.      Third, it showed strong political will by leading
legislative fights needed to carry out its reform agenda, as well as issued the required enabling
regulations. In general, the involved ministries have been managing and monitoring the implementation
and effects of the various reform measures ­ and have sought to adjust them in light of the evolving
experience and lessons learned. Fourth, as mentioned, the Government has been undertaking other
measures complementary to those in the PLaRSSAL policy matrix.

18.      The deep commitment of the different agencies involved, including the Ministries of Finance,
Social Protection, Education, the DNP, SENA and ICBF during program preparation and implementation
of the first program operation has been instrumental for the success of the program. High level technical
staff of all agencies involved participated jointly with Bank staff in preparation activities and discussions
leading to the program preparation, identification of the objectives to be achieved, and the timing of the
targets and triggers of the sequence of loans. Government staff were highly qualified and experienced,
many of them having been involved in previous Bank operations, including the SECAL operation. The
coordinating role played by DNP was instrumental during preparation and execution of program
objectives. The DNP has played this coordinating role efficiently, making sure that agencies involved are
making progress in achieving agreed output targets and meeting the triggers and prior actions for
PLaRSSAL II. This ensures continuity of reform efforts over time and permits detection of delays and/or
problems that need to be addressed early on in the process.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

19.     The main findings of this operation are the following:

    · The PLaRSSAL is a well designed operation that fits the needs of the client, contributes to the
        implementation of Colombia's national development plan, and is consistent with the Country
        Assistance Strategy. The GOC is fully committed to the implementation of the PLaRSSAL
        program and has shown strong political will.
    · Progress in the implementation of the PLaRSSAL program, particularly in the first phase of the
        operation, is satisfactory and likely to be sustainable. The achievements have been so substantial
        that an increase in the proposed PLaRSSAL II loan amount has been recommended.

20.     The experience of PLaRSSAL I implies the following main lessons that have been considered in
the preparation of the PLaRSSAL II:

    · Strong and sustained dialogue between the GOC and the Bank through joint high-quality sector
        work on social protection issues and operations is valuable for future operations. The PLaRSSAL
        II continues this practice by building on the on-going dialogue around the joint analytical work in
        the training (SENA), education and health sectors, and the continued implementation of the RAS
        investment operations.
    · Emphasis on outputs and outcomes, rather than inputs and processes, facilitates monitoring and
        following up of conditions by both the Government and the Bank. Focusing on key program
        outcomes permits the inclusion of many sectors in the operation, which would be difficult to
        manage in a series of operations if the outcomes for each sector were not clearly defined and
        measurable. This also permits the inclusion of sectors where reform efforts are more advanced
        than in others. The PLaRSSAL II intends to push this farther by even more focus on measurable
        outcomes in various sectors.
    · A series of operations ­ SECAL, PLaRSSAL I, and PLaRSSAL II ­ commits the Government to
        stay focused on monitoring progress in outputs of key reform measures over a longer time period
        in a coordinated, formal and systematic way. The common set of outcomes, and the evaluation of
        these outcome indicators with the beginning of each new operation, allow for changes in the
        strategies to be implemented when the previous strategies do not return the expected results.
    · While the institutional reform is underway, constant collaboration between the GOC, the Bank,
        and other partners is crucial to developing the new platform upon which the health, education,
        and social reforms will rest. Notably, during the continued engagement with the Bank through
        the series of operations, the DNP has played a strong coordinating role, ensuring that the entities
        involved are making progress in achieving agreed output targets and advancing in meeting the
        trigger actions. This ensures continuation of reform efforts over a long period of time and
        permits detection of delays or problems that need to be addressed.
