Project sustainability is rated as likely based on\n            Government commitment to health, ability to pay, and efforts\n            already achieved to nensure appropriate levels of staffing\n            in all facilities. World Bank performance is rated as\n            unsatisfactory, while Borrower performance is rated as\n            marginally satisfactory. Most of the lessons drawn from this\n            project have been identified in sector evaluations (for\n            example, see report no. 21392 (OES)) and largely integrated\n            in recent Bank guidelines for project preparation. This\n            project illustrates that: Projects should be kept simple to\n            avoid difficulties in implementation. Appropriate monitoring\n            and evaluation indicators to measure project outcome,\n            output, and progress need to be developed and their use in\n            decisionmaking encouraged. Supervision intensity and\n            adequacy of the Bank's team skill-mix have an important\n            influence on project outcome. It is better to introduce new\n            Bank procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents\n            at the country level than on a project by project basis so\n            that all parties are equally informed and given full\n            opportunity to buy into these proposed improvements. The\n            Bank should have given more consideration to its prior\n            experience in this country."}, "docdt": "2001-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
