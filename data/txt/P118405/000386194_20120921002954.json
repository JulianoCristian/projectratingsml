The\n            closing date for the project will be extended from September\n            30, 2012 to November 16, 2012. A six week extension will\n            allow the project to meet its development objectives and for\n            full disbursements under the roads and Waste Water Treatment\n            Plant (WWTP). This does not require an extension of the\n            completion date of the administrative agreement, which\n            remains December 31, 2012, but an amendment stating that the\n            end dates of activities provided are extended until November\n            16, 2012. The first two components of the project managed by\n            the Moldova Social Investment Fund (MSIF) have been\n            completed satisfactorily and fully disbursed. This will be\n            the third and last extension. The first in June 2011 was for\n            three months to allow time for the administrative agreement\n            and framework/financing agreement between the Government and\n            EC to be amended. Once the framework agreement was approved,\n            in July 2011, the administrative agreement was extended by\n            one year to December 31, 2012 and the grant agreement to\n            September 30, 2012. There is no possibility of further\n            extension due to the fact that the EC cannot extend the\n            administrative agreement."}, "docdt": "2012-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
