                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PDO is to reduce the economic and social disparities among regions through the following: (i) by improving social services at the local and community level to
                         provide better assistance to the vulnerable, especially the disabled, elderly, children, and the poor; (ii) by improving water management at the community level so as to
                         increase the supply of potable water, construct and rehabilitate small-scale water supply and irrigation systems, and adequately equip water accumulation facilities; (iii)
                         by lowering road transport costs for road-users in Moldova, and providing better access to services by improving the condition and quality of its road network; and (iv)
                         by improving the quality of sanitary services in Orhei.
