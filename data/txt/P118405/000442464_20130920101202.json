"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Regional Development\n            Project for Moldova were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Grantee performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: on the Government side, using\n            existing Project Implementation Units (PIUs) while assuring\n            that they have the capacity to deliver and absorb the extra\n            work can be an efficient way to leverage existing government\n            structures and reduce administrative cost. Since funds for\n            the project were tied to the financing agreement between the\n            European Commission (EC) and Moldova, its extension was\n            restricted to the duration of the later, which meant that\n            grant funds went unused, and the government had to increase\n            its contribution at a time of fiscal contraction. A detailed\n            reporting mechanism that allowed the Bank to inform the EC\n            on the status of project implementation and meets\n            donor's expectations should be agreed upon during\n            preparation. There is a need to integrate approach to\n            dealing with water issues in the design of social investment\n            funds with water sub-projects particularly in the case of\n            community driven development programs. Households\n            re-affirmed their willingness to pay for improved water\n            supply, share connecting costs, have meters installed, and\n            cover monthly payments for piped water connections. Moldova\n            Social Investment Fund (MSIF) contributions were capped at\n            United States (U.S.) 75,000 dollars. As a result, the fund\n            was able to more significantly impact smaller rather than\n            larger villages. Experience in the procurement of the road\n            rehabilitation section where the total investment was\n            considered too low to attract international bidders but the\n            amount required to use International Competitive Bidding\n            (ICB) revealed the importance of assessing sector entry\n            costs and procurement guidelines to define investment amounts."}, "docdt": "2013-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
