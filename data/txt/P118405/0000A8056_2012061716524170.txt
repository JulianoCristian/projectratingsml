                         The PDO is to reduce the economic and social disparities among regions through the following: (i) by improving social services atthe local and community level to
                         provide better assistance to the vulnerable, especially the disabled, elderly, children, and the poor; (ii) by improving water management at the community level so as to
                         increase the supply of potable water, construct and rehabilitate small-scale water supply and irrigation systems, and adequately equip water accumulation facilities; (iii)
                         by lowering road transport costs for road-users in Moldova, and providing better access to services by improving the condition and quality of its road network; and (iv)
                         by improving the quality of sanitary services in Orhei.

                         The Bank mid-term review mission was conducted April 12-25, 2012. The mission confirmed that the Roads Rehabilitation of the 5 km segment is on track to be completed by August
                         2012, before the project closing date. This was also confirmed by the EC Representative who accompanied the mission. The contractor, subcontractor and supervisor have been
                         mobilized. The main bypass section has been completed and is now awaiting its asphalt concrete surfacing. Two smaller bypass sections (where small bridges are to be repaired)
                         are being built. The contractor has started to carry out the localized repairs which are needed prior to the main asphalt works. The subcontractor is about to complete the installation
                         of a new asphalt hot mixing plant. Asphalt works should start by mid-May 2012 at the latest. Significant volumes of gravel and other materials have been stockpiled. The road works
                         signs are in place at each end of the site, assuring adequate visibility of the EU as funding source. In the unlikely event that works slip, the State Road Agency has confirmed that
                         there are funds available from other sources to complete this.

                         Regarding the WWTP, visible progress has been made. While the plant co-financed by the IDA NWSS project was not expected to be operational, construction was largely expected
                         to be completed by September 30, 2012, the closing date of the grant. The contractor estimated that only approximately 75% of the constructed wetlands will be complete by
                         September 30, 2012. To date, 3/4th of the constructed space has been compacted; all elements of the collector are in place and expected to be completed by June 2012; 1.5 km (out
                         of 5 km) of pipe to bring the waste from the city has been laid. The Bank team was impressed by the commitment and caliber of the contractor and supervisor, and the quality
                         appeared good. There were some important issues that the Bank team asked the Government to follow up on. The mission confirmed that funds from the National Ecological Fund
                         (NEF) are available to cover any remaining costs related after EC funds have been exhausted to ensure completion of the project. A follow up mission is planned in early July 2012
                         to maintain the pressure on the contractor to complete the works and to join the EC verification mission planned during the same period.
