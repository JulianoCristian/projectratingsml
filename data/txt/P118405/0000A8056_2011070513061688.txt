                         The objective of the Project is to reduce the economic and social disparities among regions through the following: (i) by improving social services at the local
                         and community level to provide better assistance to the vulnerable, especially the disabled, elderly, children and the poor; (ii) by improving water management
                         at the community level so as to increase the supply of potable water, construct and rehabilitate small-scale water supply and irrigation systems, and adequately
                         equip water accumulation facilities; (iii) by lowering road transport costs for road-users in Moldova, and providing better access to services by improving the
                         condition and quality of its road network; and (iv) by improving the quality of sanitary services in Orhei.

                         Once that is done, the AA can be amended and the Grant Agreement closing date extended to September 30, 2012.

                         The State Road Agency (SRA) had awarded a Roads maintenance contract in April to a Spanish company. That contract was put on hold pending the extension. After news of the
                         EU extension, the SRA met with the contractor this week and they agreed to sign the contract. The SRA and contractor understand that 1) the EC has agreed in principle to extend
                         even though we don't have all the agreements in place, 2) there is a small risk the govt is taking that it doesn't happen for whatever reason, and 3) there is absolutely no possibility of
                         extension beyond Sept 30, 2012.

                         The EC has been informed of this decision. The Waste Water Treatment Plant contract should be signed by August 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This updated ISR is to reflect the news that the EU has agreed to a one year extension of the Administrative Agreement, until December 31, 2012. The EU is expected to sign an
                         Amendment to their Financing Agreement with Moldova on June 22, 2011 in Brussels and it will be sent to Moldova thereafter. The next step is for the Prime Minister to sign it.
                         Once that is done, the AA can be amended and the Grant Agreement closing date extended to September 30, 2012.
