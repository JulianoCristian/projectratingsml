Mali's efforts to deepen\n            fiscal adjustment and to provide a stable macroeconomic\n            environment that is conducive to sustained private\n            sector-led growth. It will ensure improved quality of fiscal\n            adjustment through greater reliance on expansion of revenues\n            and closer coherence with long-term social development\n            objectives. The project's main objectives are to: 1)\n            improve domestic resource mobilization and reduce\n            distortions in the existing system of direct taxation; 2)\n            improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and the poverty focus\n            of public expenditures; and 3) support measures to address\n            gender-based constraints on access to land and credit for\n            women. The components of the project are as follows: 1)\n            fiscal reforms including administrative and policy measures,\n            which will strengthen tax administration, reduce fiscal\n            fraud and simplify direct taxation; 2) expenditure\n            efficiency and effectiveness involving budget preparation,\n            monitoring expenditure execution and poverty focus of\n            expenditures; and 3) integration of gender into the reform program."}, "docdt": "1996-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
