{"cdata!": "The outcome of the Economic Management\n            Credit is rated as satisfactory, sustainability as likely,\n            institutional development impact as modest, Bank performance\n            as satisfactory, and Borrower performance as satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned include: A macroeconomic adjustment\n            program dealing with policy reforms and administrative\n            restructuring at the central levels of Government should not\n            be combined with a grassroots operation in widely dispersed\n            rural areas. These usually require intensive supervision and\n            likely some technical and operational support, which is\n            difficult to accommodate within the structure of an\n            adjustment operation. Another approach may be to arrange\n            with one of the resident bilateral donors to provide this\n            type of assistance under a cofinancing agreement. Careful\n            attention should be paid to the design of progress and\n            output monitoring indicators, to ensure that there is a\n            clear relationship between the inputs provided under the\n            project and the expected output. That was not always the\n            case in this project. For example, the impact of the\n            mandated recruitment of additional primary school teachers\n            on primary school enrollment ratios could have been offset\n            by other factors, leading to a constant ratio. The correct\n            assessment of the impact would require estimates holding\n            other influences constant."}, "docdt": "2001-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
