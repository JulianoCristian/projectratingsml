HNSP will provide support to\n            priority activities for which there is a financial gap,\n            provided that they are consistent with the sector policy and\n            there is agreement on their relevance.  The support will\n            focus on five areas: a) further developing human resources\n            and improving their geographical distribution; b) ensuring\n            adequate sector financing and equitable allocation of\n            resources for the poor and for underserved geographical\n            areas; c) improving health sector management to raise\n            efficiency; d) improving the accessibility to quality and\n            affordable health services in underserved areas; and e)\n            enhancing and expanding community-based communications for\n            improved nutrition."}, "docdt": "2006-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
