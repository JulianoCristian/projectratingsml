A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Countryand sector issues

Political situation and World Bank relation: On August 3, 2005 a bloodless coup took place in
Mauritania which ousted the Mauritanian President Taya. Subsequently the Military Council for Justice
and Democracy formed a transitional Government headed by Colonel Ely Ould Mohamed Vall. The
transitional government announced that it would step down within two years after national approval o f a
new constitution and parliamentary and presidential elections. The new Government also committed itself
to focus on improving: (i)  the judicial system, with a view to establishing a fairer system for individuals
and a more attractive investment climate for businesses; and (ii)   governance, in particular by deepening
public finance reforms. After the coup, the World Bank decided not to suspend disbursements but to put
new operations on hold untilthere were clear signs from the government on its willingness to implement
their new commitments and that the international community would also indicate their engagement with
the transitional government. Since then, the government has developed a road map on governance
addressing former problematic issues such as transparency in managing the oil sector. It normalized the
relationship with the IMF, and committed to deepen public finance reforms and modernize the
administration which will be supported by an upcoming IDA credit. The government is also in the
process o f developing a new PRSP. InDecember 2005 the Bank reassessed its relationship with the new
government as the international community signaled its willingness to re-engage with Mauritania. Bank
senior management then decided to normalize Bank relations and actively worked on this operation as
well as a Public Sector Capacity Buildingproject.

Health and nutrition status in Mauritania: Since the country's independence in 1960, Mauritania has
undergone important transformations and from a traditionally nomadic society o f the past it became a
country characterized today by a higher pace o f urbanization. Of the 2.7 million inhabitants, some 1.8
million live in urban centers, including 600,000 in Nouakchott, the capital city. However, o f the vast
surface o f the country (1,03 million sq. km) over 80% o f the land i s desert (only the southern areas o f the
country support rain-fed vegetation). The very low density o f the population living in rural areas (on an
average there are 2.4 inhabitants per sq. km), incomplete road and communication systems and poverty
generate important problems and impact on the health and nutrition status and the performance o f the
health delivery system. About 46 percent o f the population lives below the poverty line, only 37 percent
o f the population have access to safe water and 77 percent to health services. With an annual gross
national income per capita o f only US$430, Mauritania remains one o f the poorest countries inAfrica.

Most health status indicators inMauritania have improved during the last decade and compare favorably
with Sub-Saharan Africa countries. For instance, between 1988 and 2000 the under-5 mortality rate
declined from 182 to 116 per 1,000 live births, infant mortality rate diminished from 118 to 74 per 1,000
live births, and maternal mortality decreased from 930 to an estimated 747 per 100,000 live births
(Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2000-Ol), contributing to a life expectancy o f 56 years in 2002
(from 53 years in 1999). While the total fertility rate also declined fi-om 6.2 percent in the eighties to 4.6
percent in 2000, the population growth remained high at around 2.5 percent. Conversely, chronic
malnutrition rates have stagnated between 1988 and 2001 (DHS), and remain a serious problem in rural
areas among the poorest and the very young (0-3 years) who are the most vulnerable. Nearly one third o f
children suffer from this condition. Inaddition, acute malnutrition, or wasting, at 13 percent constitutes a
serious health problem (see also Annex 1).

The health delivery system has been strengthened during the last decade and access to services and the
geographical distribution o f health personnel have improved. For instance, in 2003, child immunization
rates reached 73 percent, 63 percent o f deliveries were assisted by a health provider and the number of



                                                      4

consultations per inhabitant increased to 0.3-0.4 per year while hospital utilizations rates remained
stationary at around 60 percent. These figures demonstrate improvement but also modest performance.
Notwithstanding this progress, there i s needto further improve the sector's performance.

Mainhealth and nutrition sector issues are as follows:

Insufficient and inequitable access,problems with affordability and utilization of health and nutrition
services. Even as access to health services has increased, 23 percent o f the population must travel more
than five kilometers to reach a health center or a health post, and 10 percent must travel more than ten
kilometers to reach the nearest health facility. This, in a country like Mauritania, i s more dramatic than
elsewhere because of climatic and geographical conditions, the critical state o f roads and the cost of
transportation. Low accessibility i s among the main causes o f under utilization o f health services inrural
areas, inparticular inlow population-density areas (such as the central and northern regions). Other major
contributors to underutilization o f inpatient services and low attendance o f outpatient facilities are
affordability, in particular for the rural population, and health provider's behavior when discharging
services to the poor population. The government intends to update the "Infrastructure development plan"
and, by developing outreach community-based services, to reduce the existing disparities ingeographical
accessibility thus targeting the poor and other underserved groups in remote areas. Also, Government's
policy aims to better involve the private sector in the delivery o f basic services especially inurban cities
and to motivate providers.

Inadequate financing and inequitable resource allocation. The funding o f the health and nutrition
sectors remains low compared to the cost o f reasonably good service provision and makes the
achievement o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) questionable. Resource allocation to regions
and facilities i s not linked to performance nor does it pay sufficient attention to the needs of the poorest
regions. The Government has updatedthe Medium-Term Expenditures Framework (MTEF) for the period
2005-2007 in accordance with sector budget requirements and poverty reduction objectives. Emphasis
was given to the quality and equity o f the sector spending, better budget management and harmonization
of donors' procedures. Government has adopted a revised cost recovery system and has taken steps
towards the implementationo f mutual funds and subsidies targeting the poor and pregnant women.

Shortages of skilled of health care providers and low motivation. There has been progress in human
resources development (documented ina recent Health Personnel Census, 2004) e.g., a larger proportion
of providers i s now working inregions. However, shortages o f qualified and motivatedhealth and social
workers along with imbalances in the skill-mix and uneven geographical deployment remain among the
key factors affecting the quality and utilization o f services provided by the public sector. Ineffective
management, training and supervision exacerbate the lack o f responsiveness o f the system to the health
needs o f the population. To improve service provision to the rural population, the government i s
implementing innovative policy and reform measures (including incentives to the staff to relocate and
work inrural areas) that will need to be further pursued inthe years to come. Skilled nutrition staff inthe
health sector is very limited. Moreover, community nutrition workers, who received some training under
the earlier project, are relatively few and more intensive training i s urgently needed.

Inadequate drug quality and supply: Drug shortages continue to persist in health facilities and the
capacity o f the drug procurement and distribution system needs further strengthening. Inaddition, there
are problems with drug quality, which affect both the public and the many private pharmacies of the
country. The recently adopted pharmaceutical policy, which includes a new registration system and more
capacity to enforce regulation for drug quality control, ought to be thoroughly and promptly implemented
to reduce the circulation o f low quality and counterfeit drugs.




                                                      5

Insufficient institutional capacity. The Ministry o f Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) i s not
adequately staffed and equipped to provide efficient stewardship for the implementation o f the Health
Sector Development Plan and, generally speaking, to carry out its day to day management functions.
Although the regional health directorates (DRPSS) have been strengthened, this does not suffice to effect
adequate decentralization. To obtain more cooperation from stakeholders also require immediate and
sustained attention. Similarly, the State Secretariat for the Promotion o f Women [Secrktariat d'Etat i2 la
Condition Fkminine (SECF)] is not sufficiently decentralized. Inaddition, the SECF capacity to develop
nutritionpolicies, implement nutritioninterventions and deliver services i s inadequate. Program execution
inthe sector is slowed down by the rapid turn over of staff holding key positions and by weaknesses in
financial management and procurement. Issues such as the collection o f informationand quality data for
monitoring and evaluation are among the key elements that still require detailed analysis, planning and
support. Coordination between MOHSA and SECF, which share the mandate for malnutritionprevention
and reduction, has been problematic over the past years.

Poor management of health and nutrition service provision. Increased resource allocations have not
translated into increased performance o f many o f the priority health programs or interventions (such as
tuberculosis, malaria, reproductive health, infectious disease control, maternal and child health and
nutrition) because of weak management, poor intersectoral collaboration (in matters such as water,
sanitation, nutrition), insufficient community participation and lack o f emphasis on demand creation for
preventive services. The new health sector policy seeks to: (i)        firther decentralize the management o f
priority public health programs to the DRPSSs; (ii)          broaden the role o f health committees to include
prevention, hygiene and sanitation; (iii)      lay emphasis on IEC and other activities to induce behavior
changes; and (iv) improve intersectoral collaboration. The new National Nutrition Policy calls for a
stronger communication programto change behavior andpromote better feeding practices.

Inadequate commitment to nutrition: At the highest political levels, progress has been made inraising
the awareness o f nutrition as a development issue, witness the development o f a national nutrition policy
and the acceleration o f nutrition interventions over the last five years. However, nutrition i s still not seen
as a cause o f poverty and an obstacle to economic development, which for these reasons is worthy o f
investment. In addition, nutrition programs still have very low coverage, all o f which imply that much
more remains to be done inthis domain.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

Over the past decade, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction. It has
undertaken a broad macroeconomic, structural and social reform program and, since early 2001, has
implemented satisfactorily the Mauritania Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper (PRSP). Two PRSP progress
reports showed that MDGsremain highon the government's -agenda. But the said reports also pointedto
the fact that under current policies and withpresent financial flows, the country is highlyunlikely to reach
the health and nutrition related MDGs. Three years o f drought followed by the locust invasion may also
have hindered the achievements of targets. Between 1998 and 2003, other donor funds contribution as a
 share in health financing declined from 55 % o f the total health budget to 26 %. Additionally, one donor
has decided to redirect its aid to other sectors and another will channel its aid through budget support,
One important reason was the availability o f HIPC resources. Maintaining donor funding to the health
 sector is, therefore, critical. On the positive side, oil reserve exploitation might generate resources inmid-
term.

Experience from other countries in Africa and elsewhere has demonstrated that rapid improvement o f
national wealth (as the one anticipated in Mauritania due to the exploitation o f oil reserves) i s not
necessarily followed by a more equitable distribution o f resources and, more often than not, increases the
 gap between the rich and the poor. This is likely to also happen in Mauritania and provides the rationale


                                                          6

for continuing the support to health and other social services with emphasis on the accessibility and
affordability o f these services for the poor.

The main objective o f the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY03-05 i s to support the Government
inthe implementation ofitspovertyreduction strategy. The thirdCAS pillar isparticularlyrelevantto the
health and nutrition sectors: the development o f human resources and the expansion o f the accessto basic
infrastructure and services. The proposed Health and Nutrition Support Project (HNSP) would be
consistent with all the objectives o f the CAS, and especially relevant to human resource development,
increased access o f the poor to basic services, and institutional developmentbased on good governance.

The Government and IDA have been partners in the health sector in Mauritania since the early 90s. The
Bank's assistance consisted of: (i) Health and Population Project (FY92); (ii) Health Sector
                                        the                                                the
Investment Project (FY98); (iii)     the Nutricom Project which was a Nutrition Learning and Innovation
Loan (LIL) (FY99); and (iv) the multi-sector HIV/AIDS project (FY03). The Health and Population
Project and the Health Sector Investment Project had satisfactory outcomes and demonstrated
government's willingness and ability to address complex sectoral and developmental issues, while the
Nutrition LIL resulted in important lessons that have been incorporated in the project design. The
adoption o f a sector-wide approach (SWAP) for the implementation o f the Health Sector Investment
Project as early as in 1998 is another evidence o f Government's commitment. Notwithstanding the fact
that there was no pooling o f resources and common implementation arrangements, the sector-wide
approach used by the health sector in Mauritania was successful as it substantially contributed to the: (i)
strengthening o f the collaboration with donors and among stakeholders, (ii)     development o f an effective
planning and evaluation mechanism by means o f which donor activities became part o f sector-wide
annual operational plans, (iii)  decentralization o f decision making to regions and (iv) strengthening o f the
capacity in the sector and, to some extent, to the pursuance o f reform objectives such as the ones on drug
procurement (an autonomous DrugProcurement Agency was created), health provider re-deployment and
motivation system, emphasis on accessibility and affordability o f basic health services, etc. Therefore the
proposed credit would be fully justified since it will build on past achievements and, also, will help
pursue the reformprocess inthe sector.

The now closed Nutricomproject, which was implemented between 1999 and 2005, piloteda community-
based approach to reducing malnutrition in both urban and rural areas. The experience with the LE
showed that the country's capacity to develop nutrition policies and implement complex interventions
was overestimated. Although much has been done to improve the capacity, it remains weak and
inadequate for community-based growth promotion interventions to be scaled up under this new project.
Community-based growth promotion i s a managerially complex intervention that requires a highlevel of
supervision and motivation. On the other hand, national awareness o f nutrition being a development
problem and political commitment to engage inthe fight against malnutrition, have increased. A National
Nutrition Policy has been approved and i s being translated into programs in2005. However, malnutrition
rates remain very high in Mauritania and the focus o f this project being on nutrition i s in response to a
request from the government to continue addressing the issue.

Hence, the proposed HNSP i s fully consistent with the health and nutrition needs o f the population o f the
country as it would support the implementation o f the National Health and Social Action Policy 2005-
2015 (NHSAP), and the National Nutrition Development Policy 2005-2010 (NNDP). The Bank's
assistance to the country remains, therefore, essential to foster progress inthe health and nutrition sectors
and sustain efforts to provide equitable services to the under-served.

3. Higher level objectivesto which the project contributes

The Government's Program for the health and nutrition sectors i s clearly stated in the recently updated
National Health and Social Action Policy (NHSAP) and the newly adopted National Nutrition
Development Policy (NNDP). These policies, both developed through broad participatory processes, have
a strong poverty focus and aim at accelerating the achievement o f (i)more demanding health and
nutrition outcomes, (ii) sector reform objectives and, ultimately, (iii) and MDGs targets by the year
                                                                      PRSP
2015. The proposed HNSP would provide support to the implementation of these far-reaching policies
and targets.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The Health and Nutrition Support Project (HNSP) would be financed through a Specific Investment Loan
(SIL) o f US$lO.O million over a 3-year period (2007-2009) to support the Government's Program for the
health and nutrition sectors. The credit would assure the completion o f a range o f activities started under
the Health Sector Investment Project (closed on December 31, 2004) and use similar implementation
arrangements being a follow-up project. The lessons learned from the Nutricom project (closed on April
31, 2005) would also feed into the new design. Notwithstanding these similarities, HNSP's main thrust
would be to support (i)   measures to strengthen sector performance and institutional capacity (in the
MOHSA and the SECF, centrally and inregions) and (ii) key areas of concernto improve health
                                                            selected
and nutrition outcomes thus contributing to the achievement o f MDGs and poverty reduction objectives.

The proposed project would be an integral part o f the Government's health and nutrition policies and
would be implemented by the MOHSA (the health package described in component 4.1-4.4, section 4)
and the SECF (the community nutrition activities described in component 4.5, section 4) in a
collaborative and transparent manner with bilateral and multilateral donors and UN technical agencies
(French Development Agency, Spanish Cooperation, African Development Bank (AfDB), United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organization
(WHO)).

The part o f the operation to be implemented by MOHSA (80%) would be conceived as a sector-wide
operation (SWAP) and would be guided by the following principles:
0   Donor and government interventions will be (a) supportive to the agreed upon sector policy (National
    Healthand Social Action Policy (2005-2015) and (b) consistent with the MTEF;
0   Joint (Government and all donors) annual working sessions to review progress and to develop sector-
    wide work plans will be carried out;
    Key performance indicators will be agreed upon and will serve to monitor progress and evaluate
    outputs and outcomes; and
0   The SWAP will not entail pooling o f funds and harmonized procedures. However, as capacity
    improves, common procedures and implementation mechanisms will progressively be established ina
    move towards future programsupporthudget support.

The activities to be implemented by SECF (20%) would be based on:
0   An annual SECF work plansupporting the NationalNutritionDevelopment Policy (2005-2015);
    Key performance indicators that will be agreed upon and will serve to monitor progress and evaluate
    output and outcomes;
    A sector-wide approach would not be put in place for the community nutrition component for
    practical reasons (the SECF i s not used to implement such an approach, and the size o f the


                                                      8

    community development component would not justify the additional resources needed in order to
    implement such an approach).         However, for activities pertaining to the community nutrition
    component, the SECF will participate and contribute to the MOHSA annual sector review.

IDA fundswouldbe allocatedon an annualbasisbasedonthe followingprocess:
    Yearly, M O H S A will evaluate the implementation of the Annual Operational Plan (POAS) of the
    previous year and develop an operational plan for the upcoming year (based on regional and
    departmental submissions);
    Included inthe annual operational plan for the health sector will be the Annual Nutrition Action Plan
    (PAAN) for the Nutrition interventions, which will be prepared by the SECF on the basis o f annual
    reviews o f the progress inimplementing community-based nutrition activities;
    The POAS will be discussed and approvedby donors, other stakeholders, and IDA;
    The POAS and the PAAN set o f activities to be funded from the IDA credit and the related
    procurement and disbursement plans will be submitted to IDA for non-objection; and
    Due to the short time-span o f the proposed operation (three years) and based on the lessons learned
    from other IDA supportedactivities inthe sector, IDA support to civil works will be identifiedfor the
    entire 3-year period and would be formalized into a Procurement and Disbursement Plan for civil
    works. Civil works being a small disbursement category in this project will constitute less than 25%
    o f the total credit.

The following will guide the overall execution o f the program:
0   Resources will be allocated with preference to the poorest regions;
0   Priority will be given to improving the functioning o f existing health facilities, i.e. personnel and
    other necessary support would be provided with priority to facilities whose performance needs
    improvement;
0   An update of the infrastructure development plan, including (a) a review o f the situation of health
    facilities that are not operating (sewices de santk non-fonctionnels) and (b) a review o f human
    resources in the sector and regions, will be conducted and will initially be financed fi-om the PPF.
    These documents will be used inthe POASdevelopmentprocess;
0   The Government will implement specific measures to render drugs and services affordable, facilitate
    the access o f the poor and raise the demand for health services with emphasis on prevention. The
    implementation and observance of these thrusts will be monitoredsystematically;
0   Communication, not weighing, i s the essential component o f the community-based nutrition strategy,
    implyingthat activities and services are not solely center-based but more geared towards coverage
    and impact; and
0   The community nutrition strategy will be expanded to two additional Regions.

2. Program objective

The overall objective o f the Government Program i s to contribute to the improvement o f the health and
nutrition status o f the population in general, notably o f women, children, and the poor, and by that
accelerate progress towards the health and nutrition related MDG targets. The Government Program i s
stated inthe recently updatedNational Health and Social Action Policy (2005-2015) and a newly adopted
National Nutrition Development Policy (2005-2010). The HNSP would be a support project to assist the
Government to implement these policies.

The following strategies are outlined inthe Government's policies as well as in the MTEF (2005-2007):
(i) resourcesdevelopmentwithemphasisonskillsandreasonablegeographicaldistribution;(ii)
   human
expansion o f coverage and improvement o f quality and utilization o f health and nutrition services; (iii)
availability o f quality drugs at affordable prices; (iv) raising the demand for primary health services with

emphasis on prevention; (v) social action and creation o f an environment conducive to health and
nutrition; (vi) capacity building to improve performance and use resources more efficiently; (vii)
provision o f adequate financial resources; and (viii) intersectoral collaboration and broader involvement
o f stakeholders.

3. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveand key indicators

3.1. Project Development Objective
The HNSP overall objective i s to strengthen the health system and its capacity to improve the health and
nutrition status o f the population, notably o f women, children, and the poor, as it will support the
implementation of the Government Program for the health and nutrition sectors during the period 2006-
2008.

HNSP would have the following more specific objectives:
         (i) accesstobasichealthservicesinunderservedareas;
            improve
         (ii)improve the equitable allocation ofresources to underserved areas;
         (iii)strengthen the health sector management to raise efficiency; and
         (iv) enhance andexpandcommunity-based communications for improvednutrition.
Progress towards the achievement of these specific objectives would be monitored during HNSP
implementation.

4. Project components

HNSP would provide support to priority activities for which there i s a financial gap, provided that they
are consistent with the sector policy and there i s agreement on their relevance. However, based on lessons
learned from past operations, it was deemed necessary to pre-identify the entire set o f civil works that
would be supported fi-om the credit. Also, the implementation of the Health Sector Investment Project
demonstrated that a certain focus on key issues is necessary, thus making possible to evaluate outputs ina
more specific manner. Focusing on key issues would also allow a more substantial contribution to the
achievement o f MDGs, which is the fundamental priority o f the country. Lastly, and based again on past



                                                       11

experience inMauritania and elsewhere, it was deemed usefulto retain a certain flexibility in financing,
to monitor progress periodically and to plan in a transparent manner depending upon the ever evolving
situation in the sector (in terms of needs, financing and implementation capacity). As a consequence of
the above features, activities to receive financial support from the credit would fall into two categories:
(i) pertainingtoallotherdisbursementcategorieswouldbediscussedandagreedupononan
    Support
annual basis using the annual progress review and operational planning process already inplace; and (ii)
Civil works would be launched during the first year o f the operation, and. The HNSP funding would
remain flexible because part o f the credit will be allocated on an annual basis and also because the totality
of IDA funded activities will be reviewed every year and adjustments made when and ifneeded.

The proposed HNSP would provide support focusing on the areas identified below. The MOHSA would
implement the health package described in paragraphs 4.1-4.4 and SECF would implement the
community-based nutritioninterventions as described inparagraph 4.5.

4.1 Further develop humanresources and improvetheir geographicaldistribution(US$2.0 million).
The project would support activities to (i)  strengthen the sector capacity to manage human resources; (ii)
improve inter and intra-sectoral coordination for better management o f human resources; and (iii)
improve management and content of training programs, including formative supervision.

     e             Professionalize the Directorate of Human Resources at all levels through: (i)
     strengthening human and material capacities o f the DHR in order to fulfill its mandate; (ii)
     maintaining a human resources management system that uses a forecasting and preventive approach
     contributing to an improved knowledge and a better distribution o f available staff (technical and
     administrative), inaccordance with revised staffing norms, expressed needs, and available resources.
     e             Improve coordinating mechanismsfor improved human resources management through:
     (i)   establishing a network system for information sharing between the DHR an the DRPSS on
     staffing, needs, etc.; (ii)strengthening the capacities to manage human resources at the level o f the
     DRPSS; (iii)    strengthening DHR capacity to participate in the public administration reforms within
     the MOHSA and those led by other ministries; (iv) improving coordination between the
     DHR/MOHSA and other sectors involved in human resources management; and (v) piloting an
     accountability systemfor health care providers co-managedwith the communities.
     e             Improve the management and content of pre-services and in-service training, and on-the-
    job training through: (i)    improving the coordination with training institutes (ENPS, INSM), while
     exploring possibilities o f sub-contracting with training institutes located in the sub-region; (ii)
     improving efficiency o f the DHR to manage training abroad and maintain personal file accordingly;
     (iii) curriculaandtrainingprogramstoreflectthenationalhealthpolicyorientationsuchas
           revising
     quality-assurance (approach centered on the patient), environmental management, training o f trainers;
     and (iv) improving integrated formative supervision from the central to the regional level and from
     the regional to the decentralizedlevel.

 4.2 Ensure adequate sector financing and equitable allocation of resources for the poor and for
 underserved geographical areas (US%1.5 million). The project would support activities (i) improve  to
 the existing process and methods for mobilizing the different sources of sector financing and for
 allocating them more equitably; and (ii)   to strengthen measures to ensure financial accessibility to health
 services, increase utilization of services by the poorest and most vulnerable, and to rationalize the existing
 cost recovery system.

     e             Mobilization and allocation of sector financial resources. To further support MOHSA's
     progress since 2003 in improving the annual budget preparation process, the HNSP will provide
     technical and financial assistance to strengthen ministry capacity to: (i) prepare the annual updates of
     the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the sector; (ii)       establish criteria for distribution


                                                       12

     o f budget and for allocations by level o f care, region, type o f expenditure, etc.; and (iii)  organize
     annual sectoral expenditure reviews. The project will also contribute to the preparatory work
     necessary to establishnational health accounts (NHA).
     0            Financial access of the population to health services. Given the increasing financial
     needs o f the sector, the stabilizing of available resources for health, and the relatively low level o f
     budgeted health expenditures over the last three years, the HNSP will support efforts: (i)   to subsidize
     essential health services for the poor and other targeted populations; (ii) to organize payment o f health
     services for the poorest andmost vulnerable populations who are unable to afford subsidized services;
     and (iii) to help those populations interested in and able to establish alternative financing systems
     (mutuelles) at community level to share risks. In addition, the HNSP will provide support for
     strengthening the cost recovery system, including revising the regulatory basis for charging and
     collecting monies and training facility-level management committees.

4.3 Improve health sector management to raise efficiency (US$l.O million). This component would
finance activities: (i) to promote the sector-wide approach; and (ii) develop the management capacity
                                                                         to
o f health sector personnel at all levels.


     0            Developing the sector-wide approach. Initiated in 1998 with support from the HSSP, the
     sector-wide process has advanced, and HNSP would provide support to MOH in the process o f
     formulating a memorandum of understanding clearly establishing the objectives, roles and
     relationships o f the collaboration.
     0            Strengthening of sector management capabilities. HNSP would concentrate especially
     on: (i)enhanced coordination o f the planning and budgeting process; (ii)      increased budget execution
     through more efficient organization o f the procurement process and improved financial management;
     and (iii) development o f measures and modalities for monitoring and evaluating the programmatic
     interventions.
     0            Monitoring and evaluation. HNSP would monitor and evaluate progress within the
     overall context of: (i) poverty reduction strategy through achievement o f the MDGs pertaining to
                             the
     health; (ii)the development o f a consolidated sectoral program with common measures and
     procedures for supervising, monitoring, and evaluating results; et (iii)        the regular submission o f
     project reports on physical and financial results as well as periodic supervision o f HNSP's key
     performance indicators.

4.4 Improve the accessibility to quality and affordable health services in underserved areas (US$3.5
million). This component include activities to (i)    improve access to and quality o f basic health services,
(ii) demandforservices,and(iii)
    raise                                 strengthening o f the monitoring and evaluation o fthe quality o f the
services.


     0            Construction o f approximately 13 health posts and 1 health center in areas o f low
     accessibility to public or private health services and rehabilitation o f selected primary health facilities.
     The sites o f these facilities would be chosen based on accessibility criteria, estimated number o f
     population in the catchment area, possible existence o f specific health problems, etc.. The facilities
     will benefit from maintenance and equipping, including the provision o f equipment to ensure
     effective medical waste management.
     0            Activities to improve access to and quality of services by: (i) strengthening o f
                                                                                           the
     outreach activities from health posts, and the revival o f the community approach in order to ensure
     improved access to preventive child, maternal and nutrition interventions for the population inhard-
     to-reach areas; and (ii) the improvement o f the availability o f drugs.
     0            Activities to raise the demand for health and nutrition services, with emphasis on
     prevention, and to induce behavioral changes conducive to health and nutritional improvements; and



                                                       13

    increase community participation inthe management o f health services and to render health providers
    more responsive to the needs of the underserved populations.
    0             Strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of the quality of the services provided
    through the enhancement o f the integrated formative supervision, and the revitalization of the
    monitoring system of the primary health care facilities.
    0             Strategies to be supported would include: (i)      reduction o f child mortality primarily by the
    extension o f the Integrated Approach to Childhood Illness (IMCI); (ii)        reduction o f maternalmortality
    by the improvement of the availability, the quality and the utilization o f emergency obstetrical and
    neonatal care; and (iii)    decrease inthe incidence of schistosomiasis'.

4.5 Enhance and expand community-based communications for improved nutrition (US$2.0
million). This component would finance activities to: (i)develop and implement a community-based
nutrition communication strategy, (ii)      improve access to basic essential health and nutrition services; (iii)
support the application of the salt iodization law in close collaboration with UNICEF; and (iv) strengthen
the capacity o fthe SECF to plan, monitor andevaluate nutritioncommunication program implementation.
This will be achieved usingcommunity mobilization strategies, training ofpolyvalent community agents,
and interpersonal communication strategies supported by group and mass communication strategies.
Basic essential health and nutrition services refer to essential services that can be provided by trained
community agents, e.g., micronutrient supplementation, de-worming, and distribution o f bed-nets.
Messages about micronutrients would typically be included under the communications program to
mobilize the community and raise awareness about the importance. The MOH and the SECF, by means
o f a memorandum o f understanding, will coordinate efforts and collaborate on community health and
nutrition issues.

5. Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design

The proposed project would be the fourth IDA-financed project in the health and nutrition sectors in
Mauritania and would be the first operation simultaneously supporting health and nutrition, and
implemented by two partners (ie., MOHSA and SECF). Lessons learned from other projects, notably in
Mauritania, and reflectedinto HNSP design include:

    ProjectManagement.Withregardto management, a projectmanagementunitcanbe very effective,
but might not necessarily help develop the implementation agency's capacity. As a consequence, at
project closing, unless the project unit's staff become civil servants, part of the investment i s lost. The
MOHSA has successfully drawn from this lesson and the Health Sector Investment Project had already
been implemented by MOHSA staff. Inthe case o f the HNSP, the Government opted again for a project
to be implemented by the health and nutrition sector administrations, and undertook to strengthen the
capacity o f key MOHSA and SECF departments to ascertain adequate project implementation.


0   Monitoring and evaluationindicators.Agreeing on a set o f monitoring and evaluation indicators
does not suffice, if at mid-term and at project closing comparable and reliable information cannot be
made available. Taking into account this observation, the HNSP will provide support to strengthen the
Management Information System and improve data quality and reporting. The HNSP will also contribute
to the financing o f a DHS, which would provide data to document trends since the last DHS (also
conducted with IDA support in 2000/2001). Finally, a beneficiary assessment will be carried out in the
project's preparationphase.

` Activities for control o f other endemic diseases already receive adequate financing fromother sources such as The
Global Fundfor malaria and tuberculosis, or GAVIfor vaccination, as well as UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank
M A P for HIV/AIDS. However, ifneeded, these areas would also be eligible for funding from the credit.


                                                          14

0   Cost Recovery provides much needed additional resources to the facility that raised the money but,
in a poor country such Mauritania, could (i) the poor from trying to seek care and (ii)
                                               deter                                             constitute a
disincentive for the health providers to dispense preventive services (which generally remain free of
charge). HNSP will, therefore, support a review o f current cost recovery practices in Mauritania and,
based on this review, the generalizationo f those best practices which include adequate measures to render
services affordable to the poor (such as subsidies, exemption from payment, community based solidarity
mechanisms and pre-payment schemes (mutuelles villagoises).


0   Role of Women. The successful collaboration with the SECF inNutricom demonstrated once more
that women play a major role inhealth status improvement and ineconomic growth. It also demonstrated
that inMauritania, as well as elsewhere, they connect easily with the rural population and the underserved
groups. Therefore, the HNSP would consistently seek ways to directly involve women and its entire
nutrition part i s entrustedto the SECF.


0   Community Involvement. Community involvement i s a major success-factor in many operations
and this was also demonstrated throughout several projects and, in Mauritania, very specifically through
the Health Sector Investment andNutricomProjects. Therefore, the HNSP will further pursue community
involvement, which will take a larger dimension due, among others, to the stress on decentralization and
responsiveness to populationneeds that characterizes the project.


0   A sector-wide approach, when feasible, has considerable advantages over a traditional investment
project. The Government i s inthe driver's seat, i s incharge o f implementing and evaluating activities that
are part o f its own policy, and coordinates donors' contributions. Costly duplications could be avoided and
the additional time spent for reaching consensus among stakeholders i s a good investment for motivating
partners, building up capacity and ownership. Learning from the experience gained with the previous
Health Sector Investment Project, the proposed project will also be designed as a SWAP. Moreover, the
HNSP will capitalize on the use o f the annual review and planning process for continuously monitoring
progress and planning, and will continue to relay on an open and transparent collaboration with donors
and NGOs. However, the Health Sector Investment Project also demonstrated some shortcomings such as
the fact that IDA financing was distributed to too many minute activities (all useful but dispersed ina way
that precluded the identification of tangible outcome changes). In order to avoid a relapse into this
situation and to better prioritize, the HNSP design includes a focus on five project components that
address key sectoral issues that may prevent the achievement o f the policy objectives and MDGs.


0   The Heavily Indebted and Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The Heavily Indebted and Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative has made a strong contribution to addressing key issues under the health
development program. It helped put health issues at the center of the policy dialogue between Mauritania
and the Bank. It gave a new impetus for re-launching the immunizationprogram, and provided additional
resources to the health sector, some of which were used to give hardship allowances to the staff posted
outside the capital city. Further to this observation, it i s intended to continue to pursue both avenues
(HIPC and HNSP) and use the CAS and the country team discussions for coordination and support. The
PRSP highlighted the malnutrition problem as a development problem in Mauritania, which helped add
the nutrition sector on the development agenda. The continuation o f investment in nutrition i s a direct
result o f the attention it was given inthe PRSP.


0    Supply of services does not necessarily increase utilization rates. The Health Sector Investment
Project has proved this statement (consultations/population ratio and hospital utilization rates have
remained quasi stationary) and demonstrated the need to initiate, early in the process, specific activities
aiming a improving the demand for services. These activities are often not costly and can also be used to


                                                      15

reach other objectives such as educating the consumer on health issues, inducing behavioral changes,
increasing user's involvement in health facility management. For that reason, demand raising activities
and community involvement will receive HNSP funding with priority. In fact, the community-based
nutrition communications program i s intended to include next to direct key-behavior messages to improve
young child feeding-practices, messages on basic health which raise awareness and create demand for
services.

6. Alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection

Lendinginstrument:
As mentioned, the proposed HNSP would be a follow-on operation to the previous Health Sector
Investment Project and the Nuh-icom Project and it would be financed through a Specific Investment
Loan (SIL). The proposed operation would utilize a sector-wide approach similar to the one applied
successfully during the implementation o f the Health Sector Investment Project but with a broader scope,
as the HNSP will support not only the MOHSA policy for the health sector but also the SECF policy for
nutrition. The annual program review and operational planning process (POAS) will continue to be the
main instrument for monitoring, allocating resources, reaching consensus and planning. The HNSP will
not use common implementation arrangements and pooling of funds to which most donors inMauritania
do not adhere as yet. IDA moneys for civil works will be pre-identified. The remainder o f IDA funds will
be allocated through the POAS process to support activities aiming at addressing five key health and
nutritionissues as stated insection B4 on HNSP components and Annex 4 on HNSP detailed description.

Other lending instruments and approaches also considered were:

        Two freestanding follow-up operations to the previous Health Sector Investment Project and
        Nutricom to be financed through a PRSC were initially envisaged. This formula was rejected
        because o f the delay incurred inthe PRSC and also inan attempt to use resources more rationally.
        A supplemental financing to the Health Sector Investment Project was also considered and
        rejected as such financing was not meetingthe conditions stipulated inthe Operational Policies.
        The choice of a Development Policy Lending was also proposed. Such a lending instrument was
        not found feasible since it requires an IMF program on track (which i s currently not the case in
        Mauritania). Inaddition, a budget support instrument would not be optimal for the execution o f
        community based health and nutrition activities (that are central to the proposedoperation).
        The choice o f an APL was discussed and rejected as future financing needs for the sector are hard
        to predict at this point intime inMauritania (e.g., ina few years exploitation o f oil reserves may
        improve the financing o f the sector and may also impact on donor financing and programs).
        Classical targeted investment projects were considered as an alternative to one single sector-wide
        project and discussed with the Government and donors. Such projects may yield more immediate
        benefits and disburse IDA funds more promptly. However, the drawbacks o f the approach would
        outweigh advantages as it would (i)   create and undue reliance on donor-initiated decisions; (ii)
        delay and detract from MOHSA and SECF policies; (iii) not be the best vehicle for sector
                                                                   may
        reform; and (iv) provide narrower sector and health status benefits. The rationale for combining
        health and nutrition was also supported by the interrelationship between malnutrition and disease
        and by the need to coordinate health and nutrition activities to create synergy and avoid
        duplication.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

Duringthe implementation of the Health Sector Investment Project and the Nutricom Project, relations
with donors, NGOs and other sectors improved substantially, all major policy documents were developed
in close consultation with external and internal partners most of whom became also active partners in
program implementation. The annual operational planning process was valuable inbuildingpartnership
as it provided an opportunity to comprehensibly exchange information on the situation inthe sector, and
on the activities being implemented or planned thus helping to reduce duplication and better focus on
sectoral priorities. The role of various external partners and the content o f their programs became better
understood. For instance, WHO has focused on disease control programs and policy matters, UNICEF on
nutrition and child survival programs and policy including immunizations, UNFPA on reproductive
health and supporting technically the demographic and health survey, and the population census (the latter
activities were executed by ONS (OfJice National de la Statistique), the French cooperation supported
among other things the set up o fthe drugprocurement facility and warehouse.

IDA took the lead inpublic expenditure analysis and capacity buildingand also played a leading role in
donor coordination and its role as last resort lender was well appreciated. As a result o f successful donor
coordination work, a Memorandum o f Understanding was signed and a "Partner Group for the
Development o f Health, Social Action andNutrition Sectors" was created.

The MOHSA has already demonstrated its interest and leadership. The MOHSA decided on a Donors
Coordination leader who assisted the Government in the coordination o f donor assistance programs and
activities. The partner group supported and advised the MOHSA and the SECF duringthe preparation o f
the national health and nutrition policies, including in the deepening o f the analysis on core bottlenecks,
in carrying out a detailed institutional and organizational capacity analysis at all levels of the health
sector, and inelaborating the MTEF.

The identification and preparationof the proposedHNSP i s the result of intensive discussions with all key
bilateral and multilateral donors and UN technical agencies. All those partners have endorsed and
welcomed this process and have pledged to focus their interventions to maximize their contribution to the
achievement o f the objectives o f the health and nutritionpolicies and MTEF.

All the above mentionedpartnership arrangements will be further strengthened, usedand supportedbythe
HNSP.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

Implementation will emphasize the strengthening o f national health systems and capacity. Common
procedures and implementation mechanisms, according to country specific guidelines, will progressively
be established and adopted ina move towards program supporthudget support as capacity improves. The
project will support Annual Operational Plans (POAS) which give the MOHSA and the SECF the
responsibility for choosing actions in accordance with established priorities found in their respective
sectoral policies. This approach provides some flexibility while ensuring accountabilities towards
reaching results and outcomes. Furthermore, an agreement between the MOHSA and the SECF will be
signed in order to clarify and define respective roles and responsibilities with regard to the
implementation o fthe project, specifically, referral and outreach.




                                                      17

Technical Implementation Arrangements:

MOHSA: A decree (number 025 dated May 5, 2005) on the attributions o f the MOHSA has recently
been adopted to better respondto the requirements o f the NationalHealthand Social Action Policy and to
achieve the MDGs. To this end, a new organigramme has been elaborated and the implementation
modalities for the SWAP presented inAnnex 6 refer to the new organigramme.

The successful implementation o f the program will require a high level o f coordination and oversight
capacity within the MOHSA. As such, and under the authority o f the Minister, the overall responsibility
will lay with the Secretary General who will ensure strategic coordination of all actions foreseen under
the Program. The Secretary General will represent the MOHSA when liaising with cross-cutting
ministries (Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Development and Ministry o f Civil Service) and will
coordinate the overall functions and responsibilities o f the technical directorates.                Technical
implementation o f project activities will be fully integrated into the MOHSA structures.

SECF: The SECF will be responsible for the implementation of the community nutrition activities.
While the central level was heavily involved inthe planning and monitoringo f activities under the former
Nutricom LE project, these responsibilities will now be decentralized to the regional level. Hence, the
central management unit o f the SECF will be responsible for: (i)     overall coordination activities regarding
the project itself and with other sectors at the central level; (ii)  capacity building o f the regional level
operators; (iii) technical guidance on the implementation through policy development, training and
supervision; and (iv) ensuring overall financial management according to rules and procedures in close
collaboration with MSASDAF.

Subsequently, the regional level will be responsible for planning and monitoring o f the activities related
to the community nutrition activities and elaborating the regional-level annual action plans; and
coordinating the activities within their regions. The regional services will be the decentralized structures
responsible for the activities carried out at the community level. They will assist with social mobilization
and ensure data collection and timely monitoringreports o f activities.

Fiduciary Implementation Arrangements
Financial Management. The financial management will be handled by the DAF o f the MOHSA (for the
components 4.1-4.4) and by a Finance Specialist within the SECF (for the component 4.5). The two
specialists will be responsible for (a) preparing monthly Special Account (SA) reconciliation statement,
and quarterly Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs) Withdrawal Schedule, quarterly financial monitoring
reports, and annual financial statements; and (b) ensuring that the project financial management
arrangements are acceptable to the Government and IDA. They will also be responsible for forwarding
the reports and statements to the Government and IDA.

Flow of Funds. The overall project fundingwill consist o f IDA Credit and Counterpart Funds according
to newly adopted Country Financial Parameters limited to 90 percent. With respect to bankmg
arrangements, IDA will disburse the credit through two Special Accounts (SA) operated by the MOHSA
and the SECF.

Financial Reporting. All bank accounts will be reconciled with bank statements on a monthly basis. A
copy of each bank reconciliation statement together with a copy o f the relevant bank statements will be
reviewedmonthly and will expeditiously investigate any identified differences. As the project will not be
ready for report-based disbursements, it i s proposed that at the initial stage, transaction-based
disbursement procedures (i.e. direct payment, reimbursement, and special commitments), as described in
the World Bank Disbursement Handbook, be followed. However, when project implementation begins




                                                       18

and the borrower requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the
Bank-FMS to determine ifthe project i s eligible to convert to FMRs.

The project will prepare and submit to IDA Audited Project Financial Statements within six months after
year end. By Credit Effectiveness, relevantly qualified external auditors will be appointed by the
Government on the basis o f terms o f reference acceptable to IDA. The auditors will audit the project
accounts and financial statements in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. The audit
reports will include a single opinion on (i)the Audited Project Financial Statements, (ii) accuracy and
                                                                                           the
propriety o f expenditures made under the SOE procedures and the extent to which these can be relied
upon as a basis for loan disbursements, and (iii) the Special Accounts.

Medical WasteManagement Arrangements:
        At the regional level, the DRPSS and the health districts will be responsible for the management
        o f medical waste within their jurisdiction; they will establish technical operating units who will
        oversee the implementation o f the national policies for health care facilities in their respective
        areas.
        At the level o fthe health care centerhealthpost, the responsible o f each o f these facilities will be
        in charge of medical waste management; will be accountable for overseeing the proper
        application o f regulations and procedures; and will appoint teams responsible for sorting waste at
        the source; collection; storage; transport; and disposal o f waste.
        The Ministry o f Rural Development and Environment will ensure the strict application o f
        environmental norms and procedures (pollution standards; environmental assessment procedures
        and approval o f environmental studies) regarding all activities related to medical waste
        management.
        The Communes will be responsible for maintaining clean surroundings, and they will ensure that
        no untreated medical waste along with domestic waste i s disposed at the waste dumps which they
        manage. They will also be required to give their prior approval o f projects that might negatively
        affect public health, especially the collection, transport and disposal o f medical waste in their
        areas.
        At the level of the health centerihealthpost, the project will support the establishment of hygiene
        committees and officers responsible for medical waste management at these facilities.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomedresults

As mentioned, the implementation of the Health Sector Investment Project helped institutionalize an
annual review and planning process. Consequently, during the last eight years monitoring and evaluation
were regularly performed and improved. A Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for the years
2000/2001 provided outcome data and a population census (also supported by the Health Sector
Investment Project) provided reliable population data including their breakdown per regions and
departments. It also helped standardize the official names for cities and villages (inMauritania a locality
could have many names and different spellings and this situation was a major hurdle for the inventory and
planning for health infrastructure, and, more generally, indata reporting).

Notwithstanding these achievements, the lessons learned from the implementation of the Health Sector
Investment Project have also shown that (i)        the Monitoring and Information system needs further
improvement, (ii)  more attention should be paid to data quality, (iii) collection of information on
                                                                           the
donor activities was incomplete and needed to be further discussed with the relevant donors, (iv) to
accurately evaluate outcome and impact (health status indicators) surveys should be carried out at
intervals matching the start, mid-term and end o f the operation.




                                                      19

All these lessons were taken into account in the design of the HNSP, namely: (a) adequate attention to
MDGsand MDGsrelated indicators, (b) emphasis on and support to informationand monitoring system,
data quality and timely reporting, (c) improved information on all partners' activities, (d) agreement on a
relevant set o f monitoring indicators (including on the periodicity o f reporting) that the sector can report
with a reasonable effort and cost, (e) support to surveys to take place at criticalpoints intime inprogram
and project development.

Additionally, the HNSP would likely face two factors inregard to outcome/impact evaluation. Firstly, a
DHS i s costly and require a multi-donor effort both interms o f technical assistance and money. Itremains
uncertain to date whether the sector will be able to carry out a DHS in 2006 and another one in
2008/2009. Secondly, the HNSP will be implemented over a short period o f time (three years) and
changes in health status indicators, even if they occur, might not be measurable in a statistically
significant manner (due to survey margins o f error).

Beneficiary assessments will be instrumental in collecting information on the user's satisfaction with
services and to a certain extent on behavioral aspects and there will be more collaboration with Ministry
of Finance among others to improve the budget and expenditure data.

Lastly, the partners will meet once a year with the Government to review progress accomplished under
the HNSP duringthe previous year against the agreed upon indicators and to agree on the POAS and the
budget for the following year and ensure coherence with the HNSP priorities. Prior to those meetings,
MOHSA will submit to donors, detailed reports on performance and planning. These meetings will also
examine data quality and the needs for improvingreporting and, will also examine the overall progress in
the sector towards the meeting o f policy targets and MDGs.

4. Sustainability

There are major factors that will contribute to HNSP sustainability:


0      The HNSP supports the Program proposed by the Government for the health and nutrition sectors
for the period 2005-2015. There i s a wide consensus and commitment to this program that it i s built on
and further develops the previous policies for the health sector (Plan Directeur 1991-1995/6, Plan
Directeur 1998-2002, andPlan d'Actionpour la Nutrition -updated in2002).


0      There is also a demonstrated commitment by the Government towards poverty reduction and
MDGs. The 2004 Public Expenditures Review: "Focusing Public Expenditure on Growth and Poverty
Reduction" conducted by the World Bank has provided evidence that the Government's policy has indeed
been implemented, that resources have been used in accordance with its requirements, and that the
financing  o f the sector has steadily been improved.


0      The MTEF and the anticipated enhanced collaboration with Ministry o f Finance will guide the
development inthe sector ina more down-to-earth manner.


0        The HNSP i s not an IDA triggered initiative. The Government has demonstrated ownership and i s
inlead ofall donor activities. Furthermore, the Government is implementingthe project with its own staff
and rightly perceives the HNSP as part and parcel o f its own activities for the sector.


0        The HNSP i s expected to contribute to buildinga sustainable structure for the implementation of
community-based activities through its focus on capacity buildingat the regional level. Inaddition, by the

end of the project, coordination betweenthe MOHSA and SECF, the two leading agencies inthe nutrition
sector, will have been institutionalized into a sustainable work arrangement.


e         There i s consensus with donors and other partners that the HNSP should continue the approach
launched with the opportunity o f previous operations. This consensus translates into transparent
relationship and mutual support and it is skillfully harnessed by the Government in its pursuit o f sectoral
objectives. From a financial sustainability perspective, however, the answer i s less clear since, at present,
the public financing to the health and nutrition sectors remains insufficient and, overall, there i s a decline
in donor financing. It is for these reasons that the HNSP lays emphasis on improving financing and
efficiency. Ina medium term perspective, the exploitation o f newly discovered oil reserves, might impact
favorably on the country's wealth and, hopefully, make a major contribution to poverty alleviation,

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financialanalyses

A project specific economic and financial analysis was not conducted for this project, as: (i) is a
                                                                                                 HNSP
follow-on project to the Health Sector Investment and the Nutricomprojects for which such analyses were
conducted; (ii)   the HNSP overarching goal i s to assist Government to reach MDG by means of well
proven cost effective strategies and (iii)a Public Expenditures Review was conducted recently and
provided relevant information on and analysis o f the sector policy from an economic perspective.
Moreover, a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 2005-2007 was recently developed aiming to help
the sector become more results-oriented, reduce inefficiencies and, to better support the Government's
 efforts to reachthe MDGs.

 Since 2001 the trends o f donors hnding to the health sector i s decreasing while the government spending
 i s increasing. Donors funding represented 55 percent o f the total health expenditures in 1999 but only 29
 percent in 2002 and 27 percent in2003. Inthe meantime, IDA i s becoming the major donor representing
 64 percent in 2003 against 14 percent o f external financing in 1998. Donors financing is still
 characterized by the difficulties to track funds and the use o f separate procedures for financial resources
 mobilization, accounting and reporting andprocurement.

 Based on available data showing trends in Government spending and assuming that financing by other
 donors (exclusive o f IDA) does not decrease further over the next three years, it i s projected that IDA
 during the three year implementation period will contribute to finance approximately 9% of total
 (government and donors) spending in the sector, other donors contributing to a little less (an average of
 6.7%). This is a marked reduction in donor financing compared to the last four years where donors
 financed in average 28% of the spending in the sector. The Government intends to conduct an economic
 analysis of the impact o f the decreasing external fundingto the sector.

 The Public Expenditures Review: Mauritania, Focusing Public Expenditure on Growth and Poverty
 Reduction, Public Expenditure Review,June 25, 2004 (Report No. 29167-MAU) shows the following:

 Over the last years the economic performance inMauritania has been satisfactory. Over the period 1998-
 2003, real GDP growth averaged 4.3 percent 1998-2003. Macroeconomic stability was consolidated and
 inflation declined from 8 percent in 1998 to an average o f 4 percent over 1999-2002. The overall balance
 of payment position remained favorable. The recent discovery o f relatively important oil and gas reserves
 could have a major impact on the economy inthe medium-term. Production i s supposed to start in2006.

 Over the period 1998-2002, the allocation o f funds to the health sector increased from 1.9 to 4.0 percent
 of GDP, (while expenditure on health increased from $7.7 to $13.9 per capita). However, low absorptive
 capacity and late release o f funds caused an important gap between allocated budgets and actual spending.

 Mauritania has made remarkable efforts inredirecting health spending towards decentralized units. Now
 more than 57 percent o f the health sector budget i s spent in decentralized units compared to 40 percent
 targeted. However, the poorest regions have benefited less than others and equity has not been achieved



                                                      23

as intended. Richer regions tend to spend more public money per person compared with the poor regions.
This phenomenonwill needto beredressed inthe future, with a view to improving the health status of the
poorest segments o f the population.

Although the size o f cost recovery schemes at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels i s relatively
small, these arrangements have succeeded in keeping drugs accessible to the poor. However recent
problems call for the reform o f the cost recovery system in order to improve the management of its
proceeds and better protect the utilization o f health services by the poor.

Regarding affordability of services, a system o f exemptions exists for underprivileged people, for
preventive services like immunizations and for curative services needed in relation to conditions such as
tuberculosis, leprosy etc., which have strong public externalities. As these conditions affect more
frequently the poor, the health system also promotes equity. The central drug procurement facility,
CAMEC, has limited capacity to supply drugs to all public health facilities. Stock outages o f essential
drugs and vaccines are frequent.




2. Technical

The policy for the health sector is technically sound and the issues o f quality, access and equity are
addressed systematically. The Government emphasizes poverty reduction as the main objective for the
country and for its collaboration with the World Bank, and stresses the importance o f the health sector.
As the new health policy continues the policies launched by GOM in 1991 and 1998, there i s also
evidence that the sector policy i s being consistently applied, i s appropriate for the country, and has started
to have an impact on the health status. This i s evidenced by the last PER carried out in 2004, which has
demonstrated regular improvement in financial resources (contributed by GOM) and rational use o f
resources (emphasis on primary and secondary care, right ratios between investment and recurrent
expenditures, and between recurrent and recurrent non-salary expenditures, a continuous effort to
decentralize service delivery and decision-making, etc.). The Program will pursue cost-effective
interventions (approximately 75% o f the interventions fall in the category o f high-cost-effective
interventions). The GOMwill also continue to strengthen healthdelivery capacity at the outreach.




                                                       24

The former Nutricom LIL project envisaged a strategy o f community-based growth monitoring and
promotion. However, capacity has repeatedlybeen shown to be inadequate to pull this off successfully. In
practice, the emphasis turned almost entirely on weighing children with little or no counseling o f the
caregivers to change care practices. Giventhe difficulties with (scaling up) the community-based growth
promotion interventions, the nutrition component o f the HNSP would focus primarily on the development
and implementation of a flexible nutrition communication strategy at community level. Accordingly, the
HNSP intends to strengthen the communication skills o f community workers without the distraction o f
periodic weighing of children. Rather than insistingon monthly weighing o f children, this new operation
would support dissemination of messages using various channels simultaneously in addition to inter-
personal communication. According to capacity, the communication program would in its simplest form
focus on one theme at the time for an extended period o f time untilresults are obtained before moving to
the next theme. Community workers can inthis way focus more on results rather than running activities
as they have done in the past. Where capacity i s more enhanced, these single theme campaigns can be
accompanied by additional communications, including growth monitoring in those community sites
where it i s working well.

Communications for behavior change i s a cost-effective approach to improving nutrition. A cost-
effectiveness study conducted on the Nutrition Communication and Behavior Change component in
Indonesia showed that with only providing educational inputs- counseling, the nutritional status o f 40%
o f children improved. Results from an impact study on the Madagascar community nutrition program
shows that the use o f radio for dissemination o f nutrition and basic health messages has very positive and
wide-spread impact.

3. Fiduciary

The financial management assessment (Annex 7) conclude that, provided the following conditions are
met prior to credit effectiveness, the Bank's financial management requirements will be satisfied: (i)
qualified financial management specialists present within MOHSA and SECF; (ii)          Counterpart Funds and
Special Accounts opened and initial deposit o f Counterpart Funds made; and (iii)           qualified external
auditors appointed by MOHSA.

By effectiveness, the project will not be ready for report-based disbursements. Thus, at the initial stage,
transaction-based disbursement procedures, as described in the World Bank Disbursement Handbook,
will be followed i.e. direct payment, reimbursement, and special commitments. However, when project
implementation begins and the borrower requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will
be undertakenby the Bank-Financial Management Specialist to determine ifthe project i s eligible.

4. Social

A recently conducted Public Expenditures Review rightly states that "in terms o f equity of health
spending, on average, household expenditure on health in Mauritania represents around 5.5 percent o f
total expenditure, a relatively low level if compared to other countries in the region. Nevertheless, it i s
interestingto notice that even though the size o f health expenditure increases with the level o f well being
(as expected), its relative weight diminishes as income level increase. This means that while amongst
richest households' health expenditure i s in the order o f 4.6 percent o f total expenditure, amongst the
poorest it accounts for nearly 9 percent o f total expenditure. It i s likely that the unequal weight o f health
expenditure betweenthe poor and the non-poor has a negative effect on inequality".

Cognizant of this situation, Mauritaniai s committed to poverty alleviation and reducing inequities among
socio economic groups. The Government health and nutrition policies lay a particular emphasis on the



                                                     25

provision o f adequate and affordable services to the underserved with a specific focus on the population
o f remote geographical areas, women and children and the poor. Targeting areas where malnutrition rates
are high i s equal to pro-poor targeting, malnutrition and poverty are intrinsically linked. It i s anticipated
that the HNSP, that i s specifically supporting the implementation o f these policies, would have a
significant contributionto their success and the attainment o f the MDGs.

The following HNSP features are most relevant from a social perspective:
0     Support to further develop health facilities inthe geographical zones with low accessibility to public
or private services.
0     HNSP set o f activities aiming at improving the affordability o f services, which includes, among
others, the review of current cost recovery arrangements and the support to the expansion o f cost-recovery
arrangements with provenmechanisms to maintain or improve service affordability.
0     HNSP support to a more equitable distribution of resources (financial, human resources, services,
drugs and vaccines) to regions and beyond, which will also take into account poverty and accessibility
criteria.
0     Use o f a broad participatory approach to fully involve stakeholder and the civil society.
0     Reliance on strategies o f a clear benefit to the underserved such as preventive care and primary
health care development, community based interventions in nutrition, demand raising with focus on
remote under-served populations, improvement o f health and nutrition providers' behavior in regard to
women, children and the poor, and motivating them to discharge preventive services.
0     Support to human resources development policy thrusts promoting a better geographical distribution
of providers and the development o f areward and incentive system for work inpoor and remote areas.
0     Systematic monitoring o f the progress made in the health and nutrition sectors activities to reduce

Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) that has been prepared for this project. The RPF outlines the
principles and procedures to be followed inthe event that land acquisition will become necessary during
project implementation.

5. Environment

Potential negative environmental and social impacts (air pollution, soil and water pollution, soil erosion
or loss of vegetation) might result from the construction o f health centers and posts in rural areas, and
ineffective medical waste management at these facilities. To address potential impacts on the environment
and public health effectively, the project has prepared (i)     an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) designed to identify, assess and mitigate potential environmental and social impacts;
and (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to address potential negative social impacts related to
land acquisition. These frameworks were prepared because the exact locations and potential localized
impacts of the newhehabilitated health care facilities were not knownprior to appraisal.

Furthermore, the project will draw on the recommendations o f the National Medical Waste Management
Plan, and fund those activities that are relevant to safe medical waste management at the health centers
and health posts to be financed under the proposed project. Thus, the following activities will be
 supported by the project: (a) the establishment of hygiene committees and appointment o f an Officer
responsible for medical waste management at the health posts and health centers; (b) provision of
equipment and development o f a system that allows for proper segregation o f wastes at the health

facilities; (c) training o f health care personnel, sanitation workers, municipal waste dump operators, and
private waste collectors; and (d) public awareness campaigns regarding the dangers of unsafe medical
waste management; the costs for these activities will be included in the project cost tables. The Project
Implementation Manual will include a chapter on environmental and social management to ensure
potentialimpacts are addressedeffectively duringproject implementation.

6. Safeguard policies

The project has triggered OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement due
to potential negative environmental and social impacts related to the constructiodrehabilitation o f health
centers and healthposts, and ineffective medical waste management. The safeguard screening category is
S2; and the environmental screening category is B. To address potential negative impacts consistent with
the requirements o f these safeguard policies, the project has prepared an ESMF and a RPF. Inaddition to
describing the environmental and social screening process, the ESMFmakes recommendations regarding
capacity buildingneeds to ensure its effective implementation, and consultations with potentially affected
persons as part o f the screening process that will take place at the time construction and rehabilitation
plans are prepared. To address issues related to medical waste management at the health centers and
health posts to be constructed and/or rehabilitated, the Government draws on the National Medical Waste
Management Plan and will implement relevant activities (training, segregation, public awareness
campaigns). This plan, plus a summary o f the project objectives and medical waste management
provisions, as well as the ESMFand the RPF has been disclosed inMauritania and at the Bank's Infoshop
prior to appraisal.

                              Annex 1:Country andSector Background
            MAURITANIA: HEALTHAND NUTRITION SUPPORT PROJECT

A.     CountryBackground

Mauritania has undergone significant socio economic changes and from a predominantly nomadic society
at independence (1960) i s characterized today by a high level o f urbanization. Of the 2.7 million
inhabitants, some 1.8 millionlive inurban centers, including 600.000 inthe capital city Nouakchott. Over
80 percent o f the country's land surface i s desert and only the southern areas supports rain-fed vegetation,
A narrow production base and low levels of industrialization still characterize the country's economy.
Mauritania's export base i s heavily concentrated, with nearly all exports consisting o f two commodities:
fishing and iron ore. These commodities are highly vulnerable to sharp swings ininternational prices and
external demand. The recent discovery o f relatively important oil and gas reserves could have a major
impact on the economy in the medium-term. Production i s supposed to start in 2006. Attempts at
diversifying the economy (agriculture, livestock, tourism) have had limited success to date. In2003, gross
national income per capita was US$ 430.2

Mauritania was one o f the first countries to develop a full PRSP (February 2001) through a broad
participatory process. Based on the analysis o f the national household survey data (2000), it set ambitious
socio-economic goals for the 2015 horizon, focusing on four main pillars: (i)     accelerating private sector-
led growth; (ii)  anchoring growth in the economic environment o f the poor; (iii)         developing human
resources and ensuring universal access to basic services; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacity and
governance. Mauritania has been implementing satisfactorily the PRSP and the three Progress Reports
have showed that MDGs remain high on the government agenda. However, they also pointed out that
under current policies and with present financial flows, Mauritania i s highly unlikely to reach the health
and nutrition related MDGs, particularly with regards to the reduction o f infant and maternal mortality,
malnutrition, endemic diseases control.

Over the last five years the government has defined its health sector policy in the Plan Directeur de la
Santk 1998-2002 and it i s currently inthe process o f adopting an updated sector policy: National Health
and Social Action Policy (NHSAP) (i.e., Politique Nationale de Santk et d'Action Sociale 2005-2015).
The implementation of the sector policy, embedded in the PRSP and MTEF3processes, has been
supported over the last five years by several bilateral agencies and multilateral organizations including
IDA and international and local NGOs. A sector wide approach (SWAP) has been used in the health
sector to: (i)address the sectoral priorities; (ii)gradually reduce the duplication o f efforts brought about
by the coexistence of various donor-driven projects; (iii)strengthen local capacity in planning and
management; and (iv) assist MOHSA insettingup an effective coordination mechanism.

Over the years, financial resources from the public budget allocated to the health sector have consistently
been increased and used in accordance with sector needs and priorities. As mentioned, at present, the
funding for the health system remains insufficient for the delivery o f a reasonable package of care and,
there is general agreement, that the attainment o f MDGs remains unlikely. This situation i s further
aggravated by deficiencies in budget execution and resource allocation (financial, human and other) and
an inefficiently use o fresources.




  This means that the country is above the IDA grants threshold o f US$ 340 a head, preventing it to benefit from
IDA grants.

The Nutricom project (1999-2005) was a clear sign o f Mauritania's growing commitment to the fight
against malnutrition, which had started following the International Conference on Nutrition, which
prompted the elaboration o f a National Plan of Action for Nutrition in 1993.                                    The government's
commitment was reaffirmed again inthe PRSP where nutrition is highlighted as one of five priorities for
human resource development, and the prevalence o f malnutrition i s included as one o f the performance
indicators. Finally, in 2004, the government adopted the National Nutrition Development Policy, which
outlines national priorities for the attainment o f the nutrition MDGs. Implementation o f the commitment,
however, has been limited with limited financial resources from the public budget going to nutrition
programs.

Despite the Government's commitment and o f foreseeable economic growth (the prospect o f the
exploitation o f oil reserves), external support will continue to be necessary to sustain health and other
social services for some years. The decrease in donor funding to the health sector4 i s also critical and
justifies IDA involvement inthe financing o f the health and nutrition activities inthe mid-term.

B.        National Health and Social Action Policy & NationalNutrition Development Policy

The overall objective of the National Health and Social Action Policy (2005-2015) i s to improve the
health status and social protection o f the population (and in particular o f women, children and poor)
through the provision o f more accessible and quality health and social services through support to the
following strategies as outlined inthe two policies and the MTEF (2005-2007):
     (i)develophumanresources;
     (ii) coverageandqualityofhealthservicesdelivery;
            expand
     (iii) theavailabilityofdrugandotherhealthcommodities;
            improve
     (iv) increase the demand for health services;
     (v) promote social action and create an environment conductive to healthandnutrition;
     (vi) strengthenthe institutional capacity ofthe sector for an improvedperformance.

 The objectives o f the National Nutrition Policy include among others the reduction o f low birthweight,
 malnutrition rates among children under five and to improve the nutritional status o f pregnant and
 lactating women. The following strategies are proposed to achieve the objectives: (i)                            improve household
 level food security; (ii)      malnutrition reduction; (iii)        nutrition surveillance; (iv) IEC and (v) monitoring and
 evaluation.

 The National Nutrition Development Policy aims to address the nutrition problems o f growth faltering
 and stunting in early childhood, acute weight deficits or wasting in children, undernutrition in women,
 low birth weight, micronutrient malnutrition, and nutrition-related chronic diseases.                                     The general
 objectives are to improve household food security, to reduce malnutrition related mortality, and promote
 good health, care and feeding practices. Strategic focus will be on:
      (i)householdfoodsecurityinrural,urbanandemergencysettings;
      (ii)  nutrition-relevant health services relatedto case-management andprevention;
      (iii) community-basednutrition and early childhood development; and
      (iv) school health andnutrition.
 Specific interventions ineach o f these areas will be developed basedon the following key strategies:
      (i)IECandBCC;
      (ii)  Nutritional surveillance, monitoringand evaluation;
      (iii) researchandtraining;
            Applied


  Other donor fundingpossibilitieswere exploredbut appearhighly unlikely at present.Between 1998 and2003, other donor funds contribution

C.      The HealthDelivery System

ThePublic sector
The health public delivery system in Mauritania i s structured in three levels. Tertiary care i s dispensed
only in the capital city by a few hospitals. Among those are the Centre Hospitalier National, the Centre
Hospitalier Cheick Zaid and the Centre Neuropsychiatrique de Nouakchott with respectively 385, 100
and 80 beds. All the tertiary hospitals provide general and specialty inpatient and outpatient services, and
only a fraction o f their beds could be labeled as tertiary. The importance o f these facilities should not be
write off as they constitute the highest referral level inthe country and the patients that they cannot solve
can only be treated abroad at a considerably higher cost. The secondary level is composed o f the regional
hospitals located in 10 of the 13 regional (Wilaya) capital cities (Nouakchott does not have this type of
facility since the tertiary hospitals perform this function, and Inchiri and Tiris Zemmour regions are being
served by the regional hospitals o f the neighbor regions). The regional hospitals have 40 to 120 beds and
35 to 80 staff and provide inpatient curative care (including surgery and obstetrics) and outpatient
consultations. They are designed to minimize the referral to the tertiary hospitals of the capital city. At
the basic level o f the health delivery system are the (a) health centers, (b) health posts and (c) Unitks
Sanitaires de Base (USB). The health centers (61, in 2002, comprising 12 health centers type A and 49
health centers type B) are located inthe capital city o f departments (Moughatta) and are typically staffed
with 1or 2 medical doctors and 9 to 14 nurses and aid-nurses. They may also have from 10 to 20 beds
and provide a wide array o f curative, preventive and rehabilitative services (but do not have surgical
capacity). The health posts (339 in 2002) are located invillages o f 600-1500 inhabitants, are staffed with
2 to 3 nurses or aide-nurses and traditional birth attendants.          The USB are services provided by
community health workers and traditional birth attendants at the outreach. At this level, simple curative
and preventive care as well as assistance for safehormal deliveries are provided fi-ee o f charge. The
Direction Rkgionale de la Protection Sanitaire et Sociale (DRPSS) and the Circonscription Sanitaire de
Moughatta (CSM) perform regional and departmental management functions, including the supervision
and training of health personnel and o f community health workers.            The health delivery system i s
characterizedby low utilizationrates (about 3-4 consultations per capita andper year inhealth centers and
60% utilization rates in regional hospitals), lacks maintenance and drugs, and it i s poorly staffed and
equipped, inparticular inrural areas and inthe poorer regions.

ThePrivate sector
The private sector inMauritania consists o f an impressive network o f private pharmacies spread all over
the country and, inbig cities, by private clinics (there are 24 medical clinics; and 28 medical, 32 nursing
and 34 dental smaller private practices). There is also a hospital in the capital city. In rural settings
traditional healers dispense traditional medicine remedies. The recent census o f health personnel has
shown that, in the entire country, the number o f health personnel in formal private practice i s small (2.9
percent of total health personnel and 4.2 percent o f total medical personnel) suggesting that most o f the
personnel inprivate practice are public servants working informally inthe private sector. Other ministries
and agencies (such as the Ministry o f Defense, SECF, SNIM) participate in health service delivery and
have budget items related to health service delivery. However, the services delivered by the private sector
and by other public sectors than health are not recorded in the MOHSA statistical data. Likewise, health
expenditures analyses do not take into account the money spent by other ministries and agencies to
provide or pay for health services. Ingeneral, and contrary to the objectives of the health policy, there has
been little progress so far towards an efficient mobilization ofprivate providers.

D.     Sector Performance and Key Issues

Health and Nutrition outcomes
Mauritania i s a low human development country.            Since 1990 there was an encouraging pace of
improvement but the health indicators remain poor and depict, generally, a sever situation. For instance,
between 1988 and 2000, the under-5 mortality rate declined from 182 to 116 per 1,000 live births, infant
mortality rate diminished from 118 to 74 per 1,000 live births, and maternal mortality decreased from 930
to an estimated 747 per 100,000 live births (Demographic and Health Survey 2000-Ol), contributing to a
life expectancy of 56 years in 2002 (from 53 years in 1999). Total fertility rate also declined from 6.2
percent in the eighties to 4.6 percent in 2000 but the population growth remained high at around 2.5-
2.9%.

Malnutrition rates improvedbetween 1990 and 1995 but have since deteriorated. Malnutrition i s a serious
problem especially inthe rural areas, among the poorest and the very young (0-3 years) who are the most
vulnerable.

Growth faltering mainly happens within the first two years, by the end o f which approximately four inten
children have become stunted. The prevalence o f acute malnutrition or wasting i s worrisomely high, i.e.,
 13%. Although the prevalence peaks at the age o f 6-12 months (16%) it remains around 10% or above in

every age-group o f children under five years old. This is unusual and a marker o f acute problems such as
infectious diseases, poor child care, and/or food shortages.

Insufficient and inequitable access to health and nutrition services
The Government has invested in health facility development and the set up o f a network o f reasonably
small facilities (health centers and health posts) supported by first referral facilities (regional hospitals)
and by a few tertiary facilities in the capital city o f the country. Consequently, the access to health
services increased from less than 60% o f population having access to a health facility about 15 years ago
to about 77% today. However, there are still large inter-regional and inter-district variations, and overall
the situation remains difficult since 23% o f the population should travel more than five kilometers to
reach a health center or a health post and for 10% o f the population the nearest health facility i s at more
than ten kilometers. The actual situation i s more sever than the one depicted by these accessibility
indicators, as this happens in the Sahara desert where there are few roads and transportation means, and
the cost o f transportation i s very high. For example, it is very dramatic for a woman with a complicated
pregnancy to reach the first facility with obstetrics and surgical capacity (as this means to travel long
distances through the desert to arrive in due time at the regional hospital) and this explains to a large
extent the still very high MMR. The low accessibility to health services i s among the main causes o f
under utilization o f facilities in rural areas and central and northern regions where the population i s
scattered. Poverty i s another underlining factor and the affordability o f services ranks high on the public
health agenda. The government intends to update the infrastructure development plan to reduce the
existing disparities in geographical accessibility, to develop outreach community-oriented services more
accessible to the poor and neglected people in remote areas, to review the cost recovery policy to better
protect the affordability o f services and drugs, to involve more the formal private sector inthe delivery o f
basic services especially inurban cities, and to mobilize communities to take on a more active role inthe
delivery and use o f primary health care services, buildingon the achievements o f the former Nutricom
project which rallied communities around community nutrition centers to provide essential child care
information and basic nutrition services. However, the number o f centers i s low, only reaching a minority
of the target population. Regarding severe malnutrition the government intends to improve (community)
referral and case-management o f severely malnourished children inthe health system.

Inadequate Financing and Inequitable ResourceAllocation
From 1998 to 2002 the Government has increased the share o f the public budget for health from 1.9 to
4.0% o f the GDP and actual expenditure for health increased from about US$ 8 to US$ 14 per capita. The
Government also stated its commitment to the social sectors inmany official documents. Nonetheless the
 sector remains under-funded and unable to provide the population with a reasonable package o f essential
health and nutrition services. The situation i s further aggravated by: i)the chronic low utilization rate o f
the budget (not more than 65-70% o f the budget i s actually spend and most o f expenditure takes place in
the last quarter o f the FY), ii)declining donor support and iii)flawed allocation to regions (i.e., resource
 allocation to regions and facilities i s not linked to performance nor does it pay sufficient attention to the
needs o f the poorest regions).      There is general consensus, that the under-funding and inefficient
utilization o f resources make the achievement o f MDGs questionable. Cognizant o f this situation, the
 Government has updated the Medium-Term Expenditures Framework (MTEF) for the period 2005-2007
 inaccordance with sector budget requirements and poverty reduction objectives. Emphasis was laid on
 the quality and equity of the sector spending, better budget management and harmonization o f donors'
procedures. Government is also moving quickly towards the revision o f the cost recovery system and the
 implementation o f mutual funds and subsidies targeting the poor and pregnant women.

Shortagesof skilled and motivatedhealthpersonnel
 Mauritania employs inthe public system 274 physicians (1 physician for about 10,000 inhabitants) out o f
 who half are specialized physicians, 60 pharmacists, 47 dentists and about 2270 health providers o f other
 categories (technicians, nurses, aid-nurses, midwifes, aid-midwifes). The total number o f personnel o f all


                                                        32

categories (administrative and others included) employed by the public sector i s 3818 and the total
number o f health personnel of all categories inthe public andprivate systemreaches 4257.

The shortages o f qualified and motivatedhealth and social workers along with imbalances inthe skill-mix
and geographical deployment (63% of the total health providers work outside Nouakchott; however only
47% o f physicians work in Wilayas) are among the key factors undermining the access, quality and
utilization o f services. There are disproportionate numbers o f health providers, notably medical doctors,
working inthe healthadministration and holding administrative positions for which they are not qualified.
Similarly, health providers of all categories are more abundant in the capital city and in a few better off
regional capitals (midwifes especially but also medical doctors), although the last Healthpersonnel census
shows some progress inthis regard. There i s also lack o f specialized providers in specialties like surgery,
obstetrics, and anesthesiology. Ineffective management, training and supervision exacerbate the lack o f
responsiveness o f the system. A recently conducted health personnel census documents some positive
trends in HRD, part o f which can be attributed to the implementation o f innovative measures (including
incentives to the staffto relocate and work inrural areas) that the proposedproject would support.

Finally, skilled nutrition professionals are few in the health sector. At community-level, community
nutrition workers have been mobilized and trained under the earlier Nutricomproject. However, they are
still few innumber and more mobilizationand training i s needed.

Inadequate drug quality and supply
Drugshortages persist inmain health facilities and the capacity o f the drugprocurement and distribution
system needs further strengthening. Recently a Drugprocurement and storage capacity was created but it
has not yet started to perform adequately. There are also notable problems with drug quality, which affect
both private and public pharmacies. A recently adopted pharmaceutical policy includes the setting up o f a
new registration system and the development o f sufficient capacity to enforce regulation for quality
control with a view to reducing the circulation o f low quality and counterfeit drugs. MOHS i s also
pursuing the improvement o f regional drug warehouses and other logistics measures to better drug
management, minimize loses and improve the supply o f drugs, vaccines and consumables to health

Insufficient institutional capacity resultinginpoor management of resources and services
The Ministry o f Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) in not adequately staffed to provide efficient
stewardship for the implementation o f the Health Sector Development Plan. The State Secretariat for
Women Affairs (SECF) idem ditto suffers from inefficient stewardship in the area o f community-based
nutrition, not least because the Secretariat is much smaller and insufficiently decentralized. Program
execution continues to be slowed down by the rapid turn over o f staff holding key positions and by
weaknesses in financial management, execution, procurement.              Issues such as decentralization,
monitoring and evaluation are among the key elements which still require detailed analysis, planning and
strong leadership to bring the system up to speed and create an environment based on achieving results.
Coordination between MOHSA and SECF, which share the mandate for malnutrition prevention and
reduction, has been problematic over the past years.

Increased resource allocation for the priority health programs or interventions to reduce problems such as
TB and Malaria or to improve reproductive health have not translated, so far, into performance
improvement and significantly better outcomes. Among the causes o f this situation are weak
management, poor intersectoral collaboration (in matters such as water, sanitation, nutrition, the of
control infectious diseases and maternal and child health), insufficient community participation and not
enough emphasis on demand creation for preventive services. The new health sector policy seeks to
decentralize more the management of priority programs, to broaden the role o f health committees towards
prevention, hygiene and sanitation, to support behavior changes and improve intersectoral collaboration.

In addition, the government intends to develop performance contracts devised as means of rewarding
managers for outputs and to enable all stakeholders to efficiently participate in the achieving of public
health objectives. The government also recognizes the need to put more emphasis on and improve
communication for behavior change at community andhousehold levels.

The Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project (Grant H-057-MAU for SDR 15.3 millions) became effective on
January 12, 2004. Its main objective i s to maintain the level o f HIV infectionthat causes AIDS below the
prevalence rate o f 1 percent and reduce opportunistic infections. The latest IP rating i s marginally
unsatisfactory and the DO ratingsatisfactory.

The Nutrition, Food Security, and Social Mobilization Project (Credit 3187- MAU for SDR 3.6
million) became effective on October 13, 1999 and closed on April 30, 2005. Its main objective was to
evaluate the effectiveness o f specific activities contained in two programs--one urban and one rural--to
reduce child malnutrition in a measurable way, specifically to improve the nutritional status o f mothers
and children, to promote the physical development o f children, and to increase generating activities. The
latest IP and DO ratings are satisfactory and marginally unsatisfactory. OED rating was unsatisfactory.

The HealthSector InvestmentProject(Credit 3055-MAU for SDR 17.8 millions), became effective on
October, 1998 and closed on December 31, 2004. The main objective o f the project was to improve the
health status o f the population through the provision o f more accessible and affordable quality health
services. The latest IPand DO ratings are both satisfactory. OED's rating was moderately satisfactory.

The Health and Population Project (Credit 2311-MAU for SDR 15.7 millions) became effective on
June 2, 1992 and closed on August 30, 1998. The main project objectives were to: (i)    improve the quality
and the accessibility o fbasic health and family planning services; (ii)assist the Government to articulate a
national population policy and define an action plan; and (iii)    enhance women's ability to participate in
and contribute to the country's social and economic development. OED's rating was satisfactory.

Other DonorsPresentinthe Healthand NutritionSectorsinMauritania

A number of donors and international NGOs are involved in the health sector in Mauritania. These
include bilateral donors (France, Spain, Germany) and multilateral agencies (AfDB, France, Spain,
UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO; and KFW). These donors cover a large range o f activities and are financing
several projects and are complemented by IDA lending.           Most are involved in primary health care
development at the district level, and projects are generally limited to specific geographical areas. A
donor coordination mechanism has been established and has improved over time under the leadership o f
the MOHSA (see table below).

                              Annex 4: DetailedProjectDescription
        MAURITANIA : HEALTHAND NUTRITION SUPPORT PROJECT

The decision to chose a sector-wide approach has implications on the project design because it
renders all priority activities consistent with the Government health and nutrition policies (for
which funding i s inpart or intotality needed) eligible for IDA funding.While, this principle will
be observed, an attempt will also be made to focus the HNSP assistance on a few critical issues,
thus (i)contributing more effectively to the attainment o f the development objectives o f the sector
and the achievement o f MDGs and (ii)        making it feasible to evaluate the HNSP in terms o f
tangible results attributable to its inputs.The HNSP components described below provide support
to the solving o f these critical issues.
The project design includes another feature specific to sector-wide approaches, i.e., funding from
the credit will be allocated annually through a transparent planning process led by Government.
There i s one exception to this principle Le., civil works and major goods will be pre-identified
because procurement for such categories takes a longer time and HNSP total duration will not
exceed 3 years.
It should also benoted that HNSP as well as the overall progress inprogram implementation will
be monitored and reviewed annually making adjustments possible at any time, should the
situation inthe sector undergo changes.


1. Further develop human resources and improvetheir geographical distribution(US$ 2.0
million)

The Government has treated human resources development as a priority for more than a decade
and progress has occurred in this problem area. While the number o f health providers o f all
categories has increased, many training opportunities were offered, supervision activities
intensified and increasingly included on-the-job training, improvements in other areas was
modest. Among the remaining issues, there i s the geographical distribution o f providers that in
spite o f recent improvements continue to be a challenge, the inadequate number o f human
resources, the need to increase the quality o f services discharged in the public facilities and to
motivate the providers o f all categories and, inparticular, those working inremote areas. There is
also necessary to continue to strengthen human resources management in the MOHSA and
devolve more o f its tasks to regional administration. This implies strengthening the linkage
between the MOHSA and other transversal ministries (Finances and Civil Services) as well as
other sectoral ministries (Higher Education). This HNSP component aims at addressing this
human resources development issues that are the most pressing.

The component will support activities to:
(i) Professionalize the Directorate of Human Resources at all levels through: (a)
strengthening human and material capacities o f the DHR in order to fulfill its mandate; and (b)
maintaining a human resources management system that uses a forecasting and preventive
approach contributing to an improved knowledge and a better distribution o f available staff
(technical and administrative), in accordance with revised staffing norms, expressed needs, and
available resources.

(ii)Improve coordinating mechanisms for improved human resources management through: (a)
establishing a network system for information sharing between the DHR and the DRPSS on
staffing, needs, etc.; (b) strengthening the capacity to manage human resources at the level o f
DRPSS; (c) strengthening DHR capacity to participate in the public administration reforms

undertaking inthe country and led by the MOHSA and by other ministries, notably, redefinition
of the salary scales, external recruitment process, motivation and technical premium, etc.; (d)
improving coordination between the DHWMOHSA and other ministries for all issues concerning
human resources affecting the health sector; and (e) piloting an accountability system for health
care providers co-managed with the communities (Le., issues linked with absenteeism, behavior,
with identification of potential solutions, such as establishing a performance-based system and
staff evaluation system, etc.).

(iii) themanagementandcontentof pre-servicesandin-sewicetraining,andon-the-job
      Improve
training through: (a) improving the coordination with the training institute (ENPS, INSM), while
exploring possibilities o f sub-contracting with training institutes located in the sub-region; (b)
improving efficiency o f the DHR to manage training abroad against needs and record and
maintain personal file accordingly; (c) revising curricula and training programs to reflect the
national health policy orientation such as quality-assurance (approach centered on the patient),
environmental management, training o f trainers; and (d) improving integrated formative
supervision from the central to the regional level and from the regional to the decentralized level.

2. Ensure adequate sector financing and an equitable allocation of resources for the poor
andfor underservedgeographicalareas (US$1.5 million)

This component has as objectives: (i) improve the existingprocess and methods for mobilizing
                                         to
the different sources o f sector financing and for allocating them more equitably; and (ii)            to
strengthen measures to ensure financial accessibility to health services, to increase utilization o f
services by the poorest andmost vulnerable, and to rationalize the existing cost recovery system.

(I, Mobilization and allocation of sector financial resources. To further support MOHSA's
progress since 2003 in improving the annual budget preparation process, the HNSP will provide
technical and financial assistance to strengthen ministry capacity to: (a) prepare the annual
updates o f the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the sector; (b) establish criteria
 for overall repartition o f budget and allocations by level o f care, region, type o f expenditure, etc.;
and (c) organize annual sectoral expenditure reviews. The project will also contribute to
preparatory work on national health accounts (NHA).

 (ii) Financial access of thepopulation to health services. Given the increasing financial needs o f
the sector, the stabilizing o f available resources for health, and the relatively low level o f
budgeted health expenditures over the last three years, the HNSP will support efforts: (a) to
 subsidize the most essential health services for the poor and other targeted populations; (b) to
 organize payment o f health services for the poorest and most vulnerable populations who are
 unable to afford even subsidized services; and (c) to help those populations interested inand able
 to establish alternative financing systems (mutuelles) at community level to share risks. In
 addition, the HNSP will provide support for strengthening the cost recovery system, including
 revising the regulatory basis for charging and collecting monies and training facility-level
 management committees.

         Subsidies for essential services. The project will finance: (a) studies to evaluate the
 needs and define the operational modalities for subsidizing services; and (b) monitor the inclusion
 of adequate subsidies by the Government (and possibly other partners as well) in the annual
 health budget. HNSP will also support a subsidy to services for pregnant women through the
 expansion o f the "forfait obstktrical" 15 health facilities in the Trarza, Nouadhibou and
 Guidimakha regions thus extending the system to a total of nine regions. HNSP will finance
 training of local teams in the management of the system, organization o f public informationand


                                                   41

sensitization campaigns, and monitoring and evaluation o f the impact o f the system on pregnant
women.

         Payment of health services for the poorest. Based onprevious operational researchto test
a system of payments for indigent populations, the Ministry intends to evaluate this experience, to
formulate a national strategy for care of the poorest, and to establish official regulations for
identifying and caring for this population at the different levels o f the health care system. The
project will contribute to all phases o f the process: evaluation of the program; formulation of
policies, regulations, and guidelines; and financing o f program expansion in the Nouakchott,
Brakna, and Assaba regions.

         Organization o f mutuelles de s a d . HNSP will support continuation o f the activities o f
the nine existing "mutuelles" (of which five are inNouakchott), created with the assistance o f a
project financed by the UNFPNILO and the establishment o f an additional fifteen "mutuelles de
santk" which will be community-based in rural districts. Specifically, HNSP will finance: (a)
formulation o f an overall action plan and framework for developing community-based
"mutuelles"; (b) operations o f a multi-disciplinary central-level team responsible for providing
assistance in the creation o f the "mutuelles" and in establishing arrangements between the
"mutuelles" and the relevant health facilities (health posts, health centers, and hospitals); (c)
training for ministry personnel, NGO support staff, and community management o f the
"mutuelle"; and (d) an initial source o f funding for the "mutuelles." Inthe last year o f the Project,
an evaluation of the existing "mutuelles" will be conducted and the results incorporated into
legislation and regulations for creating and managing future "mutuelles de santk."

         Support for strengthening the existing cost recovery system. Prior to the signature o f the
credit agreement, the Government will be asked to publish regulations to ensure: (a) more
transparent accounting o f receipts at health facility level; (b) greater responsibility and
participation o f the management committee in deciding on expenditures (from the MOHbudget,
facility receipts, and other sources); and (c) more consistency across health facilities with respect
to the pricing o f services and drugs. HNSP will support the installation or re-dynamization,
training, and operations o f the officially established management committees; to ensure the
sustainability o f the health facility, a functioning management committee would be set up before
providing funds for the initial purchase o f essential drugs (for health posts financed by the
project) or for the re-supply o f essential drugs to health facilities inneed. HNSP will also finance
the costs o fregular supervision and control o fthe cost recovery system.

3. Improve health sector management to raise efficiency (US$ 1.0 million)

This component has as objectives: (i) promote the sector-wide approach; and (ii) develop the
                                          to                                           to
management capacity o f health sector personnel at all levels.

(i) Development of the sector-wide approach. Initiated in 1998 with support from the HSSP, the
sector-wide process has advanced, and HNSP will provide support to MOHSA in the process o f
formulating a memorandum o f understanding clearly establishing the objectives, roles, and
relationships o f the collaboration.       A draft memorandum, limited to external donors, was
circulated inFebruary 2005; using the Health Thematic Group, the draft will be expanded to: (a)
include representatives o f all the partners; and (b) to identify and support those key points on
which further collaboration can be accelerated (e.g., coordination o f in-service training, per diem
rates, etc.).




                                                   42

  (ii) Strengthening of sector management capabilities. HNSP will concentrate especially on: (a)
  enhanced coordination o f the planning and budgeting process; (b) increased budget execution
  through more efficient organization o f the procurement process and improved financial
  management; and (c) development o f measures and modalities for monitoring and evaluating the
  programmatic interventions.

           Coordination and planning. Support from the proposed HNSP will contribute to: (a) an
  evaluation of the importance of the various planning approaches and instruments, particularly in
  the context o f the MTEF; and (b) financial support for updating the planning over the long-term
  (health infrastructure, equipment, and human resources development), the medium-term (the
  rolling two/three year investment plan); and the short-term, annual action plans at both regional
  and central levels.

           Procurement. accounting and financial management. HNSP will strengthen procurement
  capabilities with respect to knowledge and mastery o f IDA procedures from planning, through
  organizing and carrying out the various tenders, to archiving the appropriate documents. The
  project will improve accounting and financial management by: (a) upgrading o f the management
   instruments used by the previous project (the financial management software; the manual of
   administrative, accounting, and financial procedures; the project implementation manual, etc.);
   and (b) contracting of a financial management consultant to provide short-term support for the
  Directorate o f Administration and Finance, has been merged with the Directorate o f Investment.
   Since financial management will be decentralized, the project will also provide assistance to the
  Regional Directorates, which will identify their needs annually in their action plans. An external
   audit of all project funding will be carried out on an annual basis with the final results to be
!  submitted to IDAno later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.

   (iii) Monitoring and evaluation. HNSP will monitor and evaluate progress within the overall
   context of: (a) the poverty reduction strategy through achievement o f the MDGs pertaining to
   health; (b) the development o f a consolidated sectoral program with common measures and
   procedures for supervising, monitoring, and evaluating results; and (c) the regular submission o f
   project reports on physical and financial results as well as periodic supervision o f HNSP's key
   performance indicators.

            Achievement of the MDGs. Within the framework o f the recently established inter-
   ministerial committee, which i s responsible for monitoring progress in attaining the MDGs,
   HNSP will: (a) contribute to financing the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS); and (b)
   finance (in year 3) a beneficiary incidence survey to evaluate the impact o f project actions on
   access to and utilization o f health services by the poor and vulnerable populations. These studies
   will be carried out ina manner which will allow for comparisons with similar studies conducted
   in2004.

            Development o f common measures and urocedures. HNSP will focus on developing
   common measures and procedures for supervising, monitoring, and evaluating results by
   financing:  (a) meetings o f the Health Thematic Group to identify common indicators for
   measuring sectoral progress; (b) implementation o fjoint (MOHPartner) supervision missions in
   the field; and (iii)
                      organization o f a system o f performance basedcontracts (lettres d 'engagement)
   with health services and facilities. In addition, HNSP will continue the practice o f the previous
   project o f contributing financial and technical support for the organization of the semi-annual
   sector reviews.




                                                     43

         Regular reporting Given MOHSA's significant progress over the last two years in
strengthening the health management information system, HNSP will continue to finance
development of the required software improvements and practical tools as well as periodic
supervision at regional level.

4. Improve the accessibility to quality and affordable health services at the outreach (US$
3.5 million)

Dispensing accessible, affordable and quality care in Mauritania is very difficult due to the
country's specific geographical conditions and the scarcity and high cost o f transportation and
communication means. The low population density o f rural zones and the poverty o f their
populations are other equally important obstacles. The Government has strived with these issues
for many years and the solution chosen impliesto buildhealth facilities o f reasonably small sizes
but able to treat a high number of cases and reduce, as much as possible, referral. There was
improvement ininfrastructure coverage in the last years but many problems remain to be solved.
Among these there i s the need to better reach the poor (in general and in remote areas in
particular), to raise the quality o f services, to maintain or improve drug and service affordability,
and last and very important, to significantly improve the attendance o f outpatient facilities and the
utilizationo f hospitalbeds. This component aims at making a contribution to these matters.

This component support activities to improve access to and quality o fbasic health services, andto
raise demand for services:

(i) Construction of approximately 13 health posts and 1 health center in areas of low
accessibility to public or private health services. The sites o f these facilities would be chosen
based on accessibility criteria, estimated number o f population in the catchment area, possible
existence o f specific health problems, etc.. The facilities will benefit from maintenance and
equipping, including the provision o f equipment to ensure effective medical waste management.
The Health Sector Investment Project has shown that contractors cannot execute easily works for
small facilities widely dispersed in the Mauritania desert and that civil works take a longer time
than elsewhere to implement. For this reason bidding documents will be developed before credit
effectiveness.

(ii) Activities to improve access to and quality of services by: (a) the strengthening o f outreach
activities from health posts and the revival o f the community approach in order to ensure
improved access to preventive child, maternal and nutrition interventions for the population in
hard-to-reach areas; (b) the strengthening o f the drug purchasing and distribution structures in
order to ensure availability o f drugs and vaccines.

(iii)Activities to raise the demandfor health and nutrition services, with emphasis on prevention,
and to induce behavioral changes conducive to health and nutritional improvements; and increase
community participation in the management o f health services and to render health providers
more responsiveto the needs o f the underserved populations.

(iv) Strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of the quality of the services provided
through the enhancement o f the integrated formative supervision, and the revitalization of the
monitoringsystem o f the primary health care facilities.

(v) Strategies to be supported would aim at: (a) reduction o f child mortality primarily by the
extension o f the Integrated Approach to Childhood Illness (IMCI); the HNSP will support four
regions in making the implementation o f this strategy possible; (b) reduction o f maternal


                                                   44

mortality by the improvement o f the availability, the quality and the utilization o f emergency
obstetrical and neonatal care (SONU); the HNSP will support the gradual extension o f SONU to
10 health centers; and (c) decrease in the incidence o f schistosomiasis; activities for control o f
other endemic diseases already receive adequate financing from other sources such as The Global
Fundfor malaria and tuberculosis, or GAVI for vaccination, as well as UNICEF, WHO and the
World Bank MAP for HIV/AIDS. However, if needed, these areas would also be eligible for
fundingfrom the credit.

5. Enhance and expand community-basedcommunications for improvednutrition (US$2.0
million)

Priority actions include: (i) and expand community-based communications for improved
                              Improve
nutrition including better access to basic essential health and nutrition services; (ii)
                                                                                      support to the
application o f the salt iodization law (in close collaboration with UNICEF) and the promotion o f
iodized salt consumption; and (iii)   strengthen capacity of the SECF to plan, monitor and evaluate
nutrition communication program implementation. These priority actions will be implemented
through community mobilization, training o f polyvalent community agents, and interpersonal
communication supported by group and mass communication.
The HNSP will focus primarily on the development and implementation of a flexible nutrition
communication strategy at community level. Accordingly, the HNSP intends to strengthen the
communication skills o f community workers. Rather than insisting on monthly weighing of
children, the new project would disseminate messages using various channels simultaneously in
addition to inter-personal communication. According to capacity, the communication program
would in its simplest form focus on one theme at the time for an extended period o f time until
results are obtained before moving to the next theme. Polyvalent community workers can inthis
way focus more on results rather than running activities as they have done in the past. Where
capacity i s more enhanced, these single theme campaigns can be accompanied by additional
communications, including growth monitoring in those community sites where it i s working
well.

Basic essential health and nutrition services refer to essential services that can be provided by
trained community agents, e.g., micronutrient supplementation, deworming, etc.. Messages about
micronutrients would typically be included under the communications program to mobilize the
community and raise awareness about the importance. On the basis o f a memorandum o f
understanding, the MOH and the SECF will coordinate efforts and collaborate on community
health and nutrition issues to avoid duplication and harmonize strategies. As a result, the
community health strategy o f the MOH will be integrated with the community nutrition strategy
o f the SECF by the creation o f community health and nutrition posts. Basic health and nutrition
services are essential services delivered by trained community workers,                for example
micronutrient supplementation and deworming. Messages on micronutrients would systematically
be included inthe communications program inorder to mobilize communities and sensitize them
on the important role. This i s also described in the memorandum o f understanding between
MOHSA and SECF which i s established in order to ensure coordination o f efforts between the
two ministries, avoid duplication and harmonize strategies. In this way, in the common
intervention zones, the MOHSA community health strategy would be integrated with the
community nutrition strategy by creating basic healthand nutritionposts.

A concrete example usingVitamin A as one o fthe early themes would entail the following. After
formative research to determine the target group and the content o f the key-messages, a training
of the community volunteers would take place. A number o f different communication channels,
such as radio (which has been a very successful component o f the former project), posters in the


                                                  45

community, home visits by the community workers, would sensitize the community, mothers and
children about the importance of Vitamin A and would help the social mobilization around
vitamin A for the distribution day. Once the monitoring data shows that all eligible children have
received vitamin A and have been properly informed (supervision by regional SECF levels and
health sector staff) the polyvalent community workers will be trained on the next theme, while
maintaining their skills and performance in vitamin A which should be distributed every six
months (inclose collaboration with the health sector). Other themes identified (but depending on
formative research) would include exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate weaning practices, iron-
supplementation duringpregnancy, hand-washing and sanitation, etc)  .

This also allows performance-based management to enhance capacity in a gradual manner and
would provide a simplified monitoring system which, in the earlier LIL, was too complex and
rated unsatisfactory.

 IDA would support the Government's Program for health and nutrition sectors acting as a last
 resort lender. As mentioned, HNSP could provide support to priority activities for which there i s
 a financial gap, providedthat they are consistent with the sector policy and there is agreement on
 their relevance. However, based on lessons learned from past operations and in particular the
 Health Sector Investment Project, which have showed delayed implementation in some
 disbursement categories, the entire set of civil works that will be supported from the credit will be
 pre-identified. This category combined will use less than 25 percent of the credit and would be
 formalized into a Procurement and Disbursement Plan for civil works. The progress in the
 implementation o f the procurement plan for civil works will be discussed annually during the
 annual evaluation and planning process.

                          Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
         MAURITANIA: HEALTHAND NUTRITION SUPPORT PROJECT

To facilitate and continue sustainable institutional development, the SWAP will be implemented
using the MOHSA and the SECF structures, which will be progressively adapted to meet their
mandate and functions. Measures to address capacity limitations within these ministries will be
carried out prior to and during project implementation period. Training and technical assistance,
including consultants/advisers will be provided, as determined, to supplement the existing
capacity that is currently inadequate to carry out expected functions. Program implementation
will be monitoredthrough periodic donors meetings organized bythe MOHSA.

Implementation will emphasize the development o f national health systems and capacity.
Common procedures and implementation mechanisms, according to country specific guidelines,
will progressively be established and adoptedina move towards program supporthudget support
as capacity improves. The project will support Annual Operational Plan (POAS), which give the
MOHSA and the SECF the responsibility for choosing actions in accordance with established
priorities found intheir respective sectoral policy. This approach provides some flexibility while
ensuring accountabilities toward reaching results and outcomes. Furthermore, an agreement
between the MOHSA and the SECF will be signed inorder to clarify and define respective roles
and responsibilities with regard to project implementation and, more specifically, the
improvement and expansion of the community nutrition activities component.

ProgramTechnicalImplementationArrangement.

MOHSA. A decree onthe attributions o fthe Ministry(at all levels) has recently been adopted to
better respond to the requirements o f the National Health and Social Action Policy (NHSAP) and
to the MDGs. To this end, a new organigramme was elaborated (see below) and the
implementation modalities for the SWAP refer to the new organigramme.

The successful implementation o f the program will require a high level o f coordination and
oversight capacity within the MOHSA. As such, and under the authority o f the Minister, the
overall responsibility will lay with the Secretary General who will ensure strategic coordination
o f all actions foreseen under the NHSAP. The Secretary General will represent the MOHSA
when liaising with cross-cutting ministries (Ministry o f Finance and Ministry o f Economic
Affairs and Development, Ministry o f Civil Service, Ministry o f Higher Education etc.) and will
coordinate the overall functions andresponsibilities o f the technical directorates.

Technical directorates and units at the central as well as at the regional and district levels are
responsible for implementing their activities according to agreedPOAS and priorities as set inthe
NHSAP. As capacity will be built over the program implementation period, the POAS will be
adjusted accordingly. A review o f the POAS achievements and constraints will be carried out
annually and will form the basis for the preparation o f the following year's POAS, according to
priorities and potential changes in the MOHSA's capacity to manage its mandate. Technical
implementation o f the program will be assigned to organizational units within the ministry
according to their comparative advantage. Strengthening measures to equip these units to meet
these challenges will be part o f the POAS.

CentralLevel
(a)      Direction des Afaives FinanciBres (DAF). Under the overall responsibility o f the
         Secretary General, the DAF will function as coordinator for IDA resources and will be



                                                 48

         responsible for overall administrative and financial management. The DAF will manage
         the allocated budget to the MOHSA in the context o f the NHSAP and will ensure
         financial coordination o f the program through regular supervision and audit o f all
         administrative, financial, accounting, and procurement operations. The Accounting Unit
         (Sewice de la Comptabiliti) will ensure budget supervision and accounting functions o f
         all program's administrative and financial operations and will also ensure financial and
         accounting support needed for the carrying out o f the POAS o f the various technical
         directorates. The unit will provide technical support and backstopping to the
         decentralized levels when carrying out their budgetary, administrative, financial,
         accounting functions. It will produce financial reports (periodically and annually). The
         Procurement Unit (Sewice de la Passation des marchis) will manage procurement
         functions for goods, works, and services in collaboration with the technical directorates
         that will benefit from these inputs.
         Direction de la Planijication, Coopbration et Information Sanitaire (DPCIS). The DPCIS
         will serve as the interface between the Government and the FTPs (Financial and
         Technical Partners) for all issues pertaining to the operational implementation o f the
         N H S A P . The DPCIS will be responsible for consolidating the planning and programming
         o f the Ministry's activities and ensure adequate monitoring and evaluation. The
         directorate will address issues that may arise during implementation and propose related
         corrective measures in consultation, as may be required, with the FTPs. It will provide
         the link between the fiduciary and technical directorates to ensure that resources are
         timely made available to the technical directorates (at all levels). The DPCIS will report
         directly to the Secretary General.
         Technical Directorates ( D m , DES, DLM,DPL, DAS, DIMM).These directorates will be
         responsible for the development and technical implementation o f their respective POAS.
         They will also provide technical support to the decentralizedlevels on an ongoing basis.

Regional Level. As part o f the process leading to the decentralization and deconcentration o f
responsibilities in delivering quality services, the Regional Directorate o f Health and Social
Promotion (Direction rigionale pour la promotion sanitaire et sociale, DRPSS) will ensure the
financial  and technical management o f the programat the regional level according to the terms o f
the agreement established with the central level. It will provide technical supervision and support
for activities being carried out as part o f its POAS and those at the Circonscription Sanitaire de
Moughata.

Circonscription Sunituire de Moughutu (CSM). Under the responsibility o f a Health Team, the
CSM i s the first level o f management and implementation o f the program. Service delivery and
implementation at that level are the responsibility o f the health team, who are accountable to local
authorities. Measures to strengthen the capacity o f the CSM, in terms o f human resources, and
financial  and material resources, will also have to be provided prior to and during the project
implementation period.

SECF. The SECF will be responsible for the implementation of the improvement and expansion
of the community nutrition activities component. This will be achieved usingseveral o f the same
modalities as those put inplace in the context o f the previous Nutricom project. To this end, the
management unit o f the SECF will be responsible for: (i)     planning, organizing and coordinating
the activities and elaborating the annual action plan for the nutrition component; (ii)    ensuring
timely and adequateimplementation o f the activities as stated inthe agreed action plan and o f the
attainment o f the objectives; (iii)
                                   establishing financing agreements between the SECF and NGOs
to carry out activities, where NGOs have greater comparative advantage; (iv) ensuring financial,
accounting and administrative management; and (v) ensuring monitoring and evaluation o f the


                                                  49

activities and production of progress, technical and financial reports, as and when required in
close collaboration with MSASDAF. The regional services will be the decentralized structures
responsible for the activities carried out at the community level. They will liaise with NGOs and

         MAURITANIA: HEALTHAND NUTRITIONSUPPORT PROJECT


A. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

ImplementingEntity
The HNSP will be housed at the DAF o f the MOHSA and the SECF and will be in charge o f all
aspects o f financial management o f the project. The HNSP will thus benefit from Health Sector
Investment Project and Nutricom Project experience in term o f managing IDA funds. The main
recommendationsbelow relative to the financial staff, to the informationsystem organization, and
to the audits should be implementedbefore the effectiveness o f the project.

Staffing
HNSP will appoint a Financial Management Specialist within the DAF o f with academic and
professional qualification acceptable to the Bank. Reporting to the DAF, she should be capable
o f directing and guiding the financial management operations o f the Project including the
coordination o f FM operations with decentralized autonomous hospitals. Other appropriately
qualifiedand experiencedaccounting support staff will be appointedby HNSP where needbe.

Riskanalysis
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) revealed that the systems for
planning, budgeting, monitoringand controlling public resources inMauritania are improvingbut
remain at a level that they do not provide sufficient reasonable assurance that funds are used for
the purpose intended. The risk o f waste, diversion and misuse of funds was assessed as partially
high. The overall project risk from a financial management perspective is therefore considered
partially high. Nevertheless, various measures to mitigate these risks have been agreed. The
financial management arrangements for HNSP are designed to ensure that funds are used for the
purpose intended, and timely information i s produced for project management and government
oversight, and facilitate compliance with IDA fiduciary requirements.

As the CFAA recommendations on financial accountability reforms have not been implemented
yet, the Country Risk i s assessed as partiallyhigh.

The table in the section under identifies the key risks that project management may face in
achieving its objectives and provides a basis for determining how management should address
these risks.

Various measures to mitigate these risks have been agreed and thus the project risk from a
financial management perspective could be moderate provided the risk mitigating measures are
properly addressed.

Control Risks
The main control risks, ratings and mitigating measures are tabulated below. The project risk
from a financial management perspective i s considered moderate provided the risk mitigating
measures below are properly addressed.

 Strength and Weaknesses

 Strength: Existing FMcapacities are very important butneed for updating to the new context.

 Weaknesses; FM decentralization to autonomous hospital at regional level and collaboration
 between D A F M O H S A and SECF remain very challenging because o f poor communication.

 Information Systems
 The existing computerized FM Systems will be revised and updated accordingly. Inthat regard, a
 Financial Management Consultant will be appointed to harmonize and customize the overall
 systems accordingly. He will also train financial staff on the use o f the system.

 FinancialReporting and Monitoring
 Monthly, quarterly and annual consolidated reports will be prepared by the financial
 management specialist and submitted to HNSP management and IDA for the purpose o f
 monitoring project implementation. Monthly: (i)        a Bank Reconciliation Statement, (ii)         Statement
 of Cash position, (iii)       Statement o f expenditures, and (iv) Statement o f Sources and Uses o f
 funds; Quarterly: (1) Financial Reports, (ii)   Physical Progress Reports, (iii)      Procurement Reports,
 (iv) SOEwithdrawal schedule, and (v) Special account statement/reconciliation.

 Annually: An annual project financial statement consisting o f the following: (i) Statement o f a
  Sources and Uses o f funds (by Credit Categoryhy Activity showing IDA and Counterpart Funds
  separately); (ii)Statement o f Cash Position for Project Funds from all sources; (iii)
                      a                                                                               Statements
 reconciling the balances on the various bank accounts (including IDA Special Account) to the
 bank balances shown on the Consolidated Statement o f Sources and Uses o f funds; (iv) SOE
 Withdrawal Schedule listing individual withdrawal applications relating to disbursements by the
  SOE Method, by referencenumber, date and amount; and (v) Notes to the Financial Statements.
 Indicative formats for the reports are outlined intwo Bank publications: (i)          quarterly FMRsinthe
 FMRGuidelines, and (ii)         monthly and annual reports inthe FinancialAccounting, Reporting and
 AuditingHandbook (FARAH).

 Accounting Policies and Procedures
 Project accounts will be maintained on an accrual basis, augmented with appropriate records and
 procedures to track commitments and to safeguard assets. Accounting records will be maintained
  in dual currencies (Le. Ouguiyas and SDR or USD). The Chart of Accounts will facilitate the
 preparation of relevant monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements, including information
       ..
  on the following:
       .    Total project expenditures;
            Total financial contribution from each financier;
            Total expenditure on eachproject component'activity; and



                                                      54

        Analysis o f that total expenditure into civil works, various categories o f goods, training,
        consultants and other procurement and disbursement categories.
Annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with International Accounting
Standards. All accounting and control procedures will be documented in the FAPM, a living
document that will be regularly updatedby the FMS.
B.AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS

The IDA Agreement will require the submission of Audited Project Financial Statements for
HNSP to IDA within six (6) months after year-end. Relevantly qualified external auditors will be
appointed by HNSP on TORS acceptable to IDA. A single opinion on the Audited Project
Financial Statements in compliance with International Standards on Auditing will be required
including the accuracy and the propriety o f expenditures made under the SOE procedures and the
extent to which these can be relied upon as a basis for credit disbursements. In addition to the
audit reports, the external auditors will be expected to prepare a Management Letter giving
observations and comments, and providing recommendations for improvements in accounting
records, systems, controls and compliance with financial covenants inthe IDA agreement.


C.DISBURSEMENTARRANGEMENTS

The overall project funding will consist of an IDA Credit as well as Government Counterpart
Funding as required under the recently approved Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) for
Mauritania. A 10% overall contribution i s expected from the Government under the Operation.
The following accounts will be maintainedby HNSP:

         (i)    Two (2) designated accounts inU S Dollars with respective equivalents incurrent
                account in Ouguiyas which will be managed by HNSP. Funds will be used to
                make payments to suppliers inthe respective contract currencies; and

         (ii)   A Project Account inOuguiyas opened at the Central Bank to which Counterpart
                Fundswill be deposited.

Interest income received on the Special accounts will be depositedto the respective project
accounts or any other account o f borrower.

Methodof Disbursements

The overall financial risk for the project has been rated partially high and, by effectiveness, the
Project will not be ready for report-based disbursements. Initially, the transaction-based
disbursement procedure will be followed (as described in the World Bank Disbursement
Handbook), i.e. direct payment, reimbursements, special commitments and replenishments o f the
Advance account.

When project implementation begins, the quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)
produced by the project will be reviewed by IDA. Where the reports are adequate and produced
on a timely basis and the borrower requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review
will be undertakenby the Bank, FMS to determine ifthe project is eligible for this disbursement
method. The adoption o f report-based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away
from the transaction-based disbursement method to quarterly disbursements to the Project's
designated account, based on FMRs.Detailed disbursement procedures will be documented inthe
FAPM.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs)

Disbursements for all expenditures will be made against full documentation, except for items
claimed under the Statement o f Expenditures (SOE) procedure. SOEs will be used for payments
claimed under contracts for: (i)  works in an amount inferior to US$500,000, (ii) in angoods
amount inferior to US$250,000; (iii)  consulting firms in an amount inferior to US$lOO,OOO and
(iv) individual consultants in an amount inferior to US$50,000, as well as all small equipment,
office supplies and training. Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs
will be retained by HNSP or any decentralized HNSP office inMauritaniaand the documentation
will be made available for review by IDA periodic supervision missions and project external
auditors. All disbursements are subject to the conditions o f the Financing Agreement and the
procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.

DesignatedAccounts

To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume o f withdrawal applications, two (2)
Designated Accounts in U S dollars with respective equivalent in local currency current account
(Ouguiyas) would be opened by HNSP in a commercial bank or at Central Bank on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA. The required characteristics for a bank acceptable to IDA has been
providedto Government should MoHSA. The authorized allocations would be US$1.3 million for
Special Account A (MoHSA) and US$450,000 for Special Account B (SECF). The respective
allocations will cover about six months of eligible expenditures. HNSP will be responsible for
submitting monthly replenishment applications with appropriate supporting documents for
expenditures. Since country legislation does not allow local commercial banks to handle
payments in foreign currency, such payments will be made by the Central Bank o f Mauritania.
MOHSA will ensure with the Ministry o f Finance that foreign currency payments to suppliers o f
goods and services under the HNSP are made by the Central Bank within 3 days o f submission o f
an invoice. Given the short implementation period and the expected quick results o f this
operation, IDA will grant a six months' advance to MOHSA. The flexibility should allow
MoHSA to finance most o f IDA'Sshare o f expenditures through the designated accounts. The
designated accounts will be replenished through the submission o f Withdrawal Applications on a
monthly basis and will include a reconciliation o f the account and relevant bank statements and
other documents as required until such time as the borrower may choose to convert to report-


                                                56

based disbursement. The borrower may also choose to pre-finance project expenditure and seek
reimbursement from IDA, as needed.

Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f US dollars 1.3 million into designated
account A (MoHSA) and US dollars 450,000 into designated account B (SECF). The designated
accounts will be used for all payments inferior to twenty percent o f the authorized allocation and
replenishment applications will be submitted monthly. Further deposits by IDA into the
designated accounts will be made against withdrawal applications supported by appropriate
documents.

Counterpart funds andtaxes

Based on the newly adopted Country Financial Parameters, the cost sharing between IDA and the
Government of Mauritania will be limitedto 90% (or 100%excluding taxes). While project costs
include all taxes and contracts for goods and services are approved all-taxes included in
accordance with Bank procurementrules, the borrower will be authorized to submit its claims for
local expenditures all-taxes excluded, in order to facilitate payments, while fulfilling the CFP
requirements.

Conditionsfor negotiations
The conditions for negotiations are: (i)a qualified financial management specialist appointed
within the DAF of MoHSA; (ii) and extend at regional level the existing FMsystems and
                                       update

Conditionsfor crediteffectiveness
The conditions for credit effectiveness are (i) counterpart fund arrangements are put inplace
                                                    that
and 50% o f annual forecast are released; and (ii)          that the recruitment o f an external auditor i s
finalized.

FinancialCovenants
A financial management system, including records and accounts, will be maintained by HNSP.
Financial Statements will be prepared in a format acceptable to IDA, and will be adequate to
reflect, inaccordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources and expenditures
inrespect ofthe project.

SupervisionPlan
Supervision activities will include: review o f quarterly FMRs; review o f annual audited financial
statements and management letter as well as timely follow up o f issues arising; and participation
inproject supervision missions as appropriate. The Bank FMS incharge will play a key role in
monitoringthe timely implementation o f the financial management arrangements.

Conclusions
The overall conclusion o f the financial management assessments is that, provided the following
conditions are met by HNSPprior to negotiations, the Bank's financial management requirements
will be satisfied: (i) a qualifiedfinancial management specialist appointed within the DAF of
MOHSA; (ii) updateand extend at regional level the existing FMsystems and train the users; (iii)
Initial deposit of Counterpart Funds released; and (d) qualised external auditors appointed.

By effectiveness, the project will not be ready for report-based disbursements. Thus, at the initial
stage, transaction-based disbursement procedures, as described inthe World Bank Disbursement
Handbook, will be followed, i.e. direct payment, reimbursement, and special commitments.
However, when project implementation begins and the borrower requests conversion to report-
based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the Bank-FMS to determine ifthe project i s
eligible.

                             Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements
           MAURITANIA:HEALTHAND NUTRITIONSUPPORTPROJECT

A. GENERAL

Procurement for the proposed Project will be carried out in accordance with'the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated inthe Development Financing Agreement. The various items
under different expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be
financed by the Credit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the
need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed
between the Borrower and the Association in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will
be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual Project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Procurementof Works:The Project will support the construction of healthposts and one health
center under the health component and o f two regional antennas for the SECF under the nutition
component. Implementation o f civil works will be delegated to AMEXTIPE as a delegated
contract management agency. Civil works estimated to cost less than $500,000 equivalent per
contract may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis o f National Competitive Bidding
(NCB). N o civil work contracts are envisaged above this amount, but this will occur, these
contracts would be subject to International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract will be procured on the basis o f simplified
biddingdocuments (SBD) by soliciting quotations from not less than three (3) qualified domestic
contractors, preferably more in order to obtain at least three comparable offers. The invitation
shall include a detailed description o f the work, including basic specifications, required
completion date, a basic form o f agreement acceptable to the Association, and relevant drawings,
where applicable. In all cases the award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest
price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the
contract successfully. Domestic Preference will not be applicable. The procurement will be done
usingBiddingDocuments agreedwithor satisfactoryto the Association.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this Project are, notably, pharmaceuticals,
vaccines, medical equipment and supplies, motor vehicles, motorcycles, office equipment, and
furniture. Pharmaceutical products, vaccines, medical equipment and supplies may be procured
through CAMEC (Centrale d'achat des medicaments essentiels et consornmables), according to
procedures and bidding documents acceptable to the Association. Goods estimated to cost
US$250,000 equivalent and above per contract will be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). For exceptional cases (namely vaccines), and with the Association's
prior approval, Limited International Bidding (LIB) may be employed. Individual contracts
costing less than US$250,000 equivalent will be procured through National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) procedures. Pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and supplies may be procured from
UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, and other specialized agencies of the United Nations. Direct
Contracting (DC) may be employed with prior approval o f the Association for certain cases, such
as procurement of medical equipment or spare parts which must be compatible with existing
equipment.

Other goods with an estimatedvalue o f less than US$30,000 equivalent may be procured through
shopping based on comparing price quotations from at least three eligible suppliers inaccordance



                                                 59

with IDAProcurement Guidelines (paragraph 3.5) and June 9,2000 Memorandum"Guidance on
Shopping" issued by the Bank. Requests for such quotations will be inwriting, and will include
time and place for delivery of the quotations; a clear descriptiodspecificationand quantity o f the
goods; as well as requirements for delivery time, place for delivery o f goods, and installation
requirements as appropriate. The request for quotations should be sent to at least three reputable
suppliers; however, it may be preferable to approach more suppliers because not all three
suppliers may respond so that at least three competitive quotations are received. Quotations will
be opened and evaluated at the same time. Whenever possible, goods o f similar nature, and if
needed during the same period, should be grouped into packages o f US$250,000 equivalent or
more, so that they can be procuredthrough ICB to achieve the best value for money.

The procurement will be done usingthe Bank's Simplified BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB
and national SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Association.

Procurement of non-consulting services: Non-consulting services will be provided using the
procurement guidelines.

Selection of Consultants:       Consulting services required for implementation o f the project
components, including studies, technical assistance, and the supervision o f civil works, which
require the recruitment o f consulting firms or individual consultants, will be procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers. All consulting services contracts (excluding assignments of standard or
routine nature, e.g. audits) above US$lOO,OOO equivalent for firms will be awarded on the basis
of Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method inaccordance with Part 1o f the Guidelines.
Shortlists for contracts costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent may consist o f national firms
only in accordance with provision o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Guidelines provided that a sufficient
number o f qualified firms are available at competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have
expressed interest, they will not be excluded from consideration. Consulting services contracts o f
standard or routine nature, e.g. audits, costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent for firms will be
awarded on basis o f Least-Cost Selection (LCS) method in accordance with provision o f
paragraphs 3.1 and 3.6 o f the Guidelines. Consulting services contracts below the threshold o f
US$lOO,OOO equivalent for firms may be awarded on the basis of Consultants Qualifications (CQ)
inaccordance with provision of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.7 of the Guidelines. Individual consultants
will be selected in accordance with Part V o f the Guidelines. The selection o f UNagencies and
NGOs will be in accordance with paragraphs 3.15 and 3.16 o f the Guidelines. Single Source
Selection may be employed with prior approval of IDA and will be inaccordance with provision
of paragraphs 3.9 to 3.13 o fthe Guidelines.

Training Activities, including workshops and study tours, are geared toward building capacity,
information sessions and improving management skills. Training activities will be part o f the
project's Annual Action Plan (POAS) and will be included in annual procurement plans. The
annual training program (including proposed budget, agenda, participants, location o f training,
and other relevant details) will be reviewed duringthe Joint Review.

All works, goods, and services to be financed under the POAS will be procured in accordance
with the procedures stipulated inthe updated ProcurementPlan.

Operating Costs: Operating costs to be financed by the project will be procured using the
implementing agency's administrative procedures reviewed and found acceptable to the
Association. Operating costs include day-to-day operating expenses, such as fuel, office supplies,
maintenance of office equipment, project-related travel and supervision, salaries for local


                                                  60

contractual staff, but excluding salaries o f officials o f the Borrower's civil service. Repeated
procurement o f supplies and services may be procured as much as possible under annual
contractual agreement.

Other:The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well
as model contracts for works and goods procured, are presented in the Project Implementation
Manual (PIM).

B.ASSESSMENT OFTHE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT PROCUREMENT

Procurement activities for the health component will be carried out by the Ministry o f Health
through the Directorate for Financial Affairs (DAF) at the central level. The agency i s staffed by
financial management and public administration specialists, and the procurement function is
staffed by a pool o f staff who attended training inBankprocurement areas.
For activities that will be implemented by the SECF, procurement will also be carried out by the
DAFofthe MoHSA.

A first capacity assessmentofthe DAFMoHSA to manage procurement activities was carried out
by the procurement specialist of the World Bank country office in Nouakchott in March 2006.
Capacity assessment o f CAMEC was carried out in February 2006 by the senior procurement
specialist based in Washington with the field-based procurement specialist. The assessment
reviewed the organizational structure for implementingthe Project and the interaction between
the Project's staff responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant central unit for
administration and finance.

Organization of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and functions in procurement:
According to the organization chart o f the MSAS approved in June 2005, the procurement
function will be performed essentially by a contracts division in the DAF comprised o f
experienced high level staff from the closed PASS, and equip with an adequate number o f
computers, archive and filing materials. Procurement for more than 2 million UMwill be carried
out by the C D M o f the MSAS, and procurement for more than 25 million UM for goods and
services and for more than 75 millionUMfor works will be carried out by the CCM, which has a
large experience inprocurement according to the procedures o f the Association.

Procurement Capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: MSAS has a
Departmental Procurement Commission (Commission Dkpartementale des Marchis, CDM)
which has a long experience in procurement according to the Association procedures. A few
members o f the commission have benefited from procurement seminars financed by the World ,
Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB) thanks to the projects funded by the two
institutions.

Procurement Capacityof the DrugProcurementAgency, CAMEC: Pharmaceutical products,
vaccines, medical equipment and supplies may be procured through CAMEC. The capacity o f
this drug procurement agency to procure was assessed inFebruary 2006, and agreed actions to
strengthen its capacity are currently ongoing which will enable CAMEC to procure goods for the
purpose o f this project and for the ongoing HIV/AIDS MAPoperation.

The overall Project risk for procurement i s high.

The key corrective measures that have been agreed to are: (i)     providing training to procurement
specialists to strengthen the DAFMSAS and the members o f the CDM; (ii)        recruiting short-term


                                                  61

consultants, as needed, for specific technical activities and for capacity strengthening in
procurement; (iii)       establishing a contract planning and management system at the central level to
be managed by administrative division o f the DAF/MSAS; and (iv) strengthening the filing and
archive of procurement-related documents, including training o f the civil service in charge of the
filing. Procurement review will be carried out twice per year and an independent audit will be
organized annually.

C. PROCUREMENTPLAN

The Borrower will develop a procurement plan for the first year o f project implementation based
on the adopted annual action plan which provides the basis for determining the procurement
methods. This plan was finalized and approved by IDA during credit negotiations. As soon as the
credit i s approved, the plan will be available on the project's database and on the Bank's external
website. The Procurement Plan will be updated annually or as required to reflect the actual
project implementation needs and improvement ininstitutional capacity.

A.        HEALTH

2.        The government health sector strategy has been oriented since the beginning o f the 1990s
towards the provision o f primary health care services to the population. This resulted in the
strengthening and decentralization o f the service delivery system towards the regions and the
implementation o f community-based health policies. Over the last five years the government has
defined the sector policy in the Plan Directeur de la Sante` 1998-2002 (PDS). The overall
objective o f the strategy i s to improve the health status o f the population in general, and o f the
poor inparticular, through the provisiono f more accessible and affordable quality health services.
The program's specific objectives are to: (i)                improve health services quality and coverage; (ii)
improve health's sector financing and performance; (iii)                        mitigate the effects o f major public
health problems; and (iv) promote social action and create an environment conducive to better
health.

3.        The implementation o f the sector policy over the last five years, embedded in the PRSP
and MTEF processes, has been supported by several bilateral agencies and multilateral
organizations including IDA and international and local NGOs through a sector wide approach
(SWAP). The SWAP was used to address in an efficient manner the new sectoral priorities,
gradually reduce the duplication o f efforts brought about by the coexistence o f various donor-
driven projects, strengthen local capacity inplanning and management, and assist the MOHSA in
setting up an effective coordination mechanism.

4.        Mauritania i s currently inthe process o f shifting to programmatic lending (Press). To this
purpose the government i s preparing a new health sector policy and a new MTEF 2005-2007. The
key challenge is to improve the health sector implementation capacity by expanding/ enhancing
the delivery system, strengthening resource management and monitoring and evaluation. The
implementation o f an effective intersectoral collaboration (needed to tackle issues that the health
sector cannot solve by its own, like human resource and financial resource management) will also
be critical.

Key Sector Issues
5.        Health Outcomes. Health indicators inMauritania compare favorably with neighboring
countries (with the exception o f Senegal) and Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Life expectancy at
birth is higher than the average value for SSA and neighboring countries. Infant and under five
mortality rates remain high despite the positive trends achieved in the late 1970s and OS.^ The


  Taking a longer perspective, the general trends are encouraging, especially for under-5 mortality rates, which have experienced a
dramatic decline from 185per 1,000 in 1975-79to 135per 1,000 in 1997 and 123per 1,000 in 2003. Child mortality, by contrast, has
experienced a much slower reduction, from 95 per 1,000 in 1975-79to 87 per 1,000 in 1997 and 74 per 1,000 in2003. Clearly, ifone



                                                               64

reduction o f maternal mortality remains also a challenge. At 747 deaths per 100.000 live births,
maternal mortality rate i s higher than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa and than in some
neighboring countries, such as Senegal, Niger and Mali. Despite a low utilization rate of modem
contraceptives (8 percent), there has been a positive shift in fertility patterns in the last decade.
The fertility index has decreased fiom 6 children per woman in 1990 to 4.7 children per woman
in 2000 and to 4.6 children per woman in 2003. This is due inpart to an increase of the median
age for a woman at first birthfrom 18,l years in 1990-91to 20.7 years in2000 (DHS, 2000).

6.          Chronic malnutrition remains a serious problem particularly in rural areas among the
poor and pregnant women and the very young (0-3 year-old) that are the most vulnerable, as
nearly one third of children suffer from this condition. Almost 32 percent of children are
underweight, and 10 percent are malnourished. Micronutrients disorders such as iron, folic acid,
iodine and vitamin A are widespread. Infectious diseases still remain a main public health
problem, inparticularly malaria, and some new or reemerging diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV
infections, Schistosomiasis (see Box 1). The situation in non-communicable diseases (especially
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) i s also worsened as a result of urbanization and
improvement inliving standards.

 utilizes the mortality estimates presented in DHS, then the decline in child mortality and, to a lesser extent infant mortality, looks more
 dramatic (a new infant mortality survey using DHSmethodology i s underway.

7. Trends o f vaccination coverage have been reversed since 2000 at its level reached during the
first half o f the 1990s. The decline during the period 1995-2000 was due to the decrease o f both
internal and external financing that conducted to shortages o f supplies and equipment, reduction
of personnel training, slacking o f social mobilization activities, and difficulties to carry-out
outreach strategy to reach people inremote areas. Since 2000, there has been a resurgence o f the
routine immunizationprogram matched by an impressive material commitment from Government
and external partners. As a result, DPT3 coverage has increased from 26 percent in 1999 to 82
percent in 2002. The decline o f DTP3 coverage in 2003 at 73 percent i s a clear indication that
there i s no place for complacency.

8. Primary Health Care Utilization. Health service utilization rates inMauritania are still low,
particularly for children. Due to data collection problems, it i s difficult to provide a precise
number o f visits per capita. In 2000, the HPM study found that the average number o f health
visits per capita was in the order o f 0.19 visits per person per year. This number was lower than
0.30 visits per capita found in 1997 in the context o f the preparation o f the Health Investment
Project and through the monitoring o f health services. Recent evidence point to around 0.3/0.4
visits per person per year, more inline with the average o f such as Senegal, Benin and Guinea.

9. Access to Health Services. There i s clear evidence that the geographic accessibility to health
services has improved. A comprehensive Plan de Dkveloppement des Infrastructures Sanitaires
(PDIS) containing inter alia standardized buildingrequirements and equipment lists, has served
as a guide for rationalizing the distribution o f services over the last five years. Geographical
accessibility has increased from 65 percent in 1997 to 77 percent in 2003: this means that 23
percent o f the population still must travel more than five Kmto reach a health center or a health
post, while 10percent must cover more than ten Kmto reach the nearest health facility. This low
accessibility i s among the main causes for under utilization of health services in rural areas and
central and northernregions where population i s ~cattered.~

                                                       Zaid and the Centre Neuropsychiatrz                  Nouakchott with
                                               All are
  represent the highest referral centers in the country. Next on the pyramid are regional level secondary
  hospitals located in 10 o f the 13 regions (Nouakchott, Inchiri and Tiris Zemmour regions have no regional
  hospitals), with 40 to 120 beds and 35 to 80 staff. These hospitals offer curative (including surgery) and
  preventive services. They are designed to decrease the referral volume to the center and to cut travel time for
  the population living in the countryside. The last level is primary care health centers, health posts and Unit&
  Sanitaires de Base (USB). Health centers (61 in 2002 including 12health centers type A and 49 health centers
  type B), located in department capitals, are typically staffed with 1 or 2 medical doctor(s) and 9 to 14 nurses
  and nurses aides and may have 10 to 20 beds. They provide a wide array of curative, preventive, promotive
  and rehabilitative services. Health posts (339 in 2002) located in villages o f 600-1500 inhabitants, are staffed
  with 2 to 3 nurses or nurses aides and traditional birth attendants. The USB are services provided by
  community health workers and traditional birth attendant                      i s level, simple curative and preventive
  services as well as safeinormal deliveries are provided                        charge. The Direction Rkgionale de la
                       ire et Sociale (DRPSg and the Circ                     n Sanitaire de Moughatta (CSM) perform
                       artmental management function, in                   supervision, outreach and training of health
  personnel and community health workers.



'Other factors contributing to reduce access to health services include shortages and uneven distribution of health care providers,
shortages o f drugs and equipment and the poor quality o f the building which often doesn't have complimentary infrastructure like
water and sanitation, electricity and incinerators.



                                                               66

10. Quality of Health Care. The quality o f health care provided by public health care facilities
continues to be poor leading to low attendance rates, low productivity and highunit costs. This i s
due to:

(i) Incentivefor PublicHealthPersonnel.Publichealthpersonnelhaveweakincentivesto
   Low
increase their productivity in government work, since they can sell their services to private
clients. In fact, the public (especially the urban non-poor) is more likely to seek medical care
from government-employed doctors working in private practices than from those working in
public facilities (see Box 2 for a description of public and private health care inMauritania).

(ii) Misallocation of Health Personnel. Misallocation of Health Personnel.                                             Sub-sector
(technical levels) and geographical imbalances make the allocation o f health personnel
inefficient. Large proportions of health workers tend to be employed at the administration and
tertiary level o f care undermining efforts to increase access to priority interventions primarily
delivered through primary care services. Geographical imbalances, worsened by a centralized
personnel management and a low human resource management capacity including the lack o f a
reliable personnel management information system, limit the access to health services o f rural
populations. Lower skilled staff tends to substitute for higher skilled staff in underserved areas.'
In general, the ratio populatiodpersonnel is more favorable in the richer than poorer regions,
especially for doctors.

(iii) Shortageof QualiJiedStafJ:Furthermore, thesector suffersfromachronic shortageof
qualified staff, such as polyvalent nurses, public health specialists, doctors and surgeons and from
low salaries. In the last 20 years, the real value o f the average salary in the health sectors has
almost halved. The lack o f effective management and supervision incombination with low salary
levels result in attitudes and practices that not only affect the technical quality o f services, but
also the reputation and inturnthe demand o f public services. Under these circumstances, it i s also
difficult to persuade health staff to work inrural areas, given that the attraction o f urban areas and
the possibility to earn a salary inthe private health sector (between 10 and 20 time higher than in
the public sector) act as a powerful disincentive, notably for specialized staff.

(iv)      Management of health sewice provision. The efficiency o f health care provision
continues to be reduced by difficulties to integrate vertical "priority" health programs, the
absence o f policy to develop collaboration with other sectors and tackle issues requiring a
coordinated multi-sector action and the lack of continuity for interventions like vaccination,

 For instance, about one third of health personnel is employed at the administration and tertiary level, and more than 50 percent of
doctors and 42 percent of midwives carry out administrative duties. Similarly, more than 55 percent of all health workers are
concentrated in Nouakchott, even though the capital city hosts "only" 35 percent of the country's population. In addition, of a total of
220 midwives, less than 50 work in the interior of the country. And in the wilayas, a great proportion of health personnel are
concentrated inregionalcapitals.



                                                                 67

prenatal care and tuberculosis control (for instance, the DTP1-DTP3 dropout rate was 16% in
2001). While allocation to support services increased the availability o f vehicles and gas,
supervision didnot significantly improve.

11.      Drug Supply. The introduction o f cost recovery at the health post and health center
levels significantly improved the availability o f essential drugs, although delays affect the
extension o f this practice at the district hospital level. Accessibility to quality generic drugs
continues to pose problems. The central warehouse (CAMEC) created in 2002 is not yet fully
functional, nor efficiently structured and managed. Its capacity to supply drugs to all health public
facilities i s still insufficient. Stock outages o f essential drugs and vaccines are frequent
recognizing amongst its multiple causes the absence o f an efficient and transparent procurement
system and the difficulties to CAMEC to access to foreign currencies, the insufficient capacity
and resources o f the regional pharmaceutical stores Dep6ts Pharrnaceutiques Rkgionaux
compounded by their unspecified responsibilities. At all levels, drug purchasing planning
capacity i s deficient including in health facilities. The regulatory framework is deficient as well
and the capacity o f the central ministry to enforce regulation i s low, meaning that there is some
disorder in the private pharmaceutical market leading to the circulation o f low quality and
counterfeit drugs. Financial access to drugs i s also limitedby the health practitioner's tendency to
prescribe brand name drugs instead o f their generic equivalent.

12.      Sector Management and Administrative Capacity. Although the quality o f the health's
sector management has greatly improved inrecent years (mainly as a result o f the SWAP and the
Plan de Renforcement des Capacitks Institutionnelles (PRCI), program implementation i s still
hindered by the lack o f accountability and weaknesses in national capacities for financial
management, execution, procurement and audit that cause delay and disruption in program
implementation. Supervision and monitoring activities aimed at improving health service quality
and program implementation are not regularly carried-out at facilities level and inhealth districts.
The system of health information i s very centralized, complex and incapable o f producing
relevant and timely information for the management o f program and services, nor to provide full
account of the resources used, especially at the local level. In general, the overall planning o f
activities does not seem to be linked with the objectives to be attained in a coherent and effective
manner.

 13.     Decentralization. Importantprogress has beenmade with the setting-up o f district health
administration and district plans, as well as directing financial resources to the regions (these
remain, however, modest). However, the mechanisms o f participation of local communities inthe
management o f health services, through the Comitks de Gestion, remain weak. Local
management committees are not representative o f their communities and women are absent
amongst them, especially in the most disadvantaged areas. Their members are still too much
focused on management o f cost recovery proceeds at the expense o f improvement of information
and prevention activities in their communities. Their participation to local planning activities is
still low. The slower pace o f the implementation o f the decentralization process contributes to
delay the health sector's progress in decentralizing the decision making to local governments at
regional and district levels.
Trends inHealthExpenditure (1998-2002)

 14.     Table 1below presents data on the allocation and execution o f investment and recurrent
spending in Mauritania for the period 1998-2002. By closely examining the table, the following
generalization can be made:




                                                   68

0  Allocation. Allocation of funds to the health sector increased fkom 1.9 to 4.0 percent o f GDP
    over the period examined. InUS$ per capita terms expenditure on health increased from 7.7
    to 13.9. Allocation of investment resources increased faster than that for recurrent spending,
   reaching a ration o f around 1in2002.
0  Execution. Healthbudget execution rates substantially deterioratedover the last two years. In
    2001 and 2002 execution rates were in the order o f 48 and 67 percent respectively. The gap
   between allocated budgets and actual spending are quite important. In 2002, for instance,
    actual expenditure on health amounted to 2.7 percent o f GDP or US$9 per capita, i.e. below
    the level o f U S 1 3 per capita, considered by the World Bank and other organizations as the
    minimumlevelof expenditurenecessaryto ensure abasic levelofessential services.
0   L o w execution rates affected particularly investment expenditures, suggesting that donor
    contributions were not fully utilized. For instance in 2002, the execution rate o f internally
    financed investment expenditures reached 97 percent while the execution rate for externally
    financed investment expenditures was only 38.5 percent o f the allocated budget. Salary
    budget execution rates remainednear 100percent suggesting that the need for other operating
    costs was not fully met; the execution rate o f primary and secondary levels budgets was
    below the annual average. The budget execution rate increased from 40 percent to 68 percent
    inthe primary sector, from 42 to 44 percent inthe secondary sector, and from 57 percent to
    70 percent inthe tertiary sector.
0   This expenditure under-run may be attributed to the low absorptive capacity of the health
    sector, unable to take up a large spending on poverty reducing projects that increased sharply
    following the implementation o f the MTEF. The analysis suggests that the shortfall in
    spending may result from inaccurate estimate during the planning process and or from
    problems arising during execution. Three factors are contributing to the latter: (i)         the general
    and continuing lack o f understanding about procurement procedures (IDA and government)
    due to an acute shortage o f trained procurement experts; (ii)cumbersome and time-
    consuming guidelines for procurement o f supplies and services (the CPAR recently
    completed identifiedprocurement as the single most critical operational issue); and (iii)         weak
    capacity of the civil work management agency (Amextipe) and local contractor^.^
0   The increase o f total health expenditures on health was due to investment expenditures until
    2000. Since then the trend has been reversed and health recurrent expenditures have sharply
    increasedinabsolute terms. Their share ingovernment total recurrent expenditures rose from
    6.5 percent in 1998, to 7.4 percent in 2001 and 9.3 percent in 2002. On the contrary, health
    investment expenditures, which a share o f government investment expenditures reached 8.8
    percent in 1998 and 16.0 percent in 1999, decreased to 9.7 percent in 2000 and 7.1 percent in
    2002.




 The decline in the execution o f health investment expenditures may have been affected largely due to
insufficiency in the procurement system that caused delays in the implementation of civil works (for the
construction I rehabilitation of healthposts and regional hospitals) and acquisition o f equipment.

Their share in health recurrent expenditures increased from 17 percent in 1998 to 23 percent in
2000 and decreased again to 18 percent in 2002 (Table 2). Per capita expenditures for
pharmaceuticals increased regularly from US $0.5 in 1993 to 139 UM(US$ 0.73) in 1998 to 304
UM (US$1.12) in 2002. However the amount spent on pharmaceutical products under current
pharmaceutical policies i s not efficient for reasons stated above. Shortages o f drugs are quite
frequent inthe public health system.

17.      Prevention. The share o f public direct recurrent expenditures for prevention has
increasedto near 35 percent inaverage over the period 1998-2002 suggesting the emphasis put on
prevention. Though there were large variations ranging from 30 percent in 1998 to 56 percent in
1999, 40.7 percent in 2000, 18 percent in 2001, and 30.2 percent in 2002. These figures include
only materials not salaries. Table 2 below, which provides information about amounts spent on
the different public health program, shows the need to increase spending for some priority health
programs such as malaria, reproductive health, because o f their link with certain health outcomes
(IMR, MMR,etc.).

18.      Maintenance expenditures are decreasing from 9 percent o f recurrent expenditures in
1998 to 5 percent in 2002 despite the increase o f the total number o f equipment. Moreover,
maintenance expenditures are unequally allocated among health facilities, tertiary hospitals in
Nouakchott getting the bulk o f the amount allocated. In general medical equipment is in critical
situation as suggested by the high rate o f equipment outages and the Government inability to
replace equipment on a large scale and to put inplace a long-term maintenanceplan.

Economic Classification

19.      Looking at a longer trend a good balance has constantly been maintained between
recurrent and investment expenditures except in two periods, 1994-1995 and 1999-2000 where
the ratio pickedup because o f ambitious investments in facility construction made under the PDS
1991-1996 and PDS 1998-2002. The relative importance o f recurrent spending, amounting to 59


lo Health sector wages and salaries represented 11 percent of the total govenunent wage bill in 1998 and
13.8 percent in2002.



                                                   71

  percent o f total health allocation in 1998, decreased in 1999 and 2000 but increased sharply to
  nearly 76 percent in2001and to nearly 68 percent in2002.

  20.      This corresponds to a ratio of allocated investment to recurrent expenditures o f 0.7 in
  1998 to 1.3 in 1999, 1.2 in2000 and about 0.5 in2002. In1999 and 2000, for each dollar injected
  into the health sector's current expenditure, 1.3 dollars and 1.2 dollars went to investment, while
  the "optimal" ratio should be between 0.4 and 1. Maintaining a balance between recurrent
  expenditures and investment expenditure is important to generate enough capacity o f
  implementing planned activities by departments. In order to ensure long-term sustainability and
  input balance, a basic requirement of reviewing the recurrent cost implications of all proposed
  investments should be enforced.
  Efficiency and Equity of Health Expenditure

  21.      The health sector policy and the MTEFhave been successful inimproving efficiency and
  equity by shifting health expenditures towards: (i) cost-effective interventions; (ii)
                                                       high                                 primary
  health care; and (iii) services inrural and remote areas. Inother words, the sector policy i s being
  oriented towards better serving the need o f the poorest segments o f the population.

  22.      Spending by levels of services. Although health expenditures have increased for all levels
  o f services, the increase for the primary sector over the last five years was more marked than in
  other sectors. Inrelative terms, Table 3 shows also that the budget spent on primary (i.e. health
  posts, health centers in categories A and B) and secondary (regional hospitals) care combined
  represented about 31 percent o f total health expenditures in 1998, 40 percent in 2000 and 51
  percent in 2002, and that expenditures for tertiary care were slightly higher rising from 14.7
  percent in 1998 to 17.6 percent in2002. By contrast, expenditures for the administration dropped
  from near 54 percent in 1998 to 31percent in2002.

23. This trend was particularly acute with
respect to wages. Figure 4.3 illustrates that              Figure 4.3 Salary Expenditures by Levels of Care

                                                           Tertiary      "^_II Administration
that remains     i s that   service   delivery     '
performance has not kept up with expenditures. The hospital sub sector (see Box 2 above)
accounts for 22 percent to 45 percent of public health expenditure but has also a low utilization
rate with occupancy rates about 60 percent for tertiary hospitals and 30 percent for regional
hospitals." Reasons for this low occupancy rate couldbe: (i)       lack of working referral mechanism
from the primary to the secondary level to the tertiary level; (ii)     poor quality due to shortage of
adequately trained specialist physicians, shortage o f drugs and degradation o f physical
infrastructure and equipment making it that regional hospitals are not very different from health
centers. This prompted the government to launch a program o f rehabilitation o f seven o f nine
existing regional hospitals, to create a directorate in charge o f overseeing hospital management
and to design a hospitalreformpolicy.

25.      Spending by programs. To make the most effective use o f limited resources, the
allocation for public and merit goods has beenprioritized inview to ensuring the highest positive
impact. Desegregation o f MOHSA expenditure on priority (vertical) health programs i s shown in
Table 4. They accounted for 30.4 percent o f recurrent non-salary expenditure in 1998 and 30.2
percent in2002 following an increase to 54 percent in 1999. Regarding the allocation o f spending
to different programs, the largest actual spending was seen for immunization, then followed by
reproductive health then by nutrition and HIV/AIDS. Moreover, between 1998 and 2002, the
trend in the allocation of spending by programs has been uneven. Moreover, between 1998 and
2002, the trend in the allocation of spending by programs has been uneven and the increase o f
spending did not significantly improve the performance o f some programs (like To and malaria
programs) or interventions because of managerial problems, shortages o f personnel, insufficient
decentralization to regional teams and weak coordination capacity o f the Direction de la
Protection Sanitaire.

26.      There has been an increase in the amount o f executed spending for reproductive health,
bilharzias and nutrition as a share o f MOHSA total expenditure on health programs; a decrease
for immunization; and stagnation for Nutrition and HIV/AIDS programs. Spending for malaria,
HIV/AIDS and bilharzia/schistosomiasis control programs remains below what would have been
needed. This situation is being fixed with the new global fund for malaria, Aids and tuberculosis.
GAVIis also allocating funds inorder to improve the financial sustainability ofthe immunization


  The number of staff in tertiary hospitals is disproportionately high: 496 personnel for 385 beds in the
"CHN", 306 personnelfor 100beds in"Cheik Zaid Hospital"

program. The share o f donor-financed expenditures for all these programs i s high, some being
financed   only on external sources (schistosomiasis, reproductive health, nutrition, etc.). This
indicates that despite the increased efforts by government to finance key health programs on its
ownresources, these programs remain vulnerable to decline indonor-financed expenditures.

  (Source: GIRM 2004a)

27.       Spending by regions. Mauritania has made remarkable efforts in redirecting health
spending towards decentralized units. Now more than 57 percent o f the health sector budget i s
spent in decentralized units compared to 40 percent targeted. However, the poorest regions have
benefited less than others and equity has not been achieved as intended. Table 5 shows that the
level of health spending in nominal terms in 2002 was twice higher in all regions than it was in
 1998, except in Hodh el Garbi where it decreased substantially. In some regions (Adrar and
Tagant) health spendingwas 6 times higher in2002 comparedwith its level in 1998.

28.       The distribution o f poverty varies significantly across regions. Nouakchott, Nouadhibou
and Inchiri have the lowest incidence o f poverty and Assaba, Gorgol, Guidimaka, HEG and
B r a h a have the highest. An examination o f the per capita expenditure and poverty distribution
shows that the reverse i s true: richer regions, i.e., those with fewer persons below the poverty
line, tend to spend more public money per person compared with the poor regions. In these
poorest regions (Assaba, Braha, HEG, Gorgol and Guidimaka), although per capita expenditures
innominalterms increasedsince 1998,their level was lowerthat itwas tenyears ago. More effort
remains to be done, to better redirect MOHSA recurrent expenditures toward the regions with the
lowest incidence o f poverty. To this end, the government needs to adopt transparent mechanisms
for allocating resources to the region that will bringmore funds to the poorest ones; to introduce
better budget practices and to improve fiduciary capacity both at central level and at regional
level.
Impact of different sources offinance on equity

29.       Private expenditure. On average, household expenditure on health in Mauritania
represents around 5.5 percent o f total expenditure, a relatively low level if compared to other
countries inthe region. Nevertheless, it i s interesting to notice that even though the size o f health
expenditure increases with the level o f well-being (as expected), its relative weight diminishes as
income level increase. This means that while amongst richest households' healthexpenditure i s in
the order o f 4.6 percent o f total expenditure, amongst the poorest it accounts for nearly 9 percent
o f total expenditure. It is likely that the unequal weight o f health expenditure between the poor
and the non-poor has a negative effect on inequality.

30.       The greatest proportion o f health expendituregoes towards the purchase o f medicines (67
percent) followed by health visits (19 percent), transport (9 percent), and hospitalization (7
percent). In general, the analysis o f the EPCV4 data shows that the poorest 40 percent o f the
population have expenditure levels equal to or under the poverty line. For this people, health
expenditure can contribute to further deteriorate their standard o f living towards a situation o f
extreme poverty. Although inabsolute terms this segment spends less that richer households, the
relative high weight in health expenditure in their total expenditure means that this group i s a
good candidate for benefiting from public subsidies in the future, with a view to facilitating its
usage o f health care.

31,       Cost recovery. Usually, cost recovery revenues are retainedirecycled at facilities. They
are relatively small compared to expenditures incurred by the state and by donors. Cost recovery
systems practiced inpublic health facilities for services and drugs involve tertiary hospitals, some
regional hospitals and health posts and health centers which charge for a variety o f services. The
better off population, which tends to be the primary user o f tertiary care services, pays more, as
services rendered in tertiary facilities are more expensive. Conversely, the poor, who usually are
the users of outreach services, pay less and still have access to affordable services o f an
acceptable quality.

32.       The cost recovery system has succeeded in keeping drugs accessible to the poor. For
instance, despite the fact that essential drugs are sold in the public sector at about two to three
times their procurement price, they are o f a better quality and seven to eight times cheaper than
the drugs sold inprivate pharmacies. Regarding affordability o f services, a system o f exemptions
exists for deprivedpeople, for preventive services like immunizations and for curative services
needed in relation to conditions such as tuberculosis, leprosy etc., which have strong public
externalities. As these conditions affect more fi-equently the poor, the health system also promotes
equity.

Table 6: Amount Generated by the Cost Recovery Systemper Year (UMmillion)inPublicHealth
Facilities




33.      Current problems with the cost recovery system are that the MOHSA has relaxed its
control over the revenues generated since two years (with the risk that funds could be waist) at a
time when health committees in charge o f the management o f these revenues are not functional.
The co-management o f health facilities, corollary to the co financing, i s not working well nor the
exemption system, deterring the poor and some vulnerable groups from making use o f public
facilities.

34.      Donors' allocations. Table 7 below shows that the trends o f donors funding to the health
sector i s decreasing while the government spending i s increasing since 2001. Donors funding
represented 55 percent o f the total health expenditures in 1999 but only 29 percent in2002 and 26
percent in 2003. In the meantime, IDA i s becoming the major donor representing only 14 of
external financing in 1998 against 64 percent in 2003. Donors financing is still characterized by
the difficulties to track funds and the use o f separate procedures for financial resources
mobilization, accounting andreporting andprocurement.

Policy Priorities

35.      Based on the analysis presented, the strategy o f fight against poverty inthe health sector
should focus around three main axes: (i)       Improve health outcomes for the poor; (ii)Secure
sustainable health financing and limit the impact o f health expenditure on the revenues of poor
households; and (iii) strengthen health sector management and governance.

36.      Improve Health Outcomes for the poor. Scale uppriority interventions and make them
accessible to thepoor. The still relatively high levels o f infant and child mortality and maternal
mortality underline the importance o f paying attention to preventing and curing infectious
diseases, often the main cause o f mortality. Taking into account the main risk factors,
improvement o f health indicators calls for the provision at facilities level o f an integrative
package for transmittable diseases, child and maternal health and nutrition. Efforts to improve
child and maternal health outcomes should go beyond the health sector and be supported through
cross-sectoral interventions that include improvements in access to clean water and in mother's
education, improvements o f family food intake and change in breastfeeding practices. A new
emphasis should be put on IEC and social mobilization involvingother sectors, particularly local
authorities and effective inter-sectoral coordination mechanisms at various levels.


                                                 76

37.     Improve health care utilization by the poor and vulnerable group. Paying special
attention to gender issues, behavior change, communication and social marketing can boost the
demand for services. Improve Access to Health Sewice. To ensure access to the integrative
package o f health services referred to above, there is a need to pursue the development o f PHC
network based upon a revised infrastructure development plan targeted on rural and underserved
areas. The aim i s to ensure, before 2010, that 90 percent o f the population has access to well
functioning health structures (basic services) within 5 Km from the domicile. Community
outreach services should be also expended.

38.      Improve the Quality of Health Care:

(i)   Improve the availability, management and motivationo f health personnel i s needed. Equity
       in the distribution of health staff and their efficiency will set the pace for scaling up of
      interventions and pave the way for the achievement o f the MDGs. This implies improving
      the Human Resource Directorate; adopting the staffing norms for all levels o f care; better
      targeting deployment o f staff to critical geographical areas coupled with decentralization o f
      personnel administration and management to regional levels; designing a more attractive
       package of incentives with the full involvement o f local authorities and communities; and
       relying more on private providers particularly in urban areas. The quality and relevance o f
       the medical education also need to be improved. There is a need to decentralize nurse
       schools and involve local government in their management and the selection of the
       students.

(ii)   Increase the availability, quality and affordability o f essential drugs and consumables. The
       Government i s updating its pharmaceutical policy and will set up drug registration
       mechanisms and a quality control system. The CAMEC and regional pharmaceutical stores
       (DPR) will be restructures.

(iii)ImprovetheManagementofhealthserviceprovision.Thereferralsystemshouldbemade
       operational between PHC facilities and hospitals. To consolidate the results achieved so far
       it is necessary to: adopting the hospital reform policy; improve the management of
      'hospitals; win the loyalty o f specialized staff moved to regional hospitals (surgeons,
       obstetricians, specializednurses, etc.); establish quality monitoring activities; and improve
       maintenance o f equipment. All hospitals, especially at tertiary level, should draft a medium
       to long-term improvement plan for both their management and quality o f care provided to
       users. The Government should also develop with health facilities managers performance-
       based contracts devised as a means o f holding them to outputs and to apply rewards and
       sanctions. Measures should be taken aiming at increasing involvement o f the users o f
       services inthe management o f health facilities. Supervision activities mustbe intensified.

(iv)   Promote maintenance activities. There i s a need to design a long-term maintenance
       strategy. A feasibility study should be carried-out by 2005 to establish agency. All health
       facilities should be provided with funds for maintenance. Procurement documents should
       be improved allowing for standardization o f equipment, for after-sales services and training
       o f users.

 39.     Secure Sustainable Financing and Limit the Impact of Health Expenditures on the
Revenues of the Poor. Maintain a balance recurrent and investment expenditures. In order to
ensure long-term sustainability, reviewing the recurrent cost implications o f all proposed
investments should be enforced. Redirect health spending towards under served areas. More




                                                  77

effort remains to be done, to better redirect MOHSA recurrent expenditures toward the regions
with the highest incidence ofpoverty.

40.     Speed up ongoing reforms of the cost recovery system and promote risk-sharing
mechanisms. The process should be speeded up ensuring that some medications and consumable
supplies will be free o f charge (tuberculosis drugs, vaccines, vitamin A, etc.), or delivered at a
reduced price (impregnated mosquito nets; services for children under five and pregnant women).
A harmonized tariff system for drugs and cost recovery for health services should be applied and
a special fund should be established (from government and local communities budgets and from
cost recovery proceeds) for covering the costs o f specific health services and/or o f indigents.
Additionally, pilot experiments being conducted inNouakchott (obstetric flat fee) and inthe two
Hodhs (indigence project) to convert cost recovery for services into pre-payment arrangements,
should be scaled up in order to reduce the impact o f health expenditure on the poorest. The
tracking o f cost recovery funds should be made regularly available.

41.     Setting up a Financing Strategy. The government should design a financing strategy
responding to the following characteristics: global, realistic, rigorous and flexible. There i s also a
need to assess the contributions o f all stakeholders in the financing o f the health sector and to
systematize the elaboration o f PER, benefit incidence studies and public expenditures tracking
surveys. The institutional framework o f the financing strategy should be strengthened and the
Direction des Affaires Sociales should be entitled to follow up on all health financing issues
including cost recovery now embedded in the Direction de la Protection Sanitaire: Improving
budget managementprocedures and capacity.

42.      Strengthen Sector Management and Governance. Strengthen sector management and
administrative capacity. An assessment o f the organizational structure o f the MOHSA i s
underway. Its results will serve to restructure the ministry and its decentralized units. The
MOHSA should improve accountability among its staff and managers by extending to all levels
result-based management system to promote a culture o f result and increase efficiency and equity
inthe sector spending. The financial management system should be strengthenedat central level
and in DRPSS, CSM and hospitals. Capacity for data collection, analysis and dissemination
should continue to improve by strengthening the informationsystem.

43.     Increase decentralization. The decentralization process i s just starting. Strengthening o f
capacity in the Directions rkgionales and in the Circonscription sanitaires des moughatas must
be considered as prerequisite for the successful implementation o f sector reforms especially the
implementation of the result-based management. The links between the central level and the
decentralized levels should be clarified in order to avoid duplication o f responsibilities. The
government should speed up the reorientation o f community participation in order to increase the
participation o f local communities inthe management o f health services and protect the access o f
the poor by adopting regulation that defines mandate and composition o f community health
committees.

44.     Modernize the Regulation of the Private Sector. Given the deep involvement o f public
health workers inprivate practices, the low quality o f the services provided by the private sector
and its outdated regulation, and the volume o f private health spending, regulation and
enforcement o f quality and standards have become essential to ensure the effectiveness o f private
spending. Contracts to regulate the collaboration between the public and the not-for-profit private
sector have to be developed.

posts to be funded under the project; and (ii)       medical waste generated at these facilities. To
address the potential negative environmental and social impacts, the project: (a) is inthe process
o f preparing an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) because the precise
locations o f the health posts and health centers, and the potential localized impacts could not be
identified prior to appraisal; and (b) will finance: (i)   equipment; (ii)    training; and (iii)public
awareness campaigns based on recommendations made in the National Medical Waste
Management Plan.

ESMF: The ESMF will be applied by qualified personnel at the time when plans for the
construction andor rehabilitation o f health posts and health centers are made to ensure that
potential environmental and social impacts are identified, assessed and mitigated appropriately.
Thus, the ESMF (i)      describes steps 1-7 o f the environmental and social screening process; (ii)
includes an environmental checklist to be appliedamended by qualified personnel as appropriate;
(iii) provides generic draft terms o f reference for an environmental analysis, should one be
required; and (iv) it summarizes the Bank's operational policies to ensure that these are taken into
account during project implementation as required. The ESMF furthermore includes provisions,
including costs estimates, for environmental management capacity building to ensure effective
implementation o f the ESMF; these costs will be incorporated into the project cost tables.

Medical waste management: To address potential negative environmental and social impacts that
might result from unsafe medical waste management, the project will finance (i)             equipment
(containers for syringes, trash bins, boots, gloves, masques for the maintenance personnel; on-site
sanitary pits); (ii)  training for three health care personnel per health posthealth center plus
weekly information sessions over a six-month period; and (iii)public awareness campaigns
(production and dissemination o f television and radio messages; posters at health centers and
health posts; and animation). These provisions are consistent with the National Medical Waste
ManagementPlan, dated March 2003, that was prepared for the HIV/AIDS Project. Thisplan was
redisclosedprior to appraisal, along with a summary o f the objectives and provisions made under
the proposedproject.

OP 4.12 InvoluntaryResettlement

OP 4.12 was triggered due to the potential need for land acquisition which might lead to the loss
o f assets, loss o f shelter, loss o f access to economic assets or loss o f livelihoods, requiring that
affected persons be compensated andor resettled. To address potential negative social impacts
due to land acquisition, the project has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which
was disclosed inMauritania and at the Bank's Infoshop prior to appraisal.

The ESMF, RPF and the Medical Waste Management Plan for the Project will be disclosed in-
country and at the Infoshop prior to appraisal.
