                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Except for the nutrition component, the overall project implementation has been slow during the last year. Prospects for the next 8 months (i.e. up to the closing date) are positive
                         as the Bank and the government have agreed on an action plan that should help reach the Project Development Objectives. The Bank will continue to provide close supervision.
