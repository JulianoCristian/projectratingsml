                                                                                        58727

1.    Summary. The proposed change aims at reallocating Credit proceeds to cover overdrawn
categories and to allow the Project to move forward smoothly till the closing date of June 30,
2011. There is no other project change or any safeguard issue.

2.    Project Status. The Health and Nutrition Support Project was approved on June 1, 2006,
and became effective on December, 2006. The original grant amount was SDR 7.0 million, of
which SDR 5.54 million, or 80%, have been disbursed.


3.    The objective of the project is to strengthen the health system and its capacity to improve
the health and nutrition status of the population, notably of women, children, and the poor. It
supports the implementation of the Government Program for the health and nutrition sectors.


4.     A supervision mission took place from October 19-28, 2010 with the objectives of: (i)
renewing the dialogue between with the Government and partners in the health sector; and (ii)
assessing the status of the project and its prospects for renewed implementation.


5.    Proposed Changes. The proposed changes are as follows.


6.     Financing. A reallocation of Credit proceeds is proposed that will enable the Project to
complete already engaged activities. Given higher-than-planned spending in sector management
(Part 3), improving access and quality of services (Part 4), and expanding nutrition activities
(Part 5), and a reduction in expected spending for human resources (Part 1), support to sector
financing (Part 2), and Project Preparation Advance (PPA) refinancing, the reallocation will
allow the project to move forward smoothly till closing. Details are presented in Annex 1.


7.    There is no change in project components or in the activities listed under each
component, neither is there any change to the institutional and implementation arrangements.
The project cost is not affected. All expenditures will continue to be financed at 100%.


8.    The government has presented an action plan and a procurement plan which are realistic
and feasible.


9.    There are no outstanding audit reports.
