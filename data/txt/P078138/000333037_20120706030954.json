PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Community-Based\n            Ecosystem Management Project (CB EMP) for Chad were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            ensuring the sustainability of the community-based\n            Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) approach requires\n            sustained technical, financial, and administrative support\n            that cannot easily be provided through a single project.\n            Many actors are involved, and funding must be provided for\n            many different activities, such as sensitizing the\n            population on environmental linkages, formulating\n            subprojects, managing the subproject approval process,\n            contracting service providers, constructing facilities,\n            transferring funds, and properly maintaining facilities once\n            investments have been completed. This level of support is\n            particularly challenging in poor or isolated rural areas,\n            where public services and institutions are often limited or\n            nonexistent. CB EMP has shown that environmental investments\n            can deliver considerable benefits in the long term, but\n            funds are required not only for local investments but for\n            establishing and sustaining the public administrative\n            structures that provide technical and administrative\n            support. Encouraging vulnerable groups, such as women and\n            youth (as well as other underrepresented groups, like\n            herders in the case of Chad), to participate actively in CB\n            IEM subprojects can effectively empower these groups,\n            improve their livelihoods, and enhance their status in\n            society. The project actively promoted participation by\n            women and youth, which enabled both groups to improve their\n            living conditions and status. Training in CB EMP almost\n            always included women, and the involvement of vulnerable\n            groups was a condition for subproject approval."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
