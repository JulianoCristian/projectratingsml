                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. Significant progress has been achieved since the last supervision mission. Several key activities that had been delayed for several years are now under implementation and fully
                         on track. Many rural communities have formulated Local Development Plans (LDPs), which have led to the formulation of 192 community-based ecosystem management sub-
                         projects, out of which 113 have been fully completed. The rate at which sub-projects are being implemented has increased dramatically, reflecting the success of the participatory

                         3. Despite the recent progress, implementation continues to lag. For this reason, the overall performance rating for the Project is maintained at moderately unsatisfactory (MU).
                         4. Government has introduced a request for an extension of the Project closing date. This request has been positively received by IDA and is now under processing. The new closing
                         date will be December 30, 2011.
