COMMUNITY-BASED ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT PROJECT 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
 
SUMMARY 
 
The purpose of the proposed restructuring is to extend the closing date of the Project. The 
extension of the closing date will give enough time to the Project Implementation Unit 
(PIU) to complete key activities that are currently under way and without which the 
project objective cannot be achieved. These activities include: (i) implementation of 
community-based micro-projects; (ii) elaboration of five ecosystem management 
schemes; and (iii) preparation of the feasibility study for the establishment of a National 
Observatory for Chad's Environment Management (ONAREN).

Extension of Closing Date 
 
CHAD - COMMUNITY-BASED ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT PROJECT 
PROJECT ID: P078138  
TF 55093-TD
 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
 
1. 
The closing date for Chad Community-Based Ecosystem Management Project 
(Grant No TF55093--Project ID: P078138) will be extended by nine months, from March 
31, 2011 until December 30, 2011.   
2. 
A recent assessment of implementation progress showed significant achievements 
in some components. Under Component 1 (Financial support for community-based 
ecosystem management micro-projects), 113 micro-projects have been completed, out of 
a
total of 192 planned. Under Component 2 (Capacity building for integrated ecosystem 
management), efforts have been made to integrate environmental issues in the preparation 
of local development plans, and training on environmental issues has been provided to 
more than 4,000 stakeholders. Under Component 3 (Support for an enabling environment 
for community-based integrated ecosystem management), legislation has been enacted 
relating to the management of the forest and fauna, and the institutional and technical 
capacity of the Ministry of Environment has been strengthened. The project objectives 
continue to be achievable. 
3. 
Implementation has fallen behind schedule because of: (i) effectiveness delays; 
(ii) suspension of Bank activities in Chad; (iii) civil conflict in areas targeted by the 
Project; and (iv) procurement delays. The proposed extension is needed to give the 
Recipient the required time to complete key activities, including: (a) implementation of 
remaining community-based micro-projects that are currently under way; (b) elaboration 
of five ecosystem management schemes; and (c) preparation of the feasibility study for 
the establishment of a National Observatory for Chad's Environment Management 
(ONAREN). The G
overnment’s request for an extension of the closing date is supported 
by an Action Plan (AP) to complete the project’s remaining key activities. 
4. 
This will be the second extension of the Project, after an earlier extension of 12 
months. There is no outstanding audit report.
