Credit Project for Madagascar were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was high; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: development policy lending\n            can be effective instruments for the Bank and other\n            development partners to signal significant concerns about\n            governance. By late 2008 development partners governance\n            concerns escalated. As a result, the International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) postponed its Board presentation that was\n            scheduled for December, 2008. Donor coordination for budget\n            support remains essential. A partnership agreement was\n            signed in 2004 between the Government and the key budget\n            support donors, the European Union (EU), France (Agence\n            Francaise de Developpement and the French Co-operation), the\n            African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, later\n            joined by Germany. The goal was to provide a better\n            alignment with Government procedures and Paris declaration\n            objectives. Broader monitoring of developments on the ground\n            and more attention to outcomes, as opposed to inputs, is\n            needed. Although selected prior actions and indicators were\n            coordinated with the Government's action plan and\n            Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) objectives, their monitoring\n            did not always provide a whole picture of real progress on\n            the ground, especially in regards to developments on the\n            governance front. Even when the range of systemic\n            performance issues is broad, as it is in all areas supported\n            under the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series,\n            especially Public Finance Management (PFM), it remains\n            important to set as much as possible a few reasonable\n            objectives aiming at gradual and sustainable improvements.\n            Supplemental financing may sent mixed signals to authorities\n            when issues emerge in the implementation of a PRSC-supported program."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
