The project has two main components. The first\n            component focuses on raehabilitation and maintenance of\n            irrigation infrastructure and drainage infrastructure as\n            well as targeted rehabilitation of infrastructure for the\n            national Amelioration Assistance Program (AA). The second\n            component develops and strengthens irrigation and drainage\n            management in AA service territories and finances operation\n            and maintenance costs to AAs, provides financing to\n            establish AAs, supports the Department of Amelioration and\n            Water Economy in the Agriculture and Food Ministry (DAWE),\n            provides technical assistance to begin implementing the Dam\n            Safety Action Program, finances environmental monitoring of\n            indicators that have been identified during the\n            Environmental Assessment, and sponsors training and study\n            tours in areas such as financial management and accounting,\n            conflict resolution, governance, asset management, and\n            operations and management planning. Project management and\n            financing the Project Preparation Facility comprise the\n            third and fourth components."}, "docdt": "2001-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
