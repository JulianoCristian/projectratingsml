Some lessons learned included:\n            consistent Government support is key for successful project\n            implementation. Appropriate government policies have to be\n            in place for an enabling environment to allow project\n            interventions to work successfully. Without a suitable\n            institutional framework to manage, operate and maintain\n            irrigation and drainage infrastructure, investments in\n            rehabilitation are important, but nevertheless of short-term\n            impact. The project has disbursed well over US$40 million on\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure over the\n            past seven years, over 90 percent on higher-order works.\n            Without these investments, systems would have likely gone\n            out of operation. In a measure to assist smallholder farmers\n            the government rescinded the land tax for landholdings under\n            5 ha. An alternative to abandoning this tax in irrigation\n            and drainage schemes would have been to retain it and use\n            the money for maintenance of the physical infrastructure.\n            This would then have provided regular maintenance funds and\n            benefitted all farmers in the irrigation and drainage\n            schemes. Having a land tax would also encourage landholders\n            who are not using the land to sell it. Charging service fees\n            in drainage schemes is difficult, as the benefits of\n            drainage extend beyond plot holders. A fixed property charge\n            to all property owners in a drainage scheme would be more equitable."}, "docdt": "2010-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
