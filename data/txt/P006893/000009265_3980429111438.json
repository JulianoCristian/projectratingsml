This report\n            analyzes Colombia's proposal for reforming its\n            regulatory regime in environmental licensing against the\n            backdrop of laws on environmental assessment existing in\n            countries with comparable experiences. The proposed changes\n            to Colombia's laws modify existing law by establishing\n            1) an instrument of environmental policy corresponding to\n            the environmental impact evaluation; 2) actions triggering\n            environmental impact studies; 3) mechanisms to determine the\n            reach/range of these studies and evaluation criteria as well\n            as to identify their significance; and 4) mechanisms for\n            public participation in government decisionmaking about\n            investment projects. It also contains six sections\n            presenting recommendations to strengthen national\n            environmental policy, the program for environmental\n            licensing, and the incorporation of environmental\n            considerations in planning, operating, and maintaining\n            infrastructure projects."}, "docdt": "1996-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
