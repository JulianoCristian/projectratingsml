Lessons that\n            contributed positively to the success of this technical\n            assistance (TA) operation, highlight the importance for\n            basic legislation regarding sector reform, to be in place\n            prior to project effectiveness, to strengthen institutions,\n            and in turn, allow the project to become an essential tool\n            for the sector development objectives. Moreover, the TA\n            adapted itself to supporting expenses, which would not have\n            been available through conventional financing, and was\n            responsive in providing resources, e.g., training\n            assistance. Nonetheless, regarding the project's\n            shortcomings, lessons convey: 1) the need to possibly extend\n            TA to other institutions, not originally contemplated as\n            beneficiaries, as in this case, a sector-wide perspective\n            would have identified the Public Services Super-intendence\n            as a potential beneficiary; 2) the array of contracts\n            awarded under TA was indicative of a certain degree of\n            dispersal, and not a contributor factor; instead, a stronger\n            supervision could have addressed this issue; and, 3) studies\n            contracted under TA projects should be closely followed, to\n            ensure responsiveness to the agency's actual needs."}, "docdt": "2002-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
