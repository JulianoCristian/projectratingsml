The project includes the following\n            components: 1) overall regulation, pricing and energy\n            policy; 2) specific power sector assistance which includes\n            engineering and investment banking assistance and\n            privatization exports to help mobilize private capital for\n            new power generation and distribution projects; divestment\n            of existing public-sector controlled power plants;\n            corporatization and privatization of utilities; and creation\n            of the new grid company to facilitate competition between\n            electricity generators; 3) specific gas sector assistance in\n            developing a new industry structure and regulations for the\n            natural gas market incorporating private sector\n            participation and competition; 4) assistance in executing\n            sectoral environmental assessments together with project\n            environmental assessments, formulating energy sector\n            environmental regulations and guidelines; and 5) energy\n            demand management and safety enhancement by developing a\n            demand side management strategy for efficient energy use."}, "docdt": "1994-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
