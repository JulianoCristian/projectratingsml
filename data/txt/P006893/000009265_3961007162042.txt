MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THIE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE D)IRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO COLOMBIA
FOR AN ENERGY SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
I submit to your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Colombia for the equivalent of US$ tI million to help finance a project for Energy Sector
Technical Assistance. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 17 years, including 4 years of grace.
Background
I.     Colombia has abundant energy resources: proven oil reserves are currently on the order of
3.2 billion barrels, equivalent to a Reserves/Production (RIP) ratio of around 20 years; proven (8.3
rillion cubic feet ) and probable gas reserves amount to around 8.8 trillion cubic feet, equivalent to
a R/P ratio of about 70 years; coal reserves are estimated to be on the order of 2.2 billion tones
(R/P in excess of 100 years); the hydroelectric potential is around 90 gigaWatt (GW), of which less
than 10% (about 8 GW) has been installed. Despite the abundance of energy, the sector faces
serious problems: the electricity subsector was in dire financial straits until recently, exacerbated by
a dramatic supply crisis in 1992-93 which curtailed supply by up to 25%; the coal subsector has had
a prolonged shortage of funds withn the principal state-owned enterprise; finally, despite the
volume of reserves, natural gas has been supplied to a minimal proportion of potential users.
2.     Since taling office in 1990, the Gaviria government has launched major economic reforms,
characterized by opening trade through reduced tariff barriers, exposing economic agents to
competition and fostering private sector participation in areas where the public sector traditionally
prevailed. Some areas where this policy is being applied are the ports, the railways, state-owned
banking, state-controlled industial enterprises and social security. The Samper Government (1994-
1998) policies have emphasized socially oriented priorities, but it has continued the Gaviria-era
strucural reforms. The energy sector is another area where the Government is currently promoting
these policies; an initial target for reform, due to the prominence of its problems, is the power
subsector, to be followed by the hydrocarbons industry starting with natural gas.
3.     Energy will soon occupy an even more prominent position within the economy: Colombia
will fice an oil boom from newly discovered oil fields that could put the economy on a faster
growth path; by the end of the centunty, Colombia can become a competitive upper-middle-income
economy with a fist-growing service sector, a more selective but also more efficient and outward-
oriented manufactwing sector, and a strong export base, if the oil windfill is effectively managed
and its competitive edge is consolidated.
4.     The Energy Sector. Until 1990 there was, in practice, no single insttution responsible for
overall energy policy, and although the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MNE) nominally exercised
this function, it was overwhelmed by sector enterprises with vastly greater resources. As a



-2 -
consequence, oil policy was largely deternuned within ECOPETROL, the state oit corporation;
power sector policy was determined through a complex interaction of five major generating
companies and ISA, an interconnection and generation enterprise (created in the late 60s with Bank
support); natural gas policy feil within the realm of ECOPETROL and its development was, at least
until the late 80s, a secondary consideration; since the late 70s coal policy has been entrusted to
CARPBOCOGL a sate agency currently being resctured. Electricity pricing was the responsibility
of a Tariff Board which determined both bulk and retail tariffs, whereas prices for oil products were
promulgated by MME. Coal is the only product which has been exempt from state-dictated prices.
5.     The energy sector has acquired an increasingly high profile within f'e country's economy.
The discovery and commercial development of the Cusiana oil field with proven reserves of 2,000
million barrels will undoubtedly have a major impact on the Colombian economy and energy sector.
It wilt ensure steady growth of oil revenues and will provide a gas source in the center of the
country to maintain, after year 2000, the development of the gas market when supplies, heretofore
concentrated on the Atlantic coast, will start to decline.
6.     The power subsector has experienced major problems during the last decade. In the 80s it
becane the source of considerable financial difficulties due to overbuilding of generating facilities
which led to significant macroeconomic dislocations. Paradoxically, it also faced a supply crisis due
to an unprecedented drought in the early 90s, which aggravated sectoral problems caused by
inadequate planning, low efficiency, and poor maintenance These crises provided the impetus for
embarldng on radical institutional reforms.
7.     Despite the large volume of reserves, the natural gas industry is at an early development
stage, and its availability has been limited to gas and oil-producing regions. Major cities such as
Cali and Medellin lack supplies in the absence of a national pipeline network. Power sector
problems prompted the Government to focus on natural gas development and LPG distribution as
economic substitutes for electricity. During the last two years, two major factors have converged
to provide new impetus to the development of the natural gas industry and to raise its profile in the
Government's agenda: on one hand, massive power rationing highlighted the vulnerabilty of the
electricity sector to hydrological contingencies which the use of natural gas could mitigate both by
substitting electricity at the final-use stage and by fueling low cost, efficient, turbines; on the other,
very large volumes of associated gas were discovered which practically doubled the country's
reserves. In order to develop the natural gas industry's potential, ECOPETROL undertook the
organization of a trunk gas pipeline system which will reach the major urban markets by late 1995.
8.     A number of the problems that the sector faces have institutional origins. In the 60s and
70s the state increasingy became the major owner in energy enterprises, with a consequent
slackening of efficiency incentives and the virtual disappearance of accountability. The symptoms
of serious problems in the energy sector became alarming in the nid-80s with the power sector's
financial crisis; it then became evident that energy policy should be given a cohesive nature in order
to address the issues of excessive investment in electricity generation and the underdevelopment of
the gas subsector. In 1990 an OED study', developed during a two year period with the
OEBD, Colombi-Tlhe Power Sector and the World Bank. 1970-1987. Repot No. 8893 (June 28, 1990).

participation of Colombian experts, identfied many of the weaknesses of the power subsector and
recommended its restructuring through the introduction of adequate regulation and private sector
participation. Since 1991 the Bank has supported the reshaping of the powver sector in order to
introduce market forces by promoting competition and private sector participation.
9.     Government Policy. The Government has a well-defined policy for electricity within a
sector-wide perspective and clear objectives for the gas sector set out in the National Gas Plan. A
definite policy for the oil sector has yet to be structured; nevertheless, it is a Governent objective
to reduce its presence in the oil industry and it has already sold its petroleum distribution
companies. An overall energy policy has not yet been formulated in detai but the Government
recognizes its need and has requested support for this purpose.
10     Government policy for the power subsector consists of: (a) introducing competition by
creatig a wholesale market for electricity und an open-access transmisson network managed by an
independent grid operator company; (b) disengag itself from direct participation in electnicty
production and distribution through divestment of power plants and udtiles and undertaldng the
development of new generating stations with private sector participation; (c) introducing reguation
as a means to both attract the private sector and to prevent monopolistic behavior where market
mechanisms are ineffective; and (d) introducing pricing reforms to reflect costs amd to narrow the
focus of subsidies in order to target the needies sectors of the population.
11.    In the gas subsector the Government aims at developing this relatively neglected resource
and, in the process, correcting the uneconomic use of electricity for heating. The Government's
policy in this respect consists of: (a) promoting the increased share of gas-fired electricity
generation in order to reduce the reliance on hydro-electric generation and increase system
reliability; (b) attracting the private sector to build an infrastructure of gas pipelines and distribution
networks and developing new markets for gas; (c) stimulating exploration and development of new
gas reserves to supply expected increases in demand; (d) creating an efficient gas trading and
transportation system with private sector participation; and (e) fostering a market similar to that
being developed for power.
12.    The Government has taken the first sters towards implementing these policies: the
incorporation of private capital in power generation and gas transmission has been initiated; the
independent grid operator company is being organized; an Energy Regulatory Commission has been
created, together with a much-needed Energy Policy Unit to address overall sector issues.
13.    The Regulatory Commission is continuing to promote the pricing adjustment policies
which have been implemented in the last few years. Electicity tariffs have been continuously
revised in order to reach economic cost levels and eliminate price distortions within consumer
sectors; the following table summarizes average tariff levels as a percentage of economic costs
during 1991-1993 as well as the target levels for 1994-1997:
YEAR                   1991  1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997
Percent of Economic Cost       72.7  70.9  83.0  87.0  92.7  97.7  100



The tariff adjustment program is being implemented on schedule and the targets for 1994 have
already been met.
14.    On average natural gas prices cover economic costs. Natural gas costs are on the order of
$1 per miUion Btu (Mbtu) at the wellhead; wholesale and retal costs vary considerably according to
location; for example, they are on the order of $1.8/Mbtu for wholesale deliveries and $3.8/Mbtu
for retail delivery in Bogota compared to values which are expected to be 2o7% higher in Cali once
the pipelines are put in place. Prices are set by MME and exhibit wide ranges of variation fom one
market to another which reflect the fragmented nature of the industry. With the development of
new trunk pipelines and the interconnection of producing fields, bulk prices should become more
uniform and a pricing policy will have to be developed to address the issues which will arise  .l the
context of an integrated gas industry structure.
15.    Environmental policy, embracing socioecononic and sociocultural problems, is now being
actively taken into account in power sector planning and a Ministty of the Environment was
recently created. A further step in this direction consists of consolidating energy-related regulations
and developing sector-specific guidelines.
16.    Due to these reforms, the implementation of energy policy in Colombia is at a critical
point: major responsibilities have been vested in new institutions such as the Energy Regulatory
Commission and the Ener  Polcy Unit, and the open-access power grid and gas sector and
pipeline operating companies have yet to be organized. There is an urgent need for strengthening
the new agencies in order to enable them to discharge their functions efficiently.
17.    Country Assistance Strategy. Colombia's prospects and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strat  (CAS) were discussed by the Board on December 16, 1993. The proposed project is fuly
consistent with the CAS. The country assistance program seeks to help the Government consolidate
and increase its structural refonns, to support private-sector-led growth, to improve the delivery of
basic services, to address the degradation of the natural resource base, and to strengthen
institutional capacities. The strategy recognizes that the country's extenal position will become
substantially stronger and the Bank's efforts wil consequently focus on the quality of new lending,
with a volume of resource transfers which takes into account the Government's priority of
managing significant foreign exchange inflows. Policy reform, insttutional development and
improved implementation will be stressed. The Bank will maintain a sound lending program with
emphasis on technical assistance to help the Govemment in the process of decentralization and
modernization of the State. The proposed Technical Assistance responds directly to this strategy by
focusing on the institutional aspects of the energy sector and the implementation of reforms.
i8.    The 1994 World Development Report explores ways for developing countries to imnprove
the provision and quality of infrastructure services, including electricity and piped gas. The report
identifies the basic cause of poor past performance as inadequate institutional incentives for
improving the provision of infrastructure, which has been the case in the Colombian power and gas
sectors. The report recommends addressing the problem through commercial management,
competition and user involvement.



19.    The Bank's role regarding the electric power sector was formulated in detail in a 1993
Policy Paper2 which provides guiding pr; iples for Bank support of power sector restructuring
programs. The recommendations consist of: (a) transparent regulation requiring countries to
separate their govenunent's role as operator and owner of utilities from its policy formulation role,
through independent regulatory bodies; (b) importation of services which the Bank would assist in
financing for improving efficiency; (c) commercialization and corporatization whereby the Bank
will aggressively support power sector strategies designed to reorganize the operation of utilities as
commercial concerns; (d) commitment lendcng focused on countries clearly engaged in improving
sector performance in line with the preceding principles; and (e) encouraging private sector
investment. Excepting the importation of services, which does not apply to Colombia -a country
with a proven record of managerial capability-, the Govermment is proving its commitment to
insatitional reform by directing its efforts towards implementing all of the proposed
recommendations.
20.    The Bank has supported the Government in the process of power sector institutional
reform since 1991. The Bank has helped to shape and to define a new vision for the energy sector
by: (a) supporting analyses of the sector's problems and identifying the issues; (b) exploring the
options for addressing them; (c) fostering constructive debate concerning past conceptual and
systemic deficiencies attnbutable to inadequate institutions; (d) designing a reform program starting
with the power subsector; and (e) by supporting the implementation of this program. As an
essental component of institutional reform in the energy sector, the TA project will also focus on
the gas subsector where the development of a natural gas industry wili complement power policy by
lowering electricity generation costs and substituting end-use electricity consumption, thereby
fostering a rational pattem of energy use consistent with Colombia!s resources. The Bank's
involvement at an early stage seeks to ensure an effective development of the natural gas subsector
and to avoid problems which affected the power subsector in the past.
21.    in regard to environmental and energy demand management issues the project will aim at
providing the energy sector with a head start in developing regulations and incorporating them into
its expansion strategy, thereby supporting other institutions, such as the Ministry of the
Environment, with viable guidelines to enable sector development whilst simultaneously respecting
environmental constraints.
22.    Project Objectives. The proposed TA projeci provides a direct application of the country
assistance strategy by preserving the momentum gained over the immediate past regarding
institutional reform by passing from the study and design stages to the more resource-intensive
phase of recommended actions. The objectives of the project are: (a) to implement regulatory
reforms by strengthening the newly created entities in charge of regulation and energy policy
fomulation and implementation for the power and gas sub-sectors in order to help them build
experience and thereby increase their chances of performing efficiently; (b) to implement strategies
specifically designed for the energy sector, respecting environmental concerns and constraints and
attracting private investment in the sector; and (c) to develop a demand-side management strategy
and assist in its implementation.

23.    Objectives specific to the power sub-sector are to achieve the divestment of state-owned
assets or enterprises, to attract new private investments for system expansion, and to execute the
instiutional reforms required for putting in place a fiUy competitive market at the generation level.
Objectives specific to the gas sub-sectors are to assist in developing the industry's structure and
regulations for building up a gas market, and to assist in seting up the required organizations. The
enviromnental care objecive is to develop a consistent set of environmental guidelines for energy
sector development. Demand-side management objectives are to develop standards and guidelines
for efficient energy use and to disseminate them among consumers and industries.
24.    In the regulatory and policy making areas, the project will seek to implement regulatory
reforms by strengthening the recently created regulation and energy policy orgapizations in order to
help them build up experience, thereby increasing thei chances of performing efficiently.
Objectives specific to the electricity sector are to achieve the divestment of state-owned assets and
enterprises, to attract new private sector investment for system expansion and to continue the
institutional reforms required for putting in place a competitive market at the generation level.
Objectives specific to the gas sector are to assist in developing the industry's structure and
regulations for building up a gas market and to assist in setting up the required organizations. The
environmental care objective is to develop a consistent set of environmental guideEnes for energy
sector development. Demand side management objectives are to develop standards and guidelines
for efficient energy use and to disseminate them among consumers and industry.
25.   PIroject Desription. According to the project objectives, the proposed Technical
Assistance has been broken down into the following components (refer to Amex 4 for details):
(a)  Overall Regulation, rding and Energy Poicy: assistance to the Energy
Regulatory Commission and to the Energy Policy Unit for developing a compeive
industry, disseminating information regarding utiiities' performance, protecting
uses, pncing services efficiently, controlling and focusing the allocation of subsidies
to the poor, and structuring energy strategies, taking into account enviromnental and
socioeconomic constraints;
(b) Specific Power Sector Assistance: hiring of engineering and investment banling
assistance and privtizaon exports to help mobilze private capital (both domestic
and foreign) for new power generation and distribution projects, divestnent of
exsting public-sector controlled power plants, corporatization and privatization of
utilities, and creation of the new grid company (ISA-Transmission) to facilitate
competition between electricity generators;
(c) Specific Gas Sector Assistance: assistance in developing a new industry structure
and regulations for the natural gas market incorporating private sector participation
and competition; assistance to the Govenmment in attracing private companies to
the sector;



7-
(d) Environment: assistance in executing sectoral environmental assessments together
with project environmental assessments, formulating energy sector enviromnental
regulations and guidelines, and promoting user awareness and participation in the
definition of energy sector projects;
(e) Energy Demand Management and Safety Enhancement: development of a
demand side management strategy for efficient energy use; assistance in devising
mechanisms for disseminating information to help users in making fuel and
equipment choices.
26.    Specific outcome/unplementation indicators linked to each of the major project objectives
are as follows (refer to Annex 4 for milestones and timetable):
(a) The consolidation of a competent team of experts within the Energy Regulatory
Connission who will produce regulations for use of the transmission system, rule on
regulated prices and conduct a first comprehensive regulatory review of a power
uility before the end of the project;
(b) Development and publication of a comprehensive energy strategy;
(c) The sale of assets or shares in 3 power utilities and the awarding of contracts for not
less than 400 MW of new generating capacity; the creation and satisfactory
operation of the new transmission company;
(d) The development of a plan for a new gas industry structure and the creation of the
new company (or companies) involved in the plan;
(e) The publication of an energy sector environmental policy, and the publication of the
appropriate legislation and guidelines together with an upgrading of staff skills for
environmental management and planning; and
(f) The publication of a demand-side management strategy together with a plan for
implementing recommendations and disseminating information to users.
27.    The planned outputs of the project are summarized in the action plan in Annex 4.
Monitoring of project progress will involve both control of technical assistance output through
progress reports and review meetings with consultants, and tracking of implementation actions by
the Government. The recipients of technical assistance will be the institutions involved in sectoral
reforms, namely the Mnistty of Finance, the Ministy of Mines and Energy through its Energy
Policy Unit and its Institute of Alternative Energies, ISA, and the Energy Regulatory Commission.
This list may be extended to other institutions, such as the Superintendency of Public Services,
insofar as energy matters are concerned.
28.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's active involvement in assisting policy
formulation and implementation began in 1991 with the discussion of the 1990 OED report which



-8-
was widely debated in a semina organized by the Colombian authorities in 1991. This seminar was
followed by a number of similar events sponsored by the Bank which provided a forum for the
participants to discuss sector issues, and particularly the politically sensitive questions regarding
sectoral structure, the role of Government in the sector, as well as the array of possible solutions.
29.    The Bank has supported power sector reforms over the last three years through a phased
approach: a first phase, sponsored with ESMAP funds, defined the issues, identified the origins of
many of the problems and the options for institutional reform. The first phase (between March and
July 1991) ended with a seniinar and a workshop where the Government, backed by sector
authorities, firmly endorsed the power sector restructuring program. There followed a second
phase (between August and December, 1991), supported by Japanese Grant Facility funds, where a
number of task forces staffed with representatives from the sector, together with considerable
consulting support, drafted an Electricity Law which was approved by Congress, and enacted in
July 12, 1994. A third, much more resource-intensive phase, was initiated by the end of 1992: its
purpose consists of producing the detailed power sector regulations based on the Government's
policy and the findings of Phase 2. The consultants hired for the development of phases 2 and 3
have been financed by the Bank through the Public Sector Reform Loan.
30.    The Bank's participation in institutional reform has now matured into a project with
tangible results, such as the creation of the Energy Regulatory Conunission and a firm commitment
to seting up a workable competitive market for electricity generation. Effictive action has also
materialized in the area of private sector participation which has been promoted through: (a) the
instailation of 95 MW (Mamonal) of private generation in an industrial complex in Cartagena; (b) a
150 MW BOO contract awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB) to Seviliana de
Electricidad, a Spanish utility (both of these projects are already in operation); (c) a 880 MW BOO
contract (ICB) in Barranquilla awarded to a consortium led by ABB and urrently being negotiated;
(d) the award of a 150 MW ICB project awarded to ENRON (Termovalle); and (e) invitation to
pre-qualification for a 300 MW BOO thermal plant on the Atlantic Coast (La Loma). The
generation capacity of these plants totals 1575 MW, which represents 16% of the total installed
capacity in Colombia. These developments are to be followed shortly by the organization of the
open access network operated by an independent transmission company. These achievements
should be seen as the consequence of the effort that went into devising the sector's reforms. The
TA project will support the restructuring program which will require greater funds given the
increasing complexity of the tasks which lie ahead.
31.    The Technical Assistance project seeks to facilitate and speed up the transition from
publicly-owned sector organizations in power and gas to competitive enterprises with private
participation. The introduction of private sector participation will include divestiture of selected
assets and private participation in new investment. The project will respond to the need for getting
new institutions and the regulatory system to perform adequately; it thereby addresses the policy
recounendations formulated in the OED study. The start-up and leaning processes involved in
setting up the new entities can be exceedingly lengthy and prone to error. The TA project is
designed to hasten the process whilst avoiding potentially costly significant mistakes. In order to
ensure a successful transfer of knowledge, the project will inevitably have to span a significant



-9-
period of time (estimated to be around 4 to 5 years); otherwise, given the volatility of institutional
memory, the resources are likely to be lost.
32.    Complementing the TA project, an investment project (Power Market Development) is
being prepared to develop the infrastructure required for the creation of a competitive bulk market
for electricity sales. In the context of a comprehensive strategy statement expected to be provided
by the Government to implement the power sector reform proposals described above, this follow-
on project will: (a) strengthen and expand the national load dispatch center and the financial
settlement center, to ensure the smooth functioning of the mechanisms for energy interchange and
the corresponding cash flows; (b) strengthen and expand the interconnected transmission system,
removing existing bottlenecks, aimed at increasing the competition for sales of electricity, and
facilitating entry to the market; and (c) train those ISA-TRANSMISSION 3personnel responsible
for load dispatch and settlement.
33.    The Bank's involvement in the development of strategies and advice on consultant
selection, supervision and evaluation will provide valuable benefits by ensuring that objectives are
being achieved and by keeping the process on track through periodical project audits. In order to
sustain this process, the Bank can bring to bear its knowledge gained through previous sector
studies, and its experience with sector reforms (both successful and unsuccessful), including
privatization in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Pakistan, Jamaica and the Philippines.
34.    Lessons from previous Bank Involvement. The Bank has lent more than US$ 2 billion
in 31 operations to support the Colombian energy sector, mainly by financing investments in power
generation and transmission. The 1990 OED review found that the projects generally met their
physical objectives, and helped develop technical capabilities in the beneficiary agencies, but failed
to establish a sustainable institutional and financial framework for the sector.
35.    The last tranche of the 1987 Power Sector Adjustment Loan w>, canceled due to the
institutional pitfills encountered during its execution. The corresponding PCR, confirms OED's
findings (refer to Annex 1 - Lessons from the Bank Experience in the Power Sector): (a) a complex
and cumbersome institutional sttucture with pervasive political and regional pressures that block
management efficiency incentives; (b) poor financial performance in individual utilities and the
sector at large; (c) low and distorted electricity tariffs; and (d) a sectoral investment program that
overly stressed generation at the expense of distribution, and suffered from large time and cost
overruns. The TA will support restructuring programs for the power and the gas sectors aimed at
addressing all of the primary institutional causes of these problems and will draw on the experience
gained in similar projects (e.g. Pakistan, Jamaica).
36.    Key lessons which have been learned from other Bank TA loans include the need to: (a)
limit the scope and size of the technical assistance loan to keep it focused and manageable; (b)
ensure consistency and coordination between the legal/regulatory reform and the corporate
restructuring/privatization process; (c) ensure the continuity of the reform program, during and
after the execution of the technical assistance operation; and (d) have well-defined loan

and financial seltlement among participants of the national power pool.

administration and financing arrangements in place up-front. The proposed TA has been designed
with these principles in mind.
37.    Costs and Financing. The total cost ofthe project is estimated to be about US$ 12.4
million, with a foreign currency element of about 89%/. The amount of the Bank loan, would be
US$ 11 million (Schedule A).
38.    Implementation. The project will be managed at two levels: a Coordinating Group will
be in charge of overall orientation, and an Executing Unit will be in charge of project
administration. The Coordinating Group will be made up of representatives from the National
Planning Department, the Mnistry of Mines and Energy, the Mnisay of Finance and, the Energy
Regulatory Commission. A project coordinator will be in charge of the executing unit and will be
assisted by consultants hired to do specific tasks as required (Annex 4 presents the Project
Implementation plan). All reports and recommendations of the consultants engaged to assist in the
execution of the project witl be submitted to the Bank. The Executing Unit will have primary
responsibility for preparing terms of reference and short lists, and selecting consultants, subject to
Bank approval. Bank staff will hold a project launch workshop in Colombia short after loan signing
in order to review planned startup actions. Inputs required to supervise the project are estimated
to total about 12 staff-weeks per year during the first two years and 10 staff-weeks per year
subsequently. A midterm review of the project to detemiine the need for adjustments will be held
before October 31, 1997, or whenever 50% of the loan has been committed, whichever is earlier.
Annex 2 summarizes the Operational Guidelines for loan administration and consultant hiring,
contracting and supervision. Draft TOR's for consulting assistance to prepare/implement the
project components are available in the project files.
39.    The Government and the Bank agreed to use UNDP to administer the contracts and
payments under a management arrangement satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 3). Its management
fee of US$ 0.4 million will be financed from the proceeds of the loan. UNDP will disburse directly
to consultants and will maitWain supporting documentation on file for review by Bank supervision
missions.
40.    Project Sustainability. By supporting the implementation of institutional reforms which
promote private sector participation, economic pricing, environmental protection, and efficient
energy uses, the project will help the Govermnent establish conditions for a sustainable operation
and development of the energy sector.
41.    Environmental Aspects. The Project has no adverse environmental effects. It has been
designed to introduce environmental considerations and guidelines into energy sector developments
and will include Sector Environmental Assessments and Project Environmental Assessments.
Because of the special attention given to these issues it belongs to Environmental Category B.
42.    Poverty Category. Not applicable to this project.
43.    Program Objective Category. The Project belongs to the category of Public Sector
Management and Private Sector Development.



44.    Procurement. The loan witl finance consulting services, computers and ancillary
equipment, and training. Methods for procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B.
Procurement of goods to be financed with proceeds from the loan would follow procedures in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for procurement. The contracting of consulting firms for services
totaling about US$ 9.9 million to caffy out sectoral, institutional and management studies under the
various components of the project, and of individual consultants for the strengthening of MME and
the operations of the Project Coordinating Unit, would be in accordance with Bank Guidelines for
the use of consultants and use the Bank standard contract form. Prior Bank review or approval of
budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and
contracts under the Bank's Consultant Guidelines shall not apply to contracts estimated to cost less
than US$ 100,000 equivalent each, in an aggregate not expected to exceed US$ 500,000.
However, this exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to: (a) the terms of reference for such
contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a critical nature, as
reasonably determined by the Bank; or (d) amendments of contracts for the employment of
consulting firms raising the contract value to US$ 100,000 equivalent or above. Procurement of
computing equipment and software, and necessary communications and ancillary equipment for the
imnplementation of the energy regulation information system, and strengthening of the electricity
dispatching center, and the general strengthening of MME units, for an estimated amount of about
US$ 0.5 million, would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using mainly
a 2-step bidding procedure, with standard Bank bidding documents, in packages of not less than
US$ 100,000 each. An estimated US$ 0.6 milion of the loan proceeds would be used for the
reimbursement of training expenses such as tuition fees and travel expenses for courses and
seminars in accordance with a plan to be previously approved by the Bank, and for fees of
individual consultants acceptable to the Bank. The administrative expenses of UNDP, which would
be hired as procurement agent under a Management Service Agreement with DNP to expedite
project implementation, would be paid with proceeds from the loan directly to UNDP. Prior review
of documentation and procurement decisions will be required for all procurement including the
proposed UNDP management service agreement.
45.    Disbunements. The Planning Department will request disbursements and submit these
requests through the Executing Unit to UNDP for processing. UNDP will disburse payments
directly to consultants. Expenditures for individual contracts of goods or services, for which prior
review by the Bank is not required will be disbursed against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)
certified by the Banco de la Republica of Colombia. Detailed supporting documentation for
expenditures will be kept by UNDP and submitted by the borrower to the Bank. The application
for withdrawal submitted by the Borrower to UNDP will be in amounts of about US$ 500,000.
UNDP will submit full documentation for all contracts requiring Bank's prior review. Conditions of
disbursement for training will be that the corresponding expenditures have been included in a plan
satisfactory to the Bank, submitted by the Executing Unit. The responsibility of the Executing Unit.
Disbursements, representing mainly expenditures under short term technical assistance, will be made
over a five-year period, which is close to the 4-year average disbursement profile for technical
assistance projects in the Latin America and Caribbean Region. Since the implementation of energy
sector reforms has already started, retroactive fmancing not to exceed US$ I million (i.e., 10% of



-12-
the loan amount) would be applied to finance eligible expenditures made after July 31, 1994. The
closing date of the proposed Loan would be December 31, 1999.
46.    Accounts and Audit. UNDP will maintain separate accounts for receipt of project funds
and payments for all project activities. Accounts and statements of expenditures of the project and
ofthe Executing Unit, would be audited each year by auditors acceptable to the Bank in accordance
with the Bank's Auditing Guidelines. The audited reports would be submitted to the Bank not later
than four months after the close of the fiscal year.
47.    Actions Agreed. During negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) a project
implementation plan, including timetable, presented in Schedule 5 to the loan agreement; (b) that
the Borrower will furnish to the Bank (i) not later than August in each year, a forecast for the
sources uses and funds during the next calendar year, and (ii) 30 days after the end of each calendar
semester, a report on the results of the Project and on the meeting of the targets set in the
implementation program; and (c) that at the time of submitting to the Bank each report to be
submitted pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) (ii) above, review jointly with the Bank the
time-table for the Implementation Program, and revise such time-table if so agreed with the Bank
48.    Conditions of effectiveness will be (i) the signature of a project administration agreemnent,
satisfactory to the Bank, between UNDP and the Government, and (fi) the coordinating group and
the executing unit shall have been established in form and subsistence satisfactory to the Bank.
49.    Benefits. The proposed loan would assist the Government in the implementation of
legaVregulatory reforms for the energy sector and the strengthening of associated public
institutions, which would improve efficiency and attract private investors to the energy sector.
Economic pricing of electricity and gas would eliminate a financial burden to the Government by
allowing these sectors to fund their own investment needs, and would reduce energy waste and
pollution. Sector efficiency would be further enhanced through increased private participation, and
scaling-down of government intervention which would be focused on market regulation.
Environmental monitoring and management of energy-related operations would be much improved.
50.    Risks. The project poses no significant technical risks and enough momentum seems to
have been developed to carry the power and gas sector reform implementation over, which is
supported by the Central Govenmient administration that took power in September, 1994. The
major risks relating to the implementation of the sector reforms include: (a) insufficient institutional
capabilities in government to develop and enforce the regulations needed for the successful
implementation of the new energy sector structures; (b) a political reluctance to authorize tariff
adjustments, and the opposition to reform of interested groups such as the unions, the management
of existing utilities, and some local govenmients; and (c) the possibility of a slow response from the
private sector. These risks will be mitigated substantially through: (a) training (funded by the loan)
and in-house technical assistance during the first years of operation of the new Energy Regulatory
Commission; and (b) advice regarding the prudent use of Government guarantees to private
investors together with mechanisms designed to prevent unjustified and excessive use of such
guarantees and pre-established rules for phasing them out.

51.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
