outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: sustained\n            commitment of senior management/officials to long-term\n            project goals and to providing strong support for the\n            operation is essential to maintain momentum. Sustained\n            consistency of messages should be maintained at all times.\n            Agreements made should be honored in order to avoid\n            confusion and unnecessary wasting of time and resources.\n            This includes adherence to mutually agreed deadlines and\n            plans. Bridge financing should be built in to avoid\n            disruptions in staffing (between Board approval and\n            effectiveness) particularly in countries with known long\n            delays in effectiveness. Agreements on major project\n            issues/activities must be detailed and documented with\n            precision so as to avoid any mis-interpretation later on.\n            When there are several distinct implementing agencies with\n            clearly different degrees of commitment and readiness at\n            appraisal, it is prudent that fiduciary functions and the\n            designated accounts for these agencies are not placed in\n            either one of the agencies. Otherwise, implementation in one\n            agency is totally dependent on the other."}, "docdt": "2009-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
