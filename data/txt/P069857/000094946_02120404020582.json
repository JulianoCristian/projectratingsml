and mortality through an\n            effective national strategy for TB control adapted to the\n            world standard, and an HIV/AIDS Program largely focused on\n            prevention of transmission of the disease among high-risk\n            groups. There are three project components. The first\n            component focuses on controlling tuberculosis with training\n            and education, diagnosis, treatment, public awareness\n            campaigning, and monitoring and evaluation. The second\n            component provides finance to stabilize the epidemiological\n            situation in the country, reduce risky behavior among young\n            people, and reduce the social tension in the society and\n            negative consequences of the epidemic. Specifically, this\n            component finances a pilot project to help Ukraine develop\n            capabilities to treat a limited number of adults and\n            children infected with HIV, with anti-retroviral drugs. The\n            successful implementation of this pilot will help Ukraine\n            access added funds from the Global Alliance. The third\n            component comprises the financing of TB and AIDS control\n            activities in the prison system. It was designed as a\n            separate component because of the institutional nature of\n            the prison system, a self-contained and centrally managed system."}, "docdt": "2002-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
