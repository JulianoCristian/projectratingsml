What, in general, a new strategy and social\n            protection mechanisms should be in Ukraine? These questions\n            have been for quite some time in the focus of great\n            attention of the World Bank experts. The World Bank fist\n            project in this area - the social protection support project\n            (April 1997 - June 2000) had a rather modest budget of\n            United States (U.S.) 3 million dollars, but it had a\n            considerable social effect. This will improve the\n            administering of the program of the public housing and\n            utilities subsidies (PHUSP), which was in force at that time\n            in Ukraine and caused many complaints due to cumbersome\n            (non-automated) system of processing applications, lack of\n            experience among the staff, absence of operational\n            communication between relevant local and regional agencies\n            and the ministry of labor and social policy of Ukraine. The\n            next project - the social investment fund project - approved\n            by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank on\n            December 4, 2001, is, perhaps, one of the most successful\n            projects today. It is expected that during the six years of\n            this joint Ukraine-World Bank activities, over 500 micro\n            projects can be implemented aimed at supporting the\n            residents of poor or depressed areas, citizens with specific\n            problems, children from unhappy families, and the like. And\n            at the national level, it is necessary to refine the\n            principles of providing such poverty-targeted assistance and\n            self-aid by involving the public at large in these\n            activities. In December 2002, the Board of Executive\n            Directors of the World Bank approved yet another important\n            project - tuberculosis (TB) and acquired immunodeficiency\n            syndrome (AIDS) epidemic control project for Ukraine."}, "docdt": "2004-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
