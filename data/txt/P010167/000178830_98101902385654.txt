INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A SEVENTH (MAHAWELI TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed
Development Credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in an
amount of SDRs 31.3 million (US$36.0 million) on standard IDA terms to help
finance a Seventh (Mahaweli Transmission) Power Project. The entire proceeds
of the Credit would be relent to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) at 12%
interest rate per annum for a term of 20 years, including three years' grace,
with Government bearing the foreign exchange risk. To help finance part of
the foreign exchange cost of the proposed project, the OPEC Fund would
provide a loan of US$11.0 million, free of interest, for a period of 20
years, including 5 years of grace, with a service charge of 3/4 of one per
cent per annum on amounts withdrawn and outstanding.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The most recent economic report, "Sri Lanka:  Policies and
Prospects for Economic Adjustment" (Report No. 3466-CE, May 15, 1981), was
distributed to the Executive Directors on May 26, 1981. Country data are
provided in Annex I.
3.        After several years of relative stagnation, Sri Lanka's economy
has experienced sustained growth. This growth has been the direct result
of the economic liberalization of 1977, and the development push associated
with it. Until 1977, Sri Lanka's growth performance had been below both need
and potential. Although GDP growth in the 1960s, at 4.4% per annum, was
above the average for low income countries, it slackened sharply in the
1970-77 period to 2.9% per annum, just below the average for low income
countries. Through much of this period, the terms of trade deteriorated
steadily, eroding even these modest gains; as a consequence, per capita gross
national income rose by a mere 0.9% per annum during the 1970-76 period. The
slowdown in economic growth in the 1970-77 period is attributable to a com-
bination of factors, including inadequate investment, poor management of the
economy, and a policy environment not conducive to growth and investment;
these factors were compounded by poor weather in some years and a sharp rise
in the cost of imported food and petroleum.
1/ This part is substantially the same as Part I of the President's
Report on a Second Small and Medium Industries Project for
Sri Lanka (Report No. P-3124-CE, dated September 23, 1981) which
was approved by the Executive Directors on October 13, 1981.



-2-
4.        The three tree crops--tea, rubber, and coconuts--which are still
the mainstay of the economy, suffered from low replanting and inadequate
incentives. These problems were exacerbated by a dual exchange rate system,
introduced in 1968, that discriminated against these crops, and by the uncer-
tainties surrounding a protracted nationalization (1972-75) of the larger
estates. After the exceptional output growth of the 1960s, rice yields and
cropping intensities declined in the 1970-77 period due to poor institutional
support. Investment in manufacturing was also low, and the inefficiency of
most public and private sector firms, nurtured in a highly protected environ-
ment, resulted in growth of manufacturing of 1% per annum. The only bright
spots were subsidiary food crops and industrial exports which benefited from
good incentives.
5.        An inadequate public savings effort, caused by inelastic revenues
and uncontrolled growth in recurrent expenditures, inhibited public invest-
ment. Unfavorable policies further constrained private savings. The slow
growth rates and changes in the structure of output provided neither the jobs
nor the employment structure for a growing labor force. The low output
growth, the excessive capital intensity of investment, the mismatch between
the job aspirations of those with post-primary education and the jobs avail-
able to them, the post-war demographic bulge, and the rising female par-
ticipation rates contributed to a massive increase in unemployment, estimated
at over 1 million, or some 18% of the labor force in 1977.
6.        In sharp contrast to this poor economic performance, Sri Lanka's
social achievements in relation to per capita income have been outstanding.
Sri Lanka has about one and one-half times the life expectancy, almost thrice
the literacy, one-quarter the infant mortality and half the birth rate which
would be expected for a country at its per capita income level. Nutrition
levels have been adequate, and in the 1960s paralleled gains in income dis-
tribution. These improvements in the quality of life, in particular the rise
in health standards, the spread of education and the availability of sub-
si.dized food have been important factors in the decline in mortality. The
increasing age of marriage, the spread of female education and employment,
and a vigorous family planning program, have also contributed to a sharp
decline in fertility. As a consequence, population growth, net of migration,
has dropped steadily, from 2.7% per annum in the 1953-63 period to 2.2% per
annum in the 1963-71 period, and 1.7% per annum during 1971-81.
7.        Favorable initial conditions induced these social gains.  Compul-
sory primary education was introduced as early as 1901. The food ration was
introduced in 1942. Thus, at the time of Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka
already enjoyed high levels of adult literacy and life expectancy. These
initial gains were consolidated and expanded in the post-independence
period through large expenditures on social services and the food subsidy,
expenditures which accounted for two-fifths to one-half of government
revenues in the 1960s and early 1970s. These expenditures were traditionally
financed by capturing the surpluses of the three major tree crops, which



-3-
provided the Government with easy sources of revenue and foreign exchange.
These surpluses began to decline in the late 1960s as government policies
discriminated against tree crops and export unit prices weakened. As growth
in other productive sectors also decelerated in the 1970-77 period, the
budgetary resources available for social programs were squeezed between
inelastic revenues and rapid inflation. As a consequence, expenditures for
social services other than the food subsidy began to decline as a proportion
of total current expenditures and of GDP, threatening the hard-won gains in
health and education. In short, the economy could no longer generate the
resources needed to sustain a large program of welfare expenditures.
Moreover, the very size of those programs reduced the scope for policy makers
to shift resources to development.
8.        The policy changes introduced in 1977, following the election of
the United National Party, were intended to break this vicious circle. The
new Government identified its objectives as the sustained revival and resus-
citation of the economy and increased employment through (i) increased
capacity utilization in the productive sectors, (ii) stimulation of savings
and investment, and (iii) efforts to encourage exports, and import substitu-
tion in foodgrains. A program of policy reforms was developed in close
consultation with the IMF. These reforms were supported initially by an IMF
standby arrangement covering 1978 for SDR 93 million. On January 26, 1979,
the Fund's Executive Board approved an SDR 260 million Extended Arrangement
to cover the 1979-81 period. The principal aim of the reform program was to
dismantle controls over resource allocation and initiate price adjustments
with a view to establishing more realistic relative prices. By 1980, these
goals had largely been achieved.
9.        The program of reforms comprised a number of major policy initia-
tives. The exchange rate was unified I/ on November 16, 1977, at a
depreciated rate of Rs 16 = US$1.00 and allowed to float.  This implied
a depreciation of 46% against the official rate prevailing prior to unifica-
tion, and 11.2% with respect to the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate
(FEEC) rate. The trade and payment regime was liberalized. Public sector
import monopolies were almost entirely terminated. Prior licensing of
imports was abolished for all but a handful of commodities. The tariff
structure was revised and simplified. Other budgetary taxes and subsidies
were adjusted to reflect the change in trade and exchange rate policies. In
particular, rice and sugar rations were confined to the poorer half of the
1/ Prior to unification, all exports other than tea, rubber, and coconut
products and all imports other than food, fertilizers, and drugs were
channelled through the certificate market. Since November 1972, the
FEEC rate was maintained at a 65% premium over the official rate.



-4-
population, and the food subsidy was eliminated through a series of adjust-
ments in administered prices. On September 1, 1979, the Government intro-
duced a system of food and kerosene stamps for families with monthly incomes
of less than Rs 300 to replace specific subsidies and food rationing, and
to target benefits to the poor. To help offset the adverse impact of these
changes on real incomes, public sector wages were periodically adjusted
upwards. Public corporations were asked to pass on cost increases, except
for fertilizer, petroleum, milk, and public transport, for which price
increases were initially deferred to cushion the impact on consumers. The
Government subsequently eliminated the overall subsidy on petroleum products
and made sizable adjustments in bus and train fares, electricity and fer-
tilizer prices. The burden of selected subsidies and transfers, as a conse-
quence, fell from around 9% of GDP in 1978 to around 5% in 1980. These
changes, and higher aid receipts, have helped permit a sizable increase in
capital expenditures.
10.       Agricultural pricing policies have changed dramatically.  The
domestic support price for paddy was increased by 21% in November 1977, by
25% in November 1980, and by a further 5% in February 1981 following a sub-
stantial increase in fertilizer prices. With the related increase in flour
prices, incentives for paddy and other flour substitutes benefited. At the
same time, there occurred a large policy-induced decline in the role of the
state in domestic rice trade. Fresh coconut prices were also increased and
the export duty on coconut products was appropriately adjusted. While the
unification of the exchange rate ended formal discrimination against tree
crops, high export duties, particularly on tea, continued to siphon off most
of the operating surplus for the Government. As tea prices fell and produc-
tion costs rose in 1978-79, the Government responded to the reduced producer
margins by lowering taxes on tea. The Government also ended most price
controls, and reformed the interest rate and tax systems. The burden of
company and personal taxation was lowered, and the taxation system was
rationalized to increase revenue elasticity; nevertheless, the overall
revenue elasticity to economic growth and domestic inflation remains low as
taxes on slowly growing tree crop exports have averaged over 30% of current
revenues. Interest rates were also raised sharply to encourage savings and
discourage speculative imports. However, inflation eroded these rates and in
April 1980 further upward adjustments were made.
11.       These economic reforms were accompanied by a major effort to step
up public investment. The Government's capital expenditures jumped from 6%
of GDP in 1977 to an average of 13% in 1978 and 1979, and 19% in 1980, as
government departments responded to the initial improvement in the budgetary
resource position and embarked on long overdue replacement investments and
new projects that had been shelved earlier for lack of resources. At the
same time, the Government undertook three major new programs which are to be
the lead projects in a five-year rolling public investment program. These
are: (i) accelerated implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga Development
Program, by far the largest multipurpose river basin development program ever



-5-
undertaken in Sri Lanka; (ii) a 200 square mile free trade zone north of
Colombo under a newly constituted Greater Colombo Economic Commission which
has established the first of several Investment promotions Zones near
Colombo's international airport and by end-1980 had signed agreements with 64
investors involving a total investment of US$130 million; and (iii) a massive
housing and urban renewal program with its main focus on the Colombo
metropolitan region, including the construction of a new capital complex at
Kotte, a suburb of Colombo. Budgetary expenditures on these three programs
will amount to Rs 34 billion, or 52% of projected budgetary resources over
the 1981-85 period. The underlying public investment strategy seeks to
balance the large investment requirements of the Government's high priority
programs with the urgent rehabilitation and fresh investment needs in other
sectors. The main thrust of the public sector program is to lay the founda-
tion for longer-term development, both by encouraging efficient use of exist-
ing infrastructure investments and by expanding the longer-term private
sector to respond to the economic reforms and the stimulus of the public
sector investment program, and provide much of the short-term growth.
Private fixed investment has so far responded well, increasing from about 7%
of GDP in 1977 to 15% by 1980, and helping overall fixed investment to exceed
33% of GDP in 1980.
12.       In response to the policy reforms and the accompanying acceleration
in investment, economic growth in 1978-80 averaged an impressive 6.8% per
annum. This growth was shared by almost all sectors of the economy, par-
ticularly construction and services. The only major exception has been the
tree crop sector. The impressive performance is due to a number of factors
including the improved availability of inputs following import liberaliza-
tion, an increased role for the private sector in distribution, and the
removal of price controls. Although there is little information available on
employment, Central Bank estimates suggest that unemployment dropped from 18%
of the labor force to 15% between 1977 and 1979.
13.       Despite this strong performance, major weaknesses in economic
performance emerged in 1980. In particular, the national savings effort has
not matched the rapid rise in investment. Gross national savings fluctuated
around 15% of GDP during the 1978-80 period, while recourse to foreign
savings to finance the higher investment rose from 4.5% of GDP in 1978 to
19.5% in 1980. Although the Government has succeeded in containing the
costly consumer subsidy and transfer programs, expenditures on which have
declined as a percent of GDP (para 9), relatively inelastic revenues combined
with steadily rising other recurrent expenditures and declining terms of
trade resulted in hardly any public savings over the 1978-80 period. As a
result, the Government has financed its rapidly rising capital expenditures
through foreign aid, and increased its domestic borrowings. Initially the
Government met its domestic financing requirements through non-expansionary
borrowings from captive financial institutions, which could mobilize
increased private savings following the interest rate reform. However,
resources mobilized through these channels have not grown as rapidly as the



-6-
budgetary deficit, and the Government has been increasingly forced to under-
take expansionary borrowings from the Central Bank. Between 1978 and 1979,
these rose from 0.4% to 1.2% of GDP and in 1980 increased sharply to 10.5% of
GDP.
14.       Inflation has also increased sharply since 1977.  The exchange rate
adjustment, the other policy-induced price increases and related wage
increases, the removal of price controls, and the build-up of external
assets, which added to the money supply, contributed significantly to infla-
tionary pressures in 1978 and 1979. However, these were moderated by bumper
paddy harvests, increased capacity utilization in the economy, increased
availability of imports, and the beneficial effects of competition from
imports and in domestic distribution. Since then, rapid growth in the broad
money supply--38% in 1979 and 32% in 1980--has added a sizable "built-in"
increase to the system. Together with the corrective price increases
designed to reduce budgetary subsidies and keep pace with rapid increases in
international petroleum, wheat and sugar prices, these pressures have caused
inflation (as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index) to accelerate
from an average of 11% in 1978 and 1979, to 26% in 1980.
15.       Rapid expansion in economic activity has been reflected most
vividly in the balance of payments. Import volume growth since 1978 has
averaged 15%. Between 1978 and 1980, the net petroleum import bill more than
tripled and increased from 11% to 36% of non-petroleum exports, while capital
goods imports more than doubled in response to the acceleration in invest-
ment. However, exports have shown barely any volume growth as declining tree
crop export volumes offset the strong growth in garments exports. These
adverse trade volume trends were compounded by a 20% terms of trade
deterioration over the same period. The rapid growth in tourism receipts and
private remittances from abroad in this period failed to offset the
deterioration on the trade account and the current account deficit rose from
$124 million (4.5% of GDP) to $805 million in 1980 (19.5% of GDP). In 1978
and 1979, rapidly rising non-monetary capital inflows due mainly to increased
net aid disbursements more than offset the current account deficit, and Sri
Lanka continued to add to its net international reserves, albeit at a declin-
ing rate. In 1980, however, net international reserves fell by $220 million,
and by end-1980 gross international reserves stood at $377 million, or equiv-
alent to less than nine weeks of imports of goods and non-factor services.
With the rapid drawdown in reserves, the public sector, especially the public
corporations, have begun to make significant use of commercial financing.
16.       The Government, realizing in early 1981 that continuation of the
1980 trends would risk continued high inflation and unsustainable pressures
on the balance of payments, took corrective steps. The 1981 budget proposes
to reduce government capital expenditures from 19% of GDP in 1980 to 14% of
GDP in 1981, and the overall budgetary deficit was reduced from 21% to 15%
between 1980 and 1981. In addition, the Government has moved to limit public
sector purchases of equipment and construction of new buildings and taken



-7-.
steps to raise additional resurces and impose a control mechanism over capi-
tal expenditures by public corporations. Preliminary indications are that
the adjustment measures taken in 1981 have succeeded in improving economic
performance, the overall budget deficit is estimated to have declined to 15%
of GDP. The current account deficit in the balance of payments to about 15%
of GDP, and average annual inflation to below 20%. Continued strong measures
will be required throughout the medium term to ensure that public sector
investment is consistent with available resources, as many of the large
development schemes the Government has initiated are only now gathering full
momentum.
17.       Aid donors have responded enthusiastically to the Government's
development initiatives, the average level of aid commitments in 1978-80 was
almost 120% higher in nominal terms and almost 40% higher in real terms than
in 1975-77. Most of the growth came in project aid, reflecting the Govern-
ment's efforts to increase investment, particularly in the Accelerated
Mahaweli Program. Since public investment is already overprogrammed, con-
tinued high levels of aid will depend upon donors' abilities to shift from
project to non-project aid and to finance a sizable portion of local costs;
the Government will need to maintain donor confidence in its economic
policies and management through a vigorous domestic resource mobilization
program and continued restraint on government expenditures. Despite recent
measures to support its investment program, Sri Lanka's budgetary situation
remains tight. The adverse impact on revenues of slowly rising export prices
and volumes, and rapidly rising import prices, has increased budgetary pres-
sures. Local cost financing, in support of Sri Lanka's own resource mobi-
lization efforts will not only provide valuable relief to these budgetary
pressures but also supplement foreign exchange resources needed in support
of balance of payments.
18.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed stood at US$1,335
million at the end of 1980, amounting to about 35% of GDP. However, this
is almost all long-term concessional debt. As a result, the debt service
burden is relatively low; debt service ratio in 1980 excluding IMF repur-
chases stood at 9.3% of exports of goods and non-factor services, declining
from 13.3% in 1977. While this sustained decline is due in part to improved
export earnings, the main cause has been a decline in outstanding short- and
medium-term commercial borrowings. Unless the ratio of the current account
deficit to GDP continues the improvement began in 1981, Sri Lanka will again
have to begin undertaking significant shorter maturity commercial borrowings
to fill the gap between the current account deficit and likely concessional
aid flows. In that case, the debt service ratio could increase quickly.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
19.       Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the
Bank Group has approved eight loans totalling US$72.9 million (net of cancel-
lations) and 25 credits denominated in US dollars totalling US$362 million
and 4 credits denominated in Special Drawing Rights totalling SDR 134.3
million (net of cancellations and exchange adjustments) in support of 35
projects. 1/ About 54% of Bank Group assistance has been for agriculture
(irrigation, agricultural, and dairy development), 13% for power, 12% for
transport, and the remainder for development finance company operations, a
program credit (mainly involving the import of raw materials for industry),
water supply, telecommunications and small and medium industries. Eight
loans and eight credits have been fully disbursed so far. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of September 30, 1981,
together with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       An IFC equity investment of about US$100,000 equivalent in the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) and two IFC lines of credit
totalling US$7.0 million have been made to the Government-owned Bank of
Ceylon (BOC). The first IFC loan to BOC, made effective in 1979, consisted
of US$2.0 million for term loans to firms with fixed assets of below Rs 6
million (US$385,000); the second IFC loan of US$5.0 million is geared to
larger enterprises with eligible subloans ranging from US$83,000 to US$1.0
million. IFC also approved an investment of US$3.68 million in a synthetic
textile mill, and US$986,000 in a polypropylene bag manufacturing plant in
FY79. During FY80, IFC approved an increase in equity investment of about
US$51,000 equivalent in DFCC and an investment of US$260,000 in an equipment
leasing company. In FY81, IFC approved an investment of about US$0.7 million
in equity and about US$17.0 million in loans for a new hotel project in
Colombo.
21.       The Bank Group's current strategy focusses on the agricultural
sector. It aims to support Government efforts to increase food production
and reduce dependence on food imports, and to raise productivity, employment,
incomes and living standards of the rural population in Sri Lanka. This
strategy includes projects to support basic infrastructure. In addition to
providing financing for the Second and Third Mahaweli Ganga Development
Projects and the Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project, the Bank Group
is assisting the Government to implement the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga
Development Program (Accelerated Mahaweli Program) principally through coor-
dinating external assistance. The Board approved the Second Small and Medium
Industries Project on October 13, 1981. Recently the appraisals of a second

Credit 174 (1970) are counted as two single projects.



-9-
tea rehabilitation project and an industrial sector credit have been com-
pleted.
22.       The Bank Group, as of end 1980, accounted for 9.7% (IBRD, 2.3%;
IDA, 7.4%) of Sri Lanka's total debt outstanding and disbursed, and 6.5%
(over 80% IBRD) of debt service on medium and long-term debt. The projected
Bank Group's share in total existing external debt outstanding and disbursed
will increase to 17% by 1985 (with the IBRD's share declining to 1.3%). The
Bank and IDA portions of this debt service are expected to decline to about
4% by 1985.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Power Source and Potential
23.       The source of most of Sri Lanka's energy at present is firewood,
which provides about 60% of the total energy, the rate of consumption being
estimated to be between 3.8 and 5.4 million tons per year. Although the per
capita use of wood has increased very little over the past fifteen years, the
absolute increase rose to a degree that there is now concern about deforesta-
tion. There are no known reserves of coal, oil or natural gas. Exploration
off the northwest shore is in progress, but the likelihood of substantial
finds is small. The sole importer and refiner of petroleum and its products
is Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Its refinery has a capacity of 2.35
million tons per year and produces enough gasoline for the country, but part
of the needs for diesel and kerosene are imported. More heavy furnace oil is
produced than the domestic market needs, the surplus being exported as bunker
fuel. Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), though not important at present, is in
excess supply, and as it is relatively cheap, its use is likely to increase.
24.       The total potential for hydro energy in the country is estimated at
6,600 GWh per year. The firm energy available from existing hydro develop-
ments is about 1,500 GWh per year, and the additions now planned will
increase it to about 3,240 GWh by 1990. A ranking study of all remaining
hydro sites is planned.
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)
25.       CEB is a public corporation, established in 1969 to replace the
Department of Government Electrical Undertakings. It is governed by a seven
member Board appointed by GOSL. GOSL controls tariffs, capital investment,
borrowing, the appointment of the Chairman and the General Manager, and the
conditions of service of all employees. CEB is subject to the provisions of
the 1971 Finance Act regulating the finances of public corporations. CEB has



-10-
adequate organization and management systems designed by international con-
sultants in 1973 under the Fourth Power Project (1969)1/. However, its
managerial effectiveness, in recent years, has declined. A program of
measures for improvement of management and training is currently in place
(paras 55 and 56).
Generation and Transmission
26.     CEB is responsible for the transmission and distribution of elec-
tricity in the country and for the development of its own generating
capacity, except for the construction of the Ukuwela station on the Mahaweli
Ganga. CEB's recent generation program has included two hydro stations of 40
MW at Bowatenne (commissioned last year) and of 60 MW at Canyon (scheduled
for commissioning th4s year). In all CEB has 499 MW of installed generating
capacity, of which 369 MW is in eight hydro plants and the balance in steam
turbine, gas turbine and diesel stations. The main transmission system,
extending over 569 miles, operates at 132 kV but there is also an older 66 kV
system (214 miles). Subtransmission and distribution lines at 33 kV extend
to about 3,250 miles, and there are about 750 miles of 11 kV overhead dis-
tribution lines, whereas in the city of Colombo the distribution is mainly by
underground cables.
27.     The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), which is an agency under
the Ministry of Mahaweli Development for implementing a multi-purpose
accelerated program for construction of dams, hydro stations and irrigation
works, is responsible for the construction works at Victoria, Kotmale, and
Randenigala. As each hydro component under this program is completed, it
will be transferred to CEB for operation. The Victoria (210 MW) and Kotmale
(201 MW) hydro stations, now under construction, are scheduled to come on
stream in 1984 and 1985 respectively. Construction works on Randenigala
project (122 MW) is scheduled to start this year. Recently, satisfactory
preliminary terms for the transfer of hydro stations at Victoria and Kotmale
were agreed between MASL and CEB. There are a number of privately owned
generating plants but, except for one at the CPC refinery, these are mainly
for standby purposes.  A large captive generating plant is planned for the
extended cement factory at Chunnakam. Some Local Authorities in remote areas
provide part time electricity service from diesel generators.
Electricity Consumption
28.    The consumption of electrical energy increased at an average annual
rate of 9.5% from 1961 to 1980, varying from 17.8% in 1966 to 3.3% in 1974.
Growth was weak from 1972 to 1977, but with the resumption of economic growth
in the last three years (1977-80) it averaged 11.5% per annum despite the
1/ Loan 636-CE (US$21.0 million)



-11-
severe load shedding. CEB forecasts that annual growth will continue at
about 15% in the immediate future with some tapering off to about 9% after
1985.
Electricity Supply
29.       In 1980, CEB was supplying electricity directly to about 208,000
consumers. In addition, CEB sells in bulk to 218 Local Authorities who
retail to about 226,000 consumers, making a total of about 434,000. Elec-
tricity consumption in 1980 was less than 100 kWh per capita. The total
energy generated by CEB's power stations in 1980 was 1,668 GWh, against the
estimated requirement of 1,728 GWh. Load shedding was inevitable during 1980
(May-August) and 1981 (February-June) due to lower than average rainfall, and
the breakdown of a hydro unit.
Rural Electrification
30.       Rural electrification, at present, is available to about 2,000 of
Sri Lanka's 25,000 villages. Under a rural electrification project financed
by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), CEB has planned to provide connections
to additional 1,150 villages by 1984 and to arrange financing of house wiring
and connection charges by instalment payments. A load promotion and monitor-
ing unit will also be introduced in CEB under this project.
Development Program
31.       CEB's generation program through 1990 is dominated by the
Accelerated Mahaweli Program which calls for the addition of about 600 MW of
hydro generating capacity to CEB's system. In order to prevent capacity and
energy shortages before enough new hydro stations - Canyon, Victoria and
Kotmale - are commissioned, CEB installed six 20 MW of gas turbines in two
phases during 1980 and 1981. To meet further energy needs through 1985, CEB
undertook a study in early 1981 to determine the least cost solution and as a
result GOSL and CEB have decided to install an 80 MW diesel plant, for which
GOSL has requested IDA financing.
32.       CEB is also preparing a long term (15 years) master plan for power
generation, transmission and distribution on a least cost basis. CEB will
submit this plan, endorsed by GOSL, to the Associaton by December 31, 1982,
and thereafter update it annually (Section 3.06, draft Project Agreement
(PA)).
33.       Studies of the transmission system by CEB's engineers in 1979
indicated that a voltage higher than 132 kV would be necessary to handle the
flows of power to be expected from Mahaweli developments in the mid-1980s.
This finding was confirmed by consultants who recommended the use of 220 kV
lines from the Victoria-Kotmale-Randenigala/Rantembe areas to the load cen-
ters of Colombo. Future expansion of the grid will proceed on that basis.



-12-
Sector Coordination
34.     Recognizing CEB's potential role in the overall development of the
power sector, IDA has continued to emphasize the need for adequate coordina-
tion between CEB and other agencies, particularly MASL, involved in the
preparation, design and construction of any "joint scheme". 1/ The level of
coordination between CEB and MASL presently is limited to technical matters.
Under the proposed Credit, provision has been made for GOSL to ensure proper
coordination between CEB, MASL and any other agency associated with any joint
scheme (Section 3.02(a), Draft Development Credit Agreement (DCA).
The Bank Group's Role and External Assistance
35.       Between 1954 and 1969, the Bank made four loans totalling US$58.4
million for power development in Sri Lanka. The first three were made to
GOSL and the fourth (1969) to the newly established CEB. In 1969 the Bank
and IDA extended US$29.0 million2/ for a multi-purpose development on the
Mahaweli, which included the construction of the Ukuwela hydro (38 MW) sta-
tion now operated by CEB. These loans and the credit helped establish a
total generating capacity of 203 MW, of which, 153 MW was hydro and 50 MW
thermal. The Bank Group's involvement in transmission and distribution
started with an IDA credit of US$6.0 million (Fifth Power Project)3/ in 1973
followed by another credit of US$19.5 million in 1980 (Sixth Power Project)
4/ for further reinforcement and improvement of transmission and distribution
systems.
36.       Physical implementaton of previous projects has been satisfactory.
Recent Project Performance Audit Reports for the Fourth (1969) and the Fifth
(1973) Power Projects and the Mahaweli Multipurpose Project (1969) expressed
satisfaction about the implementation and initial operation of these
projects. An organizational structure and appropriate public utility manage-
ment and financial systems were developed by consultants financed under the
Fourth Power Project. Severe staffing difficulties in recent years and the
lack of adequate management training for senior management have prevented the

purposes as defined under the Ceylon Electricity Board Act.

was a feature of the Sixth Power Project (1980) and also forms an important
part of the proposed project (para 56).
37.       ADB has provided financing for the Bowatenne and Canyon hydro
stations, and for rural electrification (para 30). GOSL has arranged
bilateral financing for the Mahaweli hydro stations; from UK for Victoria and
from the Federal Republic of Germany for Randenigala; it is using Swedish
import support credit funds for the partial financing of the Kotmale project.
A 220 kV transmission line from Randenigala-Rantembe to Victoria is being
financed under German aid as part of the Randenigala project. The
UK-assisted Victoria hydro project includes a 220 kV transmission link from
Victoria to Kotmale. As the transmission line linking Kotmale to the prin-
cipal load centers in the Colombo area is not covered under the above men-
tioned bilateral assistance for the Accelerated Mahaweli Program, GOSL
requested IDA's assistance.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The proposed project was prepared by CEB with assistance from
consultants and was appraised in May/June 1981. The Staff Appraisal Report
entitled "Seventh (Mahaweli Transmission) Power Project" (No.3599a-CE dated
January 21, 1982) is being distributed separately. A timetable of key events
relating to the project and special conditions of the proposed Credit are
given in Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington from November
16-20, 1981. GOSL and CEB were represented by a delegation headed by Profes-
sor K.K.Y.W. Perera, Secretary, Ministry of Energy and Power.
Project Objectives
39.       The main objective of the project is to deliver at minimum cost the
output from hydro stations in the Mahaweli basin to the principal load cen-
ters in the Colombo area and to establish the first elements of a 220 kV grid
that will eventually cover much of the country. It would also help improve
the reliability of the existing 66 kV network. The projet also helps build
on the institutional capabilities developed under the earlier projects and
provides for better coordination within the power sector.
Project Description
40.       The proposed project consists of the following components:
(a) 126 km of 220 kV double circuit transmission line from
Kotmale to the load centers around Colombo and 38 km of
132 kV single circuit transmission line from Rantembe
to Badulla;



-14-
(b) one new 220/132 kV substation, extensions to three existing
132 kV substations, one new 132 kV switching station and
extensions to an existing 66 kV substation;
(c) replacement of circuit breakers with new ones of higher
rupturing capacity;
(d) equipment for power factor correction, power line carrier,
and for a loss reduction cell;
(e) vehicles, tools and buildings; and
(f) engineering consultancy services, technical assistance and
training.
Project Implementation
41.       CEB will be responsible for the implementation of the proposed
project. CEB's engineers have worked closely with experienced consultants,
appointed under the Sixth Power Project (1980), on the conceptual design and
specifications to ensure that the newly introduced 220 kV lines would even-
tually evolve into a 220 kV grid covering much of the country. Consultancy
services will be extended to include the supervision of construction. The
cost of engineering consultancy services is estimated at US$1.3 million based
on 140 man-months of foreign engineering services at an average cost of
US$9,300 per man-month to cover international travel, subsistence, allowances
and reimbursable foreign costs.
Project Cost and Financing, and Relending
42.       The total project cost is estimated at about US$76.3 million equiv-
alent (including customs duties of about US$12.1 million equivalent) with a
foreign exchange component of US$46.8 million. The estimates are based on
1981 prices. Price contingencies have been estimated assuming annual infla-
tion of 23% for 1981, 17% for 1982, 14% for 1983, 12% for 1984 and 10% there-
after for local costs; and 9% for 1981, 8.5% for 1982, 8% for 1983, 7.5% for
1984 and 7% thereafter for foreign costs. Physical contingencies average
10%. The proposed Credit of US$36.0 million equivalent, together with the
proposed OPEC Fund Loan (US$11.0 million equivalent), would finance the full
foreign exchange cost (about 73% of total project cost excluding duties), and
a small amount (US$0.2 million equivalent) of local cost for training (para
55). The remaining local costs, amounting to about US$29.3 million equiv-
alent, would be funded by CEB from internal cash generation. Satisfactory
arrangements for financing by the OPEC Fund is a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed Credit (Section 5.01(c), draft DCA).
43.       The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be onlent to CEB with interest
at 12% per annum, for a period of twenty years including 3 years of grace,



-15-
with GOSL bearing the foreign exchange risk. The execution of the subsidiary
loan agreement between GOSL and CEB is a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed Credit (Section 5.01(b), draft DCA).
44.       The average annual rate of inflation as measured by the GDP
deflator rose sharply after 1978, reaching 24% in 1980. In early 1981, GOSL
took a series of adjustment measures which succeeded in reversing the trend
and reducing estimated inflation in 1981 to about 20%. GOSL is expected to
continue and strengthen the adjustment measures, leading to a further
decrease in inflation to about 10% by 1985, implying a 2% real interest rate
at this time. GOSL does have a policy of maintaining positive real interest
rates over the medium term. Current inflation is largely a result of
policy-induced price adjustments in administered prices, short-term
demand-supply imbalances in certain sectors, most notably construction, as
well as imported inflation. The Sri Lankan authorities expect production to
continue to respond positively to the price changes and the liberalization of
the economy, and together with a tight rein on government budgetary deficits
and credit expansion, cause the gradual slowdown in the rate of inflation.
Procurement and Disbursements
45.       The 220 kV and 132 kV lines will be constructed under one single
responsibility contract, while all substations and switching stations will be
covered by another contract. There will be major contracts for power trans-
formers, replacement of circuit breakers and power line carrier equipment,
and a number of relatively minor supply contracts for other materials. All
major components to be financed by IDA and the OPEC Fund will be procured
under international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's guidelines.
Vehicles, equipment and materials estimated to cost less than US$15,000
equivalent per item may be procured in accordance with local procedures,
which are satisfactory to IDA, but not exceeding US$150,000 equivalent in
aggregate. For materials and equipment tendered internationally, the stand-
ard domestic preference of 15% on the c.i.f. price or the prevailing duty,
whichever is less, will be applied in bid evaluation.
46.       The Credit will be disbursed on the basis of 100% of the foreign
expenditures for 220 kV and 132 kV transmission lines; 100% of foreign expen-
ditures for directly imported items, or 100% of the local expenditure
(ex-factory) for locally manufactured items, or 65% for locally procured
items (equipment and materials for power transformers, power line carrier,
loss reduction program, and vehicles and tools); 100% of foreign expenditures
on engineering consultants, technical assistance, and training. The OPEC
Fund loan will be disbursed against the foreign expenditures for substations
and replacement of circuit breakers.



-16-
Tariffs and Finances
47.     Tariffs:  CEB has satisfactorily revalued its fixed assets up to
1980, in accordance with an index-linked formula agreed with IDA. As the
Government did not authorize tariff increases, CEB was unable to achieve the
8% rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets in operation from 1974
to 1978 as required under the Fifth Power project (1973). The present
Government which came in power in late 1977, has authorised two tariff
increases, the first on December 1, 1978 and the second on October 1, 1980.
As a result of these increases, CEB's average tariff rose from Rs 0.16/kWh to
0.58/kWh (about 3 US cents).l/ Its financial rate of return on revalued
assets, having declined from 7% in 1974 to 2% in 1978, increased to about 9%
in 1980 and is estimated at about 11% in FY81. Since October 1980, CEB is
also recovering automatically each month from its consumers the costs of fuel
for its increasing thermal generation. However, over 90% of domestic con-
sumers, whose monthly consumption is below 200 kWh (equivalent to a maximum
charge of US$5), are exempt from the fuel surcharge.
48.       CEB will continue to review its tariffs annually before the start
of each financial year to ensure that revenues are sufficient to meet operat-
ing expenses and to produce a rate of return of at least 8% on currently
valued net fixed assets (Section 4.04(a), draft PA). While CEB's rate of
return on its currently valued net fixed assets is estimated at 11% in FY81,
CEB will have to increase tariffs by about 50% in FY82 (equivalent to 12%
rate of return) to meet the local cost of its approved investment program
through FY85. This increase in tariffs is a condition of credit effective-
ness (Section 5.01(e), draft DCA).
49.     Tariff Structure:  In addition to increases in tariff levels, which
have enabled CEB to meet its financial rate of return commitment, CEB has
made some improvements to its tariff structure. Domestic consumers now pay
higher block tariffs and non-domestic tariffs have been rationalized. CEB
agreed under the Sixth Power Project (1980) to carry out a study of long-run
marginal cost (LRMC) pricing and review its tariff structure by December 31,
1980 and, thereafter to implement any structural improvements agreed with IDA
and GOSL. Due to some initial delays brought about by staffing problems in
CEB, IDA agreed to defer the completion date to end-December, 1981. Prelimi-
nary results of the study have been reviewed by IDA and CEB has been advised
to make some revisions. The recommendations of the study will be presented
shortly to GOSL for approval after consultation with IDA.
1/ With the addition of fuel surcharge, the average tariff was equivalent
to about US cents 6 per kWh in 1981.



-17-
50.       CEB's 1980 unaudited accounts indicate a satisfactory debt/equity
ratio of 20:80 with debt service covered 7.3 times by earnings. The current
ratio of 3.3 is relatively high but will fall to a more satisfactory level
(about two times) in the 1980s. The level of inventories, which, at end
1979, was found to be equivalent of 18 months' need, was high. CEB is
required to reduce inventories, to a level satisfactory to IDA, by December
31, 1982, while GOSL also agreed to ensure the timely availability of foreign
exchange for inventories. Based on a review of materials management problems
by CEB's consultants, action is being taken to improve controls. Covenants
similar to those in the Sixth Power Project relating to provision of foreign
exchange and reduction of inventory levels are provided under the proposed
project (Section 3.03(a), draft DCA; Section 4.07, draft PA).
51.       Future Finances:  CEB's presently approved investment program for
FY81-FY85 comprises mainly hydro generation and rural electrifiation
(ADB-assisted), and transmission and distribution (IDA-assisted). The
program includes an addition of 80 MW diesel plant which has also been
endorsed by GOSL with a commitment to contribute Rs 800 million in equity.
Total financing required for the program is estimated at US$431.0 million
equivalent. About 46% of this total is projected to be met by CEB through
its internal resources.
52.       CEB's long term finances through 1988 are satisfactory.  CEB will
probably become liable to pay income tax in FYs82 and 83 following recent
changes in tax legislation. CEB's debt/equity ratio will increase from 18/82
in 1981 to 44/56 in 1988 following the transfer of assets under the
Accelerated Mahaweli Program. The current ratio is expected to remain satis-
factory falling from about 2.7 in 1981 to 1.9 by 1988. Debt service coverage
of at least 1.25 times as required under the Sixth Power Project will con-
tinue under the proposed Credit (Section 4.03, draft PA).
53.       Billing and Collection:  In recent years CEB's billing and collec-
tion performance has been satisfactory except for the collection from the
Local Authorities. CEB is required, under the Sixth Power Project (1980), to
ensure that consumer receivables do not exceed the equivalent of three months
billings. At December 31, 1980, the figure was 3.2 months as against 3.6
months at end 1978, during which time CEB's revenues have quadrupled. CEB's
present obligation will continue under the proposed credit (Section 4.05,
draft PA). In view of the difficult financial situation of the Local
Authorities, GOSL undertook to cover the difference between the effective
tariff charged by the CEB and the lower rate paid by the Local Authorities
since December 1978. As of March 31, 1981, the obligation of GOSL in this
respect amounted to Rs 200 million. This has now been paid in full by GOSL
to CEB, and a decision has been made for the Local Authorities to pay full
CEB tariffs as of October 1, 1981. GOSL will pay to CEB the balance of Rs
108 million on Local Authorities' account through September 30, 1981. Set-
tlement of these arrears by GOSL is a condition of effectiveness (Section
5.01(d), draft DCA). GOSL will ensure that the Local Authorities pay the



-18-
current CEB tariff and also introduce retail tariffs sufficient to cover
CEB's bills for bulk supply and their own costs of distribution as well
(Section 3.04, draft DCA).
Institutional Development
54.     Staff:  Currently, CEB's employees total about 11,000 against an
authorized strength of about 14,000. Over the period 1975 to 1980, the
number of employees increased at an average annual rate of about 5%, a ratio
of one employee to 15 consumers, which is reasonable considering CEB's
expanding work program and particularly the rural electrification program
undertaken by force account. In common with other public corporations, CEB
has considerable difficulty in retaining experienced staff in recent years as
many engineers and accountants have left for overseas or for the private
sector which offer substantially higher salaries. Nevertheless, CEB has
recently been able to fill a number of key finance posts.
55.       Training:  CEB's present training facilities are inadequate in
relation to the number of employees trained. Managerial training for
engineers, on-the-job training for newly recruited engineers, and training
for accounting staff in CEB's financial operations are some of the critical
areas presently identified to be covered by the training program proposed
under the project, having been prepared under terms of the Sixth Power
Project. Financing of this program includes a sum of US$200,000 to cover the
local costs of the program mainly to ensure against implementation delays.
56..       Management Systems:  Comprehensive reporting, accounting and
budgeting systems were introduced by CEB in 1973 based on recommendations of
consultants financed under the Fourth Power Project (1969). The systems are
satisfactory, but in recent years, financial and management information
reports had not been produced on a regular and timely basis. This has
reduced management effectiveness and control. CEB agreed under the Sixth
Power Project (1980) to implement a program of management improvements.
Accordingly, the management consultants who designed the original systems
were recalled to review the position. They have now recommended a program of
measures to restore managerial effectiveness which covers (a) general manage-
ment advice, (b) restoration and further development of CEB's system, and (c)
a training program. CEB, therefore, has decided to retain the management
consultants further to implement their recommendations. Funding for this
assignment is available under the Sixth Power project.
57.       Reorganization:CEB's present organization originally designed by
the consultants under the Fourth Power Project is basically unchanged except
for a few modifications made in recent years. Changes now being contemplated
as part of the management improvement aim at further decentralization of
CEB's operations while retaining key controls at headquarters in Colombo.
The assurance obtained under the Sixth Power Project that CEB will submit to



-19-
IDA, in advance, any proposal for major organizational change, will continue
under the proposed Credit (Section 3.03, draft PA).
58.      System Improvement:  Maintenance of CEB's generating stations was
satisfactory in the past, but has deteriorated in recent years; maintenance
schedules are not kept up to date for each station to permit management to
ensure satisfactory servicing. Distribution systems have had too many con-
sumers added to them without corresponding reinforcement, and have not been
well maintained. Before 1976, energy losses on CEB's system were recorded at
less than 12%, but in 1977 they started to increase and are now estimated at
about 16%. As a part of agreed plans to improve CEB's management (para 56),
CEB will investigate system losses and undertake a study of load management
and conservation.
59.       Benefits and Risks:  The proposed project is an integral part of
the total power sector investment program in Sri Lanka, incorporating CEB's
expenditure on generation, transmission and distribution and hydroelectric
stations under the Accelerated Mahaweli Program. It is the critical link
conveying the additional power to be generated at Randenigala, Victoria and
Kotmale to the load centers. The rate of return on the small incremental
investment would be extremely high. However, the method employed in this
report is one of justifying the entire investment program including the
proposed project and recognizes all inherent costs.
60.       The economic justification involves quantifying benefits by using
the cost and extent of use of alternative energy sources for economic
activity and for lighting. On this basis, the best estimate of the economic
rate of return is about 14%. Based on the overall feasibility of the invest-
ment program, the project is justified as a necessary part of the program.
61.       The project consists of normal electric utility work entailing no
unusual risks and no particular difficulty is foreseen in its execution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and IDA, the draft Project Agreement between
IDA and the Ceylon Electricity Board, and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
63.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Conditions of effectiveness (Section 5.01, draft DCA) include:
(a) satisfactory arrangements for financing by the OPEC Fund, (b) execution
of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and CEB, (c) an



-20-
increase of tariff by about 50% over the existing average tariff, and (d)
payment by GOSL of the arrears on the Local Authorities account through
September 30, 1981.
64.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
65.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

D.   STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 1981 1/
Cr. No. 504 -  Dairy Development Project; US$9.0 million of August 9, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
Project focus has been shifted from the provision of credit for
cattle purchase and on-farm development to the establishment of Dairy Producer
Associations along the lines of the successful Anand pattern in India. The
closing date was extended by one year to permit Credit proceeds to be used to
finance the feasibility study for a proposed milk processing plant near Kandy.
The extension was also intended to provide IDA with the opportunity to con-
tinue its dialogue with the Government on the milk price/subsidy issue. The
consultants report recommended a plant costing about US$16.0 million, which
the Government considers too large. In view of this, the overall poor per-
formance of the project, and lack of progress on milk price/subsidy issue,
it has been decided not to extend the present closing date.
Cr. No. 666 - Tank Irrigation Modernization Project; US$5.0 million of
January 12, 1977; Effective Date: April 12, 1977;
C~losing Date: June 30, 1983
Excellent progress has been made on the progress of the project
during the last six months. The staff and equipment provided are capable
and adequate to complete the project by end 1982 if required local funds
are made available by the Government as needed. However, the Government
currently is experiencing a severe shortfall of local funds and most Depart-
mental budgets have been sharply reduced (average of 25-35%). The water
management program initiated during the last maha season went very well (in
fact, the program averted a complete crop failure which would have occurred
due to drought conditions) and farmers reaction to it was good. A similar
program will be introduced in the other four tanks during the next maha
season.
Cr. No. 701 - Mahaweli Ganga Development II Project; US$19.0 million
of June 27, 1977; Effective Date: December 29, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
Project implementation slowed somewhat during the last quarter of
1980 and 1981, due primarily to the shortage of local funds for the project.
Management problems and the turning over of settlement and operation and
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

maintenance responsibilities to Mahaweli Authority from Mahaweli Development
Board have also contributed to a slowing of work activities. The Government
has agreed to provide sufficient funds in 1981 and 1982 for project imple-
mentation. Despite the above temporary setback, about 85% of the irrigation
works and 40% of irrigation infrastructure have been completed. Also, over
80% of the farms have now been settled. The farmer settlers appear, for the
most part, to be satisfied with their new farms and with the project. The
project is expected to be completed by end-1982.
Cr. No. 709 - Water Supply Project; US$9.2 million of June 30, 1977;
Effective Date: February 8, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
The Project has made good progress in the procurement of equipment
and materials and in the construction of civil works. The IDA Credit and
the IDA administered CIDA Credit are almost entirely disbursed. Financial
Management of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (WDB) has improved
with WDB now producing the financial information required for management.
WDB's progress in implementing consumer metering is unsatisfactory. It has
recently taken steps to accelerate the program.
Cr. No. 742 - Fourth Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Project;
US$8.0 million of September 30, 1977; Effective Date:
December 16, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
DFCC's management problems have improved under the new General
Manager, although problems at the Board of Directors level still persist.
DFCC's capitalization and hence its exposure limite are to be expanded by
means of an increase in its issued share capital from Rs 24 million to Rs
60 million. Credit 742-CE has been fully committed and all disbursements
are expected to be completed by end February 1982.
Cr. No. 818 - Tree Crop Rehabilitation (Tea) Project; US$21.0 million
of July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 28, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
Project progress is close to target for field work, in spite of
severe drought in early 1980. Housing and health components are behind
schedule. Consultants have been engaged to help implement these components.
Tea margins have deteriorated due to doubling of tea fertilizer prices. The
Government is expected to take compensatory measures to restore tea margins.
Cr. No. 819 - Tree Crop Diversification (Tea) Project; US$4.5 million
of July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 15, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
Despite some delay in procurement of equipment, progress in field
work is impressive. Cluster selection and homestead and farm demarcation,
and soil conservation work have been completed. About 2,000 settlers have
occupied their houses. Farm planting schedule was disrupted by the severe
and prolonged drought last year. With better conditions this year, all
plantings are expected to be completed by end-1981.

Cr. No. 891 - Kurunegala Rural Development Project; US$20.0 million
of April 26, 1979; Effective Date: August 27, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project is generally on schedule; rural electrification works
have already been completed; and rural roads and education works should be
completed by the end of the year. Problems on quality of construction of
irrigation and education works were identified at early stage of project imple-
mentation. Supervisory consultants, appointed for the Second Rural Development
Project (Cr. No. 1079), will help improve construction activities.  Improve-
ments on the institutional arrangements for agricultural credit and agricul-
tural extension are somewhat slower than expected. High cost overruns were
noted in nearly all project components. Efforts are being made to cut down
cost by introducing farmers donated labor for some of the activities.
Cr. No. 900 - Road Maintenance Project; US$16.5 million of June 22, 1979;
Effective Date: December 19, 1979; Closing Date: June 30,
19_84
A general 25% reduction in budget allocations for the present finan-
cial year, followed by a further 10%, has meant a rescheduling of proposed
expenditures for the project. This has been possible without sacrificing
principal project objectives but at the cost of deferring major rehabilitation
work until towards the end of the project. Meantime, institution building and
introduction of improved road maintenance methods continue, and providing it
is possible for Government to provide increased funds for subsequent years,
project completion is expected by March 1984, six months later than planned
at appraisal.
Cr. No. 931 - Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project; US$15.5
million of July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 4, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
Implementation during the first year has been slower than anticipated
due to delays in procurement and staffing. Recently, however, most full time
staff have been recruited and procurement of vehicles and equipment are underway.
With these, implementation is likely to improve. Civil works are progressing
satisfactorily. Some questions have been raised as to the feasibility of
operating the T&V method of extension in the wet zones dominated by tree crops,
absentee landlord and inadequate infrastructure. These and other implementa-
tion issues are under review by IDA and the Government.
Cr. No. 942 - Small and Medium Industries Project; US$16.0 million
of July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 23, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The principal objectives of the project would be to encourage and
assist growth and productivity improvement of small and medium firms, defined
as enterprises having plant and equipment valued at less than Rs 1 million,

so as to increase their contribution to efficient low cost employment creation,
export expansion, regional development and economic growth. About 80% of the
total subloan amount has been committed, and disbursements which have acceler-
ated during the last six months, are expected to be completed one year ahead
of schedule. Most technical and marketing service assistance activities have
been launched.
Cr. No. 979 - Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project; US3.0 million of
April 16, 1980; Effective Date: July 7, 1980; Closing Date:
September 30, 1982.
The consultants for System C has completed the contract assignment
and departed Sri Lanka. The consultants for the Transbasin Diversion Study
completed the Planning Report for the study in June 1981 and distributed copies
for review. The consultant's work has been somewhat delayed by the lengthy
review of mid-term Planning Report. The effects of this delay, together with
the possible extension of the consultants TOR to study possible transfer of
water to the Gal Oya Basin, may delay the completion of the Final Report by
6-8 weeks and entail added work of 6-7 man months.
Cr. No. 994 - Road Passenger Transport Project; US$53 million of April 16,
1980; Effective Date: October 27, 1980; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
Consultants have commenced work in the fields of procurement,
industrial engineering and accounting and route planning. Procurement is
lagging about 18 months behind appraisal estimates. No disbursements have
been made except for consultancy services. Because of the present delays,
the original plan of 2,100 bus chassis is unlikely to be accomplished either
in time or within the project costs. Current indications are that only
1,600 new buses will be put into service during the project period.
Cr. No. 1017 - Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project; US$16.0 million;
Effective Date: September 10, 1980; Closing Date: June 30,
1986.
The project continues to make satisfactory progress, most of the
proposed institutional reorganization has been completed. The replanting
target for 1981 season is expected to be met. Response by farmers to par-
ticipate in replanting under the project has been highly satisfactory. The
training component has been slightly delayed due to difficulty in finding
suitable consultants.
Cr. No. 1020 - Telecommunications Project; US$30.0 million of June 24, 1980;
Effective Date: September 10, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
The Government has already established a separate Telecommunications
Department as part of organizational improvements under the project. The
Government has also increased overseas telephone and telex rates. Procurement
is about two to three months behind schedule but otherwise proceeding well in
accordance with the revised schedule.

Cr. No. 1041 - Water Supply and Sewerage II Project; US$30.0 million of
September 24, 1980; Effective Date: February 26, 1981;
Closing Date: September 30, 1985.
WDB has appointed engineering consultants to supervise the construc-
tion of the sewerage works under the Project and the financial consultants for
completion of WDB's organization management and financial study. The project
expenditures have been rephased to reflect the reduction in local resource
allocation during the current year.
Cr. No. 1048 - Sixth Power Project; US$19.5 million of September 24, 1980
Effective Date: March 30, 1981; Closing Date: March 31, 1985.
Procurement is proceeding satisfactorily; tender documents for
four of the five contracts to be financed by IDA have been advertised. An
agreement for cofinancing in the amount of US$20.0 million was signed between
the Government and Saudi Fund for Development on January 8, 1981. The average
tariff for power supplied by the Ceylon Electricity Board was increased from
about Rs 0.30 to Rs 0.58/kWh on October 1, 1980. The first phase of manage-
ment consultancy has been completed and engineering consultants have been
appointed to design the project components to be financed by the Saudi Fund.
Cr. No. 1079 - Second Rural Development Project; US$33.5 million of February 2,
1981; Effective Date: June 2, 1981; Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
The project is making satisfactory progress during the initial period
of project implementation. Supervisory consultants have been appointed and
procurement of essential vehicles and equipment initiated.
Cr. No. 1130 - Construction Industry Project; US$13.5 million of June 1, 1981;
Effective Date: August 19, 1981; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
Consultants have already been appointed and begun their work. The
Project Director has also been appointed. Satisfactory progress has been
achieved in the preliminary works for project implementation.
Cr. No. 1160 - Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Project; US$30.0 million of
July 15, 1981: Effective Date: September 24, 1981;
Closing Date: December 31, 1986.
Project start has been satisfactory.
Cr. No. 1166 - Mahaweli Ganga Development Project III; US$90.0 million;
not yet signed; Closing Date: December 31, 1986.
