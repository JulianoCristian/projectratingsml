                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project will support the development of the institutional capacity of the Comisi Nacional de Bancos y Seguros (CNBS) and the Banco Central de
                         Honduras (BCH) to address vulnerabilities of the Honduran financial system. In this context, the project development objective is capacity-building for dealing
                         with weaknesses of the banking system, a prerequisite for sustainable growthand poverty alleviation. The project would achieve this objective by providing
                         technical assistance for: (i) the design and implementation of a banking sector consolidation program, (ii) the reform of the payments system, and (iii) the
                         improvement of selected aspects of the financial system infrastructure. A financial sector adjustment operation is planned in FY04 to complement the proposed
                         technical assistance operation and achieve the objectives defined in the Country Assistance Strategy.
