The objective of the Project was\n            to assist the Borrower to develop the institutional capacity\n            it requires to be able to address the systemic\n            vulnerabilities of its financial system, through: (a) the\n            design and implementation of a banking sector consolidation\n            program; (b) the reform of the Borrower's payment\n            system; and (c) the improvement of selected aspects of the\n            Borrower's financial system infrastructure. The\n            principal lessons learned for Project design and\n            implementation are as follows: (i) in an environment of\n            limited implementation capacity, Project design should be as\n            simple as possible; (ii) the largest project component in\n            terms of financing, the modernization of the payment system,\n            suffered from an incomplete and superficial diagnostic at\n            inception and an overly complex design.; (iii) in low-income\n            countries with limited implementation capacity, it is\n            critical to plan for and expect longer-term International\n            Development Association (IDA) engagements since these\n            Projects often encounter adverse circumstances and delays;\n            and (iv) IDA should agree up-front with government on the\n            size and composition of the Project Coordination Unit  (PCU)\n            as well as the minimum experience and qualifications for\n            each position."}, "docdt": "2013-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
