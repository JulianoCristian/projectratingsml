                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project will support the development of the institutional capacity of the Comisi Nacional de Bancos y Seguros (CNBS) and the Banco Central de
                         Honduras (BCH) to address vulnerabilities of the Honduran financial system. In this context, the project development objective is capacity-building for dealing
                         with weaknesses of the banking system, a prerequisite for sustainable growth and poverty alleviation. The project would achieve this objective by providing
                         technical assistance for: (i) the design and implementation of a banking sector consolidation program, (ii) the reform of the payments system, and (iii) the
                         improvement of selected aspects of the financial system infrastructure. A financial sector adjustment operation is planned in FY04 to complement the proposed
                         technical assistance operation and achieve the objectives defined in the Country Assistance Strategy.

                         In most areas, the project is advancing on schedule. Aside of minor delays in a few activities, the contract for the introduction of a modern payment system had to be cancelled due
                         to factors beyond the control of the executing agencies, making a new procurement process necessary. The Government of Honduras has requested an extension of the project in
