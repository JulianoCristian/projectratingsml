1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal 2
1.       Honduras has experienced several decades of low economic growth. During the 1990s
when growth had recovered in the rest of Central America, in Honduras, it barely kept pace with
population growth, making it the slowest growth rate in the region. Natural disasters (hurricanes
and earthquakes) and a deterioration of the terms of trade, exacerbated by erratic policies and
institutional weaknesses, compounded the situation and weakened the banking system.

2.      By 2003, the stability of the Honduran banking system was uncertain, given the
significant vulnerabilities of the country’s financial sector. The Honduran financial sector
suffered a severe shock in October 1998, when Hurricane Mitch hit the country with devastating
effects in terms of human lives and disruption of economic activity. In its immediate aftermath,
the financial sector was faced with an upsurge in the volume of bad debts and substantial
financial losses. A mid-sized bank had to be liquidated by the National Banking and Insurance
Commission (Comision Nacional de Bancos y Seguros, CNBS) and most financial institutions
were forced to request new injections of capital from their shareholders to restore their solvency.
The 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program Update (FSAP) highlighted significant
vulnerabilities in the sector, including weak compliance with the Basel Core Principles (BCP) for
effective banking supervision, insufficient provision of loans adversely affected by exogenous
shocks, low capital asset ratios and high numbers of non-performing loans (NPL).

3.      In response, the Government embarked on an economic reform program focused on
ensuring macroeconomic stability and strengthening growth prospects, and made
significant progress in addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. Consistent with the
recommendations of the FSAP, a series of laws and regulations were approved in 2004 that: (i)
strengthened prudential norms (including capital adequacy, loan classification, and
provisioning), (ii) enabled consolidated supervision (including offshores, affiliates and
subsidiaries), (iii) increased the powers of the supervisory agency, the CNBS, (iv) broadened the
circumstances that require corrective actions by banks, and (v) improved the bank resolution
framework. Within this context, the International Development Association (IDA) support
sought to contribute to the strengthening of the financial sector, considered critical for the
achievement of accelerating equitable and sustainable economic growth to levels consistent with
the poverty reduction targets, as outlined in IDA’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved
by IDA’s Board simultaneously with this Credit on June 24, 2003.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.      The Project Development Objective was to assist the Borrower to develop the
institutional capacity it required to be able to address the systemic vulnerabilities of its
financial system, through: (a) the design and implementation of a banking sector consolidation
program, (b) the reform of the Borrower’s payments system, and (c) the improvement of selected

                                                1
aspects of the Borrower’s financial system infrastructure. The Project defined seven key
performance indicators covering (i) compliance with prudential banking regulations, (ii)
improved banks’ risk management systems and increased cost efficiency, (iii) reduced legal
uncertainty and payment system risks, (iv) the creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)
within the CNBS, (v) better information for the CNBS on banks and corporates, (vi) reduced
number of NPLs for the largest 50 corporate borrowers, and (vii) an enhanced corporate
restructuring and insolvency system (see Datasheet, section F).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/ justification

5.       The original PDO and key indicators were not revised throughout the life of the
Project and commitment to the original Components was maintained. This was originally a
four-year Project, which was extended three times for a total of six additional years, in response
to institutional changes and external events. However, the Project objectives were formulated in
broad terms and remained largely relevant throughout the life of the Project. The only variation
that could have warranted a reformulation of the PDO is related to the objective of designing and
implementing a banking sector consolidation program, as only some aspects of the program were
implemented, as detailed below.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
6.      The CNBS and the Central Bank (BCH) were the main direct beneficiaries of this
Project. Other beneficiaries were the financial institutions whose performance and safety were
expected to improve based on a strengthened regulatory framework and increased access to a
modern financial system payments infrastructure. Finally, the Project benefited all users of
financial services in Honduras, including depositors, creditors, investors, firms and households,
whose savings in the form of bank deposits or other types of investments were expected to be
less vulnerable to losses and would benefit from more security and lower funds transfer and
investment fees.

1.5 Original Project Components

7.     The Project was primarily designed to help reduce the risks of systemic instability in
the Honduran financial system and address many of the key policy weaknesses identified in
the 2003 FSAP Update. Support was provided through four Components (for a detailed
description see Annex 6) 3:

    Component 1: A banking sector consolidation designed to establish a sound and stable
    foundation for the recapitalization and recovery of the Honduran financial sector (US$4.50
    million).
    Component 2: A major reform of the payments system to improve the efficiency of the
    financial system and facilitate business transactions, introducing a Real Time Gross

3
 The PAD foresaw a fifth component (unallocated reserve), which is not reflected in the Financing Agreement and
which was not implemented.



                                                       2
   Settlement (RTGS) System and moving away from manual processing of checks and large-
   value money transfers (US$2.25 million).
   Component 3: Technical assistance to improve selected aspects of the financial sector
   infrastructure, including addressing weaknesses in the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating
   Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, enhancing oversight of the corporate sector
   and improving Honduras’s insolvency regime, facilitating access to finance by small
   agricultural producers, as well as enabling the early recognition and more efficient handling
   of future problems in the financial sector (US$2.03 million).
   Component 4: Project Administration Component to provide support for the Project
   Coordination Unit (PCU) in the CNBS in order to assure effective project management and
   coordination, and strengthen the capacity of this unit to implement and supervise the Project
   (US$1.11 million).

1.6 Revised Components

8.      The Project components did not change through the life of the Project. In spite of
this, the allocation of funds and resources dedicated to each area was significantly revised to
reflect the changes in the needs and priorities of the CNBS and the BCH as will be described
below.

1.7 Other significant changes

9.      The Project’s closing date was extended three times to allow more time for
completion of Project activities. These extensions were motivated mainly by the delays in the
implementation of components assigned to the BCH. The approval of the first extension was
based on the expectation that project implementation would improve. The second extension was
conditional on the signing of the contract between the CNBS and the implementing firm of the
Project’s payment system Component, and its subsequent approval by the Honduran Congress.
The last extension was given on the condition that the bid evaluation for the payment system at
the BCH be presented to IDA no later than mid-June 2011.

10.     The three extensions resulted in a major reallocation of Project funds. Credit
proceeds were reallocated among components to reflect changing priorities as the reduction of
resources allocated to Component 1 allowed for the inclusion of new sub-projects (see below),
which were necessary, but not included in the original plan. The first and second extensions
brought a substantial reallocation of funds, leading to a significant decrease in the funds
allocated to Consultants’ Services, a major increase in the financing of Goods, and a decrease in
Training, with minor adjustments in the remaining items (see Annex 1). This reflected the BCH’s
need to finance the acquisition of two new modules: the Economic and Financial Management
and Information System (Sistema de Información y Gestión Económica y Financiera, SIGEF)
and the Electronic Foreign Exchange Trading System (Sistema Electronico de Negociacion de
Divisas, SENDI). The Project financed the software, hardware, and consulting services required
to improve the BCH’s internal systems.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

11.     The Project correctly diagnosed the institutional weaknesses of the Honduran
financial system. Its diagnostic coincided with the FSAP in identifying low bank capitalization
and a weak institutional framework for financial sector transactions, regulation and supervision
as the main weaknesses of the financial system. In 2003, the banks had high non-performing
loans and high operating costs which resulted in low profitability. Moreover, the banks had weak
bank risk-management practices. These risks were magnified by the weak legal and regulatory
framework and by the poor macroeconomic context and outlook. These factors made the
likelihood of a systemic banking crisis a real possibility.

12.     The diagnostic correctly pointed to critical issues, such as weak institutional
capacity at the CNBS, with major weaknesses in AML/CFT legislation and enforcement, 4
and a restrictive bank resolution framework with limited preventive and intervention
tools. 5 Weaknesses in regulatory elements (such as an adequate credit classification and
provisioning system, supervision manuals, the training of financial sector supervisors, the use of
compliance-based supervision, instead of a risk-based approach and the absence of consolidated
supervision) facilitated regulatory arbitrage while hiding aggregate risks. In addition to weak
supervision, banks had low and poor quality bank capital, raising concerns about solvency risks
in some banking institutions, leading to the establishment of the Bank Capitalization Fund under
the Project. An ineffective and seldom used corporate bankruptcy law, focused on the preventive
attachment of assets by creditors, raising banks’ losses given default. 6 Another major concern at
the project’s inception was the modernization of the payment systems, which had a number of
structural shortcomings resulting in high exposure to credit, liquidity, legal, operational and
settlement risks both for fund transfers and securities transactions.

13.     The PDOs were consistent with the Borrower’s priorities at the time of Board
approval and with the CAS. The CAS (submitted to the Board with this credit) identified the
weaknesses of the Honduran financial system as a potential constraint to achieving its first
objective of accelerating equitable and sustainable economic growth to levels consistent with the
poverty reduction targets. While formulated in broad terms, the PDO and Project components
addressed the sectoral weaknesses and were relevant throughout the life of the Project, with the
exception of Component 1, as discussed below.

  Law 45-2002 was perceived as a significant step forward in the control of money laundering. However, much
work remained to be done for its effective implementation. A major legislative gap was that the crime of financing
of terrorism (CFT) was neither criminalized as a separate offense, nor as an AML offence.
5
  It contemplated only two possible resolution mechanisms: (i) the authorities could close a failing bank after
transferring its deposits to another institution (the “restitution” mechanism) or, (ii) alternatively, they could
capitalize and temporarily manage the impaired institution through FOSEDE, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the
“extraordinary” mechanism). The latter had been abused beyond systemic crisis situations.
6
  This lead to widespread early use of judicial enforcement mechanisms, explaining the significant amount of
foreclosed assets owned by the banks.



                                                        4
14.    The PAD correctly assessed the overall high risk rating of the Project, however it
underestimated the country related risks. The risks of the weakening of the authorities’
commitment to the financial reform program and the potential loss of confidence of depositors in
the bank recapitalization program were rightly identified during Project design. The PAD
underestimated the intrinsic project risks, which ended up delaying significantly its
implementation. It was not possible to foresee the political instability that brought additional
complications for project implementation.

15.     The design of project activities for the implementation of the payments system had
some weaknesses and did not build on a comprehensive diagnostic of the capacity of BCH.
A more comprehensive diagnostic of the BCH’s weaknesses would have pointed at the need to
modernize the general ledger of the BCH as a condition for the successful operation of an
automated payments system. It would also have addressed the lack of an automated foreign
exchange auction system. As these weaknesses became evident, they forced a major redirection
of the Project during implementation. The Project’s design also underestimated the time required
and the capacity of the key participating agencies (CNBS and BCH) to implement and coordinate
the activities.

16.     This technical assistance project was followed by an adjustment operation (the
“Financial Sector Development Policy Credit,” FSDPC), which was unusual. Usually the
reverse sequence would have taken place. The justification for this unusual sequencing was
based on the Government’s need to organize its institutional framework for banking sector
consolidation. The Government was also discussing a Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF,
thereby making it impossible to move forward first with an adjustment credit (see Annex 6). The
expectation was that by moving forward with the technical assistance credit even in the absence
of an adjustment operation, the Government would be able to address some of the financial
sector issues before committing more resources. 7

2.2 Implementation

17.    Government Commitment to the Project fluctuated as a result of changes in
leadership. Initially, the Government and the two key participating agencies (CNBS and BCH)
demonstrated a very strong commitment to the Project throughout preparation. After the change
of administration and the changes in leadership of the CNBS and the BCH, the commitment
became lukewarm and recovered in the last phase of the Project, during the tenure of the current
administration of President Lobo.
18.     The Project made use of almost 99 percent of the Credit’s resources. Figures 1 and 2
show disbursements over time, with three rather distinct phases: (i) 2004-2007 with low and
declining annual disbursements; (ii) relative paralysis between 2007 and 2010; and (iii) rapid
execution of the Project since 2010. The first closing date extension did not accomplish the
expected results and, towards the end of that period, external factors to the Project interfered
with implementation (change in Government in June 2009). The second extension yielded results

in its last year (2011), providing some justification for the third and final one. Notably towards
the end of the project, the implementing agencies performed better than in the earlier years and
provided significant support to complete successfully the project and make use of the available
resources.

19.     Project implementation suffered numerous delays due to external and internal
factors. The external factors included: (i) delays in credit effectiveness because of delays in the
Congressional approval process (one year), (ii) four changes in Government, one of which led to
the suspension of high-level contacts between the Government and the Bank for a period of nine
months (June 2009-April 2010) after the removal of President Zelaya; and (iii) multiple changes
in the leadership of CNBS and BCH, resulting in an uneven commitment to the Project and a
sometimes difficult relationship between the two institutions. The internal factors included: (i)
the technical complexity of the tasks which generated difficulties in defining technical
specifications and preparing bidding documents, (ii) the difficulties experienced in the
procurement of goods and services, and (iii) the limited implementing capacity. In addition, the
decision to allow both the CNBS and BCH to implement concurrently and have decision-making
authority was also a factor impacting effective coordination and Project implementation. This
made it more difficult to supervise the procurement of the appropriate modules required by the
SIGEF and RTGS system.

20.      The Project’s focus shifted from the initial concentration on bank restructuring to
the implementation of the payments and other IT systems at BCH while maintaining the
activities to strengthen the regulations and supervisory capacity of the authorities. There
were multiple adjustments to the various components to accommodate new needs and changing
priorities, particularly of the BCH. In particular, the objective of increasing the capacity of the
authorities to promote and lead bank restructurings lost relevance in view of the capacity
demonstrated by the private banks to restructure themselves with little CNBS intervention.
Consequently the Bank Recapitalization Fund and attached technical assistance under
Component 1 was not activated, resulting in a significant shift of resources from Component 1 to
Component 2.



                                                6
21.      The focus of activities in Component 1 shifted over time. As the Project’s activities
related to the rehabilitation of failing banks lost importance, the activities under this Component
concentrated on improving the legal and regulatory framework for banking (including the
Financial Institutions Law, the Law for Deposit Insurance, the Laws for CNBS and BCH, key
prudential regulations, inspections manuals, and risk and governance standards) as well as on
developing CNBS’s capacity to oversee the financial system and to deal with high risk
institutions by developing an early warning system, training staff, and acquiring software and
hardware to improve bank supervision. The activities financed in regards to the rehabilitation of
some banks included only some legal and diagnostic work and the preparation of business plans,
which were carried out during the early phases of project execution.

22.     The size of Component 2 greatly increased over the life of the Project. Under
Component 2, the Project’s aim was to “carry-out an upgrade of the current system, including the
launching of a special purpose large value payments system and the establishment of a
government securities depository. Around 21.3 percent of IDA proceeds were original allocated
to this Component; however, it ended up absorbing about 60 percent of the funding and financed
the additional activities of SIGEF and SENDI.

23.      Activities under Component 3 were reduced as some sub-components were only
partially implemented. Component 3 focused on three aspects of Honduras’s financial
infrastructure: (i) the institutional framework for the AML/CFT, (ii) the oversight of the
corporate sector and the insolvency and creditors’ rights regime, and (iii) the instruments to
facilitate access to finance by small agricultural producers. The latter two sub-components were
only partially implemented, with the amendment of some regulations.

24.     The task force to implement the consolidation program for the financial sector
foreseen under Component 4 was eliminated as it was not necessary anymore. Initially, a
task force of six members (four from the CNBS and two from the BCH) and an administrative
assistant was to be established to implement the bank consolidation program. Given the
demonstrated capacity of banks to restructure themselves, the task force was eliminated in 2007
as part of the amendments at the time of the extension of the closing date of the project to 2009.

25.      Despite challenges, key Project outputs by Component were largely achieved with
the strengthening of CNBS and the establishment of the new payments system (see section
3.2). A summary of the principal outputs is shown in Annex 2 (Outputs by Components). The
annex breaks down the existing contracts that were entered into by the CNBS and the BCH and
illustrates in detail how the Project Components were implemented. It shows the amounts
disbursed by Component and summarizes the objectives that each contract was expected to meet.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.   Measurement of achievements could have benefited from a stronger M&E
framework. While IDA did not put as much emphasis on the M&E framework when the Project


                                                7
was designed, it would have been desirable to develop a more robust framework with measurable
quantitative indicators during implementation as a tool to improve Project management and
results.

27.     Overall, the results indicators were mainly qualitative in nature, such as assessing
whether the risk-based supervision carried out by a regulatory agency was consistent with
international best practice. The PAD M&E framework did not originally include quantitative
indicators, although certain indicators tracking the impact of Component outputs on PDO were
later included in the Implementation Status Reports (ISR), including those related to the
allocation of funds in 2009 and those associated with the reduction of risk and increase in
efficiency of the financial system. Some of the Key Performance Indicators were not causally
related to the Components, but depended on macroeconomic framework (for example, increased
cost efficiency in the banking system and reduced NPLs for the largest 50 Honduran corporate
borrowers) and other factors beyond the scope of the Project. The lack of a causal link of the
indicators of the Project impeded management from integrating the M&E framework more
closely with Project implementation, since the achievement, or lack thereof, of some of the
outcome indicators was largely beyond the scope of the Project. In addition, the indicators
related to the monitoring of corporate borrowers could only be tracked indirectly. 8

28.    The PCU was moderately effective in terms of maintaining timely information.
While information about the execution of all activities was easily available, it did not keep up-to-
date detailed records on a consolidated basis in terms of the purpose of each sub-project, costs,
disbursements, and output.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     There were no safeguard issues and fiduciary performance was adequate. The
Project did not trigger any social or environmental safeguards policies. The final audit found that
the Project complied with all fiduciary requirements. Other audits during the period of execution
marked only minor discrepancies in accounting (due to exchange rate fluctuations), as well as
problems verifying compliance with some aspects of the loan agreement, which were resolved
once issues surrounding the confidentiality of information were addressed.

30.    However, the Project faced significant challenges related to procurement, in
particular of the payments system component, as well as of other IT components for the
BCH. In the case of the payments system, procurement activities had to deal with implementing
a system in an environment of a rapidly evolving technology. 9 The procurement process leading

8
  The indicators pertaining to corporate restructuring and to the performance of loans granted to the 50 largest
corporate borrowers were not tracked in the ISRs, as the corresponding information is confidential and only
available to the authorities and regulated lending institutions. The performance of corporate loans was tracked
indirectly by looking at the overall behavior of the non-performance loans. In this light, a revision of the indicators
related to the corporate sector would have been advisable.
9
  While the implementation of a payments system required, at the inception of the Project, the development of a
customized IT solution, in the course of time, the industry evolved towards more standardized licensed packages,



                                                           8
to the selection of the winning firms (mainly for the RTGS) was slow, complex and disputed.10
On IDA’s side, there were delays in obtaining non-objections. A significant turnover of
procurement officers, both at the IDA and in the PCU, was also a complicating factor. While
technical and market factors contributed to the delays experienced in the implementation of the
payments system, IDA and the Honduran authorities could have taken a more proactive approach
to carry out the corresponding procurement processes, as a significant cause for the problems and
delays in preparing the bidding documents was due to errors in following adequate procurement
processes.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

31.     The authorities have indicated to IDA their interest in further technical assistance
for both implementing agencies (BCH and CNBS). The BCH would require support to further
improve its systems in order to achieve further gains in security and efficiency, with a
preliminary cost estimate of about US$7.8 million. The CNBS would require support to better
regulate and oversee financial cooperatives, the agricultural finance system, and the insurance
sector as well as to further strengthen its capacity in the area of AML/CFT, among others, with
preliminary cost estimates of about US$2.6 million. The combined estimated external financing
needs of the two institutions amount to about US$10.5 million (see Annex 8). The lessons
derived from the implementation of this technical assistance Project could be valuable in
designing any new assistance.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Moderately Satisfactory)

32.    The institutional strengthening objectives for the CNBS and the modernization of
the BCH’s general ledger and payments infrastructure were pertinent at design and
remained highly relevant during the long implementation period. The structure of the
operation was appropriate to address the challenges faced by the financial sector and its oversight
throughout the life of the project. The main shortcoming in the design was a consequence of the
weak diagnostic for the payments systems activity, as described above. Based on this, the
relevance of objectives, design and implementation are rated moderately satisfactory.

3.2 Achievement of the Project’s Development Objective (Moderately Satisfactory)

33.     The PDOs were largely achieved as measured by the seven Key Performance
Indicators. The overall assessment of the achievement of the PDOs is judged Moderately
Satisfactory since the Project fully achieved three, largely achieved two, and did not achieve one

which then had to be customized to meet the requirements of each institution. Overall, expertise on payments
systems was very scarce in the market at the time of Project design.
10
   The difficulties faced by the payment system’s contractor that won the bidding process of 2009 with the Central
Bank ended in a contractual dispute, forcing the cancellation of the contract, payment of the guarantee and re-
launching of the whole bidding process. In addition, the bankruptcy of the firm charged with implementing the
precursor of the SIGEF system made it necessary to carry out a second procurement process for this activity.



                                                         9
of the seven PDO indicators. The only intermediate indicator was also achieved. One indicator -
the level of non-performing loans of the top 50 corporations - cannot be verified, as the
corresponding information is not publicly available, although the overall bank NPLs (which
include those of the corporate sector) fell significantly over the period and it can be reasonably
deduced, that the NPLs of the top 50 corporations have fallen as well.

34.     Supervision of the banking sector improved significantly, due to the implementation
of an ambitious plan to strengthen the CNBS’s supervisory capacity with the help of this Project
and additional assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Progress in
modernizing and increasing the efficiency of supervision by the CNBS was very significant with
the adoption of modern tools (Team Mate, electronic management of documents, and the
introduction of a modern credit registry, among other tasks). Although the bank consolidation
program and capitalization scheme to facilitate mergers between viable institutions was not
activated, the initial diagnostics and business plans funded by the Project were very useful for the
authorities to better understand and address the weaknesses of the system. Overall, the improved
oversight contributed significantly to restore confidence in the financial system and through this
to the growth of the economy through a higher savings rate and greater availability of financing.
It’s recommended that these advances be confirmed through an FSAP Update as soon as
feasible, covering the assessment of compliance with the various international standards,
particularly the BCPs.

35.     The Project achieved the modernization of the general ledger of BCH and
development of the key financial infrastructure for the operation of the country’s large-
value payment and government securities systems (RTGS/SD), in addition to the foreign
exchange auction system and the operation of the interbank market and efficient implementation
of monetary policy. The new general ledger and connected systems (including the foreign
exchange auction module) became operational in 2012. The RTGS/CD began operation on
March 4, 2013, replacing numerous fragmented and cumbersome, vulnerable, and error-prone
manual systems. These developments will enhance the efficiency and safety of financial
transactions in Honduras and will have a significant longer-term development impact (see Annex
7). The adoption of a modern RTGS and the SENDI resulted in an increase in the efficiency and
security of the country’s large payments, enhancing the operational efficiency of monetary and
exchange rate policies, as well as improving the safety of participants in the interbank market.

36.     Although the technical assistance credit was small, it produced relevant and tangible
results that enhanced the Honduran financial sector. The Project achieved a number of
significant results. The main achievements of the Project were:
           i.    Systemically important banks are meeting CNBS prudential regulations and
                 required CARs. 11
          ii.    Banks have enhanced their risk management systems, purchasing specialized

11
  The Honduran banking system remains solid with an average capital adequacy ratio of 14.5 percent in December
2012, up from 13.5 percent in November 2008, with all the banks in the system presenting capital adequacy ratios
above the regulatory minimum of 10 percent.



                                                       10
                  software and consulting services.
          iii.    The BCH’s new automated general ledger, the large payment system and
                  securities depository and the automated foreign exchange auction system are all
                  operational and working efficiently, achieving one of the most important Project
                  objectives.
          iv.     The Financial Intelligence Unit at the CNBS is operating effectively, reporting
                  suspicious transactions to the investigative and enforcement organs of the State,
                  achieving, as far as the CNBS is concerned, the Project objectives. 12
           v.     The timeliness, quality and granularity of the credit and financial information
                  used for prudential purposes by the CNBS and the BCH have greatly improved
                  with access to a comprehensive and timely database.
          vi.     The level of non-performing loans in the banking system has declined
                  significantly, although this cannot be attributed directly to the Project.
         vii.     The corporate and insolvency creditor rights have made some progress, but
                  further work needs to be done to make the system operate effectively, particularly
                  the interventions by the judicial system.
        viii.     The operational procedures for a bank resolution process were finalized and have
                  been successfully tested.

3.3 Efficiency (Moderately Unsatisfactory)

37.     The longer-than-programmed duration of the Project adversely affected the
efficiency of the outcomes. Costs were higher for purchases of goods and services and Project
management costs rose. The weakness in the procurement office during the early phases of the
Project may have materially increased Project costs, and the less than satisfactory financial
control reduced the efficiency of implementation. Overall, slow implementation significantly
reduced the efficiency of the Project (see figure in the Datasheet Section I showing the gap
between originally expected and actual disbursements). The project did not have an economic
analysis. 13 While the Project’s efficiency significantly improved in the final phase and all major
activities were implemented, the Project experienced a long implementation period due to (i)
poor management of the procurement process, and (ii) significant problems with service
providers involved with the acquisition of the RTGS/CD that took place during the initial phase.
The efficiency is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory in consequence hereof.




12
   These improvements contributed significantly to improve the rating of Honduras in respect to its efforts in the area
of ASML/CFT, as acknowledged by the Financial Action Task Force, an international body that oversees the
countries’ efforts in regards to AML/CFT activities in its report from May, 2013
13
   The PAD stated in the section of economic analysis: “Given the character of this operation, a quantitative
economic and financial analysis would not be the appropriate tool to assess the significance of this project. The pace
and depth of the reforms envisioned in this operation will determine the ultimate economic benefits of this credit.”



                                                          11
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

38.     The Project has substantially contributed to strengthening the Honduran financial
sector and the two main government authorities which have oversight function. While the
project took a long time to develop, it contributed substantially to:
   i.   Strengthening the capacity of CNBS to supervise the financial institutions, detect in a
        timely manner the risks that could potentially affect them and, lastly, to have the
        mechanisms in place to act fast and deal with any negative developments, thus limiting
        considerably the potential negative consequences that the failure of a financial institution
        could have on the economy.
 ii.    Establishing a functioning payments system that reduces the overall costs and uncertainty
        of financial transactions.
 iii.   Improving significantly the monitoring of suspicious financial transactions that could be
        related to money laundering or the financing of terrorist activities.

39.     The PDOs maintained their relevance throughout the period and the most
important institutional objectives were largely met. Nonetheless, significant shortcomings in
terms of efficiency and extended delays resulted in increased opportunity cost for the country
and higher operational costs. Considering the above, the Development Outcome of this technical
assistance credit is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

40.     Although the project contributed to the improvement of the conditions for
economic development, it did not have any direct attributable impact on poverty or social
development. The focus of the PDOs was on strengthening the institutional framework and of
BCH and CNBS and did not address any gender issues. No unintended outcomes or impacts have
been reported.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

41.    There was no formal survey of beneficiaries, but the Bankers’ Association and the
Bank Processing Center (Centro de Procesamiento Bancario, CEPROBAN) were very
supportive of Project activities, indicating to the ICR mission that its implementation has resulted
in a very noticeable improvement in the safety and efficiency of operations for financial
intermediaries. CEPROBAN opposed the BCH’s imposition of a rather low cap for RTGS
operations, as this reduces the volume of payments channeled by banks through its Automated
Clearing House (ACH). The Bankers’ Association mentioned the importance of FSAPs to assess
the authorities’ performance in complying with the various international standards assessed,
including the BCPs.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate


                                                12
42.     A Moderate risk rating is assigned to the development outcome, reflecting the
perceived likelihood that changes that are detrimental to the sustainability of the Project
objectives could take place. This rating is justified because:
    i. the risks to the continuity of the payments system reforms can be judged to be small. The
       RTGS system is operating satisfactorily with 12 of the 17 banks of the financial system
       (responsible for 71% of the transactions), and the remaining entities in process of joining
       it. The technology of the system has been proven in other countries and it the payments
       system can be expected to continue operating in a stable manner.
   ii. some moderate risks remain to the continuity of the achievements in the area of
       prudential regulations and supervision of the financial system. In spite of the considerable
       strengthening of the supervisory capacity of the authorities and the improvements to their
       framework, the risk of external interference into their operations remains. And,
  iii. a higher risk is attached to the effectiveness of the AML/CFT efforts beyond the scope of
       responsibilities of the CNBS. While the FIU at CNBS is operating adequately, the
       Prosecutor’s Office and judicial system are not yet following up on the suspicious
       transactions reported to them by the FIU.

5. Assessment of IDA and Borrower Performance

43.    Project performance highly depends on six inter-linked critical factors: (i) initial Project
design, (ii) flexibility to accommodate changing priorities, (iii) ownership, (iv) implementation
capacity and skills, (v) sequencing and prioritization of the reforms; and (vi) absorptive capacity
and resources.

5.1 IDA Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

44.     The PDO, Components and activities included in the PAD properly addressed the
concerns of a likely systemic banking crisis in Honduras, in view of the deterioration of the
quality of bank assets, the weaknesses in prudential supervision and AML/CT systems, and the
structural weaknesses in the payment systems of the country diagnosed in the 2003 FSAP. The
likelihood of a systemic crisis scenario was even more plausible in view of the existing
macroeconomic imbalances addressed by the IMF Stand-by Arrangement being negotiated with
the Borrower. The Project correctly focused on the most critical and strategic weaknesses in the
financial system.

45.    While the diagnostic of the CNBS weaknesses was appropriate, the diagnostic of
BCH requirements was weak and the quality of the assessment of the implementing
agencies was uneven. Especially the initial, rather incomplete, diagnostic of the BCH’s needs
made it difficult to foresee and sequence the necessary activities that culminated in the
implementation of the payment system Component, the RTGS system. A broader and more


                                                13
thorough initial assessment of the BCH’s weaknesses would have facilitated Project execution,
focusing first on modernizing the general ledger and systems and financing the necessary
technical assistance and IT systems for the critical SIGEF. The significant time, effort, and
funding required to develop this system delayed the completion of the RTGS. For the above
reasons IDA’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

46.     IDA proactively identified and resolved threats to the achievement of the
development objectives, thus dealing with the consequences of significant political
instability that resulted in uneven levels of commitment and high turnover of the senior
staff at the implementing agencies. In this context, IDA compensated for weaknesses in
implementation capacity by extending the Project implementation period, intensifying
supervision and financing additional consulting services. Focusing on the high developmental
impact of the tasks financed by the Project, staff maintained in this form an intense supervision
(20 ISRs) and added additional consulting services to foster the successful completion of the
RTGS. Frequent missions provided support to the Honduran counterparts to better manage the
Project activities and to discuss how to address the identified financial system weaknesses.

47.     The ratings assigned in the twenty ISRs might have been too sanguine when the
Project was experiencing significant delays, possibly not bringing to management’s
attention the difficulties encountered: only one of the early ISRs gave an unsatisfactory
rating. Similarly, staff recommended the approval of the three extensions, but there was no
evidence that the mid-term review flagged implementation problems, or recommended a possible
restructuring or even the cancellation of the Project. 14 The Project should probably have been
restructured to modify at a minimum the Key Performance Indicators or even the PDO.

48.     Based on the ICR guidelines, the quality of supervision was overall instrumental in
achieving the objectives of the Project. These factors, combined with the weaknesses in the
Project’s M&E, leads the rating for supervision to be Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Overall IDA Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.     The PDOs remained valid and did not change throughout the nearly 10-year
implementation period. However the accumulation of delays, for reasons that were internal and
external to the Project, led the authorities to request three extensions of the closing date. Over
time, the priority and scope of the objectives changed, with greater emphasis given to the BCH
Component, particularly the RTGS system. IDA’s flexibility, staff stamina and patience to carry
on with the implementation of the RTGS system until its successful completion allowed the
Project to largely achieve its development objectives. However at the same time the prolonged
14
 A mid-term review, carried out in early 2007, resulted in an adjustment to the project budget and extension.
However, no mid-term review document was issued.



                                                        14
implementation period led to increased opportunity costs for Honduras and direct supervision
costs for IDA.

50.     The combined rating for IDA’s performance considering the above two factors is
Moderately Satisfactory. It should be noted that there were significant internal pressures to
close the Project, which the authorities effectively resisted in view of the national importance of
achieving the key objectives. A second order restructuring of the Project would have been
adequate, especially to adjust the Key Performance Indicators and in this way to better reflect the
changes in circumstances since inception.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51.     The level of commitment and ownership at the highest levels of Government
suffered during the long implementation period from the country’s political and
institutional instability. Bank experience has shown that government ownership and
commitment to achievement of the PDOs are the most critical factors for success. Both factors
were in short supply during part of the implementation period, particularly between 2007 and
2010. The political instability, the changes in administrations, and the significant turnover in
leadership of the implementing agencies contributed to the delays in implementing the Project
(see Annex 4). In addition, the lack of supportive macroeconomic and institutional policies to
expedite the approval of critical legislation and reforms 15 contributed to these delays. Finally, the
appointment of inadequate staff to the PCU was a factor under the discretion of the government
but was not always satisfactorily and promptly resolved. The rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory
reflects these issues.

52.    Only towards the end of the Project, with the changes at the most senior levels of
BCH and CNBS, a renewed and strong commitment was there and the present
administration should be congratulated for this and for the achievement of the Project’s
objectives.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

53.     The implementing agencies contributed decisively to the achievement of the PDO
and the disbursement of the available funds despite periods of uneven performance.
Overall, CNBS and BCH valued IDA’s assistance and recognized the importance of the
development objectives supported by the credit: they actively engaged in implementing the
Project’s activities and achieving its goals. Although ownership of the Project at the highest
levels, especially of BCH was at some points uneven, reflecting the fluctuating ownership of the

15
     E.g. the Payments System Law or the Law on Corporate Insolvency



                                                       15
Project by the Government, the continuing efforts of the operational units made it possible for
the activities related to the payments system to continue during the period of relative paralysis
between 2007 and 2010. The active collaboration of the PCU, and of the units in charge of the
modernization of the payments’ and other systems at BCH, were decisive to the achievement of
the PDOs. Although the difficulties in the procurement processes for the large IT systems
(RTGS, SIGEF and, to a lesser, extent the SENDI) reflected the lack of experience of BCH staff,
their technical capacity improved in time, allowing the Project to substantially contribute to a
more efficient and secure operation of BCH in those areas. Considering the above, the
performance of the implementing agencies is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

54.     The rating reflects the average performance over all the phases of the Project.
Although the project’s development objectives were largely achieved, the very significant delays
in Project execution over time, which were caused largely by the uneven Project ownership by
the authorities described above, had a major opportunity cost for the country and led to
significant and high additional costs for IDA. As evidenced by the annual and accumulated
disbursement charts, only from 2010 onwards did Project funds disburse rapidly, as the most
expensive components (related to the SIGEF and the RTGS) were procured. The slight
“disconnect” between the ratings assigned in the last ISR and the ratings in this ICR is because
the ICR rates the overall performance of the borrower throughout the whole period of Project
execution, while the ISR rates just the period preceding it. Given this overall performance, the
rating for the borrower is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

55.      The principal lessons learned for Project design and implementation are as follows:

•     In an environment of limited implementation capacity, Project design should be as
      simple as possible. While there are limits to the simplification of specific components 16, the
      overall design of the Project was overly complex for an environment of limited
      implementation capacity, uneven leadership, and episodic institutional conflicts between the
      two main implementing agencies (CNBS and BCH). A simpler structure and a better
      separation and costing of tasks would have been more appropriate.
•     The largest Project Component in terms of financing—the modernization of the
      payment system—suffered from an incomplete and superficial diagnostic at inception
      and an overly complex design. The diagnostic included only a very limited scope of
      activities to be reformed and financed, making it necessary to incorporate other systems that
      were sub optimally sequenced and coordinated, which in turn caused additional costs and
      delays. The diagnostic of BCH’s shortcomings should have gone further to include its
16
  The modernization of the payments system, for example, requires a reform of applicable regulations, an update of
procedures as well as the management of change by the participating financial institutions, which all have to be
implemented together with adjustments to the technological infrastructure.

     general ledger and its technical capacity before undertaking the modernization of the
     payment system. The Project should have identified the need for further technical assistance
     to the implementing agencies and, also, for the need to take a broader approach in
     modernizing BCH’s systems and processes, sequencing the replacement of the general ledger
     and the addition of the SENDI as a prior reform to implanting a modern RTGS. In addition,
     the initial technical proposal to modernize the payment system prepared by BCH included
     too many modules, adding complexity to the bidding process and contributing to the failure
     of the first contractor 17. The lesson for IDA was that breaking down the required actions into
     a phased approach could have simplified the process. This would have allowed for more
     attention to implementing the individual modules that support the overall structure of the
     RTGS and the securities depository Components, which should have been implemented in a
     second phase rather than simultaneously with the supporting modules. In this regard, the IDA
     team could have been more proactive in assisting and advising the BCH, both in terms of
     technical specifications and the complex procurement process.
•    In low-income countries with limited implementation capacity, it is critical to plan for
     and expect longer-term IDA engagements since these Projects often encounter adverse
     circumstances and delays. Although this Project had clear implementation arrangements,
     the initial execution period proved to be too optimistic and three extensions of the closing
     date were required for successful implementation. An important lesson is that IDA must
     maintain the flexibility, staff stamina, and patience to carry on with the implementation of
     such Projects, even under duress, considering that the authorities would not have had the
     capacity to carry on and modernize a vital Component of the country’s infrastructure.
•    IDA should agree up-front with Government on the size and composition of the PCU as
     well as the minimum experience and qualifications for each position. Relative high
     turnover of staff at the PCU, both at the level of the Director and Procurement Officers,
     affected the dynamism and normal functioning of the Unit. The Government’s selection of an
     inadequately qualified Director, who remained in the job for an extended period, ultimately
     contributed to additional delays in the execution of the credit. The high Senior staff turnover
     at the CNBS and the BCH and the uneven level of commitment towards the Project also
     resulted in significant delays in the implementation of the tasks under Components 1
     (banking system consolidation) and 2 (financial sector supervision), but these changes were
     beyond the Project’s control. It would have been useful for the Government and IDA to agree
     up-front on the minimum requirements and qualifications for PCU personnel as well as
     criteria to evaluate performance.

  Between the first and second bidding processes for the payment system the number of components were scaled
down in order to increase efficiency and facilitate the procurement process. The implementation of the various
modules was successfully accomplished by the second contractor, which won the second bid. It implemented a
system that was less complex than the one originally offered by the first contractor, but more responsive to the
central bank needs.

Context at Appraisal 18

     1. Between 1960 and 2000, Honduras had many years of low economic growth
        performance. Output growth ranked among the lowest in the region. During the 1990s
        when growth recovered in the rest of Central America, in Honduras it only kept pace with
        population growth. Natural disasters (hurricanes and earthquakes) and a deterioration of the
        terms of trade, exacerbated by erratic policies and institutional weaknesses, adversely
        affected growth. Slow growth and weak governance contributed to widespread social
        unrest. In response, the authorities embarked on an economic reform program focused on
        ensuring macroeconomic stability, strengthening growth prospects through the
        development of human capital and basic infrastructure, improving the environment for
        private sector development, and using international trade agreements to boost growth.
     2. The government’s program—supported by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty
        Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement—improved overall economic
        performance. The PRGF arrangement, approved in February 2004, contributed to a modest
        recovery and a significantly improved external position. A two percent annual growth rate
        in real per capita GDP was finally attained in 2004, after an extended period of zero or
        even negative rates. The fiscal strategy embedded in the PRGF was based on the gradual
        reduction of the fiscal deficit, while at the same time orienting spending toward priorities
        (growth-enhancing investment and poverty spending). Key reforms supporting this strategy
        included broadening the tax base, strengthening tax administration, upgrading the
        Integrated Public Financial Administration System, introducing the single treasury account,
        and the gradual restructuring of the public sector. Nevertheless, the risks to the fiscal
        strategy were rated as significant.
     3. Key policy achievements included fiscal adjustments, in particular, by improving
          governance, catalyzing the reform of the financial system recommended by the 2003
          Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and containing the increase in the teachers’
          wage bill. Successful program implementation was deemed crucial for sustained economic
          recovery, continued external support, and reaping the benefits of the Heavily Indebted Poor
          Countries (HIPC) initiative. However, public sector unions resisted the implementation of a
          prudent wage policy. Combined with rising oil and basic foodstuff prices, this resistance led to
          broad-based demands to relax fiscal policy.
     4. The 2003 FSAP confirmed the significant financial sector vulnerabilities which had led to
        the establishment of this Project. These were, in particular:
      •    Weak compliance with the Basel Core Principles (BCP). Honduras largely complied with
           three principles, materially non-complied with 20 principles, and did not comply with
           another two.
      •    Adversely affected loans not fully provisioned. Banks had still not fully provisioned loans

           adversely affected by exogenous shocks, including Hurricane Mitch (1998) and the
           coffee crises (1999 and 2001).
     5. Since then, the authorities have made significant progress in addressing financial
        sector vulnerabilities. Consistent with the recommendations of the FSAP, a series of laws
        and regulations were approved in 2004 that: (i) strengthened prudential norms (including
        capital adequacy, loan classification, and provisioning), (ii) enabled consolidated
        supervision (including offshores, affiliates and subsidiaries), (iii) increased the powers of
        the supervisory agency, the CNBS, (iv) broadened the circumstances that require corrective
        actions by banks, and (v) improved the bank resolution framework. The CNBS approved a
        schedule that gradually implemented the new provisioning requirements over three years.
The Honduran Economy in 2012 19

     6. After reaching 3.75 percent in 2011, economic growth slowed in 2012. Estimated at
        3.25 percent, this decline in real GDP growth in 2012 partly reflected a contraction of the
        “maquila” sector (the light manufacturing sector operating in free zones). Headline
        inflation reached its lowest level at 4 percent in July 2012, but rose to 5.4 percent by the
        end of the year. This uptick reflected a reversal of favorable commodity price
        developments. Core inflation however, remained broadly stable at about 6 percent
        throughout the year.
     7. Fiscal policy became expansionary in 2012. Government real expenditure grew slightly
        faster than in 2011 and tax revenue growth declined sharply. The latter reflected continuing
        tax exemptions, weak revenue administration, the expiration of tax measures adopted in
        2010, and a Supreme Court ruling against changes to the income tax from 2011.
     8. The central government deficit is estimated to have grown to 6 percent of GDP in
        2012, from 4.5 percent in 2011. While the performance of state-owned enterprises also
        weakened, ongoing surpluses by public pensions contained the combined public sector
        deficit to 4.25 percent of GDP in 2012. Reduced domestic demand for new government
        paper and limited access to official external financing led to the accumulation of domestic
        arrears (whose stock is estimated to have reached about 4 percent of GDP at the end of
        2012) and to the BCH credit to finance the deficit.
     9. Honduras’s external position continued to weaken during 2012. The external current
        account deficit is projected to have risen to almost 10 percent of GDP in 2012, driven
        mainly by robust domestic demand, exchange-rate overvaluation, and less favorable terms
        of trade. Net international reserve losses for 2012 reached about US$370 million, with
        gross reserve coverage falling to three months of imports (from 3.5 months at the end of
        2011). Private capital outflows picked up in the second half of 2012, reflecting partly
        declining confidence.
     10. Monetary policy efforts have not been enough to prevent the deterioration of the
         external position. Low policy interest rates and a tightly managed exchange rate have
         supported the expansion of domestic demand since 2010. Bank credit growth rose
         significantly in 2012, particularly foreign currency loans and consumer credit. Reflecting
         partly crowding out by the public sector, loan and deposit interest rates in lempiras rose

       substantially since mid-2012, but did not contain credit growth. The heavily managed
       exchange rate has not helped reduce the excess demand for foreign exchange or contain the
       real appreciation of the lempira.
 11. Today, Honduras continues to face significant social and institutional challenges. It is
     one of the poorest countries in Central America and social conditions remain depressed,
     with about two-thirds of the population living in poverty. Policymaking has been
     constrained by persistent structural problems, including short political cycles, powerful
     vested interests, and social unrest. The country also faces challenges in the areas of rule of
     law, corruption, and government effectiveness.
The Honduran Banking System

 12. The Honduran banking system underwent a severe test as a consequence of the world crises
     in 2008 and 2009 and of the political crisis of 2009. Although the financial system fared
     relatively well in terms of stability—or has at least not performed worse than the rest of
     Central America—the crises’ negative impacts on loan portfolio quality led to widespread
     loan restructuring and weakened some banks to an extent which may merit a closer review.
 13. Notwithstanding the earlier crises, the financial sector remains generally sound. Non-
     performing loans (NPLs) are low (2.5 percent in November 2012) and have been declining;
     and capital levels and provisions against NPLs have increased. Recently introduced new
     regulations to strengthen risk management will be fully implemented during 2013 and
     2014. However, the rapid growth of consumer lending poses risks and financial
     dollarization remains high at about 30 percent. In addition, significant currency
     mismatches, especially on the borrower’s side, pose risks. The Superintendency of Banks
     has been addressing this issue through higher capital requirements on un-hedged loans.
 14. Banks and financial institutions experienced a significant turnover between 2004 and
     2012. In this period, the number of total banks grew from 16 to 17 and the number of
     financial institutions grew from nine to 10. In addition, there was a significant turnover
     among participants. Five banks exited and six new banks entered the market; one financial
     institution exited and two entered the market. The banking system also experienced a
     gradual and modest consolidation, as some banks were sold (Trabajadores Bamer, and
     HSBC), merged (Cuscatlan and Uno) or exited the market (Futuro and BGA) and new
     banks entered (Procredit, Azteca, Lafise, Popular, Davivienda and Citibank). Banco
     Cuscatlan was absorbed by Banco UNO, which afterwards was bought by Citibank. Banco
     de los Trabajadores is, at present, under a recapitalization plan ordered by the CNBS.
     Banco Bamer was absorbed by BAC, which in turn was recently purchased by a Colombian
     group. BGA, owned by the Panamanian Banco del Istmo, was bought, jointly with the
     whole group, by HSBC, which recently sold all its operations in Honduras to Davivienda,
     another Colombian group. Banco Futuro was sold to Banco Lafise, whileBanco La
     Constancia and Banco de las Fuerzas Armadas were closed.
 15.   The turnover of financial institutions did not result in a significant market consolidation
       and a moderate market concentration remains. The three largest banks in 2004 had a 44.3
       percent market share, rising in 2012 to 47.6 percent. There is a much higher degree of
       concentration of non-bank financial institutions; the three largest institutions in 2004 had a
       market share of 79.9 percent, dropping in 2012 to 60 percent. With very few exceptions,


                                                 28
the majority of participating banks and financial institutions have a market share of less
than 10 percent.

       Annex 6: Original Project Components and Sequencing of IDA Interventions

 1. The original project objectives were broken down into four Components: (i) Technical
    Assistance for Banking Sector Consolidation, (ii) Reform of the Payments System, (iii)
    Improvement of Financial System Infrastructure, and (iv) Project Administration.
1. Technical Assistance for Banking Sector Consolidation – (US$4.50 Million):
 2. This Component was originally designed to focus on:
   •   Improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for banking, including the review
       and reform of: (i) the Financial Institutions Law, (ii) the FOSEDE Law, (iii) CNBS and
       Central Bank Laws, (iv) drafting of key prudential regulations and the inspection manual,
       and (v) the adoption of governance and risk management standards. The procurement
       actions are in the form of individual consultancies.
   •   Rehabilitation planning and in-depth diagnostics of selected banks, including the
       preparation and assessment of rehabilitation plans, special diagnostic of troubled banks
       and advisory assistance for the resolution of non-viable banks. The procurement actions
       are in the form of consultants’ services, employing firms and individual, both nationally
       and internationally.
   •   Enhancing management of systemic risks, including detailed contingency plans, ongoing
       diagnostic and intensive supervision of high-risk institutions. The procurement actions
       were for: (i) consultants’ services employing firms and individual, both nationally and
       internationally, (ii) training, including workshops, seminars, study tours and on-the-job
       training at similar institutions abroad, and (iii) acquisition of equipment, such as desktops
       and lap-tops, a database interface, servers and examination and statistical software and
       licenses.
   •   The design and implementation of incentive packages for self-rehabilitation of banks,
       including hiring specialized companies to assist eligible institutions.
   •   The design of an effective framework for bank asset liquidations by hiring a firm to carry
       out this function.
2. Reform of the Payments System – (US$2.25 Million):
 3. This Component involved advisory assistance for the formulation of a reform strategy and
    its implementation, acquiring and implementing a RTGS and acquiring and implementing
    equipment for the reform of the securities depository. The procurement actions were for: (i)
    consultants’ services employing individual consultants, (ii) training, including workshops,
    seminars, study tours and on-the job training at similar institutions abroad, and (iii)
    equipment purchases (for the RTGS and securities depository).
3. Improvement of Financial System Infrastructure (US$2.03 Million):
 4. This Component focused on:
   •   Strengthening the legal and institutional framework for AML/CFT, including
       strengthening of the Financial Information Unit (FIU), awareness-raising and training.
       The procurement actions were in the form of: (i) consultants’ services, employing firms



                                                30
       and individual consultants, both national and international, (ii) training including
       workshops, seminars, study tours and on-the-job training at similar institutions abroad,
       and (iii) acquisition of equipment, such as desktops and lap-tops, a database interface,
       servers and analytical tools.
   •   Strengthening the framework for corporate restructuring and the initiation of the public
       oversight function, including the creation of an Oversight Unit for corporate risks at
       BCH, the reform of Honduras’ Bankruptcy Law and regulations, improving creditor
       rights, advisory assistance for the implementation of new framework for corporate
       restructuring mechanisms (both judicial and extra-judicial) and elaboration of a reform
       proposal for property registries. The procurement actions were for: (i) consultants’
       services employing firms and individual consultants, both national and international, (ii)
       training, including workshops, seminars, study tours and on-the-job training at similar
       institutions abroad, and (iii) equipment purchases, such as desktops, servers and licenses.
   •   Dissemination of best practices in rural finance. The procurement actions were for: (i)
       consultants’ services employing firms and individual consultants, both national and
       international, and (ii) training including workshops, seminars, study tours and on-the-job
       training at similar institutions abroad.

4. Project Administration (US$1.11 Million):
 5. This Component was designed to provide support for the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
    in the CNBS in order to assure effective project management and coordination, and
    strengthen the capacity of this unit to implement and supervise the project. It included the
    hiring of a project coordinator, a procurement specialist, and a financial/accounting
    specialist. This was done in accordance with IDA’s guidelines for selection of individual
    consultants.
 6. The sequencing of IDA interventions was unusual, since the TA operation preceded
    the adjustment operation. Nonetheless, correctly, the decision was made to provide
    initially support to the authorities through the TA project and to follow later on with the
    development policy credit. This sequencing was rather unusual, reflecting the constraints at
    the time of the project’s approval, but, in the end, the adjustment operation came to support
    the execution of the project and, under normal project implementation circumstances, the
    project would have saved time.
 7. Prior to appraisal of the IDA adjustment operation, the government had negotiated with the
    IMF an economic program aimed at reversing Honduras’s fiscal deterioration and at
    creating the basis for faster growth and reduced poverty. The authorities reached a new
    Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement with the IMF Board in
    February 2003.
 8. The First Financial Sector Development Policy Credit (First FSDPC) was to be executed
    over a period of two years, and would support the institutional development of the financial
    sector through reforms in the following five areas: (i) strategy for management of systemic
    risks, (ii) strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework, (iii) strengthening of anti-
    money laundering and financing of terrorism prevention system, (iv) strengthening of




                                               31
        supervision and control of systemic risks, and (v) strengthening of the payments system. 20
     9. As indicated in the ICR of the First FSDPC, the PDO Indicators were: (i) resolution of
        the adverse events that have occurred in the financial system within the framework of the
        new Financial System Law (Ley del Sistema Financiero, LSF), (ii) commitment to
        maintain Honduras’s status of cooperating country with the Financial Action Task Force
        (FATF) and improved compliance with the FATF 40+8 recommendations, and (iii)
        achievement of the goal of clearing of checks in less than 48 hours.
     10. Intermediate Outcome Indicators included the requirements for: (i) all banks to have
         risk management systems according to CNBS norms, (ii) banks to be in compliance with
         portfolio ratings and provisioning norms, and (iii) CNBS to take steps to carry out
         consolidated supervision of the financial groups operating in the country.The almost
         complete overlap of the project and the first programmatic financial sector development
         policy credit is quite striking.
     11. According to the Implementation, Completion, and Results Report for the FSDPC, the
         implementation of its reform program “was significantly assisted” by the on-going TA
         project. “The approval of a technical assistance credit before the approval of the
         adjustment operation was crucial in helping the authorities to implement the financial
         sector reforms that were later supported by the first FSDPC.” The project “financed the
         drafting of laws and regulations and the strengthening of the capabilities of the BCH and
         CNBS to implement the reforms.” In this sense the two operations were mutually
         reinforcing.

Annex 7: Improvements in Strengthening the Financial Sector’s Legal and Regulatory
  Framework and in the Operation of the Central Bank (BCH) under the Project

1. The financial sector legal and regulatory framework has been significantly strengthened
   by the laws approved under the reform program including the enactment of the LSF law,
   the amendment of other financial sector laws, and the issuing by the CNBS of norms and
   regulations for the implementation of the LSF. The CNBS is effectively applying the new
   framework for prompt corrective action, which allows the authorities to detect and require
   remedial measures if the entities in the financial system suffer deterioration in their
   financial health due to the risks assumed. Several outcome indicators in this area have
   been met. Adverse events that have occurred in the financial system have been resolved
   within the framework of the new LSF. The dissolution in 2006/7 of a savings and loans
   association was carried out within the new legal framework and the assets and liabilities of
   the failed entity were sold to a large bank with contributions from FOSEDE. Since then,
   no adverse event has occurred in the financial sector that required the application of the
   bank resolution mechanism in the LSF law.

2. The outcome indicator concerning banks' compliance with the new norms has been met.
   Most of the banks in the system are in the process of adjusting their procedures to comply
   with the CNBS's norms on credit risk, including the establishment of risk management
   systems. This norm was fully implemented by December 2009. Foreign owned banks
   have their own risk management systems in place, as required by their headquarters. Also,
   according to CNBS reports, all banks are in compliance with portfolio ratings and
   provisioning norms. These norms have been modified several times.
3. Congress has not yet approved a new legal framework for the payment systems, (although
   a law has been presented) and the Law on Electronic Signatures (is being drafted).
4. Additional measures will be required to improve the effectiveness of the AML/CFT
   legislation, particularly since prosecution and the enforcement of sanctions fall under the
   orbit of the Public Prosecutor (“Ministerio Publico”) and the police, where major
   deficiencies remain in terms of resources, prosecutors’ integrity, judicial and police
   enforcement, and imposition of sanctions. While the UIF is functioning well within the
   CNBS, critical government agencies charged with investigation and enforcement are not
   performing their duties.

5. By contributing to a greater reliability and efficiency of BCH’s foreign exchange,
   monetary policy operations and payment processing, the project reduced prior
   vulnerabilities and costs, enhancing the efficiency and safety of the foreign exchange,
   money and inter-bank markets. The project will provide tangible benefits for the
   commercial banking system, particularly by improving the banks’ cash management and
   treasury operations. This will allow for a significant reduction of inter-bank risks as it will
   now be possible to conduct collateralized overnight operations in which BCH will block
   paper issued by itself or the government as collateral in its securities depository. This will
   eliminate the banks’ bi-lateral pledges via the exchange of letters or uncollateralized short-
   term loans. The following table provides an oversight over the main improvements in the

               Annex 8: Post-Completion Operation/Possible Next Phase

Moving forward, the BCH and CNBS have identified the following areas, in which they would
require further assistance:

 I.   The BCH has identified pressing needs going forward in the following areas:
         a. Development of a government agencies’ deposit and payment module linked to
            the RTGS.
         b. Module of authorized electronic signatures of users of the Central Bank’s RTGS
            system.
         c. Purchase of middleware to allow the integration of Central Bank applications.
         d. Addition of a human resource management and planning modules to the core SAP
            in use.
         e. Module to automate the information of the Social Security Department.
         f. Acquisition of digital document administration to replace current system of
            microfilming government and Central Bank securities.
         g. Strengthening the computer centers’ backup and recovery infrastructure.
         h. Investing in IT systems to further protect the security of information.
         i. Computer and telecommunication equipment for the new Central Bank building
            and the Parallel Computer Center in San Pedro Sula.
         j. Central Bank “cloud” computer services.
 II. Despite significant strengthening of the CNBS’s institutional capacity achieved in the last
     decade, going forward, there are significant needs in banking supervision. Thematically
     the following areas have been highlighted as priority areas for additional TA support:
         a. Drafting of regulations to implement new laws, including the Social Security
            Law, the Law on Sureties and Guarantees.
         b. Analysis, restructuring and development of new regulatory and supervisory
            frameworks for the cooperative sector, Fund Administration Companies and
            Mutual Guarantee Funds.
         c. Development of financial inclusion plans linked to remittances channeled through
            cooperatives and OPDFs.
         d. Improve the rural and agricultural finance systems and reform of BANADESA;
         e. Review of the adequacy of the reinsurance regulations and training of specialists.
         f. Regulation of micro-insurers and micro-pension companies.
         g. Assistance to strengthen consolidated supervision.
         h. Software and training to: (i) analyze the corporate data collected by the Credit

          Risk Bureau for prudential purposes, (ii) development of stress-testing models,
          (iii) acquisition of statistical tools to estimate maximum expected losses.
       i. Assistance to conduct a self-assessment of GAFI’s 40 recommendations for
          AML/CFT.
III.   Going forward, Honduras’ CPS aims to define areas of engagement selectively.
       Selectivity can best be exercised by focusing on those sectors where the government
       has demonstrated strong demand and commitment, and where IDA is prepared to
       deliver. With this new focus, IDA should continue to pay attention to strengthening
       financial supervision, including regulation and supervision of non-bank financial
       institutions, while assisting the Central Bank to continue improving the country’s
       payment system.

                               CONCLUSIONES GENERALES

  1. La asistencia técnica para el programa de consolidación de la banca, ha sido altamente
     favorable para mejorar las capacidades normativas de la CNBS, estableciendo un marco
     regulatorio adecuado para realizar una supervisión basada en riesgos, manejo de
     instituciones en problemas e implementar los mecanismos de resolución, que permitan
     fortalecer la solvencia y mantener la estabilidad del sistema financiero.
  2. Se elaboró y aprobó el Marco Jurídico Adecuado que regula la Insolvencia Empresarial,
     reformando los títulos VI y VII del Código de Comercio y artículos del Código Penal,
  3. Se aumentó los niveles de solvencia de las instituciones financieras debido al
     fortalecimiento de las Reservas y del Capital regulatorio.
  4. Se obtuvo una reducción y control del riesgo de concentración de operaciones con partes
     relacionadas mediante la disminución del monto otorgado a los mismos.
  5. La aprobación de la reglamentación de Gobierno Corporativo eficientiza la administración
     de las entidades financieras.
  6. Se establecieron los procedimientos para agilizar los mecanismos de aprobación y
     concesión del prestamista de última instancia.
  7. Hay evidencia de logro de mejoras de la supervisión de las instituciones financieras, a
     través de la prevención de riesgo sistémico y el manejo de contingencias.
  8. Se logró un desarrollo de la capacidad y competencias del recurso humano de la CNBS
     mediante la incorporación de nuevas herramientas de supervisión basadas en riesgo.
  9. Las reformas del Sistema de Pagos constituyen un elemento vital en la infraestructura
     financiera de la economía del país, ya que posibilita y facilita las transacciones
     económicas, brindando seguridad en el proceso de intercambio de bienes y le proporciona
     al Banco Central de Honduras, el mecanismo para efectuar las acciones de política
     monetaria y regular la liquidez de la economía.
  10. La implementación del Modelo de Indicadores de Alerta temprana para actuar en forma
      preventiva y no reactiva ante una eventual crisis sistémica, es un factor muy importante
      para una sana supervisión prudencial.
  11. El Análisis y Actualización de la Regulación y Supervisión de los diferentes tipos de
      riesgos asociados a las Instituciones Financieras que atienden al Sector de Microfinanzas,
      permitió obtener conocimiento sobre la importancia de la supervisión de la actividad
      microfinanciera; así como, sobre los riesgos y retos de dicho sector en la región.


                                              40
12. La nueva Metodología de Supervisión implementada, permitió fortalecer los procesos de
    supervisión para las instituciones que atienden al sector de microfinanzas, principalmente
    en lo relacionado a la evaluación del riesgo de crédito.
13. La obtención de nuevos conocimientos respecto al marco conceptual sobre la
    administración integral de riesgos, permite que la CNBS prevenir a las instituciones
    supervisadas para que no sufran pérdidas económicas considerables por la exposición al
    riesgo excesivo y que asuman los riesgos con decisiones acertadas.
14. Las nuevas metodologías específicas para la evaluación de un plan estratégico y de
    negocios, permitió determinar si los mismos expresan la estrategia real de las instituciones
    supervisadas, que atienden el sector de microfinanzas. En la actualidad dicha evaluación
    forma parte de la guía del riesgo estratégico de los procesos de supervisión.
15. En términos generales podemos concluir que al haber estado en el marco de Solvencia I,
    los organismos supervisores a nivel internacional han tendido a buscar mecanismos de
    regulación y prácticas de supervisión que les permitan cuantificar y monitorear los riesgos
    a los que están expuestas las instituciones de seguros por la actividad que realizan, por lo
    que buscan otro nuevo enfoque que combine las exigencias tradicionales de solvencia
    (reservas técnicas y suficiencia de capital), con requerimientos de gobierno corporativo y
    transparencia de mercado, así como fortalecer el perfil financiero de las instituciones de
    seguros y su calidad crediticia, aplicando el enfoque de solvencia II.
16. La Inestabilidad política del país debido a los sucesos de junio 2009 afectó la ejecución
    normal de las actividades del Proyecto, lo que trajo como consecuencia postergación de
    inicio y de ejecución de algunas actividades, cambios en los perfiles y alcances de algunos
    proyectos importantes.
17. Los cambios de autoridades en la CNBS y el BCH, generaron durante los primeros cinco
    años de ejecución del proyecto una alta rotación del personal clave del proyecto
    (Coordinador y personal técnico de adquisiciones) y además esto provocó constantes
    cambios en la programación de actividades producto de los objetivos que perseguía las
    autoridades de cada Institución.
18. Para la ejecución del Proyecto fue muy importante el apoyo recibido de expertos del
    Banco Mundial en actividades estratégicas como es el Sistema de Pagos del BCH.
19. La Comisión Nacional de Bancos y Seguros avanzó significativamente en                 la
    modernización del marco regulatorio del sistema financiero, así como en el alcance de su
    propio fortalecimiento interno en materia de metodologías, sistemas y herramientas
    desarrolladas para realizar la supervisión basada en riesgos.
20. Con recursos del Proyecto se iniciaron las primeras actividades para la implementación de
    la supervisión integral basada en riesgos, actividad estratégica que fue concluida a con
    recursos de otra entidad financiera internacional para la completa implementación del
    nuevo Manual de Supervisión Integral Basada en Riesgos, basado en las mejores
    prácticas.
21. La herramienta informática para auditoría denominada Team Mate, adquirida con recursos
    del Proyecto para las tres Superintendencias, se ha constituido en una plataforma
    electrónica de alto valor para efectos de mejorar la planificación, ejecución y hacer más
    efectiva la supervisión in situ y extra situ.


                                             41
22. Con recursos del Proyecto y como parte de las actividades fundamental del mismo, el
    Banco Central de Honduras ha implementado con todo éxito el Sistema de Liquidación
    Bruta en Tiempo Real (LBTR) y Central Depositaria de Valores (CDV).
23. El Sistema electrónico de negociación de divisas, es otro proyecto financiado el cual
    permite la negociación de divisas entre los agentes cambiarios autorizados y el BCH, el
    que se encuentra funcionado desde el mes de junio de 2009.
24. La Unidad Coordinadora de Proyectos (UCP), dependiente de la Comisión Nacional de
    Bancos y Seguros (CNBS), fue de gran apoyo tanto como enlace entre Banco Mundial y el
    BCH, como en el asesoramiento, planificación, control, seguimiento y ayuda en las
    diversas tareas que implicaron la implementación de estos sistemas.
25. La implementación de estos proyectos impulsó a la elaboración de la Ley de Sistema de
    Pagos y Liquidación de Valores, así como de varios reglamentos resoluciones y circulares
    para normar los sistemas de pagos, y de Liquidación de Valores.
26. El Sistema financiero hondureño se ha visto beneficiado por la modernización del Sistema
    de Pagos y actualmente realiza parte de sus operaciones por medio de la ACH-Pronto y de
    la Cámara Electrónica de Compensación de Cheques, además poco a poco están
    procesando sus transacciones de alto valor por medio de la BCH-TR, con lo cual han
    mejorado substancialmente la seguridad y rapidez de las transacciones que llevan a cabo.
27. El Gobierno Central que es uno de los principales entes que realiza pagos, se ve altamente
    beneficiado con los nuevos Sistemas de Pagos, tanto por medio de la ACH-Pronto, de la
    Cámara de Compensación de Cheques, así como próximamente por medio de las
    transacciones en la BCH-TR.
28. El Banco Central de Honduras, ha visto una mejora considerable tanto desde el punto de
    vista jurídico; mediante la aprobación de los Reglamentos y Resoluciones del Directorio
    del BCH, que han venido a normar las diversas transacciones que se dan en el Sistema de
    Pagos y de Liquidación de Valores, así como desde el punto de vista del aumento en la
    seguridad, velocidad de las transacciones, costo y ahorro de recursos tanto humanos como
    de bienes.
29. La economía hondureña en general se ha visto beneficiada por la mejora en el Sistema de
    Pagos, dada la mayor confiabilidad que tiene debido al uso de los nuevos mecanismos de
    pagos, de subasta de títulos valores y subasta de divisas.

ANEXO C
                              LECCIONES APRENDIDAS

 1. La actualización y mejora del marco regulatorio permite enfocar en mejor forma las
    acciones y los recursos para efectuar un efectivo proceso de supervisión e intervención en
    instituciones con alto riesgo.
 2. La atención a los riesgos sistémicos debe hacerse en coordinación con todas las entidades
    que conforman la Red de Seguridad Financiera y apoyarse en indicadores de alerta
    temprana, para actuar en forma preventiva y no reactiva ante una eventual crisis sistémica.
 3. El conocer de las debilidades de la Ley y de las normativa vigente, fue un aprendizaje que
    permite actuar para buscar mecanismos alternos de orientación al sistema asegurador
    como de los funcionarios de la Superintendencia de Seguros y Pensiones, manteniendo el
    monitoreo continuo de la solvencia y de las reservas de las instituciones bajo los
    mecanismos actuales de regulación.
 4. Con las normas prudenciales del Reglamento sobre Constitución de Reservas Técnicas,
    Reglamento del Margen de Solvencia y del Reglamento de Inversiones para la supervisión
    de las instituciones de seguros, consideramos que fue un aprendizaje continuo y
    compartido con las instituciones de seguros, al mantener mecanismos de regulación que le
    permitieran a la institución cuantificar sus riegos y a la Superintendencia de Seguros y
    Pensiones a monitorear las operaciones realizadas por estas.
 5. Los planes de adquisiciones al inicio del proyecto y durante un buen tiempo de ejecución
    del mismo, fueron muy ambiciosos en función de la inexperiencia que se tenía en la
    ejecución de los procesos; sin embargo, a partir de 2010 al 2012 por las lecciones
    aprendidas y la curva de aprendizaje más el apoyo decidido de las autoridades superiores,
    se replanteo un PAC realista de conformidad con los objetivos del convenio de crédito.
 6. Es indispensable que para una buena ejecución de los proyectos, todo su personal, debe
    tener los conocimientos y experiencia en gestión de proyectos; con esto se evita retrasos
    en los procesos y por ende en la ejecución de los mismos.
 7. Todo el personal de la UCP independientemente de su forma de contratación o
    financiamiento debe tener una supervisión y evaluación continua de desempeño, y sus
    recontrataciones deben ser al menos de 12 meses y no por periodos menores, pues con
    esto se evita crear incertidumbre e inestabilidad laboral.
 8. El acompañamiento y empoderamiento de las contrapartes técnicas desde la etapa de
    inicio hasta la etapa de cierre de los contratos en cada uno de los procesos, es un aspecto
    fundamental para lograr los objetivos propuestos.
 9. Los manuales operativos de los proyectos deben ser revisados y de ser necesario
    modificados al menos una vez al año, a efecto de irlos adaptando a la dinámica
    administrativa, financiera, operativa y contable, en base a las mejores práctica.
 10. Durante la ejecución del Proyecto se tuvo cuatro (4) cambios de Presidente del país, seis
     (6) cambios de autoridades tanto en la CNBS como en el BCH, Cinco (5) Coordinadores
     de la UCP, cinco (5) oficiales de Adquisiciones de la UCP, por parte del BM, cuatro (4)
     Task Manager y Seis (6) Especialistas de Adquisiciones. Esta altísima rotación de



                                             43
           personal se constituyó en un fuerte obstáculo para el acelerado avance en la ejecución de
           los Planes de Adquisiciones, ya que cada cambio tenía una nueva visión del Proyecto y se
           hacían las modificaciones respectivas; no obstante a lo anterior, es evidente que una
           adecuada coordinación, seguimiento y apoyo institucional e interinstitucional, tal y como
           sucedió durante el período de gobierno 2010 al 2013, fue un factor preponderante para
           impulsar en forma definitiva las actividades del Proyecto y lograr una ejecución final del
           99% de los recursos aprobados.
   11. La pausa obligatoria que se originó por los acontecimientos del año 2009, más los tiempos
       de aprobación por parte del Banco Mundial en alguno de los procesos más importantes
       que se ejecutaron en el Proyecto, así como también la demora en la aprobación de las
       enmiendas al convenio de crédito, provocaron atrasos en los primeros cinco años de
       ejecución del proyecto.
   12. Uno de los aprendizajes más importantes durante la ejecución del Proyecto fue la
       necesaria evaluación y planificación previa de los recursos humanos y tecnológicos con
       que cuenta una institución, a fin de determinar cuántos proyectos es capaz de ejecutar en
       forma simultánea, junto a las además tareas rutinarias que se desempeñan.
   13. Considerando que la simultaneidad de los proyectos fue una de las principales causas de
       problemas en el proceso de implementación, se ha establecido en el BCH y en la CNBS,
       una metodología de priorización de proyectos, tomando en cuenta la disponibilidad de
       recursos monetarios y humanos, así como también por la importancia en el cumplimiento
       de los objetivos institucionales, entre otros.

Subject:           INFORME DE CIERRE PROYECTO 3800-HO


Estimado Juan:

Hago referencia a la videoconferencia sostenida con Ustedes esta mañana, en la que participaron
representantes del BCH y de la CNBS, donde se nos presentó los principales hallazgos y
conclusiones del informe de cierre del Proyecto 3800-HO elaborado por el Banco Mundial.

Tal y como fue manifestado en la videoconferencia, en términos generales los representantes de
ambas instituciones han manifestado su conformidad con el contenido de dicho informe, sin
perjuicio de unas pequeñas observaciones y comentarios que por aparte se las estamos
remitiendo para su consideración.




                                                       44
Por otra parte, estamos esperando la autorización de las autoridades superiores, para remitirles
nuestro informe de cierre que conjuntamente con el BCH hemos preparado.

Nuevamente queremos agradecerle por todas las gestiones que en su calidad de Gerente del
Proyecto ha venido realizando en los últimos cuatro años, lo que indudablemente ha sido un
importante elemento, para que se hayan logrado los resultados obtenidos durante dicho período.

Cordiales saludos

In addition to the general agreement with the content of the ICR expressed above, the borrower
provided more specific comments in a separate file, which were incorporated into this ICR. Such
comments include:

   •   Currently, all large payment transactions are carried out through the RTGS. 71% of the
       number of transactions (covering 94% of the volume of transactions) are submitted
       electronically, while the remainder, namely of those banks which are not yet participating
       fully in the RTGS, are recorded manually in the system;
   •   The borrower asked to revise the wording under Section 4 “Assessment of Risk to
       Development Outcome” to reflect that the high risk for the outcome in the area of AML
       is due to the lack of follow-up on suspicious transactions by the Prosecutor’s Office and
       the judicial branch, and to make clear that the FIU is operating properly.
   •   Under the Section “Lessons Learned”, , the borrower requested to include that some of
       the project’s activities, such as the modernization of the payments system, require the
       simultaneous implementation of legal, technical and institutional reforms to be successful
       and that such reforms therefore cannot be simplified. The borrower stressed in this
       context the importance of capacity building to enable implementing agencies to address
       these issues properly.
   •   Some dates in the text, and data on the relative participation of the Finance Companies in
       Annex 5 were inaccurate and have been corrected.
