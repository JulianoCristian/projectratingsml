       Supply Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) a key lesson learned is that,\n            in certain cases, an emergency operation can be a fitting\n            vehicle to carry forward sector dialogue while averting the\n            collapse of the power sector due to natural or other crises;\n            2) the Bank should consider developing a methodology for\n            estimating monitoring indicators to gauge the efficacy of\n            emergency receptions; and 3) demand side management measures\n            can be an important complement to emergency power."}, "docdt": "2007-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
