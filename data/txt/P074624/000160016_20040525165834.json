High\n            priority recommendations include: arranging the safe\n            disposal of old transformers and scrap material, educating\n            workers about the safe handling of hazardous substances,\n            supplying firefighting equipment, preventing soil and water\n            contamination by building a containment slab and oil-stained\n            waste storage area, preparing and testing and emergency\n            plan, regularly checking water quality for underground\n            contamination, repairing oil separator equipment and\n            building a second interceptor for power house effluents,\n            improving awareness of proper storage and disposal of oil\n            and fuel waste, educating workers about health risks of\n            PCBs, removing and replacing contaminated soil, repairing\n            air conditioners, equipping first aid kits with essential\n            drugs, and replenishing lost or broken lids or slabs to\n            avoid risks of injury or death. Medium-level concerns\n            include:  conducting regular environmental performance\n            reviews, reducing noise impacts by repairing and maintaining\n            machines and enforcing protective gear, conducting regular\n            acoustic surveys, posting signs of high noise levels,\n            providing worker training programs in health and safety\n            issues, installing electronic monitoring devices to check\n            quality of discharged effluents, in storage areas\n            providing/posting additional labeling, warning, and\n            instruction--preferably in a local language-for safety and\n            proper handling of hazardous substances, and setting up a\n            decontamination area."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
