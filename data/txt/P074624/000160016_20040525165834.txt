EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.0   Introduction
The Government of Tanzania has applied to ITA for an Emergency Power Generation
Project which is currently under preparation. Three options are being assessed to assist
TANESCO in meeting its emergency power generation needs:
1. Incremental Fuel for Existing Thermal Power Plants: Imported fuel to run Ubungo-
Songas and Tegeta/IPTL.
2. Emergency Power Plants (EPPs): capacity payments and fuel costs for 30MW of new
short term, leased emergency power generation to be installed at the existing
Ubungo Power Plant facility, and would be fuelled by gas.
3. Auto-generator Fuel and Capacity Payments: up to 30 MW of existing (domestic)
auto-generation capacity which include 18x 1 MW plant to be leased from the Geita
gold mines and to be installed at TANESCO's existing generation site at Mwanza, and
about 10 private sector auto-generators who will be providing power to the grid.
It is a requirement that all World Bank investments must comply with World Bank
Safeguard Policies and environmental guidelines as presented in the Pollution Prevention
and Abatement Handbook (1998) and IFC environmental guidelines.   Hence this
environmental audit was required.
2.0   Objectives of the Audit
The objectives of this environmental audit were:
*: To determine the environmental liabilities of the Nyakato (Mwanza), Tegeta and
Ubungo facilities to the Tanzanian government
*: To establish the need for remedial actions necessary to bring the power plant
facilities into compliance with the World Bank Safeguard policies and environmental
guidelines with the objective of protecting the health of workers and the general
public living in the area as well as to protect the environment.
3.0   Methodology and approach
The environmental auditing was achieved through following approach:
*: Review of relevant documents and preparation of audit framework, criteria and
checklist
*: Site visits (Mwanza, Songas Ubungo and Tegeta-IPTL)
*: Findings evaluation and Report writing

4.0    Major Audit findings
4.1    Mwanza Nyakato site
The facility will comply with the World Bank standard after resolving the observed
weaknesses and short comings in the following areas:
*> There was a problem of waste materials (scrap metals from old machine parts, wire pieces,
old transformers etc,) on the site which needed to be removed or disposed off to make the
power plant clean
*: The existing interceptor was not working properly, it needs maintenance. Storm water flows
into the interceptor making waste fuels and oil to over flow. As a result the waste fuel and
oil contaminate the soil down the drainage system.
*>* Oil spill is not a big problem at the site as the plant has a designated area for lubrication
storage and any spills can be collected for safe disposal. However, improvement in handling
the waste oil is required to all employees and casual labours working with waste oil. Oil drops
from the machines; oil wastes from trenches must be collected and safely disposed.
* There is small regular fuel spills at the fuel unloading bay pollute the nearby soil.
* Fuel and Oil effluents coming from the power house are collected in a pit which has no
interceptor to separate water from oil and fuel. This pit has become a source of soil
pollution at the power plant. A second interceptor is needed for that matter.
*> Some of the old transformers dumped at the yard have oil leakages which contaminate the
soil. Construction of transformer storage bay is needed to prevent transformer oil from
polluting the soil.
*> No emergency plans exist at the plant in case of fire, major accident or major oil spills.
There is a need to prepare an emergency response plan.
*> Fire fighting equipment is inadequate needs to be added
* Working area environment especially the control room needs to be improved by replacing
broken down window air condition units with new ones.
*> Working procedures and instructions are missing. Need to be prepared and be available to
workers
*> Training for people working in the power plant is lacking. There is a need to provide training
on work procedures, health and safety matters, hazardous material handling and emergency
preparedness and response.
*> Monitoring of environment at the power station is absent. There is a need to prepare an
environmental management and monitoring plan.
* Noise level measurements show high noise levels exceeding 85dB outside the power station.
Hence there is a risk of hearing impairment if ear protective gears are not used
*> Some of the signs are missing e.g. no smoking, slippery floor, etc. (risk of injury and safety)
*> Some of the trench slabs and pit lids are missing such that the pits and trenches pose a
safety risks at night or in case of emergency. There is a need for urgent replacement of
lost or broken lids and slabs.
* First aid kit is not equipped and lack essential drugs
* Some of the old transformers stored at the site have oil with traces of PCBs of less than 50
ppm. This calls for proper attention, proper handling and appropriate storage of these
transf ormers.
*> No proper place to dispose or store oil or fuel contaminated substances such as used oil
filters, oil soaked clothing etc. There is a need to construct a designated area to store or
treat the oil contaminated substances before safe disposal
*> Limited clean up of contaminated soil is required to remove all soils that have been
contaminated and replace with clean soil.

4.2    Ubungo- Songas site
Major Findings
The facility complies with the World Bank in many aspects. However the audit found the following
weaknesses:
*: Traces of oil leakage from LM6000 units and ABB GTIO turbines were observed during the
audit which might be washed to the drainage system and pollute the environment.
*: The facility still applies R22 refrigerant in chillers
4.3    Tegeta IPTL Site
Major Findings
The facility complies with the World Bank guideline. However the following weaknesses were
observed:
*: Environmental responsibility issue: As per organization chart provided, the facility does not
have a person assigned with environmental issues though; there is a person responsible with
safety issues. Environmental issues is the responsibility of every employee
*. Emergency Plan issue: in spite the fact that emergency cases are being taken care of by
Knight Support fire brigade, emergency communication flow chart with relevant personnel and
other institutions was missing or not shown

Introduction
1.0 Background
The Government of Tanzania has applied to IDA for an Emergency Power Generation
Project which is currently under preparation. The following are the options that are
being assessed to assist TANESCO in meeting its emergency power generation needs:
(i) Incremental Fuel for Existing Thermal Power Plants: imported fuel to run the two
existing thermal power plants - at the Ubungo (up to 120MW) and Tegeta/IPTL
(10OMW) Power plant facilities, at outputs exceeding non-drought generation levels (i.e.
fuel costs incurred to offset the impact of the drought). It should be noted that with
regard to the Tegeta power plant, IDA is reviewing the possibility of purchasing kWh
output in accordance with the PPA, instead of fuel.
(ii) Emergency Power Plants (EPPs): capacity payments and fuel costs for 30MW of new
short term, leased emergency power generation required to compensate for the
reduced hydropower output which is the result of drought. The EPP would be installed
at the existing Ubungo Power Plant facility, and would be fuelled by gas. An EIA and
Environmental audit has already been carried out at this project site for the Songas
facilities, under Credits 3569-TA and 2497-TA.
(iii) Auto-generator Fuel and Capacity Payments: capacity charges and fuel costs for up
to 30 MW of existing (domestic) auto-generation capacity to augment the leased
capacity noted in (ii) above. This will include 18x 1 MW plant to be leased from the
Geita gold mines and to be installed at TANESCO's existing generation site at Mwanza,
and about 10 private sector auto-generators who will be providing power to the grid
e.g.,(the sugar, mining and tobacco industries, etc.).
The aspects of the proposed Emergency Power Generation Plan for this proposed
Environmental Audit have included: (a) Incremental power generation from the Ubungo
and Tegeta Power plants as noted in (i) above; and (b) auto generation from the Geita
18x1MW gensets at TANESCO's Mwanza facilities, which forms part of (iii) above.
It is a requirement that all World Bank investments must comply with World Bank
Safeguard Policies and environmental guidelines as presented in the Pollution Prevention
and Abatement Handbook (1998) and IFC environmental guidelines. For this work the
following guidelines and policies will be applied: Thermal Power Rehabilitation,
Occupational Health & Safety, PCBs, General Environmental Guidelines and Monitoring,
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), and Natural Habitat (OP 4.04) because of
potential oil pollution.
TANESCO'S Environmental Umt. Apnl 2004  3



1.2 Objectives of the Audit
The objectives of this environmental audit were:
*   To determine the environmental liabilities of the Nyakato (Mwanza), Tegeta and
Ubungo facilities to the Tanzanian government
*   To establish the need for remedial actions necessary to bring the power plant
facilities into compliance with the World Bank Safeguard policies and environmental
guidelines with the objective of protecting the health of workers and the general
public living in the area as well as to protect the environment.
1.3 Scope of Work
The environmental audit which took place between 27th March to 8th April 2004
focused on the existing Ubungo-Songas and Tegeta-IPTL Thermal Power Plant sites and
Nyakato Power Station (TANESCO facility) in Mwanza where the 18x1MW gensets
from the Geita Gold Mines will be installed.
1.4 Methodology and approach
The auditors used the following approach:
1.4.1 Review of relevant documents:
We reviewed all relevant available in house documents including IPTL Environmental
Monitoring Program, Songas Environmental and Social Assessment and Management Plan
(ESAMP) and EIA reports for Ubungo-Songas, Tegeta-IPTL and Nyakato-TANESCO
Mwanza project sites. We also reviewed existing environmental and occupational health
and safety legislation and standards. Finally we reviewed relevant environmental policies
and guidelines of the World Bank including the Pollution Prevention and Abatement
Handbook standards
1.4.2 Site visit
D)uring the site visit we had brief meetings with relevant staff at Ubungo, Tegeta, and
Mwanza power plant facilities followed by the visual inspections. We gathered evidence
through:
*   Physical inspection of the facilities;
*   Examination of selected environmental administrative and operating records;
*   Interviews and discussions with facility management and staff and some people
living in a neighbourhood;
* Verification of procedures, instructions and equipment in place designed to help the
facilities apply and adherence to:
*   Existing environmental laws, regulations, and World Bank standards
*   Occupational health and safety standards
*   Corporate, Sectoral, government and World Bank policies and procedures
*   Good environmental and safety management practices
* Facility's own environmental management plans (EMP)
TANESCO'S Env-,onnental Unit, Apni 2004  4
U~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 



The aspects audited are grouped in the following categories:
* General environmental management;
* Air pollution management;
* Water pollution management;
* Waste management practices;
* Hazardous materials management;
* Groundwater and soil contamination control;
* Occupational health and safety management; and
* Noise management
For the Mwanza site the audit team contracted Bureau of Industrial Cooperation
(BICO) of the University of bar es Salaam to conduct air quality measurement, noise
level measurement, soil and water contamination measurement. Also a limited PCB
identification was conducted by visual inspection and using bexsil PCB screening test
kit. The team utilized the expertise of the geologist from Research and Investigations
unit (TANESCO) to do a geological survey that will help to establish underground water
monitoring boreholes.
1.4.3 Evaluation and Report writing
The obtained information from previous phases helped in evaluation of the audit
findings and to:
*: prepare a prioritized list of concerns (i.e. high, medium, low) related to past and
ongoing activities in the power plants;
* make recommendations and when applicable provided cost estimates for the
implementation of any remediation action plan deemed necessary to comply with
IDA's safe guard policies;
*: prepare an Environmental Management Plan for TANESCO's Mwanza site;
* compile the findings and finalize the report writing.
1.5 Report format

CHAPTER 2
FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT
Any development activity has the potential to impact negatively or positively to the
environment and society. A major national challenge is how to maintain sustainable
development without destroying the environment. One of the useful tools is the
Environmental Audit and Assessment (EAA) which provides an opportunity of knowing
the deficiencies thus initiate actions for improvement in environmental performance.
It is a condition of the Tanzania Government, World Bank and the donor community
that all new major projects undertake environmental and social impact assessment. For
the facility improvement or rehabilitation projects an environmental audit to identify
and address all concerns raised by the project before its implementation is required.
2.1 Tanzanian requirement
In Tanzania each Ministry is responsible for the environmental aspects of all projects
under its jurisdiction. The office of the Vice President (VPO) has an overall role in
environmental issues. The National Environment Management Council (NEMC) advises
the Government on environmental issues and reviews the environmental aspects of the
project. Upon its satisfaction of the project on environmental view point the NEMC
issues the environmental permit (clearance). Currently there is no legislation dealing
with the environment although such legislation is in the final preparation and review.
2.1.1 Environmental review
TANESCO through the Ministry of Energy and minerals needs to apply for
environmental approval (Environmental Permit) from  NEMC.  Upon submitting the
Environmental Impact and Audit Statement, the NEMC will review the document and
issue a Provisional Environmental Permit (PEP) when the document is approved and
accepted.
2.1.2 The National Environmental Policy (NEP 1997)
The National Environmental Policy seeks to provide the framework for making
fundamental changes that are needed to bring environmental considerations into the
mainstream of decision making. It also seeks to provide policy guidelines, plans and
gives guidance to the determination of priority actions, and provides for monitoring and
regular review of policies, plans and programmes.
The policy among other environmental issues, it insists on prevention and control of
land, water, vegetation and air degradation which constitute our life support systems.
Also requires protection of biological diversity of unique ecosystem.

2.1.3 Sectoral Environmental Policies
The following sectoral policies highlight the obligation of any developer on the issue of
environmental protection and conservation.
2.1.3.1     National energy Policy (2003)
The energy policy of February 2003 insists on the need to consider environment in its
totality. Issues such as energy production (construction of electricity facilities, their
operation and maintenance), procurement, distribution, and utilization systems should
be done in an environmentally sound manner.
2.1.3.2     Water policy (1991).
The policy recommended the integrated water resources management, of which the
water resources shall be conserved and water pollution should be avoided. The
relevancy of this policy to this audit study is the need for the project to avoid any
spills, wastes or any harmful substances that may cause water pollution of any kind
during its implementation, operation and decommission.
2.1.4 Environmental Legislation Frameworks
The following Acts also provide a frame work for this environmental audit in Tanzania's
perspective.
2.1.4.1     Water Utilisation Act (1974); amended in 1981
The Act establishes a central Water Board with the authority to regulate use of water,
control water pollution, and formulate standards for effluents and stream quality and
granting of discharge consents. The 1981 amendments include Standards for Receiving
Waters based on their classification (Category 1, 2 or3). The Act provides standards
for Temperature, pH, organic substances and inorganic substances, oil and grease, etc.
The standard allows the maximum limit of 10 ppm of any discharges of oil and grease to
receiving waters. Any discharge of oil and grease in excess of 10 ppm must be treated
before being discharged.
2.1.4.2     The Land Act, 1999
One of the fundamental principles of this Act is to ensure that land is used
productively and that any such use complies with the principles of sustainable
development. Although it does not provide standard value, the implication of this Act to
the Emergency Power Project environmental audit is that the land should be left in a
state where others could use it when the project activities come to an end.
2.1.4.3     National Environmental Management Council Act (1983).
The Act established the National Environment Management Council (NEMC). The
relevance of this Act to this environmental audit is the recognition of NEMC as the
legitimate body in advising the government on all matters relating to the environment
and formulating policy on environmental management; pollution control; developing EIA
TANESCO'S Env-ronmenmal Un,. April 2004  8



guidelines; formulation of proposals for legislation in the area of the environmental
issues and recommends their implementation by the Government. NEMC issues a
Provisional Environmental Permit (PEP) when it is satisfied that the project meets
country environmental requirements.
2.2 International agreements on environment
Tanzania has also committed herself to a number of international agreements on
environment and development. The relevant international agreements to this
environmental audit include:
* Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), adopted in May 1992. The aim of this
convention was on developing national strategies for the conservation and
sustainable use of biological diversity.
* The climate change convention, adopted in May 1992.    The major aim of this
convention is to combat the global worming by reducing emission of green house
gases.
* Convention concerning Protection of Workers against Occupational Hazards in the
Working Environment due to Air pollution, Noise and Vibration, adopted in 1977. The
aim of this convention is to ensure safe working environment for workers.
*  Basel Convention   on  transboundary  movements   of  hazardous wastes   and
environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes.
* Stockholm convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). The convention calls
for all countries to properly manage the pollutants such as Polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and advises restrictions on the marketing, use and disposal of PCBs
2.3 The World Bank
The World Bank, through the International Development Agency (IDA) and the IFC has
Safeguard Policies and environmental guidelines of which a lender need to comply. The
tables below summarize important aspects of these policies and guidelines which do
apply to this Emergency Power Project:

AUDIT FINDINGS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
RESPONSE
3.1 Mwanza Nyakato site
The Environmental audit for the Mwanza site took place between 27 and 31 March 2004.
3. 1.1 Site setting
Nyakato Power Station commissioned in 1978 is located about 7 km from the city centre along the
Mwanza -Musoma main road. The power station had an installed capacity of 18 MW from four
generator sets each 4.5 MW. However, capacity was reduced to 12.5 MW after one machine
failed during commissioning. The current power availability is only 7 MW. During the time of
Environmental audit only one generator was in operational producing 3.5 MW. The facility is
connected to the National Power Grid. Presently the facility has a workforce of 16 people. The
plant is owned and operated by TANESCO.
Besides the power house, the facility has above surface fuel storage tanks (Industrial Diesel Oil -
IDO), lubrication oil area, electrical workshop, Mechanical workshop, office block, warehouse,
switchyard, control room and TANESCO employee housing adjacent to the grid substation.
3.1.2Findings and Recommendations
A. 1   General Environmental Management
The environmental management and auditing is centralized at TANESCO Head office. TANESCO
has no formalized Environmental Management System (EMS) though it is in the process of
establishing one. Although TANESCO has the environmental unit, it does not have its own budget
to carry out its environmental plans.
A.1.1. Environmental management and responsibilities
(GMP, Company Policy)                                        Priority rating: B
1. The environmental management system is not comprehensive and is not formalised
2. Tracking of existing and imminent environmental legislation is not systematically done
3. Environmental issues are not managed by plans and target setting
4. The facility has no plans for training and education on environmental awareness and knowledge.
All training issues are arranged at head office bar es Salaam
5. The facility has no periodic review of environmental performance
6. The facility has got no EMP
7. The facility has not assigned anybody the responsibility of environmental affairs
TANESCO'S En-ironment=l Unit, AprMi 2004  16
U~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A.2    General Environmental Management of the Facility
The facility has above surface fuel tanks such that any leakage of the fuel will be detected. The
facility is also equipped with water oil/fuel separator though at present one is not enough and it is
not performing as it is supposed to work. Lubrication storage area is concreted to prevent soil
contamination. Fuel tanks have a retaining wall to retain fuel in case of spillage accident. The
facility has storm water drainage system and power house drainage system; however some of the
storm water goes into the interceptor (water-oil separator). There have been efforts to maintain
the generating units as required but spare parts are sometimes not available.

2. Hazardous material and wastes:
(a) The storage of oil drums and fuel have containment that do not allow spillage to
contaminate soil or surface and groundwater. However, storage of old transformers which
may have traces of PCBs is not properly done and some transformers were leaking.
(b) No labelling is done at site. Identification follows manufacturers' instructions on the
container itself
TANESCO'S Environmental Unit, April 2004   18
U~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



(c) Handling of hazardous material and particularly waste oil seems to have a problem.
Several places were observed to have contaminated by oil or fuel spillage.
(d) Although fire extinguishers are present, they are not enough to contain large incident of
f ire.
(e) Although some areas are equipped to control and prevent oil or fuel spills, some areas
need to be redesigned to provide spill control mechanism. The areas include waste
collection point and oil separator pit behind the power station (see plate 21).
3. Solid wastes:
*  Solid wastes in particular scrap metals have not been properly kept. Some are inside the
power house some are located outside and some behind the warehouse.
*  In spite of having a body within TANESCO (The Board of Survey) that deals with issue of
disposal of unneeded items including scrap metals, there is a problem still of disposing
scrap metals at Nyakato Power station
4. Ambient noise: Measurements are presented in report by BICO which is herewith appended.
However, the results show that they are on high side above 70 dB even at distance of 100m
from the power station and just out side the power station the levels are at 95 dB. All these
measurements are day time measurements which are not expected to change significantly
during the night time. These values exceed the World Bank limit in industrial area which puts
the limit at 70 dB for both day and night.
5. Record keeping:
The facility engineer admitted keeping record on accident incidents in the monthly report sent
to Head Office, although no evidence was shown to the auditors. Other records such as air
emissions, effluents discharges, spills and fire incidents have no records at the site.
6. Monitoring: monitoring plan and monitoring report
The facility has no monitoring plan to monitor air quality, discharged water quality, soil
contamination or solid and liquid waste
7. Emergency Plan:
The facility has no emergency response plan in case of spills, fire or major accidents.
8. The regular inspections are mainly done for safety reasons
Recommendation A. 2.1.1:
(a) The air emission levels are within the range acceptable by the WB. However, regular
measurement preferably two times a year should be planned.
(b) The quality of discharged water particularly the limit of oil and grease which is limited to
10 ppm (Tanzanian limit levels) should be measurement regularly (monitored)
Recommendation A. 2.1.2:
TANESCO'S Environmental Umt, April 2004    19
U~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



(a) Construct appropriate storage area for the old and new transformers and arrange safe
disposal of old transformers
(b) Additional labelling and warning or instruction should be posted in storage areas for
safety and proper handling
(c) Impart environmental awareness and knowledge to employees working in the power house
compound and risks they pose for their careless handling of hazardous substances such as
waste oil or fuel
(d) Supply additional fire fighting equipment
(e) Construct the containment slab and oil stained waste storage area to prevent further soil
and water contamination
Recommendation A. 2.1. 3:
(a) Empty the designated area for storing scrap materials (currently the area is almost full of
unwanted electrical wastes) and use it to store solid waste waiting for disposal.
(b) The power station management should identify all unwanted materials and scrap materials
and contact TANESCO's Board of Survey to countercheck the materials and dispose all
unwanted scraps.
Recommendation A.2.1.4: Since the power station is old and the financial implications of
installing noise silencers or barriers only quality maintenance of machines should be maintained
and noise personal protective gears should be strictly enforced.
Recommendation A.2.1.5: Start to keep record for facility own use and performance
improvements
Recommendation A. 2.1. 6: Adopt and implement the EMP (appended)
Recommendation A.2.1.7: Prepare an emergency plan including line of communications and
regularly hold a drill to check whether it works as intended
Recommendation A.2.1.8: Regular inspections should also include environmental and health
checks and not only safety
Comment A.2.1: Apart from having EMP needs to rectify some of deficiencies highlighted above
in order to meet minimum requirement.
MAonagement response A. 2:
A.2.2 Contractor control
(WB)
The facility has no any policy or instructions designed to control contractors' environmental
behaviour working on its compound.
TANESCO'S Envronmental Unat, Apnl 2004   20
U~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Recommendation A. 2.2: prepare instructions to control a contractor working on the compound
on all behaviours that will impact the environment. Otherwise before the contractor is awarded
the contract s/he should submit his work plan proposal that include how the environment is going
to be protected during the course of project execution.
Management response A. 2. 2:
A.3    Air Pollution Management
There is no any mechanism to control SOx, NOx, C02, CO and smoke except to maintain quality
maintenance though getting all spares is expensive and hard to get.
A.3.1 Identification and evaluation of air emissions
(Policy, WB)
The facility knows its air emission source to be the generation units and industries around the
plant may influence the air quality of the compound. However, no documentation is done.
Recommendation A.3.1: Avail machine spare parts at appropriate time to maintain quality
maintenance
Management Response A. 3.1:
A.4    Water Pollution Management
The facility has oil separator unit. However, storm water drainage system allows some water to
go to this interceptor causing the interceptor to overflow whenever it rains. In addition, there
is no plan in place to empty the intercepted oil or fuel from the interceptor. Spilled fuel
collecting channel at fuel unloading bay are blocked and another temporary container has been
buried nearby. Effluents from the power station are collected in one pit that is not connected
to the interceptor. Emptying waste fuel/oil from this pit is required regularly but no disposal
area is available
A.4.1        Meeting Internal and External bemands
(WB, Water policy and Standards requirement)               Priority A
The facility has no monitoring system to ensure that surface and underground water is not
contaminated
TANESCO'S envronmental U,t. Apnl 20(4   21



Recommendation A.4.1: Drill two bore holes and measure water quality regularly to check
whether there is under ground contamination.
Recommendation A. 4. 2     Repair existing water oil separator and construct the second
interceptor for power house effluents and regularly check whether they are performing as
intended
Comment A.4: To meet minimum WB requirement implement recommendation A 4.2 and plan for
recommendation A.4.1
Management Response A. 4:
A.5    Waste Management
The facility has requested for the incinerator from Head Office for the purpose of incinerating
solid and some liquid waste including slugs. Also it has a system of giving waste oil to people in
need of oil for timber treatment. The facility has also a plan to sell the waste oil to the
industries for re use in boilers.
A.5.1 Meeting Internal and External Demands
(WB guidelines-Requirement to manage waste to prevent spills, contamination, poisoning
etc. for the health of environment and its ecosystem, Meeting bemands: PCB Management
Program, Meeting Demands: CFC Management Program)
1. Apart from relying on performance of the interceptor, there is little effort to prevent
oil pollution at the facility through proper handling of collected oil and fuel waste.
Disposal mechanism of waste oil is not well defined.
2. There is inadequate facility or equipment to store waste oil/fuel and collection
(emptying separator pits is not systematically done). In spite of the demand of waste oil
by local people there is no clear system of collecting this waste oils
3. The facility has a system of selling empty containers (normally drums) hence no empty
container problem. However, there is no appropriate area to store or dispose the oil and
grease contained filters or clothing. Secondary containment for some of the equipment
that may pause oil contamination are missing
4. The old transformers, which some of them are suspected to have traces of PCBs (the
tested sample showed one transformer to contain PCB of less than 50 PPM) are just
lying at the compound and some of them are leaking (see plate 25). At the same time
some of the workers do not know the risks of PCBs substances.
Recommendation A.5. 1.1: Check the performance of the interceptors regularly and have a plan
to empty the separator pits. Improve awareness of proper handling of collected oil and fuel
TANESCO'S Envmronmental Un,t. Apnl 2004  22



waste. If possible arrange and contract with a certified waste oil disposal company to deal with
waste disposal
Recommendation A.5. 1.2: Design a clear system of emptying separator pits and safely dispose
the waste oil or give away for reuse by local people
Recommendation A.5.1.3 Construct appropriate area to store and treat the oil and grease
contained filters and clothing before safely disposal.
Recommendation A.5.1.4: Construct a storage area for transformers and safely dispose
unwanted ones. Raise awareness to other workers that do not know the health risks of PCBs
materials. Additionally identify (test kit) and segregate all transformers with suspected cases.
|Monogement Response A.5:|
A.6    Soil and groundwater Contamination Control
l | ~~~Interceptors and containment in place but need to be checked frequently if they perform as|
intended. Awareness is needed for cleaners and maintenance workers
A.6.1 Identification of potential contamination risks and opportunities for prevention
(EMP, WB)
1. Soil contamination was observed in some areas behind the power station, fuel unloading
bay and down the channel of discharged water from the interceptor.
2. Awareness of employees or people cleaning the drainage trenches about the risk of soil
and ground water contamination seem to be small as some of the contamination has been
caused by mishandling of the fuel and waste oil.
Recommendation A.6.1.1: Remove the contaminated soil and replace with uncontaminated soil.
Recommendation A.6.1.2: Raise awareness of employees and other people handling waste oil or
oil containing materials about the risk of soil contamination and how to properly handle oil and
fuel.
Management Response A. 6.1:
A.7    Noise Management
The facility provides personal protective gears to workers working inside the power station.
The facility does not have a program to carry out regular acoustic surveys in work places and
neighbourhood and no warning signs have been posted to alert and remind people to put on their
protective gears.
TANESCO'S Env.ronmental Unit, Apnl 2004  23



Recommendation A. 7: Have a program of carrying out regular acoustic surveys especially when
installing new equipment and post signs warning people of the high noise levels
Management Response A. 7:
A.8 Occupational health and Safety
The facility has the first aid kit, provides personal protective gears and lighting is sufficient.
There is a system of checking if employees put on their protective gears and uniforms.
1. At the time of this auditing, the control room ventilation was poor and needed the air
condition units to work again.
2. The First Aid kit was lacking essential medication and equipment and needed to be re
equipped
3. Clear instructions and penalties to employees violating safety requirement were missing
4. Training programs for workers on the issues of health and safety were not available though
good safety practices were partially implemented.
5. Working procedure and safety instructions were not available
6. Some of the trench slabs and pit lids are missing such that the pits and trenches pose a
safety risks at night or in case of emergency.
Recommendation A.8.1: Repair the air conditions and fix them again or replace with new ones
Recommendation A.8.2:Re-equip the First Aid Kits with essential drugs as required
Recommendation A.8.3: Prepare and distribute simple guidelines for employees in a known
language
Recommendation A.8.4: Avail and implement training programs to workers on the issues health
and safety and on job training
Recommendation A.8.5: Prepare working procedures and safety instruction which must be
rehearsed

B.2    General Environmental Management of the Facility
The facility has above surface fuel tanks such that any leakage of the fuel may be early on
detected. The facility is also equipped with water oil/fuel separators and plans to install
hydrocarbon electronic detectors between the waste water discharge point and separators to give
an alarm to the operators whenever the hydrocarbons (oil/fuel) exceed the limit value. Any
equipment potential to cause oil contamination such as transformers and fuel tanks have been
contained and have retaining walls to prevent soil and ground water contamination. These
containments are connected with interceptors to hold any spillage. The facility monitors air
emission and liquid effluents coming from the power station.

Dear Sir,
RE:  EMERGENCY POWER GENERATION PROJECT
ToR FOR THE ASSIGNEI) TASKS AT MWANZA POWER PLANT
We are currently making preparations for the implementation of the
Emergency Power Generation Project (EPGP), a project that will also explore
generation improvement at the Mwanza Power Plant. The preparatory studies
include Environmental Audit to be undertaken by our Environmental Unit.
Referring to earlier verbal communication between Mr. John Lazimah our
Environmental unit staff and Dr. Masanja of Chemical and Process
bepartment on 11 March 2003, we need the following services from you:
1. Ambient Air quality measurement: to know the current status of air
pollution from existing power plant( 3 points) on the following
parameters: Levels of SOx, NOx, C02, Hydrocarbon and Particulate
Matters.
2. Noise level Measurements: Inside and Outside the power house and on
the surrounding area where the additional generators will be installed
3. Soil sampling and contamination testing: Parameters needed include
pH, Nitrates, Sulphates, Calcium Carbonate, moisture content, Heavy



metals, and electrical conductivity and the depths at which the
samples were taken.
4. Water quality: Surface or underground water in the vicinity of the
power plant if any and test the following parameters, pH, oil content,
conductivity, TSS, 504, Cl, Cr, BOb, Phenol, and TKN (total kjeld
Nitrogen).
You are also requested to provide us with a brief report on sampling, testing,
analysis of the results and interpretation.
We would also like to inform you that this task should be treated as very
urgent and results are required by 5th April 2004.    The traveling
arrangement to Mwanza remains the same i.e. Iar- Mwanza 27/3/2004 and
returning date Mwanza - Dar 29/3/2002.
Yours faithfully,
For: TANZANIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED.
