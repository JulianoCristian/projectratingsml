Macroeconomic Performance

1.       Since the mid-l990s, Tanzania has made substantial progress inmacroeconomic
stabilization and structural reforms of the economy. At the beginning o fthe reform process,
economic growth was slow to gain momentum, but over the last five years or so ithas averaged
more than five percent. The positive development continued into 2002 when real gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by about 6.3 percent. As a result o f the impact o f the drought on agriculture,
real growth in2003 i s projectedat 5.5 percent.

2.       Inflationremainedbelow five percent in2003. Annual inflationdeclinedto 4.4 percent at
end-2002 (from 4.9 percent in2001), but increased slightlyto 4.8 percent by February 2004, due
to food shortages.Non-food price inflation declinedrapidly from a peak o f 9.6 percent inJanuary
2003 to 0.6 percent by December 2003.

3.       Higherreal growth inthe agricultural sector (which accounts for almost halfof GDP) has
been accomplished through the liberalizationof marketingstructures, as well as o f agricultural
prices and the foreign exchangeregime. Fiscal consolidationhas beencentral to the success in
macroeconomic stabilization. Insupport of Tanzania's reform program, donors have provided
sizable financial assistanceand this has almost eliminated the Government's domestic financing
needs. This has again led to lower interest rates and stimulated private sector growth.

4.       Fiscal developments inFY2002/03 were characterized bybetter than projectedrevenue
performance, as well as higher-than-expected expenditure. Revenue exceededprojectionsby 0.3
percent of GDP on account of buoyant revenue from Value Added Tax and income tax. Total
expenditure exceededprojectionsby 1.2 percent o f GDP, due to a higher than projectedend-of-
year catch up inrecurrent expenditures and the upwardrevision o f development expenditures
financed with foreign grants. Through January o f FY 2003/04, revenue exceededprojectionsby
0.2 percent of GDP, as tax revenue continued to be strong, partly as a result of the
implementationo f measuresto curtail smugglingo fpetroleum imports, and the impact of strong
collections of income tax. Duringthe same period, actual expenditure was 0.9 percent of GDP, or
below projections, reflecting lower-than-programmed interest payments, as well as lower-than-
projectedforeign and domestically-financed development expenditure. InFebruary 2004,
Parliament passeda supplementary budget which covers additional drought relatedexpenditures
inthe power sector, for restockingthe strategic grainreserve, andfor the purchase ofanew
government aircraft. The additional expenditure o f about TShl87 billion is to be financed
through a combination of higher than budgetedprogram support inflows, lower than budgeted
debt service payments and from a drawdownofreserves from the BankofTanzania.

5.       The discussion of the macroeconomic framework inthe last Poverty ReductionStrategy
ProgressReportpoints out that despite strong revenue performance, a major challenge remains to
raise the revenue to GDP ratio. The projectedmedium-term revenue targets are achievable, with
implementationo f a comprehensive strategy for reform o f tax administration andpolicy. Inthis
respect, the report notes appropriately the importance of eliminating exemptions, as well as of a
review of tax laws. To improve tax administration, the Government is reorganizing the Tanzania
Revenue Authority.

6.       Through December 2003, the Bank o f Tanzania (BOT)maintained a tight stancewith
respect to monetary policy with a view to meetingthe established reserve money targets. Reserve

money and net domestic assets of the BOTremainedsignificantly below the December 2003
targets, as the BOTmore stringently enforced a standingrequirement for commercial banks to
expeditiously transfer to the BOTtax revenue heldby the Tanzania Revenue Authority inbank
accounts, and inaddition, actively engagedinopen market operations. As a result of these
actions, money supply growth at end-December 2003 remainedbelow projections bymore than 4
percentage points. The liquidity squeeze inSeptember2003 resultedinsome commercial banks
being unable to meet reserve requirements, and ledto temporarily highinterest rates on the
interbank market. InOctober 2003, the liquiditysituation loosenedas aresult of the BOT'S
injection of liquidityand a drawdownof deposits by the Government. Through December 2003,
credit to the private sector increasedby 43 percent, which was significantly above projections,
fueled inpart by increasedcompetition inthe banking system and the reduction ininterest rate
spreads.

7.          Tanzania's overall balance o fpayments position improved in2002/2003 becauseof larger
inflows of donor assistanceand the impact o f debt reliefunder the Heavily IndebtedPoor
Country Initiative. However, the current account deficit, excluding officialtransfers, widened
slightly. There was a strong increaseinnon-traditional exports, mainly gold, combinedwith a
moderate improvement intraditional exports, reversing a declining trend. Through the first half
o f 2003/04, balance o f payments developments remainedinline with projections, as imports,
notably petroleum imports, acceleratedand export growth was inline with expectations.
International reserves substantially exceededprojections due to increasesof donor inflows and
exports ofnon-traditional commodities and services. The exchange rate against the US.dollar
depreciated to TShl110 per dollar by endJanuary, and has since remainedstable. Inreal effective
terms, it depreciated by about 2 percent, which combined with a modest recovery o f the terms o f
trade, improved the environment for exports. The exchangerate i s now close to what the
InternationalMonetary Fundhas estimated as an equilibriumreal exchange.

8.           The Government has made further progress inimplementingreforms inthe public
enterprise sector. At end 2002, a concession for the Dar es SalaamWater and SewerageAuthority
was granted to a British-German consortium. Meanwhile, the financial position and managerial
capacity of TANESCO have continuedto improve following the introductiono f anew
management team inmid-2002. The sale of 49 percent o f Air Tanzania to South African Airways
was completed inNovember 2002. InDecember 2003, Government offered49 percent o f the
shares of the National Microfinance Bank for sale to an investor consortium ledby a commercial
bank and consisting o f micro-finance institutions. This will be followed by the sale o f a further
21percent o f shares to domestic investors.

The 2003 Drought

9.           In2003,boththelongrains(March-May) andtheshortrains(October -December)
failed inlarge areas o f the country. Data indicates that water inflows to the overall hydropower
system were two thirds of the average inflow over the past 25 years. The 2003 inflow to the
MteraReservoir, the most important reservoir inTanzania's hydropower system, wasjust 40% o f
the 60-year average inflow.

10.       Imuact of the Drought on Food Security Followingthe poor longrains in2003, an
assessment was conducted by the Ministryo f Agriculture and Food Security inJuly in
conjunctionwith a multi-agency Food Security InformationTeam. The team identified47
districts, mostly inthe central and northern areas with apopulationof 2 million, as being inneed
o f food assistance, with a corresponding food assistancerequirement of 77,500 million tons. In
August 2003, the Government launched anappeal for food aid.

11,       The situationas ofMarch2004 continuedto reflect the on-going impact ofthe 2003
drought. Harvestingof the 2003/04 short Vuli season cereal crops inthe bi-modal rainfall areas i s
almost complete. The overall outlook i s poor due to inadequaterainfall. Ina few of the highland
areas inthe Kilimanjaro Region, crops such as maize and beans were reported to be ingood
condition. The aggregate 2003/04 productiono f cereals has been forecast at about 4 milliontons,
or about 11percent below the previous marketingyear and 5 percent below the average for the
previous five years. Below normal rainfall has also affected pasture conditions and raisedalarms
concerning livestockproductivity, thoughrecent rainfall has raisedhopes for some recovery.

12.       Reflecting low supply, maize prices continuedto rise inseveral markets, aggravating the
food-security situation. Sharp increasesinmaize prices were notedparticularly inthe southem
highlands and central Tanzania.

13.       Serious food shortageswere reportedinseveralregions, includingDodoma, Shinyanga,
Singida, Manyara, Lindi, Coast andMorogoro. Also, there are pockets o f food insecurity in
Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Mwanza, Mara andTabora Regions, where crops failed due to
drought. The Food Security InformationTeam andWorld Food Programprioritized 24 districts in
10 regions to receive available food aid.

14.       Impact of the Drought on the Power Sector. In2002, TANESCO generated 97% of its
grid-based electricity requirements from hydropower sources. (See Demand and Supply
Characteristics, paragraphs 18-20 for full descriptionofthe power system). Despite the poor
inflows in2003, TANESCO maintained a highlevel of hydropower generation through the first
halfof 2003, meeting 83% of the annual loadwith hydro power generation. The continuedhigh
level of hydro output in2003 was achieved by "mining" the Mtera reservoir. The effect was that
the Mtera reservoirwas severely depleted, and by the beginning of February2004, the reservoir
level was at 690.31meters above sea level, or only 0.3 lmabove the minimumlevelrequired for
generation'.

15.       Evenwith the drawdown onthe Mterareservoir, TANESCO beganpurchasingelectricity
from the lOOMWIPTLPower Plant inJuly 2003 at a capacity factor of about 90%. TANESCO
had to postpone its capital works programto divert funds to cover the cost o f the additional
thermal generation. Followingthe poor (October-December) short rains in2003, the declining
reservoir level at Mtera forced TANESCO to negotiate with Songas, the private operator o fthe
Ubungo Power Plant, to operate two o f the refurbishedUbungo gas turbine unitson expensive Jet
A1 fuel startinginDecember 2003. Havingexhaustedits cashreserves, inNovember 2003
TANESCO requested financial assistance from the Government. Since then, the Government
provided a cashinfusiono f about US$43 million equivalent, o f which US$15 millionwas to



`As of  May 3,2004 (effectively the endofthe rainy season), the reservoir level at Mterahadrisen to 2.76
meters above the minimumlevel. A level of 6.5 meters above the minimumlevel wouldbe requiredto
fully utilize the capacity ofthe Mtera andKidatuhydropowerfacilities.

Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project              7

reconcile outstanding Government electricity accountsreceivable before 20022. Since December
2003, TANESCO has beenspending about US$8 millionper month(compared withmonthly
revenues ofUS$15 million) on imported Jet A1 fuel to run80MW at the Ubungo Power Plant
andto purchase energy from the IPTLPower Plant.

 16.      Because o fthe depletiono f the Mterareservoir during2003, generation from the Mtera
and downstream Kidatu Power Stations will be limitedin2004. The overall contributionto
power generation from the hydro power plants in2004 i s expectedto meetjust 54% of the
demand, resultinginsubstantially higher-than-average reliance on thermal generation ifsevere
load-shedding i s to be avoided. Furthermore, TANESCO will start 2005 with a very low level o f
water inthe Mterareservoir. Inorder to replenishthe Mtera reservoir, heavy reliance on thermal
generation will continue through 2005 even under optimistic rainfall scenarios.

 17.      TANESCO i s now unable to pay for fuel for the extra thermal generation that i s needed
to make up for the reducedhydropower output in2004, and there is a shortage o f thermalpower
generation capacity. About 36MW of new thermal power capacity isrequired inOctober 2004,
with a second36MW neededinearly 2005. Private financing is envisaged for the new thermal
capacity and negotiations with a private sponsor, Songas, are under way. The Govemment,
TANESCO and IDAhave mapped out the actions needed, including the proposed IDA support,
privately-financed new thermal capacity and measuresto improve TANESCO's revenues, aimed
at addressingthe emergency situation in2004 and ensuringthat no further emergency assistance
would berequired in2005.

Status of the Power Sector

18.       Demand and Supply Characteristics. TANESCO's peak demand o f 506MW occurred in
December 2003. During2003, a total of 3,066GWh was generated, with a monthly demand low
o f 233GWh inFebruaryand a highof 275GWh inDecember.

 19.      TANESCO's interconnected grid system has an installedcapacity o f 773MW, of which
 557MW (70%) is hydropower. TANESCO has dispatched hydropower aheado f thermal
 generation because of the lower variable energy costs. Inanon-drought year, most of the
 electricity (97% in2002) i s generated from hydropower. The table below summarizes the
 characteristics o fTANESCO's existinggeneration plant. TANESCO also operates about 30MW
 o f thermal generation inisolatedareas not connected to the grid.




 'Since2002,     the Government and the Zanzibar State Fuel and Power Corporation have been current in
 their electricity payments.

20.      TANESCO's largest hydropower complex, the MteraandKidatuDams, i s on the Great
Ruaha River. The Mtera dami s the most important reservoir inthe power system providing over-
year storage capability. Also, it regulates the outflows to maintain the water level for the
downstream Kidatuhydropower plant. Thermal generation inTanzania currently relies on
importedHeavy FuelOil (HFO), Jet A1 (aviation) fuel and Automotive Gas Oil. Concerning
thermal generation, the Songo Songo gas infrastructurefacilities, supported under Credit 3569-
TA, are expected to be commissioned around July 1,2004, at which time the ownership ofthe
Ubungo Power Plant will be transferred to Songas (the private gas and power company) andrun
on indigenous gas insteadof Jet A1 fuel. In 1995, agreementswere also signed with private
Malaysian investors for the constructionof the lOOMW diesel IPTL Power Plant located at
Tegeta. InApril 1998 duringthe constructionphase, TANESCO issued anotice o f default to the
private investors because, inits view, project costs were inflated. After several rounds o f
negotiations when the differences between the partiesremainedunresolved, TANESCO submitted
the matter to the InternationalCenter for Settlement of InvestmentDisputes (ICSID) inNovember
1998. InJuly 2001, the arbitration panel issued its final rulingonthe case based on the evidence
that hadbeenpresented.As a result of the arbitrationproceedings, the final capital cost o f the
plant, for the purposes of calculation of the tariff, was reduced by 25 percent. The IPTL Power
Plant was subsequently commissioned inFebruary 2002 and operates on HFO.

 21.      Govemment's Power Sector Reform Program. Power sector reformhas been on the
 Government's agenda for several years andmucho f the preparatory work has been completed.
 An electricity sectorreform act hasbeendrafted to facilitate the development andpromotionof,

and increasedprivate sector participation in, the expansion of electricity services. The analysis of
possible market structureshas been completed and work i s on-going to define the market rules
and to establish a regulatory agency. The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority
(EWURA)will beresponsible for the electricity, gas, water and seweragesectors.

22.      Against this backdrop, there has been significant progress inimproving the performance
of TANESCO and ineffecting a financial turn-around inthe power sector, bothpre-requisites for
further privateparticipation. InMay 2002, NetGroupof SouthAfrica was awarded atwo year
Management Contract for TANESCO. The achievements o fthe performance basedmanagement
contract over the past 2 years have beensignificant (see paragraphs 25-28). Inview of
internationalmarket conditions, however, andthe need for further improvementsinTANESCO's
operational performance and its financial situationbeforesuccessful privatization would be
feasible, the Government has decided to extend the performance-based Management Contract for
around 3-5 years. The new contract would be basedonrevisedperformance incentives aimed at
reducing losses, increasing connections (after the emergency period), investing insystem
rehabilitation, and the functional unbundling(ring fencing) o f generation, transmission and
distribution. A decision on the timingfor launching private participationfor the concessioning o f
TANESCO would be basedon future internationalmarket conditions and completion o f
necessaryreforms.

23.      Recognizingthat continuedsignificant Government subsidies for the power sector have
constrainedTanzania's poverty reduction agenda, the Government, with assistance from the
donor community including IDA, has laid out a 2-year plan to complete the transformation of
TANESCO from a recipient o f Government subsidy, to a commercial entity. The plan includes
extension o fthe Management Contract with appropriate incentives to achieve the performance
improvements notedabove, implementation o f a power sector debt restructuringplanto clean up
TANESCO's balance sheet inpreparationfor privatization, andtariff adjustments. A three month
extension to the existingmanagement contract has been granted to permit adequatetime to
formulate the scope andperformance benchmarks for the next phase of the 3-5 year Management
Contract.

24.      Effective May 1,2004, TANESCO's Board of Directors approved a tariff increase of
4.3%, basedinpart on lowering the lifeline tariffblock from 100kwhto 50 kwhper month.
TANESCO will continue to review the level o f tariffs on a six monthbasis, andwill modify tariff
levels up to 5% bi-annually, which is withinthe authority of TANESCO's Boardof Directors. A
comprehensive tariff study i s proposed for financing under Credit 3569-TA. This study will
update estimateso f the longruncost o fpower supply, propose a mechanism for indexing o f
tariffs, and examine other measures(e.g. time o f day tariffs, a quota mechanismfor application in
the event of future supply shortfalls, and application of geographically differentiated tariffs), to
ensure that price signals to consumers encourage the efficient use o f electricity and that tariffs are
maintainedat a levelnecessaryto ensure financial sustainability o f the power sector.

25.      TANESCO's Financial and OperationalPerformance and Prospects. Following a
competitive selection process, inMay 2002 the Government appointed NetGroup Solutions
(South Africa) to manageTANESCO under a two-year perfonnance-based management contract,
withTrust Fundsupport from the Swedish InternationalDevelopmentAssociation (SIDA). Under
the leadership o f the new management team andwith support from the Government,
TANESCO's operational and financial performance have improved significantly over the past
two years. Since May 2002: (i)    TANESCO's billing collectionrate (excluding settlement o f
prior Government arrears) improved from 76% to 92%; (ii)      staff numberswere reducedby 1,428
to 4,991 employees; (iii) TANESCOpaid down TSh33 billion of outstanding commercial debt;

(iv) system lossesdeclined from 27% to 24%; (v) administrationand overhead costs were
reducedby about 20% andTANESCO has obtained more competitive prices from suppliers ;and
(vi) TANESCO hasanimprovedcredit rating inthe market, which enabledTANESCO to access
the domestic capital market. The resultingimprovements incash inflows enabled TANESCO to
finance: (i)  staff redundancy costs of TSh22 billion, (ii)efficiency improvement costs of TSh7.5
billion, and (iii) capital investments of TShl1.3 billion. NetGroup's efforts to train and empower
TANESCOstaffhave dramatically improvedmorale andproductivity. When the Management
Contractor first entered TANESCO, it was under police protection. Now, two years later with the
contract up for renewal, TANESCO staffhave publicly supported an extension.

26.      System lossesremain at a relatively highlevel, inpart due to systemoverloadand lack o f
fundsto implementreliefprojects suchasreplacement offaulty meters. Itis plannedthat funds
available under Credit 3569-TA would be made available to address urgent distributionand
transmission constraints.

29.      Inspite oftheseimprovements, TANESCO's financial situationcontinues to beweak.
The 2003 drought had a negative impact onTANESCO's financial situationbecausethe cost of
imported fuel for thermal generation alternatives to hydropower has been very highcompared to
TANESCO's present tariff. TANESCO's current operational requirements cannot be met from
its presentrevenues. According to the latest estimates for 2004 under the probablehydro
scenario, TANESCO's cash shortfall at the operating level is expected to be around TSh23 billion
(US$20 million equivalent).

30.      Electricitv Tariffs. InU S dollar terms, the weighted average electricity revenue declined
by 30% from US$0.095 per kwhin 1999, to US$0.066 per kwhin2003. This is highly
significant since 65% to 70% o f TANESCO's revenue requirements, even ina non-drought year,
are foreign exchange dependent. TANESCO's tariffneedsto be adjusted to correct the erosion of
tariffs over the past five years and narrow the gap between the cost of service andrevenues.

31.      Further to the May 2004 4.3% tariff adjustment, TANESCO's fundingrequirements
duringthe 2004/05 periodwill haveto bemetthrough a combination ofmeasures, including: (i)
furtherreductions inoperating costs; (ii) improvements inoperational performance
                                           further

Government's Responseto PastDroughts

32.      There have beenseveral major shortages of electricity inTanzania duringthe last decade.
In1994, TANESCOwas unable to supply about lOOMWofload, which was equivalent to about
one thirdo f maximum demand inthe interconnected system at that time. In 1997, TANESCO
shed about 50MW of load. Load sheddingo f about 30 percent or 90MW occurred again in
November and December 2000. Ineach case, load-shedding hasbeenprecipitatedbypoor
rainfallinTanzania's predominantly hydroelectric system, highlightingTanzania's over-reliance
on hydropower and inadequate or unaffordable thermal power generation. Initially, the
Government's responseto past droughts was to install thermal generation operating on imported
liquidfuel. About 37MW ofthermal generation was installedin 1994, anadditional 75MW of
thermal generation in 1995, and the 1OOMW IPTLthermal Power Plant was commissioned in
2002. However, the highcost o f energy charges from these plantsrelative to TANESCO's
revenues has limitedthe success o f this approach. The current emergency situation i s a case in
point: inaddition to a thermal capacity shortage, TANESCO is facing an energy shortage as it i s
unable to afford the cost o frunningthe Ubungo Power Plant gas turbines on Jet A1 fuel and the
energy charges from the IPTLPower Plant.

Tanzania EmergencyPower Supply Project                       12
TechnicalAnnex

33.       Recognizingthis over dependenceon hydropower, the Government undertookthe
diversificationo f Tanzania's electricity generation sourcesby soliciting private sponsors to
develop indigenous natural gas resource as part of the World Bank-assisted Songo Songo Gas
Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA). The gas infrastructuresystem and
conversion of the Ubungo Power Plant to gas-firing i s scheduled for commissioning around July
1,2004. The availability o f gas will significantly reduce the energy charges for thermal power
generation and the consequentdrain on TANESCO's cash flow.

The TANESCO/ GovernmentEmergencyPlanfor the Power Sector

34.       When the October-December short rains in2003 didnot materialize, TANESCO
considered the potential sources o f generation shown inthe table below, together with their unit
costs, with the objective o fprocuring the least cost options to make up for the reduced
hydropower output expected in2004. The option of utilizingthe dead storage of the Mtera
reservoir for power generation at the downstream KidatuPower Plant was considered and
rejected since it has bothnegative environmental and longterm power generation consequences.

                EmergencyPower Supply Options: SourcesandUnitCostsper kWh




    * About   US$O.O7ikWh o fthis total amount i s the (variable) energy charge consisting o f variable operating costs
   and fuel. Inconsidering the least cost options for replacingreduced hydro output, it is the energy charge that is of
    interest, since the (fixed) capacity payment i s on a take-or-pay basis, and must be paid whether or not electricity is
   generated.

35.       The TANESCO / Government planfor the remainder of2004 andearly 2005 is described
below3. Without a combination of all of these actions in2004 and early 2005, the emergency
situation could persist for a muchlonger period.

          The IPTLPowerPlant willrunat maximumoutput untilgas becomes available inearly
          July 2004. Duringthis period, the gas turbines at the Ubungo Power Plantwould berun
          on Jet A1 fuel and would balance the generation shortfall. After commissioning o f the
          Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA)
          scheduled for aroundJuly 1,2004, the Ubungo Power Plantwill runon gas at maximum
          capacity utilization, and the IPTLPower Plant will make up the balance o f generation
          required;

          Privately-financednew gas-basedthermalpower generation capacity will be
          commissioned inOctober 2004 andJanuary 2005, at which point the more expensive
          thermal generation plant (IPTL) will be dispatched last (see paragraphs 37 and 38);

     0   TANESCO has arranged for co-generation o f about 5MW from the Kilembero and
         Mtibwa sugar factories to be suppliedto the grid;

     0   The Govemment plans to convert the 100MWIPTLPower Plant from HFOto gas-firing
          in2005 oncethe additionalgasturbines havebeeninstalledandthe emergencypower
          supplyperiodhas concluded. At that time, individual generating unitsof the IPTLPower
          Plant would be taken off-line for conversion ina phasedmanner, without intempting
          supply (see paragraph 39);

     0    Incase further generation capacity wererequired, as afallback position, TANESCOhas
          prepared procurement documentation for foreign EmergencyPower Producers involving
          leased gas turbines to runon indigenous naturalgas; and

     0    With financing under Credit 3569-TA, TANESCO will retain a consultant to carry out a
          rapid assessment of practical electricity demand management measureswhich could
          realistically be implementedby TANESCO inthe short term.

36.       The estimated total cost of the incremental thermal generation due to the effects o f the
2003 drought (i.e. above the thermal generation that would be requiredina year with normal
hydrology) basedonthe probable hydrokhermal generation mix i s about US$67million for the
period January 2004-February 2005. Details conceming the determination ofthe incremental
thermal generation requirement are presentedinAttachment 1.

 PrivateInvestmentfor the UbungoPowerPlant(2x36MW GasTurbines)

 37.      Part of the solution to the current emergency i s to install as quickly as possible new
 natural gas-basedthermal generation. This additional gas-fired generation i s also an important
 part of the planto mitigate against future droughts. TANESCO i s targeting commissioning of a
 gas turbine (36MW) at the Ubungo Power Plant by October 2004 and an additional 36MW gas
 turbine by January 2005. Boththese gas turbines are proposedto be financed, owned and
 operated by Songas, the private sector gas and power company established under Credit 3569-
 TA.

 38.      Under the current contractual arrangementswith Songas (which has first right of refusal
 to install upto 60MW at the Ubungo Power Plant under project financing arrangements
 satisfactory to the Govemment), TANESCOhas requested Songasto finance and install two
 additional gas turbines (2x36MW) under open book arrangements. It is the intention of the
 parties to work within the existinglegal and commercial framework with regardto the existing
 Songo ContractualAgreements. As such, no additional credit enhancement (guarantees or
 increase inthe liquidityfacility) i s envisaged. Technical assistanceunder Credit 3569-TA is
 being providedto assist TANESCO and the Government to assessthe commercial bank financing
 arrangements for the 2x36MW units, including financing from the local market.

 ConversionofIPTLPower PlantfromHF'Oto NaturalGas-Firing

 39.      Even with 2x36MW ofnew gas turbines inoperationby early 2005, the IPTLPower
 Plant will continue to be runat a highcapacity factor in2005. Giventhe impact o f the significant
 cost of runningthe IPTLPower Plant on imported fuel (approximately US$4.1 millionper month
 at a 90% load factor), the economic and financial assessment supports converting the existing
 10x1OMW medium speed diesel generators at Tegeta to natural gas-firing. The Govemment has
 requested IDA assistance for financing boththe conversioncost and the cost of extendinga gas

pipeline spur to the site. It i s proposed to finance the conversion through amending the
Development Credit Agreement of the Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation
Project and creating a Project Agreement with TANESCO. The 2kmpipeline spur to the IPTL
Power Plant i s proposed to be financed under Credit 3569-TA through a change order to the
pipeline construction contract.

40.          The ReservesCertificationReport for the Songo Songo gasfieldpreparedbyGaffney
Cline andAssociates in2001andrecent updated audits o fthe gasfield, confirm that there i s
sufficient gas to meet the additionalrequirements o fthe 2x36MW gas turbines over the next 20
years, as well as for operating the IPTLPower Plant on gas.

41.          Additional mitigation measuresinclude:

      0      Once the gas infrastructure facilities are commissioned and adequate gas-basedthermal
             generation capacity ininstalled, TANESCO will revise its hydropower operating regime
             including the management of the Mtera reservoir. Technical assistanceand
             softwarehardware requirements would be financed under Credit 3569-TA.

      0      With IDA assistance, TANESCO i s undertakingpreparationo f a new Power System
             Master Planto provide an updated guide on least cost power sector expansion options.
             Also with IDA support, the Govemment i s planning to develop an Independent Power
             Producer (PP) strategy andbiddingdocuments for the next thermal plant, which i s likely
             to be either additional gas turbines or conversion o f existing simple cycle machines to
             combinedcycle.


      0      Improving TANESCO's cash flow, and ensuringthe financial sustainabilityo f the sector
             including tariff adjustments, a TANESCO debt restructuringplan, and measures to lower
             the cost of IPPs (e.g. the buydown of Songas accumulatedreturns on equity andthe
             conversion o f PTLto gas firing). A comprehensive tariff study will be financed under
             Credit 3569-TA. IDAhas also offeredto take the leadincoordinating donor responseto
             the Government's proposalfor restructuringTANESCO's debt.

42.          The combinationof adequategas-basedthermal generation, revisedoperational practices
to better managethe Mterareservoir, and financial sustainability inthe power sector, will position
the power supply system inTanzania to withstand future droughts without emergency assistance
or severe load-shedding.

Status of Ongoing Energy Sector Operations

43.          Sonno Songo Gas Develooment andPower Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA).
Implementation i s proceeding satisfactorily. Songas, a private power and gas company, has been
established under the project. Songas i s responsible for installation o f a gas plant on Songo Songo
Island, constructiono f a 232km marine and landpipeline, andconversionof the Ubungo Power
Plant (112MW) to gas firing, which is expectedto be completed on July 1,2004, about 33 months
following Boardpresentation inOctober 2001. Execution of the Ministryo f Energy and Minerals
(MEM)capacitybuildingcomponent, includingthe resettlement infrastructureandwayleave
village electrification scheme, has encountered substantial delays. A mid-termreview o f the
project was heldinJanuary 2004, and an action planto remedy the delayed implementation o f the
MEMcomponent isbeingcloselymonitored. One oftheperformance indicatorsfor the project is

an increase inthe level ofprivate investment ingas infrastructure. A measure o f success inthis
regardis the development of a commercial gas market beingundertakenby PanAfrican Energy
and the Tanzania PetroleumDevelopmentCorporation. Constructiono f a US$2.4 million gas
ringmain, with private financing, will be completed byJuly 2004. Gas sales contracts have been
signed with the Wazo HillCement Plant, Kioo Glass, the Tanzanian Breweries, and discussions
are under way with several more potential commercialusers.

44.      Privatization and Private Sector Development Proiect (IDA Credit 3304-TA). In
September 2001, the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) awarded two
power sector consultancy contracts financed under Credit 3304-TA. Mercados Energeticos was
retainedto review andrecommend anew structure for the power sector, and to develop
appropriate trading arrangements and a regulatoryregime. The consultants' recommendations
includedthe unbundlingo fTANESCO into two distribution companies, three generation
companies and atransmission company. A SystemOperator and MarketAdministrator would be
locatedwithin the transmission company, with provisions to make it independent interms of
operational decisions and financial issues. Inrecognition o f the current investor climate andneed
to consolidate the gains from TANESCO's improvedtechnical and financial performance, in
early 2004 the Govemment decided to extend the existing performance-based management
contract for another 3-5 years, rather than pushingforward with full restructuring and
privatization inthe face o f the current low global investor interest indeveloping country power
systems. Inthe interim,the Management Contractor will establishring-fenced functional
business units within TANESCO, and undertake other efficiency improvementsincluding
necessarydistribution and transmission rehabilitation and reinforcement investments, as a prelude
to proceedingwith privatization.

45.      Stone & Webster was retainedto draft the newlegislation for the Govemment approved
industrystructure, trading arrangements,andregulatoryregime, as well as to assistincorporate
restructuringo f TANESCO consistent with the new industrystructure. Draft legislationi s under
discussion. Also under Credit 3304-TA, PSRC hasretainedthe service of Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu to provide advice with regardto the institutional design and establishment of the
EWURA.


                          11: BANKRESPONSEAND STRATEGY

46.      A review ofthe existingIDAportfolio inthe power sector for Tanzania was undertaken
and the possibility o f usingsavings available under the Songo Songo Gas Development and
Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA) was considered. Use o f a portion o f these savings i s
proposed for the conversiono f the IPTLPower Plant to gas-firing. (See paragraph 39). However,
the preparation o f a stand-alone operationon an emergency basis, was deemed as a more
appropriate instrumentto support the Government's overall emergency power supply plan, for the
following reasons: InSeptember 2003, the Government had formally requested IDA to
restructure Credit 3569-TA insupport of urgentTANESCO transmission and distribution
rehabilitation requirements to prevent chronic system failures. A number o f technical/economic,
environmental/social and financial studies are currently under way inthis regard. While usingall
the cost savings to finance TANESCO's emergency power generation needscouldbeviewedas
efficient inthe short term, this would compromise system reliability inthe short to mediumterm.
Secondly, the cost savings were considered a means o f underpinning the power sector policy
dialogue on improving TANESCO's performance, industryrestructuring, financial restructuring
and establishing a functioning regulatory body.

LessonsLearned

47.      Recent Bank experience inthe preparation o f emergency projects inthe Africa Region
(Kenya, Mozambique and Madagascar) has demonstrated the importance of: (i)       the speedof the
preparatiodappraisalprocess; (ii)simple project design and strong implementation and
                                    a
monitoring framework; and (iii)    the inclusionof mitigative measures to preventrepeated
disasters. These lessonshavebeentaken into account through a simpleproject design with few
contracts, rapid preparation and appraisal, completion o fbiddocuments and procurement
procedures, a dedicated implementationunit involvingTANESCO's senior management, and a
clear set o f mitigation steps to ensurethat futuredroughts do not leadto apower sector
emergency.

Rationale for IDA lnvolvement

48.      Without IDA'Ssupport, TANESCO would be unable to pay for fuel and emergency
generation capacity whichwould result insevere load-shedding and economic disruption.
Empirical evidence from previous load-shedding episodes inTanzania clearly demonstratesthe
significant negative economic impact o f severe load-shedding. Support from the donor
community was sought, and EIBindicated its interest to participateinthe private sector
transaction for financing o fthe 2x36MW gas turbines. Donors interested inthe energy sector
indicated their preference to fundinvestments rather than consumables like fuel. Other donors
indicated that they would continue to concentrate onproviding budgetary support basedon the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which focuses on the social sectors.

Eligibility for ProcessingUnder OP/BP 8.50 on Emergency Recovery Assistance

49.      According to the OPlBP8.50 on Emergency Recovery Assistance, the Bank considers the
criteria listedbelow indecidingwhether to provide an Emergency Recovery credit`loan. The
following paragraphs detail how the proposed Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project meets
each o f these criteria.

       Impact on economic priorities and investmentprograms. Without assistanceincovering
       the incrementalcost of imported fuel and energy purchases, there will be loadsheddingo f
       about 27% o f projectedenergy requirements in2004. The economic impact is estimated to
       be equivalent to as muchas 6% o f GDP. On a monthly basis, the level o f assistance
       requiredby TANESCO to avoid load-shedding would be about 8% of total monthly
       Government revenues. Since November 2003, the Government has provided a cash
       infusion of US$43 millionequivalent, o f which about US$15 millionwas to reconcile
       outstanding Government electricity accounts receivable before 2002. The Government
       will be providing anadditionalUS$23 million inbudgetary support for emergency
       assistanceduring2004. Without IDA support, there would be a need for further
       Government budgetary allocations which would result ina significant reductionin
       spending on other economic priorities and investmentprograms, including the poverty
       agenda. Support from the donor community was sought for the proposedproject, but has
       not been forthcoming.

   0   Frequency. For recurring events, such as annual flooding a regular investment loan i s
       more appropriate. Though droughts do occur periodically inEast Africa, the situationin
       Tanzania is not an annual occurrence. While the availability o f water varies from year to
       year, water inflows into Tanzania's hydropower systemduring2003 and untilnow, were
       less than halfo f the annual 40-year average inflows. Data indicates that water inflows to

Tanzania EmergencyPower Supply Project            17
Technical Annex

       the overall hydropower system were two thirds of the average inflow over the past 25
       years. The 2003 inflow to the Mtera Reservoir, the most important reservoir inTanzania's
       hydropower system, wasjust 40% of the 60-year average inflow.

   e   regular investment project may be preferable. In2003, boththe longrains (March - May)
        Urgency. For slow on-set disasterssuch as a drought, the more thoroughpreparation of a


       rains in2003 been good, the impact of the March - May drought would have been greatly
       and the short rains (October - December) failed insome parts o f the country. Hadthe short

       reduced. Hence the full extent of the emergency was only apparent at the end of 2003, and
       shortly thereafter the Government requestedemergency assistance fiom IDA.

   e   Prospectsfor reducing hazardsfrom similar natural disasters in thefuture. The
       combination of: (i) availability of indigenous natural gas to replace expensive
                            the
       imported fuel; (ii) the installation of adequate gas-based thermal generation withinthe next
       year; (iii)revisedoperational practices to better managethe Mtera reservoir and the
       operations of other hydropower plants for optimal dispatch o f the mixedhydrokhermal
       system; and (iv) steps to improve the financial sustainability inthe power sector, will
       position the power supply systeminTanzania to withstand future droughts without
       emergency assistanceor severe load-shedding. All of these measures are to be addressed
       as part of the emergency operationand / or as part of the proposed restructuringof Credit
       3569-TA.

   e   Expected economic benejh The major economic benefit o f the proposed project i s the
       avoidance of severe load-shedding and the consequentnegative impact on the overall
       economy and delivery o f social services. The project will benefitnot only electricity
       customers, but also those employed inthe formal and informal services who would lose
       jobs and income due to the economic impact o f significant power supply interruptions.
       Social service users will also benefit as apotentially major disruption to provision o f these
       services will be avoided.

Project Objectives

50.      The proposed project would assist the Government inimplementingits emergency
measuresto avert a prolongedperiod o f severe load-shedding which threatens to cripple
economic activities and hinder the delivery of social services.

Project Description

51.      The proposedproject would provide funds to assist TANESCOandthe Government to
meet the incremental power supplycosts attributable to the 2003 drought. Itwould finance fuel
and energy purchasesto maintain power supply at a level sufficient to prevent a severe
contractionof the economy and inthe provision o f social services.

52.      IDA'Sproposed financial contributionwould cover the following incrementalvariable
costs directly relatedto the drought: (i)  the fuel costs o frunningthe Ubungo Power Plant on Jet
A1 fuel throughearly July 2004 when the Ubungo Power Plantwill be commissioned runningon
indigenous natural gas; and (ii) the cost ofpurchasingelectricity (kwh)producedf?om the PTL
Power Plant operating on HFO through February2005. The combination o f the May 1,2004

tariff increase, subsequentbi-annual tariff adjustments as necessary, the proposed IDA credit and
Government support through 2004, will ensurethat TANESCO will be able to generate adequate
power to avoid severe load shedding. The tariff projections take into account the need for
TANESCO to cover the capacity and energy payments for the proposed new 2x36MW to be
developed, constructed, commissioned and ownedby the private sector (Songas).

                                                                          (US$ million)




 On-lendingArrangements

55.      Because o f the emergency nature of this proposed project, as opposed to an investment
operation, the proposedIDA credit to the Government would beprovidedto TANESCO on a
grant basis, rather than being on-lent. Thejustification for this approach is that as a commercially

Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project           19
Technical Annex

operating company, TANESCO would either load shedor charge a tariffto fully recover the costs
o f supplyingelectricity duringthe emergency. This would require nearlya doubling of the
present tariff which would not be affordable to consumers even over the short-term emergency
period. To avoid the negative economic consequencesof load shedding, the Government i s
providing assistanceto TANESCO to permit it to supply electricity at a level exceeding that
which would be commercially feasible. Onthis basis, repayment o f these funds would unfairly
penalize TANESCO. TANESCO would enter into a Subsidiary FinancingAgreement with the
Government, setting out the terms under which the Government will make the IDA funds
available.

Benefits

56.       The avoidance of severe load-shedding and the conseauent negative impact on the overall
economy and delivew of social services will directly benefit not only electricity customers, but
also those employed inthe formal and informal services who would losejobs and income due to
the economic impact of significant power supply interruptions. Social service users will also
benefit as a potentially major disruption to provision of these services will be avoided.

57.       Maintaining the current momentumo f the power sector reformurogram. Both severe
load-shedding andmassive tariff increases(i.e. a surcharge to fully cover all additionalthermal
generation costs) couldjeopardize the sector reformprogram. Under the leadership o f the new
TANESCO management and with cooperation o f the Government, there have beensubstantial
improvementsinTANESCO's financial and operational performance inthe last 2 years. There
has also been a significant change inTANESCO staffperceptionof this first step inthe reform
process, as described inparagraph25. However, public support for the reformprocess,
 specifically the current and any futureprivate participationinthe power sector, couldbe
underminedifthere is the perceptionthat the reformprocess hasresultedineither huge load-
 sheddingor huge tariff increases.

Risks

 58.      Delays inExecution of the Government's Emergency Power Promam. There i s a riskof
 delays innegotiating with Songas, arranging the financing for, andinstalling and commissioning
 a 36MW gas turbine inOctober 2004 and the second 36MW gas turbine inJanuary 2005. To
mitigate against this risk,legal, technical andproject finance (merchant banking) assistanceto the
 Government andTANESCO is beingprovided underCredit 3569-TA. There i s also arisk of
 delays inconverting the IPTLPower Plant to gas-firing, thus continuingthe financial drain on
 TANESCO o fpaying for imported fuel. Legal andtechnical assistancewill also be provided to
 assist the Government and TANESCO inreviewing the contractual arrangements, securing the
 Government's interest inthe enhancedIPTL Power Plant and ensuring proper oversight o f the
 technical aspects o f the conversion. Finally, there is a riskthat there couldbe further delays in
 commissioning o f the Songo Songo Project gas infrastructure system. Intensive Songas
 management oversight and close monitoringbythe MEM's Project MonitoringUnit should
 mitigate against further slippages inthe commissioning date o f the gas processing plant, pipeline
 and Ubungo Power Plant runningon indigenous gas. Also, the project includes a contingency o f
 one additional monthof financing for Jet A1 fuel which would be available to TANESCO ifthe
 gas supply i s delayed through July.

 59.      Continuationo fthe Emergency into 2005 due to Failure o f Government or TANESCO to
 Take RequiredSteus. The Government and TANESCO prepared a comprehensive emergency
 power supply plan andhave already taken anumber o f important steps to enable TANESCO to

Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project            20
Technical Annex

transition out o f the emergency power supply phaseinto anormal planningmode (see paragraphs
34-42).

60.      PotentialRemtational Risk. The IPTLPower Plant transaction was a deviation from the
least cost generation expansion plan and was the subject of international arbitration proceedings,
the outcome of which was a reductioninfinal project capital costs used inthe calculation of the
plant tariff, by about 25%. The proposedproject would finance energy purchases from this
thermal plant. Also, financing the conversion o f this plant from HFOto gas-firing is proposed
with savings from Credit 3569-TA (see paragraph39). Inthe current circumstances, the purchase
of electricity from this plant is the least cost option for meetingthe load. Onbalance, this
practical consideration outweighs considerations of the history o f the transaction. Furthermore,
the IPTLPower Plant will be inoperation, with TANESCO obligated to pay capacity charges for
the next 17.5 years. Thus, it makes economic and financial sense to reduce the costs of electricity
to energy users, by convertingthe plant to gas-firing.


                      IV: STUDIESAND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

61. The following studies and technical assistancewould be financed under Credit 3569-TA7to
support the Government's strategy for addressing the current emergency and for ensuring that the
power sector i s positionedto withstand future droughts without requiring emergency assistance
from the Government:

    0    Once the gas infrastructure facilities are commissioned and adequate gas-basedthermal
         generation capacity ininstalled, TANESCO will revise its hydropower operating regime
         includingthe management o f the Mtera reservoir. This will includethe provisiono f
         technical assistanceand softwarekardware requirements.

    0    TANESCO will retain a consultant to carry out a rapid assessment o fpractical electricity
         demand management measureswhich couldrealisticallybe implementedby TANESCO
         inthe short term.

    0    A comprehensive tariff study isproposed. This study will update estimates ofthe long
         runcost ofpower supply, propose amechanism for indexingoftariffs, andexamine other
         measures (e.g. time o f day tariffs, a quota mechanism for application inthe event of
         future supply shortfalls, and application of geographically differentiated tariffs), to ensure
         that price signals to consumers encouragethe efficient use of electricity and that tariffs
         are maintainedat a levelnecessaryto ensure financial sustainability o f the power sector.

    0    TANESCO will carry out anewPower SystemMaster Planto provide an updated guide
         on least cost power sector expansion options.

    0    The Government is planning to develop anIndependent Power Producer strategy and
         biddingdocuments for the nextthermal plant, which is likely to be either additional gas
         turbines or conversionof existing simple cycle machines to combined cycle.

    0    Legal, technical and project finance (merchant banking) assistanceto the Government
         and TANESCO would be provided under Credit 3569-TA7innegotiatingwith Songas,
         arranging the financing for, and installing and commissioning a 36MW gas turbine in
         October 2004 and the second 36MW gas turbine inJanuary 2005.

         Legal and technical assistance will also be providedunder Credit 3569-TA to assist the
         Government and TANESCO with regard to the plannedconversion of the IPTLPower
         Plant to gas-firing, inreviewingthe contractual arrangements, securingthe Government's
         interest inthe enhancedIPTLPower Plant and ensuring proper oversight of the technical
         aspects of the conversion.

 V: INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION

ImplementationArrangements

62.      The Deputy Managing Director o f Generation, Transmission and Engineeringwill have
overall responsibility for implementationof the proposedproject. The Acting Director o f
Projects who reports to the DeputyManagingDirector of Generation, Transmission and
Engineering, has beenappointed as the ProjectManager. The ProjectManager will coordinate
and manageproject activities andwill interact across all departments inTANESCO and with the
MEM,the MinistryofFinance andIDA. TANESCO's Tender Boardwillberesponsible to
ensure that all procurement under the proposedproject would be inaccordance with the
Government's and IDA'Sprocurement guidelines. The structure o f TANESCO's Tender Board
conforms to the Public Procurement Act of 2001. The Chairman o fthe Tender Board i s the
ManagingDirector and the Secretary to the Tender Board i s the Director of Finance. Members
include four additional TANESCOstaff, along withrepresentatives from the Ministryof Finance
and the MEM. The Director of Internal Audit will be incharge o f project auditing, and will

Procurement

63.      The proposed project would finance: (i) requirements for the Ubungo Power Plant
                                                     fuel
untilits conversionto gas firing aroundJuly 1,2004; and(ii)       kilowatt hours (i.e., the energy

Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project              22
T e c h c a l Annex

charge made up of fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs) producedby the IPTL
Power Plant, excluding any applicable duties, taxes and levies4.

64.          Procurement of Jet A1 fuel will follow InternationalCompetitive Bidding (ICB)
procedures (allowing at least 15 days biddingperiod with publicationinthe nationalnewspapers,
the UnitedNations Development Business and dgMarket). The fifteen-day biddingperiod with
the publication innationalnewspapers, the UnitedNations Development Business and dgMarket
i s an exception, considering the emergency nature of this project. The two contracts under the
proposed project will be subject to IDA'Sprior review.

65.          Tanzania has sufficient local fuel suppliers o f Jet A1 fuel with storage and distribution
capabilities, which can meet TANESCO's demand on emergency basis. TANESCO requires this
fuel untilJuly 2004, when the gas infrastructure system i s expected to provide gas for runningthe
Ubungo Power Plant. TANESCO confirmed that local fuel suppliers could supply any quantity
o f Jet A1 fuel, but on certain occasions some dealershave failed to meet quality interms o f
specifications, specifically elements such as sulfur and alkaline are sometimes found to be out o f
specifiedrange. TANESCO normally uses a laboratory of the Tanzania InvestmentResearch
Development Organizationto confirm the quality of the consignment. It takes a day to obtain the
results, and the cost of these tests i s sharedequally between the supplier and TANESCO.

66.          Onthe basis ofthe formal procurement capacity assessmentconducted duringproject
appraisal, TANESCO has acceptableprocurement capacity, andthus the procurement risk for this
project i s consideredto be average. A procurement plan for the project executionperiod (through
February2005) was discussedandreviewedby IDA. Audits ofprocurement anddisbursementof
IDA funds will beundertakenon amonthly basis by internalauditors. Externalaudits ofthe
project accounts will be undertaken after 4 months from credit effectiveness and at the
completion o f the project.

Disbursements

67.          The project completion date is February28, 2005 andthe closing date is August 31,
2005. IDA will disburse against eligible payments upto the allocation of the CreditProceeds
limit specifiedinSchedule 1ofthe Development Credit Agreement. All applications to withdraw
proceeds from the Credit Account will be fully documented.

68.          To facilitate disbursements under the project, TANESCO will establish a Special
Account with an authorized allocation o f US$4.5 million.

Technical Annex

FinancialManagementAssessment,Auditing andReporting Requirements

70.      Accounting Systems,Policies and Procedures. TANESCO's financial management
systemhas been designedto support management inits deployment o f resources to ensure the
efficient and effective applicationof these resourcesinthe delivery of outputs and inthe
achievement o f desired outcomes. Dueto the nature of the transactions andthe emergency nature
of the proposedproject, monthly FinancialMonitoring Reports would be prepared andwould
integrate project accounting, procurement, contract management, disbursements and the audit of
physicalprogress under each o f the contracts.

71.       Management Reporting (Financial Monitoring Reports). Monthly management reports
would beproducedand would serve as Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) requiredby IDA.
They will be subject to internal audit on a monthly basis. The contents of these reports would
cover the followingaspects: FinancialReports (Sources andUses of FundsbyFundingSource,
Uses of Fundsby Project ActivityKomponent); a PhysicalProgress (Output Monitoring) report;
and a Procurement and Disbursementreport. Duringnegotiations, IDA reviewed and agreedwith
TANESCO the format and content of the FMR, which will also serve as the monthly progress
report.

72.      TANESCOEntity Financial Statements. The Tanzanian Companies Ordinance, (CAP
212) requires companies to prepare its financial statementswithin six months after the financial
year-end and inaccordancewith Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (which inter alia
includes the application o fthe accrual basis o frecognition of transactions). TANESCO will
submit its audited entity financial statementsto IDAwithin six monthsafter the endof the
financial year.

73.      Project Financial Statements. Because of the short duration o f the proposed project,
TANESCO has agreedto submit a set o f audited interim project financial statementsfor the first
4 months o f the project, and a final set of audited project financial statements for the entire period
o f the project, within45 days after the end of the respective reporting dates.

74.      Internal Audit. An InternalAudit Directorateexists at TANESCO headquarterswith
independent dual reporting to the Managing Director and respective auditees. The Internal Audit
Directoratehas sufficient capacity and i s well staffed. To improve quality andtimeliness of
follow-up, responsesto audit queries are requiredto be submitteddirectly to the Managing
Director. The Internal Audit Directorate concentrateson corporate governance and testing
compliance with financial regulations. The Director of Internal Audit would be responsible for
ensuring that the monthly FMRs are subjected to internal audit and that the report will be
providedto the Managing Director within 30 days subsequent to eachmonthly reporting date, and
copiedto IDA.

75.      ExternalAudit. The external audit for boththe TANESCO entity financial statementsas
well as the Project Financial Statements, will be carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers,
TANESCO's current appointedauditors. TANESCO will have its entity financial statements
audited within six months after the end o f the financial year. Two audits will be carried out on
the Project Financial Statements, namely four months after the project has become effective and
another one at the endo f the project. Due to the nature o f the proposed project, these audit
reports would be required within45 days subsequentto the reportingperiods. This means that
the normal legalrequirement o f IDA for submission ofthe audit report within six months of the
endofthe financial year will not be applicable. The costs incurred for the audit will beborneby

Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project             24
Technical Annex

TANESCO through its normal operating budget. Duringnegotiations, the terms ofreference for
the external auditor were discussedand agreed.

76.      FinancialManagement Risk. An evaluation o fTANESCO's financial management
system was undertaken, and indicates that the financial management arrangements for the
proposed project would satisfy IDA'Sminimumrequirements. Hence, the project financial
management riski s assessedas beingnegligible.

Retroactive Financing

77.      The proposed credit would provide for retroactive financing inthe amount of US$8.8
million, equivalentto 20% of the proposed credit amount, to finance fuel and kWhexpenditures
incurredbefore effectiveness of the proposed credit.

Environmental and SocialImpact

78,      An environmentalaudit ofthe project sites hasbeen completed byTANESCO, for which
Terms of Reference were reviewedand approvedby IDA'. TANESCO has built up its capacity
to undertake environmental audits and environmental impact assessments and has carried out
similar assessments for SIDA. The objectives of the environmental audit are to assist the
Government to determine the environmental liabilities and the need for remedial actions
necessaryto bringthe facilities into compliance with Tanzanian Law andWorld Bank Safeguard
Policies and environmental guidelines, and to protect the healtho f workers and the general public
livinginthe area andthe environment. There i s no resettlement since theproposedproject
involves existing generation sites. The sites impactedbythe proposed project include: (i)          the
IPTLPower Plant (100MW); and (ii) UbungoPower Plant (112MW), bothlocated inthe
                                          the
outslurts o f Dar es Salaam. An Environmental ImpactAssessment and EnvironmentalAudit have
already been carried out at the Ubungo Power Plant under Credits3569-TA and 2489-TA, and a
summary of air quality monitoringi s preparedmonthly by Songas. Similarly, reports on the
environmentalaspectsof the IPTLPower Plant, including air emissions, are prepared periodically
byTANESCO. TANESCO's environmental unithas carriedout the environmentalaudit, which
has beenreviewed and found satisfactory to IDA. The draft Environmentalaudit was issued to
the InfoShop on May 7,2004 and has beenmade available inTanzania at TANESCO's Corporate
Headquarters.


                   VI: FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION

Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Severe Load-Shedding

 79.     Without assistance incovering the cost of importedfuel and energy purchases,
TANESCO would load shed about 891 GWhduringMarch-December 2004, equivalent to about
27% ofprojected energy requirements in2004, or US$55 million inlost revenues to TANESCO.
Byone estimate, the cost ofthis unservedenergy to the economy couldbe as highas US$550
million, or 6% of GDP.


* At thetime of undertaking the Environmental Audit, the possibility of including diesel generators, to be
leasedfrom Geita Gold Mining Ltd. and installed at TANESCO's Mwanza site, was under consideration
and an assessmentof the Mwanza site was included inthe Environmental Audit. Since then, based on a
review o f the hydropower situation it has been determined that leased generationat Mwanza will not be
needed. Hence, financing for t h ~ component has been dropped from the proposedproject.
                                   s

Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project           25
Technical Annex



80.      Although it i s difficult to determine exactly the cost of unservedenergy, there is
empirical evidence from Tanzania to show the impact of load shedding due to previous droughts.
For example from the 1994Economic Survey, it is documented that there was a 3.8% decline in
industrial growth mainly becauseof electricity shortages and subsequentloadshedding that
started inSeptember 1994. Itwas also notedthat other services such as hotels, hospitals, and
shops were adversely affected and forced to buy diesel generatorsto meet their demands. In 1997,
the overall rate of economic growth dropped to 3.3% from 4.2% inthe previous year, on account
o f electricity shortages. Recent surveys (including the draft 2004 Investment Climate
Assessment), indicate that inadequate electricity supply i s already one o f the major constraints
faced by industryinTanzania and is also a major impediment to the start-up of new businesses.
It is clear that load shedding on the scale projectedwithout IDA support would have a very
negative impact on the economy.

FinancialImplications

81. See paragraphs 14-17: "Impact o f the Drought on the Power Sector" for discussion onthe
financial impact of the drought on TANESCOandthe Government assistanceprovided so far.

                                 MethodologyandAssumptions
    For CalculatingIncrementalThermalEnergyRequirementDueto the 2003 Drought

A1.l TANESCO and IDAtogether developed a model to estimate the additional thermal
electricity generation that would be requiredin2004 and 2005 as aresult of the impact of the
2003 drought. This "incremental energy requirement due to drought" is defined as electricity
from thermal generation that would berequired, over and above the thermal generation that
TANESCO would require givennormal hydrology and normal hydropower output.

A1.2     Data was obtained from TANESCO's records and usingTANESCO's SYSIMmodel.
Basedonhydrological data for the 1980-2003 period, it was agreedthat the inflow data for 2001
and 2002 fairly represent `normal', non-drought inflow patterns inTanzania's hydropower
catchment areas. Basedupon this inflow data, the average energy actually generatedmonthby
month from the hydropower plants in2001 and 2002 fairly represents the energy that could be
expected from hydropower generation inanormal, non-droughtyear.                            *

Al.3     Figure Al.1shows thisnormal hydropower generation, as defined above, as aportion of
the actual total electricity demand in2003. The difference betweenthe normal hydropower
output and the total demand is met by thermal generation, primarily from the IPTLPower Plant
with a small contribution from a generator at amine feeding the main grid. The combinationof
the IPTL and other thermal generation i s the level of thermal generation (i.e. the number of GWh
each monthproduced from thermal power plants) that would be expected ina normal, non-
drought year.

A1.4     FigureA1.2 shows the actual hydropower generation in2003 as a fraction ofthe actual
total electricity demand in2003. Comparing these two graphs, it is apparent that in2003 there
was lesshydropower generation andmore thermal power generation than inanon-drought year.
This is demonstrated bythe larger contributionfrom the IPTLPower Plant, andthe addition of
two additional sources of thermal generation - grid-connected diesel (diesel) generation and the
operationof two of the Ubungo Gas Turbines on Jet A1 fuel (GT Jet fuel) - inDecember 2003.
Interestingly, the number of GWhgeneratedfrom hydropower in2003 i s only slightlylower than
ina `normal' year. The effect ofmaintainingarelatively highoutput fromhydropower despite the
2003 drought was that the Mtera reservoir was fully depleted over the period. By the endof 2003
the reservoirlevel was within centimeters o f shut-down level.

Al.5     The poor finishto 2003 interms o f water reserves inthe Mtera reservoir inevitably meant
that TANESCO began 2004 with a greatly reduced potential for hydropower generation from
Mteraandthe downstream KidatuPower Plant. Figure A1.3: "Emergency Power Generation
Plan-Total Generation Requirement" shows the projected generation, by source, that would be
requiredto meet the demand in2004. Note that the hydropower generation i s significantly lower
than that for a "normal" year, reflecting the fact that output from Mtera and the downstream
Kidatuwill be limitedbecause of the low starting level o f the Mtera Reservoir.

Al.6     FigureAl.3 shows the IPTLPower Plant (IPTL) runningat maximumoutput inthe first
halfo f the year, untilgas becomes available inearly July 2004. UntilJuly, the gas turbines at the
Ubungo Power Plant will balance the shortfall runningon Jet A1 fuel (GTJet fuel), with a small
contribution from grid connected diesel (diesel) generation. After commissioning o f the Songo
Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA) scheduled for around
July 1,2004, Songas will assume ownership of the gas turbines at the Ubungo Facility. These
four existing gas turbines will runonnatural gas (GT Gas) at maximumcapacity utilization, and
the IPTLPower Plant will make up the balance. The figure shows that by October, maximum

output fi-om IPTLand the four existing Songas gas turbines wouldbe insufficient to meetthe
demand as hydropower output falls off duringthe dry season. TANESCO i s targeting
commissioning o f an additional, privately-financed 36MW gas turbine at the Ugungo Power Plant
inOctober 2004.

Al.7
Emergency" shows the impliedincremental thermal power generation for 2004 - i.e. the
         Figure Al.4 "Emergency Power Generation Plan-IncrementalRequirement Due to

difference betweenthe thermal power generation requirement to meet the actual load, and the
thermal generation that would havebeenrequired ina normal rainfall year. The proposed IDA
Emergency Power SupplyProjectwould finance the incrementalthermal generation from the
IPTLPower Plant, andJet A1 fuel for the incrementalpower generation from the gas turbines
runningon Jet fuel.

Al.8     A similar approachwas usedto project the incrementalthermal energy requirementsfor
2005. These projections show the need for a secondnew 36MW gas turbine inJanuary 2005.
Boththese additional gas turbines are proposed to be financed, owned and operated by Songas,
theprivate sector gas andpower company, established under Credit3569-TA. Evenwith
2x36MW ofnew gas turbines inoperation inearly 2005, the IPTLPower Plant will continue to
be runat a highcapacity factor in2005, inorder to allow the Mterareservoir to recover. Given
the impact o fthe significant cost o frunningthe IPTLPower Plant on imported fuel
(approximately US$4.1 million per month at a 90% load factor), the economic and financial
assessment supports converting the existingWartsila 38 lOxlOMW mediumspeeddiesel
generators to naturalgas-firing. Once the additional 2x36MW gas turbines have been installed,
one by one the generating units o f the IPTLPower Plant would be taken off-line for conversionin
a phasedmanner, to avoidreducing available capacity below a levelneededto meet demand.
