efforts to redress past policy and governance\n            shortcomings in a sustainable manner. Hence the loan\n            includes components to improve fiscal and debt management,\n            governance and civil service effectiveness, delivery of\n            health and education services, forestry management, the\n            quality and efficiency of financial services including those\n            available through privatization, and the operating\n            environment for business. A pervading theme is to strengthen\n            governance in public institutions through enhanced\n            transparency and accountability. Other benefits expected\n            include improved public sector management capacity to\n            provide core government services, a reduced public sector\n            role in commercial activities, an improved climate for\n            private sector development, and improved management of\n            natural resources. The risks to attaining the loan's\n            objectives stem for a number of factors: political\n            opposition could compromise reform; weaknesses in\n            implementation capacity could constrain reform\n            sustainability; the government's vulnerability to\n            commodity price fluctuations and natural disasters could\n            undermine gains from improved policy; and high crime rates\n            could weaken the supply response from ongoing reforms. In\n            accordance with noted conditions, the loan will be disbursed\n            in two tranches."}, "docdt": "2000-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
