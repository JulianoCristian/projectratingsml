Bank\n            performance is rated satisfactory. Borrower performance\n            overall is considered satisfactory in the implementation of\n            the program, especially with respect to perseverance in\n            carrying out the program once economic conditions\n            deteriorated and in the face of domestic opposition. A\n            stable social and political environment is essential to\n            support macroeconomic and structural reforms. The government\n            made good progress during the early phase of the project,\n            but increasingly, in the face of domestic opposition,\n            political instability, civil unrest and a mutiny, program\n            implementation became more arduous during 2001. Other\n            lessons learned include these: Careful investment in\n            preparation to ensure strong ownership and build counterpart\n            commitment and understanding are important to maintain\n            reform momentum. It was worth taking the risk of involvement\n            in a new adjustment program once the new government had\n            established its reformist credentials, notwithstanding the\n            poor track record of reforms of previous governments. When\n            counterpart capacity is not strong, close and frequent\n            supervision by the Bank is neded to achieve program\n            completion. The burden of program implementation would have\n            been considerably eased and made smoother if a more formal\n            and extensive mechanism had been established in government\n            with responsibility for program implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
