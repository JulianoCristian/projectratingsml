The Requesters claim that\n            the Papua New Guinea government and logging industry\n            participants failed to fulfill or demonstrate good faith on\n            conditionalitys aimed at improving forest governance,\n            imposed by the Bank on the Structural Adjustment Programme\n            Loan (SAL.) The Requesters claim that the submission deals\n            with significant instances of social, cultural, ecological\n            and economic harm and that the disbursement of the second\n            tranche without requiring a full review of the contractual\n            provisions of the loan constitutes a violation of the\n            contractual provisions of the SAL by loaning to a borrower\n            defaults to implement its own promises.  Examples set out in\n            the claim indicating the development objectives of the\n            governance loan have not been met and are unlikely to be\n            met, if the disbursement of the second tranche is completed.\n            The Requesters ask the Inspection Panel to address the need\n            that arises from this claim. The Requesters ask that there\n            be a moratorium on new concessions in the forests of Papua\n            New Guinea to allow a respite for reform, that landowners be\n            compensated for their losses, and the institutional reform\n            processes put in place firmly."}, "docdt": "2001-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
