the Private\n            Enterprise Development Project to support the creation of\n            new private businesses, which has emerged as one of the\n            centerpieces of the government's program to transform\n            the Polish economy.  To meet this objective, the project\n            provides financing for efficient investment in private\n            Enterprises, particularly in small and medium size\n            Enterprises (SMEs), and for a program aimed at overcoming\n            deficiencies of business practices and building support\n            services for private Enterprise development.  The project\n            includes two related components:  (i) investment financing\n            under which the Polish Development Bank will act as the\n            second-tier institution responsible for channeling Bank\n            resources through participating banks to a wide range of\n            SMEs; and (ii) institutional strengthening of the Office of\n            the Undersecretary for Business Promotion, the Project\n            Support Unit, and local business promotion agencies."}, "docdt": "1992-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
