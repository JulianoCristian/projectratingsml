The project\n            includes two related components:  (i) investment financing\n            under which the Polish Development Bank will act as the\n            second-tier institution responsible for channeling Bank\n            resources through participating banks to a wide range of\n            SMEs; and (ii) institutional strengthening of the Office of\n            the Undersecretary for Business Promotion, the Project\n            Support Unit, and local business promotion agencies."}, "docdt": "1992-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
