Am==nt:                  US$60.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                   Seventeen year maturity with a five year grace period,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Relendinu Terms:         The funds for the investment financing component
(US$58.0 million) will be on-lent by PDB to
participating banks, and by them to enterprises at
variable or fixed interest rates in any currency
included in the Bank currency pool at the option of
the enterprise. Given current trade patterns in
Poland, the bulk of on-lending is expected to be in
US$ or in DM. Interest rates to be charged by PDB to
participating banks will be set with reference to
market indices, and will provide for covering PDB's
costs of funds, the foreign exchange risk and the
interest rate risk associated with the Bank's currency
pool and interest rate policies, as well as PDB's
administration and intermediation costs, and a
reasonable profit margin. PDB's margin will be
reviewed with the Bank regularly, at least semi-
annually.  Participating banks will on-lend to
enterprises according to prevailing market interest
rates; sub-loans will be for up to seven years
maturity with up to three years grace.

NIMORANDUW AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHEN
TO THE EXECUTIVE D!RECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE POLISH DEVELOPMENT BANK
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the fol.lowing memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Polish Development Bank (PDB) with
the guarantee of the Republic of Poland for the equivalent of US$60 million to
help finance a private enterprise development project. The loan would be at
the BAnk's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen
years, including five years of grace.
2.          Backgrgund:  The far-reaching Economic Transformation Program
(ETP) launched in January 1990 was designed to achieve macroeconomic
stabilization; structural reform of the productive base to restore growth; and
progressive restoration of creditworthiness. Judging by a macroeconomic
yardstick, the results have been mixed. Inflation has subsided from levels of
over 240 percent in 1989 and 600 percent in 1990. Average inflation amounted
to less than 80 percent in 1991, and is now running at an annual rate of about
40 percent; however, major structural problems remain and the economy has not
performed well. In 1991, GDP declined an estimated 8-10 percent;
unemployment, which amounted to less than 2 percent of the total work force in
early 1990, topped 11 percent by end 1991.
3.          The overall production and price statistics, however, mask sharply
different trends among sectors of the economy, and cannot portray accurately
important underlying changes in the standards of living of the Polish
population. Price statistics, for instance, cannot capture the shortage of
products and queuing, or the inferior product quality that was the trademark
of the output of industries not concerned with the competitiveness of their
products. These features are now largely gone from Poland: stores are full of
merchandise; lines have disappeared. These improvements are not reflected in
real income statistics, but can reasonably be quoted as evidence of some
success in the implementation of the ETP.
4.          Even when using production statistics as a benchmark for success
of policies, important qualifications are necessary. Arguably, the
disappointing overall supply response results largely from the inability of
the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector to adapt to the new economic
realities.  On the other hand, a fundamental objective of the ETP's move
towards a market economy is private sector growth. On this account, a
noticeable degree of success has been attained: private sector growth was
strong in 1990 and 1991 (some 7 and 3 percent, respectively).  The
contribution of the private sector to total GDP rose from the 28 percent level
in 1989 to more than 34 percent of GDP in 1990, and to about 40 percent in
1991. Approximately 1.3 million private sector enterprises have been
established, suggesting a rate of growth of approximately 55 percent during
1990 and 1991. Private production (including cooperatives) now accounts for a
quarter of total industrial production, over 50 percent of construction, and
three quarters of trade.



- 2 -
5.          Growth of the private sector has occurred in response to the
changed market signals, and also as a result of determined Government action.
This has consisted of the adoption of comprehensive policy and regulatory
measures to create a substantialLy improved business environment for the
creation and growth of new private enterprises. A cornerstone of these
measures was the policy and regulatory changes introduced in January 1989 by
the "Law on Economic Activity", which abolished severe restrictions on
licensing, registration, number of employees and economic activities applied
to private sector initiatives. Subsequent legislation has reinforced the
foundations for the creation of a strong private sector, by modernizing tho
commercial code, establishing the basis for a clear regulatory framework in a
number of economic sectors, and by laying the grounds for a modern tax system.
6.          There remain, however, substantial constraints to contiLiuad
private sector growth. Renewed macroeconomic instability would arguably pose
the greatest danger to economic transformation. The unsettled state of
financial markets, with the resulting limited access to term finar.cing and to
credit in general for start-up businesses, also represents a substantial
hindrance to new investments. Too many resources still flow to some of the
more inefficient SOEs. The success of the privatization program has been
largely confined to the smaller scale enterprises, as progress with large and
medium-scale units has been slow. Furthermore, insufficient technical
expertise and lack of business skills must be overcome, a process that
requires time and a concentrated effort.
7.          Rationale for Bank Involvement: The proposed project is designed
to address some of these problems. The Bank assistance strategy for Poland is
geared to back the Government's economic program and the transformation to a
private sector-based market economy in a number of mutually reinforcing areas.
Private sector growth is sought through; (a) the maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic framework, which was one of the main objectives of the program
supported by the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL); (b) SOE privatization and
reform, supported by the Privatization and Restructuring Project; and (c)
restructuring and enhancement of financial markets (the Financial Institutions
Development Loan). In addition, in parallel with the support provided to the
privatization of state-owned enterprises, the Bank has also sought to address
the complementary process of the creation and growth of new, private
enterprises. A Bank review of the constraints to the development of private
SMEs conducted in 1990 provided the basis for the development of the
Government's initiatives to support private enterprise. The proposed project
builds on this effort and is designed to address identified constraints in the
access to finance, the provision of financial services and the availability of
institutional support needed for rapid growth of this sector.
8.          Besides providing scarce term financing for private sector
investment, the proposed project would directly contribute to a better
development of financial markets. The Bank will lend directly to the Polish
Development Bank, instead of to the Government or the Central Bank (National
Bank of Poland) as in previous Bank loans. While PDB has been recently
established, it has quickly built up a strong management team, a skilled staff
complement and sound policies. Within the Polish banking system, PDB has
developed as the main apex institutis- for the provision of term credit. A
direct loan to PDB will help to refocus the role of NBP as a central bank, and
will further strengthen the ongoing relationship with the Bank, initiated



- 3 -
under the Privatization and Restructuring Project, for which PDB is the apex
institution.
9.          The project also complements efforts by IFC to support the
development of the private sector, including the establishment of the Polish
Business Advisory Service. Additionally, the Bank is cooperating with other
multilateral agencies which are developing parallel support programs, with a
view of maximizing efficiency in the use of resources and thus limiting Bank
financing to essential priorities.
10.         Prolect Objectives: The principal objective of the proposed
project is to support the creation of new private businesses. To meet this
objective, the project provides financing for efficient investment in private
enterprises, particularly in SMEs, and for a program aimed at overcoming
deficiencies of business practices and building support services for private
enterprise development.
11.         Project Description and Implementation : The proposed project
includes two related components:
(i)   An investment financina component (US$58 million), which will
provide sub-loans (channeled through PDB to eligible commercial banks) to
finance efficient irvestments in private enterprises. Specifically, this
component will finance the procurement of machinery and equipment, spare parts
and permanent working capital; the construction and rehabilitation of plants,
buildings or storage facilities for start-up and expansion projects; and
technical assistance required to address production, marketing and financial
management needs of private enterprises; and
(ii) An institutional supnort component (US$2 million), which will
provide financing for technical assistance to the two key agencies responsible
for stimulating private sector development (the Office of the Undersecretary
for Business Promotion and the Project Support Unit), and through these
agencies (on a non-reimbursable and cost-sharing basis) to local private
sector support institutions (such as chambers of commerce, small business
support centers and business training institutions) to finance eligible
promotion activities. Cofinancing for these programs from the EC is in place
and additional cofinancing from other bilateral and multilateral grant funds
is contemplated.
12.         For the investment finance component PDB, in its role as an apex
institution, will on-lend proceeds of the proposed Loan to the participating
banks, and they in turn will on-lend to the final borrowers. PDB will also be
responsible for the evaluation of potential participating banks according to
agreed criteria for participation, which include the banks' capacity to
adequately judge the soundness of the sub-projects they propose to finance;
and the monitoring of the use of projects funds.   For the institutional
support component, funds will be on-lent by PDB to the Guarantor, who under
agreed arrangements will pass-on funds to eligible institutions.
13.         Environmental Aspects:  The Government is very conscious of the
severity of the environmental problems in Poland, and with the support of the
Bank-assisted Enviromental Management Project (Report P-5256-POL), is



- 4 -
building-up the capability and means to elaborate, enforce and monitor
suitable environmental protection policies and legislation. For the
preparation of sub-projects under the proposed project, PDB and the
participating banks will ensure in their on-lending agreements that all
beneficiary enterprises will build facilities and operate their plants,
financed under the project, in accordance wit:h environmental and safety
standards acceptable to the Bank. The project has been reviewed and placed in
environmental screening category B.
14.         hCtigns Agreed: Agreements reached at negotiations relate to: (i)
policies and procedures to be adopted by PDB to manage the foreign exchange
and interest rate risks associated with the Bank currency pool; (ii) periodic
review of PDB's on-lending rates; (iii) the arrangements for EC grant funds
for an amount of ECU 6 million to cofinance the institutional support
component; (iv) the eligibility criteria for the local organizations (non-
government, non-profit organizations with adequate management capacity);
activities to be funded under the institutional support component; and the
arrangements under the institutional support component with the view to ensure
full coordination among the institutions involved in its implementation; (v)
the participating conditions for banks, which include compliance with banking
regulations, satisfactory financial performance and adequate lending policies
and procedures; (vi) the legal agreements required to formalize the
obligations of the entities involved in the implementation of the proposed
project, and regulate the flow of funds from PDB to the beneficiaries; (vii)
the maximum size of sub-loans to finance sub-projects (US$2 million
equivalent), the maximum amount of loan financing per enterprise (US$4 million
equivalent), and financial covenants for eligible enterprises and sub-
projects; (viii) free limits for sub-loans; and (ix) procurement procedures,
disbursement arrangements, atuditing and reporting requirements.   The
conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Guarantor and PDB will
be a condition of loan effectiveness.
15.         Benefits:  The proposed project will assist Poland's economic
transformation program by stimulating the creation and growth of new,
privately-owned enterprises, and by helping to foster an environment in which
they can flourish. The growth of this segment of the economy is expected to
contribute to: addressing a fundamental imbalance in the ownership and size
structure of the enterprise sector; strengthening the culture of
entrepreneurship and improved enterprise management; enhancing competition and
related improvements in productivity; and, critically, generating the much
needed supply response and growth, including of exports. Additionally, the
project would support activities which would help absorb labor shed by the
restruct-tring of state enterprises; and promote regional economic development
with direct and indirect employment generation.
16.         RiVks:  The main risk is related to the uncertainty of
macroeconomic developments and sustainability of current policies, which may
weaken the investment climate and slow down the implementation of the proposed
project by reducing the demand for investment funds. Maintaining economic
stability is, however, a major priority for the Government. The budget
recently presented to parliament incorporates a deficit target that could be
financed from identified domestic and fiaumcial sources consistent with a
moderate inflation scenario. The proposed budget provides a good foundation
for the ongoing negotiations with the IMF on a new Stand-by Arrangement, which
are expected to be completed soon. In addition, the Government is discussing



the contents of a program of enhanced structural reform, aimed at stimulating
the supply response. Measures in this area include accelerating
privatization, confronting the crisis in the financial and state-owned
enterprise sectors, and improving the cost effectiveness of the social safety
net. Agreement on this program of action may lead to substantial Bank support
in the months ahead. Additional risks are related to the limited experience
of institutions supporting private enterprises and the limited managerial and
marketing experience of entrepreneurs. The technical assistance to be
provided under the institutional support component, which complements
technical assistance provided under other Bank operatXons, is designed to
minimize these risks.
17.         Rcommendagion. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
