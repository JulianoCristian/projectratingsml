applicable to the needs and constraints of the producers.\n            The project would consist of: (a) the development of a\n            long-term master plan for agricultural research, including a\n            national seed multiplication and distribution policy and a\n            long-term manpower development plan; (b) support of on-going\n            research programs; (c) institutional development of Institut\n            des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR) through\n            reinforcement and reorganization of research efforts, the\n            expansion of farming systems and on-farm research, better\n            linkages between research and extension activities, and the\n            improvement of research management; (d) development,\n            rehabilitation and equipping of research station facilities\n            and other essential agricultural and laboratory equipment;\n            (e) provision of a soils map of Rwanda; and (f) support to\n            the Agriculture Faculty and to the Department of Geography\n            of the University of Rwanda to increase the research\n            capabilities of students and faculty."}, "docdt":
