Rural Development\n            Program Paraiba Project is one of a series of projects\n            within the new Northeast Rural Program (NRDP). The project\n            objectives are to: (a) increase agricultural production and\n            productivity; (b) generate income and employment\n            opportunities for low-income rural families; and (c) promote\n            water resources development and technology generation and\n            diffusion to decrease small farmers' vulnerability to\n            recurring droughts and pest outbreaks. They also include (d)\n            increasing community participation in all phases of the\n            development process; and (e) strengthening the State of\n            Paraiba's institutional capacity to provide efficient\n            agricultural services to small farmers. In order to meet its\n            objectives, the project supports water resources development\n            for agriculture and domestic use, adaptive agricultural\n            research, agricultural extension, investment credit,\n            marketing services, funding for community subprojects and\n            project adminstration and training."}, "docdt": "1987-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
