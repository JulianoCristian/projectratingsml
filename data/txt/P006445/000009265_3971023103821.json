were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly satisfactory, project sustainability\n            was uncertain, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: when a program strategy and project design\n            is overtaken by events which make it redundant, the Bank\n            should promptly undertake the needed changes, including\n            complete reformulation if necessary, which will enable it to\n            succeed in new circumstances. Grant-based investment is a\n            legitimate and effective tool for jumpstarting capital\n            accumulation by the rural poor, and the matching grant\n            approach has contributed to sustainable local development in\n            the three states. Decentralization of fiscal and investment\n            decision-making to state and local government and\n            beneficiaries improves project administration and subproject\n            quality. Clearly-defined operational incentives and\n            penalties are needed to counter departures from project\n            guidelines. A key component of decentralization, beneficiary\n            participation in subproject selection, implementation,\n            financing, and supervision generates ownership and builds\n            sustainability. Vigilance and appropriate controls are\n            needed to prevent political interference in the\n            participatory process."}, "docdt": "1997-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
