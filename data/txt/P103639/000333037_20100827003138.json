support\n            modeling framework to identify water-related investments and\n            evaluate them in a regional context. There are three\n            components to the project, the first component being\n            knowledge base development. The knowledge base developed\n            will provide a shared, synoptic view of the Eastern Nile\n            basins, including its opportunities and risks as viewed from\n            an economic, environmental and social perspective.  Baseline\n            data will be organized systematically in a Geographic\n            Information System (GIS) platform with an associated web\n            portal. Effective use will be made of modern datasets from\n            satellite remote sensing and other global or regional\n            datasets. The second component is the modeling system. The\n            models will build on a water systems 'spine' using\n            tools developed by the Nile Basin Decision Support System\n            (DSS) to help analyze the economic, environmental and social\n            aspects of investments in a water resources systems\n            framework and to evaluate alternative scenarios of the\n            future.  The tools developed will draw upon and contribute\n            to the knowledge base developed and will be flexible to\n            adapt to changing needs and increasing information\n            availability. Finally, the third component is the\n            institutional and human capacity building."}, "docdt": "2009-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
