                         The development objective of the ENPM Project is that countries in the Eastern Nile operationalize an improved decision support modeling framework to identify
                         water-related investments and evaluate them in a regional context.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall rating of this project is moderately satisfactory. The project progressed slower than initially envisioned for a number of reasons, including (i) need to ensure linkages
                         between this project and evolving overall Nile Basin Decision Support System framework for the NBI, (ii) recent challenges in cooperation among Eastern Nile countries, and (iii)
                         procurement process delays for primary consultancy. The project team spent considerable time working with other NBI teams to ensure that ENPM project outputs would be
                         compatible with other activities, and the ENPM consultancy has now been redesigned so that its outputs will be better integrated into the DSS framework. The project has also been
