The proposed extension of two\n            months till December 31, 2012 is necessary to bring the\n            project to an orderly closure building on its recent\n            momentum. In particular, this minor extension will allow the\n            project to be consistent with the Nile Basin Decision\n            Support System activities (given the close\n            inter-relationship of activities that is being pursued with\n            ENPM) and allow for continuity into a new overall NBI\n            project that is expected to start on January 1, 2013. This\n            will enable the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office\n            (ENTRO) to systematically complete its internship program\n            under the project and complete the training and capacity\n            development activities related to spatial analysis, model\n            development, knowledge products, and portal development\n            under the project.
