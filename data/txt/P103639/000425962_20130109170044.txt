        AFRICA — EASTERN NILE PLANNING MODEL (ENPM) PROJECT
                               P103639
                       NBTF GRANT NO. TF094549

                                   Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for the NBTF Grant for the Africa, Eastern Nile Planning Model
   (ENPM) Project, TF094549, P103639 will be extended from October 30, 2012 until
   December 31, 2012.

2. The ENPM project intends to support the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office
   (ENTRO), one of the three Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) organizations, to provide
   knowledge and analytical services to support water resources planning and
   management in the Eastern Nile. The project has had a slow start but has showed
   remarkable progress in recent months when the implementation modalities were
   modified to improve in-house capacity at ENTRO in providing these services,
   especially in the public domain. In spite of overall (and rapidly evolving) governance
   issues that affect broader regional cooperation among the Eastern Nile countries, the
   project has managed to help ENTRO build strong constituencies for regional
   cooperative work on the development of a knowledge base and analytical tools to
   support the region, especially through excellent work with university networks.

3. The development objective of the ENPM Project is that countries in the Eastern Nile
   operationalize an improved decision support modeling framework to identify water-
   related investments and evaluate them in a regional context. This objective still
   remains valid and achievable with the proposed restructuring.

4. The proposed extension of two months till December 31, 2012 is necessary to bring
   the project to an orderly closure building on its recent momentum. In particular, this
   minor extension will allow the project to be consistent with the Nile Basin Decision
   Support System activities (given the close inter-relationship of activities that is being
   pursued with ENPM) and allow for continuity into a new overall NBI project that is
   expected to start on January 1, 2013. This will enable ENTRO to systematically
   complete its internship program under the project, enhance support for all EN
   riparans, and complete the training and capacity development activities related to
   spatial analysis, model development, knowledge products, and portal development
   under the project. ENTRO has in place an appropriate action plan to complete this
   project by the new closing date.

5. All audit opinions issued have been unqualified and no substantial issues have been
   raised in the management letters. There are no outstanding audits. The current audit
   for the fiscal year ending June 2012 is on-going and not over-due.

6. This will be the first extension of the Closing Date under the project.
