outcomes were\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory and grantee performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: one\n            of the key lessons that this project illustrated was the\n            need to have a project design that focus on end goals and\n            not be too rigid in the implementation modalities to achieve\n            these. A key lesson learned has been that, in complex river\n            basins with largely entrenched government positions, it is\n            critical to broaden the stakeholder pool for engagement.\n            Often, such projects support the development of high-quality\n            multi-sectoral knowledge bases, modeling tools, and\n            technical reports. However, these often remain accessible\n            only by a select few, and new researchers and technical\n            specialists have to often start from scratch. A key decision\n            that has to be made when embarking on the analysis of a\n            basin as complex as the Eastern Nile is to be decide which\n            modeling framework should be utilized. For effective\n            communication of complex issues in the Eastern Nile and\n            change entrenched mindsets, it is critical that information\n            be communicated in customized ways to target different\n            stakeholders. It is often difficult to effectively engage\n            potential users of knowledge and analytical systems without\n            something to show initially. If early efforts are done to\n            pilot the knowledge base and tools, it would be easier to\n            attract a range of potential users and keep them engaged\n            throughout the process."}, "docdt": "2013-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
