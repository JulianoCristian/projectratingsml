                         The development objective of the ENPM Project is that countries in the Eastern Nile operationalize an improved decision support modeling framework to identify water-
                         related investments and evaluate them in a regional context.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall rating of this project is satisfactory. Despite implementation challenges reflecting the current environment for cooperation in the Nile Basin, the Eastern Nile Technical
                         Regional Office (ENTRO), the implementing agency for the project, has been able to effectively pursue appropriate implementation arrangements to enable key elements of the
                         project to be completed. This has included the development of a well-organized comprehensive knowledge base and knowledge products and a range of analytical/modeling tools to
                         examine water resources planning, development, and management issues and investments, and the strengthening of knowledge networks in the Eastern Nile, working closely with
                         Universities and instituting an innovative internship program.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project implementation is closing on Dec 31, 2012 (extended from the original closing date of Oct 30, 2012). The project has enabled ENTRO to be in a position to effectively
                         provide knowledge and analytical services to the EN countries on critical water resources related issues and to build very strong partnerships with Universities in the EN countries.
                         Key elements of the project are expected to be continued and scaled-up under the recently-approved NBI's Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) Project.
