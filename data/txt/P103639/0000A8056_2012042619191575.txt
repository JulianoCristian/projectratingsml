                         The development objective of the ENPM Project is that countries in the Eastern Nile operationalize an improved decision support modeling framework to identify water-
                         related investments and evaluate them in a regional context.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall rating of this project is moderately satisfactory. The project has faced implementation problems reflecting the current environment for cooperation in the Nile Basin. The
                         Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO), the implementing agency for the project, has been able to revise implementation arrangements to enable key elements of the
                         project to be completed - including work on developing a comprehensive knowledge base and key analytical/modeling tools for the Eastern Nile, and create relevant knowledge
                         networks in the Eastern Nile.
