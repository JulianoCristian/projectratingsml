Secretariat for\n            Communication, Public Works and Transport (SECOPT's)\n            capabilities in the areas of transport planning and road\n            maintenance at a cost of almost 20 percent below that\n            estimated at appraisal. Such savings were largely due to the\n            Government's decision, early in the project\n            implementation stage, to carry out a thorough review of the\n            previously prepared engineering of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga\n            road, claiming that the average cost per km was unacceptably\n            high. The Government's view, although originally not\n            fully shared by the Bank, proved to be sound. The loan\n            included a special contingency allowance because of\n            uncertainties in the bidding outcome for the\n            Tegucigalpa-Talanga road. Although the funds were not needed\n            for the original purpose, their availability proved to be\n            very fortunate since they were later allocated, on an\n            emergency basis, to repair the damages caused by Hurricane\n            Fifi, which devastated the Northern part of Honduras in\n            September 1974. The loan included financing of technical\n            assistance to the three Government agencies involved in\n            transport planning and a training program for maintenance\n            personnel. The completion report identifies one lesson to be\n            learned from this project, and that is the importance of the\n            Bank maintaining a flexible and cooperative attitude toward\n            changes in project elements resulting from significantly\n            changed circumstances."}, "docdt": "1982-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
