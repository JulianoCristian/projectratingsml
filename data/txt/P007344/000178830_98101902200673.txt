INTERNATIONAL BANrK FOR RECONSTRUCTION ANlD DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RRCOè1V4ENDATTON OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
FOR A SIXTH HIGHWiAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Honduras for the equivalent of US$18.8 million to help
finance a project for highways. The loan would have a term of 30 years,
including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Recent Developments and Prospects
2.        A report entitled "Basic Report on the Economy of Honduras" twas
distributed to the Executive Directors in June 1972. The main recommenda-
tions of this report stress the importance of policies to diversify the econonmy,
especially through goverrment action to encourage forestry, the necessity of
negotiating a reasonable basis for renewed full participation of Honduras in
the Central American Common Market (CACM), and the desirability of increasing
tax revenues. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Honduras has a small open economy, heavily dependent on the export
of bananas, although a modest degree of diversification has taken place in
the last decade through the development of new export products such as meat,
simple manufactures, cotton and tobacco. Its limited resources consist
mainly of the fertile coastal plain in the north, a few fertile valleys in
the east, and extensive but largely unexploited natural pine forests. Known
mineral deposits are not extensive; they include silver, lead and zinc,
which have been exploited on a small scale for decades, and low-grade iron
ore. Although the average population-to-land ratio is favorable, population
has traditionally concentrated in the mountainous west, the poorest area of
the country, and on the north coastal plain. In the future, as population
pressure increases in these areas, heavy investment in physical infrastructure
will be necessary to facilitate the movement of population of less heavily
settled areas further to the east. This process has already started as the
road network was improved and expanded in recent years.
4.        gith a per capita income of about $290 in 1971,2/ Honduras is the
poorest country in Central America. Real GDP rose at an average annual rate
of 5.6 percent in the 1960's, but much of this expansion took place in 196h-68,
as a consequence of substantial investment and subsequent large increases in
output and export of bananas. Since then, the economy has been in recession,
per capita income increased slowly, and the balance of payments weakened
considerably. Several factors contributed to the recession, including severe
hurricane damage to banana and other crops in 1969, coinciding with the amred
1/ Calculated according toiorld Bank Atlas methodology.



conflict between Honduras and El Salvador and the consequent reduction in
private investment; the withdrawal by Honduras from the free trade arrange-
ments of the Central American Corrnon Market (CACM), a move which has adversely
affected a nimber of export industries; and finally, a severe drought, in 1972
which resulted in a large loss in agricultural production.
5.        The CA(M was an important element in the growrth of the Honduran
economy during the 1960's. Tne CACM5 absorbed Honduran exports of ortaples
which have no ready market elsewhere, and it provided the additional markets
necessary for the establishment of factories making textiles, clotlhing, chem-
icals and metal products. The Honduran authorities felt, however, that the
benefits of integration, especially in terms of industrial investment, were
unequally distributed among the member countries. The other GACM members
recognize the basis for the Honduran complaints, and during the past two
years have sought solutions to the problem. However, no agreeraent has been
reached largely because of the border dispute with El Salvador. As an
interim solution to basic Ccmmon Market problems, Honduras has negotiated
bilateral trade agreements with all its CACM partners except El Salvador,
A new Government took office in December 1972, and has adopted a positive
attitude towards the CACM and the El Salvador border issue. In addition, the
Common Market Secretariat (SIECA) has prepared a st-ady which proposes solutions
to existing problems, and makes recommendations geared to the foriation of a
Central American Economic Community. The report has been well received by the
CACH member governments, including Honduras. Discussions of the propo3als
among the five member countries, expected to lead to agreement on issues such
as ccmplete free trade and rationalization of the comon tariff, will be
carried out throughout this year.
6.        During most of the 1960's the Goverrment followed an aggressive
developnent policy. Among the major achievements in this period were the
establishment of a basic transport network connecting the main poDulation
centers, the expansion of electric power and telecommunications services,
and the doubling of primary school enrollment. UntLl 1968, there were no
financial difficulties in carrying forward these schemes, mainly because of
the fast growth of gover2nert revenues based on the introduction of a general
sales tax and higher income tax rates in 1964, and larger tax paynents by- the
banana companies. Since 1969, however, the public sector has experienced a
sharp deterioration in its finances, initially because of defense and other
emergency expenditures connected wxith the 1969 border incident with El Salva-
dor, and later because the normal growth of goverrnent current exDenditures
outstripped that of current revenuaes. Public sector savings declined frm
an average cf 2.7 percent of GDP in 1966-68 to 1.6 percent of GDP in 1969-71.
In spite of this, the public sector maintained an impressive investment effort
with the average investment ratio rising from 3.6 to 6.2 percent of GDP over
the same period. A large increase in net foreign financing did not cover the
overall p-ublic sector deficit, and the Central Bank was required to finance
the gap, ecuivalent tc about 1.3 percent of GDP in 1969-71. In the twelve
months ending in November 197?, however, public sector borrowing was reduced
to less than 0.5 percent of GDP.



- 3 -
7.        In December 19729 a military Governnent took power, and announced
its intention to pursue progressive development policies, and to tackle the
country's fundamental econcnic and social problems. Since then,the new Govern-
ment has been working closely with international agencies in an effort to
revise and accelerate the execution of a tentative investment program prepared
last year. The progrEa provides for continued investments in physical infra-
structure, especially power and transport, and a substantial increase of invest-
ment in the social sectors, particularly education and water supply, and in
directly productive sectors, giving special emphasis to agricultural diver-
sification. The forestry sector offers the best opportunity for the medium-
term diversification of production with good export potential. Various
institutional difficulties inhibit the prcnpt establishment of a pulp and
paper industry, but an imaginative approach, perhaps drawing together capital
frcm other Central American countries, could help overcoe scme of these
problems.
External Assistance
8.        The external lending agencies have strongly supported public invest-
rment in Honduras. Apart from the Bank Group, external financing is provided
principally by USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAID has been active in
education, health, feeder road construction, water supply and agriculture; it
was also instrumental in the formation of a private industrial finance company.
IDB has been involved in housing, education, water and sewerage, and highways.
It also supports agricultural and industrial projects by means of general
credit lines to the government-owned development bank. CABEI is financing
projects with a regional impact, primarily in transport, industry and tele-
communications. Past lending of these agencies is sumnmarized below.

IDB and CABEI are expected to continue financing projects in the sectors which
they have financed in the past, although CABEI *ill focus increasingly on
tourism.  USAID, on the other hand, may concentrate ito future lending in agri-
culture, depending on the results of an ongoing sector s-urvey which it is
financing.
9.        Since its poverty, meagre resource endowment and uncertain balance
of payments prospects make it difficult for Honduras - one of the laast
developed coantries in Latin Amierica - to borrow substantial. mounts on con-
ventional terms, external agencies have extended financial assi.stance on
fairly soft teras so that debt service, while it has risen significantly in
the last few years, is still low. It would be desirable to maintain reason-
ably soft average terms of assistance in the futuzre in order to keep the
debt service ratio within moderate limits, and further IDA credits are
accordingly being planned. However, Honduras does have some margirn for
borrowing on corventional terms; assimting that the average terms of external
borrowing were to remain more or less the sane as in the past, the debt
service ratio would rise to about 6.5 percent by the end of the decade, which
is manageable for an economy such as Honduras. Therefore, Honduras can be
regarded as creditworthy for the proposed loan.
PART II - BANK GRO-LP O?PEEATIONS TN HONDTUAS
10.       Honduras has to date received eleven Bank loans totalling US$YCXL
million and five IDA credits totalling US$21j.0 million, both net of cancel-
lations, making a total of US$94.4 million.  At the end of March 1973, the
Bank and IDA held about US$31.6 million, including about USb24.4 million not
yet disbursed. The most recent loan, for power, was signed in Jane 1972.
The proposed loan is the only operation in Honduras to be presented for your
consideration during the current fiscal year.
11.       Execution of Bank Group financed projects has, on the whole, been
satisfactory. Annex II contains a summiary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1973, and notes on the execution
of on-going projecvs.
12.       In the past, Bank and IDA lending has been heavily concentrated on
transport and power, where inadequate facilities hampered the development of
the country. The first livestock development credit approved in -1970, however,
marked the beginning of a major diversification in lending.  The Bank's
lending program for FY73-77 would support the priorities of the Government's
investment plan by giving increased emphasis to investment in the social and
directly productive sectors while continuing to lend for physical infra-
structure,where there are still substantial deficiencies to be made good.
13.       Over the past two years the Bank has been working closely with the
Government in developing programs in education and agriculture. A first
education project, wnich I hope to present for your consideration in the next
few months, includes non-fonral technical training, agricultural education,



and teacher training programs, which are long neglected areas that deserve
the highest priority. The objectives of lending for agriculture are to
assist in diversifying the economy, developing competitive exports in high-
value products, and supporting the Government's efforts in agrarian reforn.
A second livestock project, which will be geared to help the smaller pro-
ducer, will also be presented for your consideration in the next few months.
The project will be broader in scope than the first, including financing for
dairying, pig production and slaughterhouses, and a large component of tech-
nical assistance to train local technicians in livestock production and help
small farners. Other agricultural projects aimed at supporting the Govern-
ment's land colonization programs,and to increasing production of high value
crops are under consideration.
14.       We plan to assist industry in Honduras as well as in the other
Central anerican countries by lending to the Central American Bank for Eco-
nomic Integration (CABEI). Lending for industry through a multinational
institution such as CABEI would serve a number of purposes: it would support
the Central American integration effort; foster rational industrialization
in the area (national markets are too small to penmit efficient industrial
development); and assist in diversifying the region's economy.    I hope to
present for your consideration a first loan to CABEI during the next fiscal
year.
15.       In transport, we will continue to assist the Government to ccmplete
the highway links between the main regions of the country, but will in the
future increase our assistance, in consultation with IDB, in the construction
of a network of feeder and access roads to support the Government's agri-
cultural program. The project which I am presenting for your consideration
today includes financing for the first part of this feeder road program.
16.       IFC has participated in two projects in Honduras. A total of
US$378,000 was invested in a leather tanning project in 1964 and 1966. The
more important operation is a pilot project for pulp and paper industry to
utilize the wood resources of the Olancho Reserve.   A pilot company, Compania
Pino Celulosa de Centro Am6rica S.A. (COPINO), was established in June 1968,
under the leadership of International Paper Company (IPC), to investigate
and possibly carry out a project. IFC invested US$75,ooo in COPINO in 1969
and 1970. In March 1971, IPC discontinued its participation in COPINO, and
efforts to find other technical partners have so far not been successful.
The new Government has indicated that it desires to find some means of
exploiting the Olancho forest, but no specific plans in this regard have yet
been formulated.
PART III - THE TRhASPORT SECTOR
Background
2
17.       Honduras, with an area of L15 thousand kn ,is the second largest
of the Central American countries and the most mountainous. Population
density is low, about 23 per lan2, but population is heavily concentrated in
the western part of the country and along the north coast    The terrain is



- 6-
r-ugged and traversed by many rivers, and these features, together with the
tropical climate, have traditionally made road and railroad construction and
maintenance difficult and expensive. Unlike other Central American countries
where urban  population has concentrated in one center, there are three major
and relatively distant urban centers in Honduras: Tegucigalpa, the capital,
in the central zone, and industrial San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba, both of which
developed around the banana industry on the north coast. An inadequate
transport system has hampered communications between the major centers within
Honduras, and between Honduras and the other Central American cou7ntries, and
has been a major stumbling block in the country's developnent.
18.       sJith four loans and two credits totalling US$36.2 million for
highways, and two loans totalling US$1006 million for ports, the BarIC Groupi
has been closely associated wTith the develo,mient of the transport svstem in
Honduras. The Bank has contributed to financing the basic highw-y network
of the country. In addition, it hlas been instrumental in establishing and
strengthening the port authority, and has provided the bulk of financing
required to implement the Govermnent's expansion plans in ports.
19.       Development of the transport sector began only- in the mid-fifties
with the construction of the Inter-American Highwa,- in the southern part of
the country. Transport facilities are mainly concentrated in the western
half of the country and along the densely populated north coast. Folr pa77ed
roads, San Lorenzo-Tegucigalpa-Puerto Cort6s (the north*-south road), San
Pedro Sula-Ocotepeque (from the north coast to the El Salvador border), San
Pedro Sula-La Ceiba (along the north coast) and the Inter-American Highway
(in the extreme south), constitute tihe main highway network0  The railway,
principally used to transport banatnas, runs along -the Atlantic coast between
Puerto Cort6s ard Sonaguera.   Until recently, air services pla-yed a vital
role in the developnent of the country providing transport for many remot.e
areas.  As a result of the recent improvement of the highway system, however,
domestic air service has been discontinued in many areas; nevertheless,
total air traffic, especially for passengers, has been steadily increasing.
In 1971, more than 86 percent of all freight t:raffic (i-n' tons) was carried
by road, 11 percent by rail and less than 3 percent by air.
20.      About 90 percent of the country's international trade is handled
by the ports, and the Government attaches high priority to their develop-
ment. Puerto Cort6s, on the north coast, is the principal port with a total
traffic exceeding 2 million tons per annura. It handles about half of the
total banana ex-orts while the two other specialized ports east of Cort6s,
Tela and La Ceiba (also on the north coast), export the remainder. Amapala,
on the island of El Tigre, and El Muerto are the only accessible anchorages
on the Pacific coast for ocean-going ships; they are lighterage ports, and
cargoes are hauled by tugs to and from San Lorenzo on the mainland9   About
120,000 tons of lumber - re-presenting about two-thirds of total traffic
through the Dort - are exported annually through Amapala-San Lorenzo-El Muerto.
The Bank's loan for the Second Port Project is assisting the Government in
financing a deep water port at Henecan in the Pacific 



- 7-
Transport Policy and Coordination
21.       Transport planning and the preparation of transport investment
programs are the responsibility of the Technical Secretariat of Planning (STP),
in coordination with the Planning Unit of the Secretariat of Camuunications,
Public Works and Transport (SCOPT), and the Port Authority. The Planning Unit
of SCOPT was created following agreements reached in connection with the loans
for the fourth (North Road) and fifth (Western Highway Paving) highway projects.
22.       A Six-Year Transport Investment Program (1972-77) prepared last
year follows the recommendations of a Bank-financed transport survey prepared
by the Stanford Research Institute. The program amounts to about US$Th5
million, which would represent around 26 percent of the total public invest-
ment program over the five-year period. A major portion of the proposed
investment will be devoted to road improvement and feeder road construction
to support the agricultural development program of the Government.
23.       The Six-Year Transport Investment Program contains much valuable
information, but additional work is required to establish priorities within
the sector. Staff in both the Transport Department of the STP and the Plan-
ning Unit of the SCOPT lacks transport planning experience and the basi^.
data with which to work. To remedy these shortcomings, the proposed project
includes financing of technical assistance to strengthen transport planring.
2h.       Coordination of the transport sector is not a serious problem in
Honduras because there is little competition between different modes of
transport. The railway serves only a small part of the country and ne-ther
coastal shipping nor inland water transportation is of any significance.
Internal air services still currently serve cities and towns which are also
served by roads (e.g. Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula), but each mode caters
to a different segment of the market and there is no uneconomic compotitioln.
The Highway Sub-Sector
25.       Honduras has a total road network of about 5,590 km, of which
about 1,170 Im are paved; there has been a ten-fold increase in the paved
length since 1960. The increase in road transport has been in line with the
expansion of the network. The vehicle fleet grew at a rate of about 11 per-
cent per year over the past ten years, and the fleet of about 31,000 vehicles
in 1971 is adequate to satisfy demand.
26.       The General Directorate of Highways (DGC) within SCOPT is responsible
for constructing all roads in the country. It also undertakes design work for
minor improvements and for some feeder roads. The new Government has created
a General Directorate of Maintenance (DGM) with a view to increasing efficiency
in maintenance operations. Routine maintenance is carried out by force account,
and has recently been taken over by the DGMo Under the loan agreements for the
fourth and fifth highway projects, the Government agreed to carry out a number



- a-
of important refoms ini highway administration, mainly aimed at improving
highway maintenance. The technical expertise and equipaent of the highway
construction and maintenance organization have 'oeen materially strengthened,
although there is still room for improvement. The preposed project there-
fore provides for training of highway engineers, supervisors and technicans
of SCOTP.
27.       Honduras has about six local firms capable of executing small to
medimu scale c onstruction works. For larger works, most of these firms have
been associated with foreign contractors. In addition, there are about 20
small firms apecializing in drainage structures and minor earthworks which
are periodically engaged by DOC. The growth of a strong dcrtestic contracting
industry has been inhibited by uneven budgetary allocations, and by the
uneven flow of foreign financing for highway construction which have led to
uncertainties and idle periods for the contracting firms.
28.      About 75 percent of highway investment has been financed from external
sources, and the highway investment program contemplates a corresponding share
of external financing in the f-ture. Highway revenues from road user charges
currently total US$7.5 million, which appreciably exceed expenditures on
administration and maintenance alorne. Th:Ls level of road user charges is
considered acceptable frcm the point cf view of promoting efficient use of
transport facilities, but further consideration needs to be given to increas-
ing these charges, taking irto account the coimntry7ls fiscal problems.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       A report entitled "Honduras - Appraisal of a Sixtbh Highway Project"t
(No. 101-HOa) dated Pay 1h, 1973, is being distributed separately. The main
features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III. Feasibility
studies for the construction components of the project were prepared by
Howard Humphreys Keeble and Partners, of the United Kingdom, and Brown and
Root Engineering of the United States. The project was appraised in the field
in November 1972, Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington
in April 1973. The Government was represented by Messrs. herman Aparicio,
Vice Minister of Communications, 1ublic Works and Transport, Roberto Galvez,
Ambassador of Honduras to the United States,and Gulliermo Bueso, Economic
Advisor to the Embassy of Honduras in the United States,
Project Description
30.       The project forus an important portion of the Governmentrs 1972-77
highway investment program and consists of:
(a)  construction of a 55 kn primary road from TegucigaLpa to
Talanga, t>he first leg of the main route between Tegucigalpa
and Juticalpa, 3erving the rich eastern zone of Honduras,
wfhere lumber erploitation is intensive, and agricultural
and further forestry development pracxising; construction



-9-
and supervision of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road is the most
important component of the project, constituting 60 percent
of total project costs;
(b)  improvement of a 45 hm secondary road frcm Canayagua to La
Libertad that would connect the fertile Comayagua Valley in
central Honduras to the Tegucigalpa-San Pedro Sula road;
(c)  improvement of 80 km of feeder roads, and construction of
a 200 m bridge over the Ulua River, along the La Ceibita-
San Nicolas feeder road. The feeder roads would support
the agricultural development program of the Government;
(d) consulting services to supervise the construction program
listed in (a), (b), and (c) above;
(e) consulting services to carry out the engineering design for
the Ccmayagua-La Libertad road, the Ulua bridge, and part of
the feeder road program;
(f) studies of additional feeder roads for possible future Bank
financing;
(g) a training programn for highway engineers, supervisors and
technicians of the Secretariat of Communications, Public
Works and Transport;
(h) assistance in transport planning to the Technical Secretariat
of Planning and to the Secretariat of Communications, Public
Works and Transport.
31.       The Secretariat of Communications, Public Works and Transport would
be responsible for the execution of all construction, supervision, and train-
ing. Consulting engineers would supervise all the construction canponents
of the project. The project is expected to be carried out during 1973-76.
Cost Estimates and Financing
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$25.8 million
including contingency allowances; a detailed breakdown of costs is given in
Annex III. The proposed loan of US$18.8 million equivalent would finance
the estimated foreign exchange ccmponent of the project. However, a small
amount of local currency (up to US$o.4 million) may be financed depending on
which consulting firms are engaged to carry out the supervision of construc-
tion, and the feasibility and engineering studies. The remaining local
currency component would be financed by the Government.
33.       No contracts have recently been awarded for major highway works,
and it is therefore difficult to judge the response to the forthcaning
bidding for the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road. Since bids higher than the



- 10 -
estimate would place a heavy bulrden on the Government, a special contin-
gency of 15 percent of the construction cost of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga
road has been izcLuded in the uroposed loan amount; this contingency would
be cancelled, after consultat,ion with the Borrower, if the results of the
bidding indicate it is not needed.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       Contracts for the construction of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road would
be let on the basis of interrnational competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. Contracts for the secondary and feeder roads, however, would
be relatively small (about seven contracts totalling US$2.0 million), and
construction sites are so clispersed that they are unlikely to attract foreign
companies not presently operating or represented in the country. Since there
would be little, if any, advantage derived frcm :international advertising,
these contracts would be advertised locally only. This would not exclude
participation by interested foreign bidders.
35.       The loan would be used to cover 74 percent of total expenditures for
civil works contracts; 60 percent of total expenditures for consult.ing senrices,
and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the technicaL assi&stance for trans-
port planning and for the training program. It is propc,sed t.lat -ip to U-$50,000
be reimbursed to the Goverment from the proposed loan for expenditures in re-
spect of engineering services necessary for p:roject preparation incurred
between April 1, 1973, and, the date of signmig. Annex III includes the dis-
bursement schedale for the proposed loan.
Economic Justification
36.       The economic rate of return of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road, the
major component of the project, is estimated at 13 percent. The rate of
return of the secondary and feeder road program is about 1? percent. In
calculating the economic rate of return, only the readily qnuantifiable bene-
fits of reduced vehicle operating costs and lower maintenance costs have been
considered.
37.       The project can be expected to play an important role in the devel-
opment of forestry and agriculture.  The Tegucigalpa-Talarnga road would lead
to more efficient lumber'ng and thereby further promote the area's lumber
industry, which accounts for about 35 percent of Honduras total Ilwmber pro-
duction.  At present, high transport costs and difficult access to markets
are severe disincentives to producers.
38.       The proposed Tegucigalpa-Talanga road is the first step towards
opening the rich and practically unexploited agricultural regiorn of Olancho
that is about 100 km east uo' Talanga. The difficult road section between
Tegucigalpa and Talanga has been a major obstacle for developing the Olancho
region. The reduced tranisport costs between Tegucigalpa and Talanga will
stimulate production in the Olancho region of basic agricultural products
for the Tegucigal-a area, and of livestock and cotton for export. By opening
the largely unexploited and potentially rich eastern frontier of Honduras,

where the Government plans to concentrate its colonization programs, the
project will contribute to improving productivity and the pattern of land
tenure in the agricultural sector.
39.       The feeder road improvements contemplated in the project are
designed to support the Government's agricultural program. The roads will
provide farms in the affected regions with better access to the national
market, which coupled with the extension services to be provided by the
Government, is expected to increase production.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
4O.       As mentioned above, a military Government took power in December
1972 under General Oswaldo L6pez Arellano, who was President of Honduras frcm
1963 to 1971. The new Government is in control, and has been recognized by
most Bank member countries. In the past, there have been "de facto" govern-
ments in Honduras and successor governments have recognized the obligations
incurred by them; the present Government has stated that it will honor
obligations incurred by its predecessors. The constitution of June 2, 1965,
remains in force, and is being applied to the extent that it is not incon-
sistent with the decisions of the Government. Our loans to, or guarantees
by, Honduras require congressional approval under the 1965 constitution.
Due to the dissolution of Congress, such approval would now be obtained
through a Law-Decree issued by the Head of State in Council of Ministers.
This procedure is acceptable to the Bank.
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Honduras and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolution ap-
proving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the usual pattern for
highway projects.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I reconmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln No. 1495 'Western Highway Paving Project: US$8.6 million Loan of May 26, 1967;
Closing Date: September 28. 1973.
Paving work has been completed, although some slide removal and
minor drainage works are under way. Loan is expected to be fully disbursed
by the Closing Date.
Cr Nio. 179 Livestock Development Project: US$2.6 million Credit of March 2, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The credit has been fully committed, and disbursements are nolw pro-
ceeding on schedule.
Ln Hlo. 692  Fourth Power Project: Ut$5.5 million Loan and US$5.5 million Credit
Cr No. 201 both of June 24, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
Engineering studies carried out after the signing of the Loan/Credit
suggested, partly because of the proposed interconnection with Nicaragua, a
number of changes in the design of the project which made necessary amending the
original project description. These changes delayed bid preparation for and
construction of the project's transmission and sub-transmission components by
about six months. Disbursements are still expected to be completed on scheduale
by June 30, 19714.
Ln No. 767 Second Port Project: US$6.0 million Loan of June 25, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project provides for the expansion of Puerto Cort&s in the
north of Honduras, and the construction of the new port of Henecan in the
south. After loan signing, thp Honduran Congress, partly for political reasons
associated wqith the border issue with El Salvador, expressed reservations about
the construction of a port at Henecan. The Government, the Port Authority and
the Bank agreed to postpone the construction of Henecan until additional studies
were carried out. However, the Government that took office in December 1972,
and the Port Authority have now decided to proceed with the construction of
Henecan. As a result of the delays, execution of the project is about 18 months
behind schedule.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Ln No. 841 Fifth Power Pro,ject: US$12.3 million Loan of June 28, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Construction of the La Ceiba diesel units, the generation component
of the project, is expected to proceed on schedule. Delays in negotiations with
major customers and with the Nicaraguan utility may delay completion of the
transmission components of the project; completion of construction and disburse-
ments is still expected by June 30, 1976.
