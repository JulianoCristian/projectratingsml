Global Environmental Objectives

 Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Project development objectives are: (a) to enhance capacity and awareness at key national agencies and at local levels, to respond to
 climate variability and change; and (b) to better equip local communities to cope with climate change through the conservation and use of agro-
 biodiversity.


 Has the Global Environmental Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?
 No

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

1. This ISR Update records the progress status of two associated grants sharing the same project identification number P103922: (i) Agro-
biodiversity and Climate Adaptation Project/ACAP (GEF grant TF096330) and (ii) Piloting Coping Strategies for Rainfed Farmers Project (JSDF
grant TF098754).
2. Because of earlier travel restrictions associated with the country security situation, this update is based on a desk review of progress reports
prepared by the implementing agency (Project Support Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI/PSU)) and consultations undertaken
with the national counterparts via Skype and Video-conference on October 30, November 6 and 13, 2014.
3. After significant startup delays, both grants are under way to achieve most of their stated objectives and results by the upcoming closing date of
March 5, 2015.
4. GEF ACAP - The accelerated pace of implementation has been sustained since the last mission in March 2014. As a result, all major activities
under each of the project components are already completed or well underway for completion before the upcoming closing date of March 5, 2015.
Key activities remaining pending are related to downscaling of climate models and sharing climate information with stakeholders and end-users.
Disbursement levels are expected to exceed 80%.

 5. JSDF Piloting Coping Strategies - Despite the relatively low disbursement level of 33%, implementation performance of all activities has
improved with noticeable progress under the four components and the project is expected to achieve its objectives by the closing date of March 5,
2015. The end-target value for most of the intermediate outcome indicators has been achieved due to use of the already existing field units of MAI
in the targeted districts.
6. Maintaining this accelerated pace of execution during the final months will be critical to allow the satisfactory achievement of ACAP’s stated
objective and results.
7. In view of the approaching closing date of the two grants, enhanced coordination and collaboration amongst the Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation (MAI) and the Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority (CAMA) are required to complete in time the remaining activities related to climate
change modeling, capacity building and information sharing with end-users. The Recipient's project completion report will be submitted to the Wolrd
Bank before the closing of the two grants.

               Training was on a continuous process and included farmers and technical training. Farmers training focused on awareness, building capacity
               of community organizations, preparation of community plans, etc; while technical training for engineers from CAMA, NWRA, AREA and MAI
               is on technical and policy issues. About 50% of the participants from the farming communities are women.
