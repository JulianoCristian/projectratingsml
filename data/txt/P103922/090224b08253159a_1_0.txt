                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objectives are: (a) to enhance capacity and awareness at key national agencies and at local levels, to respond to climate variability and change;
                         and (b) to better equip local communities to cope with climate change through the conservation and use of agro-biodiversity.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. This ISR Update records the progress status of the two associated projects sharing the same project identification number P103922: (i) Agro-biodiversity and Climate Adaptation
                         Project/ACAP (GEF grant TF096330) and (ii) Piloting Coping Strategies for Rainfed Farmers Project (JSDF grant TF098754).

                         2. This update is based on the outcome of the mid-term review of the GEF ACAP and implementation support mission of the JSDF Piloting Coping Strategies conducted in Sana’a

                         3. GEF ACAP - The project objectives remain relevant and are mostly achievable. The pace of implementation continues to improve since the last mission in October 2013. All major
                         activities under each of the components are well underway. With this sustained trend of improved implementation performance, most of the activities are expected to be completed by

                         project closing.

                         4. JSDF Piloting Coping Strategies - Implementation performance of all activities has improved with noticeable progress under the four components. In this case as well, the
                         sustained trend of improved implementation performance is expected to allow for the proper completion of most of activities by project closing. Opportunities to build on the
                         knowledge developed and to scale up relevant experiences piloted under ACAP and its associated JSDF grant have been identified with new projects being prepared in the areas of
                         agriculture and rural development, climate change adaptation and resilience. These need to be explored and promoted actively.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Maintaining this accelerated pace of execution during the coming months will be critical to allow the satisfactory achievement of ACAP’s stated objective and results.

                         2. In view of the approaching closing deadlines of the two grants, enhanced coordination and collaboration amongst the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI), the Civil Aviation
                         and Meteorology Authority (CAMA), and the Agriculture Research and Extension Authority (AREA), are required to complete in time the joint activities related to climate change
                         modeling, capacity building and prompt adoption of the strategy being finalized for climate resilient agriculture for rainfed highlands.

                         3. Relevant lessons learned and technical knowledge acquired from the implementation of ACAP and the JSDP Piloting Coping Strategies should be made available in a timely
                         fashion to capitalize experience gained and take advantage of the opportunities for scaling up under similar new projects, in particular the two which are currently under preparation
                         with World Bank support: (a) Smallholder Agriculture Productivity Enhancement Project/SAPEP-GAFSP, and (b) Climate Resilience of Rural Communities(CRRC).

                         4. In order to address effectively eventual complaints that may arise from the implementation of project activities, necessary steps will be taken by the project unit to include a
                         grievance redress mechanism (GRM) in the Project Implementation Manual of GEF ACAP and JSDF Piloting Coping Strategies grant.
