                         The Project development objectives are: (a) to enhance capacity and awareness at key national agencies and at local levels, to respond to climate variability and change;
                         and (b) to better equip local communities to cope with climate change through the conservation and use of agro-biodiversity.

                         Adaptation Project / ACAP (GEF grant TF96330-RY) and (ii) the Piloting Coping Strategies for Rainfed Farmers Project (JSDF grant TF098754).

                         2. This update is based on the outcome of the implementation support mission conducted in Sana’a from October 20-31, 2013 and subsequent monitoring of progress with key

                         agreed-upon actions and next steps up to the end of December 2013. After slower than expected progress in most of 2013, the pace of implementation has progressively accelerated
                         in the last two months of 2013. Most progress under ACAP has been on community investments (water harvesting and storage tanks, terrace rehabilitation and upgrading, soil
                         conservation structures, etc.). As for the JSDF grant some civil works on community investments were carried out during the past six months. With the signing in July 2013 of the
                         amendments to the ACAP and JSDF grant, the Project Support Unit (PSU) implementing these projects has been strengthening its core technical and operational capacity through

                         the recruitment of needed consultants (including a monitoring and evaluation specialist). With this acquired additional capacity and the recent completion of multiple procurement and
                         contract awarding processes (equipment to support the development of climate-resilient profiles of landraces, or the improvement of climate data bases, etc.), further acceleration in
                         the pace of implementation is expected for these two grants in the coming months.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The Mid-term Review of ACAP is scheduled for March 2014. It will provide an opportunity to review in detail the implementation performance of this project, to assess its relevance
                         and to decide on adjustments that may be needed in light of the current circumstances to better ensure the achievement of the stated objectives and expected results. Mid-term
                         decisions regarding the way forward with the ACAP for the remaining implementation period will be informed by the levels of satisfactory progress reached in March 2014.

                         2. As a reminder, the first level 2 restructuring of ACAP was signed on July 16, 2013. The purpose was to : (a) formalize the transfer of project implementation responsibility to the
                         MAI/PSU following the closing on June 30, 2012 of the Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project (GSCP) and its Project Coordination Unit (PCU), (b) reschedule the mid-term
                         review (MTR) date of ACAP from August 31, 2012 to March 31, 2014 (due to the severe start up delays associated with the socio-political events of late 2010 and 2011 in Yemen),
                         and (c) introduce the modality of “individual consultant” as a procurement method to access consultant services needed to strengthen the capacity of MAI/PSU to handle the
                         additional implementation responsibility of ACAP.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
