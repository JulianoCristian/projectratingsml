                         The Project development objectives are: (a) to enhance capacity and awareness at key national agencies and at local levels, to respond to climate variability and change;
                         and (b) to better equip local communities to cope with climate change through the conservation and use of agro-biodiversity.

                         and Climate Adaptation Project (ACAP) and (b) the JSDF grant TF098754 for the Piloting Coping Strategies for Rainfed Farmers.

                         the previous ISR of January 2013, the project has experienced further implementation delays due in large part to changes in personnel in the new unit coordinating the
                         implementation of both grants and which is the Project Support Unit (PSU) of the Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock Project (RALP) at the Ministry of Agriculture (MAI). As a result,
                         overall implementation progress in recent months has much slower and much more limited than planned. Most recent progress has been with activities related to community
                         investments for water harvesting and storage facilities, rehabilitation of terraces and soil conservation, and the advancement of procurement processes to purchase equipment in

                         CAMA (Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority.

                         3. With various new recruitments of needed replacement or additional staff well underway since April 2013, to strengthen its capacity, the MAI/PSU is confident that the pace of
                         implementation will increase significantly in the coming months and should allow to make up for most of the delays accumulated.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The process of amending the Grant agreements to formalize the new implementation arrangement through the MAI/PSU is well underway (see level two restructuring packages
                         attached). The final approval of these amendments by the Yemeni Government is expected before the end of July 2013. The amendment of the GEF agreement for ACAP will also
                         include the following: (a) adjustment of its financing plan to take into account the closing of the PHRD/CCIG Grant; (b) rescheduling of its midterm review (MTR) date from August 31,

                         2012 to March 31, 2014, (since the MTR did not take place as originally scheduled in the grant because of the relatively incipient stage of implementation due to severe start-up
                         delays associated with the socio-political events of late 2010 and 2011); and (c) introduction of the modality of “individual Consultant” as a procurement method to access consultant
                         services needed to strengthen the capacity of MAI/PSU to handle effectively the additional implementation responsibility of ACAP.

                         2. Nevertheless, completing these amendment processes is not preventing the MAI-PSU from moving forward with the implementation of key activities of these two projects.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
