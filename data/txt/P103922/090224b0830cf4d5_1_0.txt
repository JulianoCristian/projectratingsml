F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were: (a) to enhance capacity and awareness
at key national agencies and at local levels, to respond to climate variability and change;
and (b) to better equip local communities to cope with climate change through the
conservation and use of agro-biodiversity.
In addition, under the JSDF grant, the project was to provide a suite of options to poor and
vulnerable farmers in the highlands, particularly women, to cope with climate change.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     The Agro-biodiversity and Climate Adaptation Project (ACAP) was implemented
with the support of two grants – US$4.0 million from the Global Environmental Facility
Trust Fund (GEF) and US$2.8 million from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF).
Both grants were intended to build climate resilience of the rainfed agro-ecosystem in
Yemen’s highlands; hence the aim of ACAP was to conserve agro-biodiversity and
enhance national capacity in climate modeling and analysis. This ICR presents the
achievements of ACAP with both sources of funding included. The ICR was prepared
during a difficult and extended period of political upheaval and deteriorating security
conditions that prevented in-country visits.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.      At Appraisal, almost half of the population living in rural areas was classified as
poor, and 83 percent of the poor lived in rural areas. They derived a large share of their
income from agriculture or agriculture-related activities. However, Yemeni agriculture
faced severe constraints to development, in particular the depletion of groundwater
resources. In addition, based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC)
projections, temperatures across the country were expected to rise anywhere between 1.4
and 2.8 degrees Celsius by 2050. Precipitation and cloud cover patterns were more
uncertain, and rainfall variability was likely to be more pronounced. The increased
variability in precipitation raised the risk of crop failure and loss of livelihoods in a region
where the level of poverty was already high and water was already a scarce resource. One
study estimated that climate change could lead to a 50% reduction of crop yields for rain-
based agricultural crops by 2020.

3.      The good news was that the agro-biodiversity of the highlands, together with the
traditional knowledge of farmers, had been the cornerstone of communities’ ability to adapt
to changing climatic conditions in the past. With systematic documentation and testing for
climate resilience, these agro-biodiversity resources and the traditional knowledge had the
potential to ‘climate proof’ rainfed agriculture in the future. However, there was a need to
understand the extent and direction of climate change in the country, and it was essential
to develop national capacity in climate data collection and analysis to generate country-
specific climate scenarios.

4.      Rationale for Bank involvement. IDA has been supporting the development of the
agriculture sector in Yemen for over three decades. Its past portfolio included projects in
agricultural research and extension and productivity improvement. Recent IDA projects
had focused on groundwater and soil conservation (FY04), and on rainfed agriculture and
livestock (FY07). The ACAP was expected to continue to support the agriculture sector,
while broadening the focus to meet the challenges posed by climate change. The ACAP
was to be strategically aligned with both the Ground Water and Soil Conservation (GSCP)
and the Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock Project (RALP). The ACAP was to collaborate
with the GSCP to encourage water harvesting and increasing irrigation efficiency as part



                                               1
of a climate-resilient “win-win strategy”. With the RALP, ACAP was to collaborate
through its activities under Component 1, which are complementary to Component 1 of
RALP, to include climate considerations in the identification and improvement of local
landraces of cereals and lentils. In addition, as the convener of the Climate Investment
Fund and the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR), the Bank provided intellectual
leadership on the issue of building climate resilience and ‘climate proofing’ development
in some of the least developed countries. The ACAP was one of the first pilot operations
to address adaptation on the ground in a country selected for the PPCR. The sequencing
of the various projects, with ACAP having to follow the Bank’s other two initiatives as
well as PPCR requirements, however, led to considerable delay between the Concept
Review (May 2007) and Appraisal (February 2010).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      The original PDOs were: (a) to enhance capacity and awareness at key national
agencies and at local levels, to respond to climate variability and change; and (b) to better
equip local communities to cope with climate change through the conservation and use of
agro-biodiversity. The key indicators were: (a) Strategy for Climate-Resilient Agriculture
for Rainfed Highlands adopted and applied by key national agencies (PDO Indicator 2);
and (b) Lessons from the community pilots are documented and scaled up (PDO Indicator
1).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

6.       The PDO remained unchanged. With the JSDF financing, the ACAP was to provide
a suite of options to poor and vulnerable farmers in the highlands, particularly women, to cope
with climate change. The options that were proposed by JSDF were not that different from
the coping strategies that the GEF grant provided. Equipping local communities with
coping strategies was the same as providing a suite of options to cope with climate change.

7.       The JSDF grant added three key indicators, namely, (a) number of pilot
communities that had developed plans for natural resource management focusing on
conservation and adaptation planning based on agro-biodiversity resources (PDO Indicator
7); (b) number of beneficiaries, especially female, that were trained on water conservation,
nutrition, natural resource conservation, etc., beyond the 10-12 pilot villages (PDO
Indicator 8); and (c) number of community pilots using local knowledge & agro-
biodiversity resources designed and developed (PDO Indicator 9). Lastly, to make the
GEF-financed activity similarly accountable, four more key indicators were added to the
list as follows (a) number of direct project beneficiaries (PDO Indicator 3); (b) percentage
of female beneficiaries (PDO Indicator 4); number of client days of training provided (PDO
Indicator 4); and (d) percentage of client days of training provided for females (PDO
Indicator 5). The multiplicity of indicators (9 PDO indicators and 18 Intermediate Outcome
Indicators) were, however, quite integrated and manageable because of the integration at
the level of project components (see below).




                                              2
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.      The Project enabled beneficiaries, who were farmers in the rainfed highlands, to
cope with climate change by building the knowledge base on climate change and agro-
biodiversity. The Project had a strong focus on gender, and on promoting the role of female
farmers, especially in traditional knowledge. The changing climatic conditions were seen
as an opportunity to empower women farmers, making them important players in the
preservation of indigenous agro-biodiversity and valuing them as recipients of critical
knowledge that were to reduce their level of poverty and better manage natural resources.
The key direct beneficiaries were the selected 8-10 village communities where the coping
strategies were to be piloted.

9.     In terms of institutional beneficiaries, at the national level, the Project initiated
improvements in collection, recording, and analysis of climate data and development of
national/regional climate models. Consequently, the Project supported various national
agencies such as the Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority (CAMA), the National
Water Resources Authority (NWRA), and the Agriculture and Extension Authority
(AREA), and it created a coordination and cooperation mechanism among such entities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.     The Project had four components. Component 1, Agro-biodiversity and Local
Knowledge Utilization and Assessment, was to build on the traditional knowledge of
farmers, develop an inventory of local agro-biodiversity, and identify and test selected
landraces for climate resilience. Information on the agro-biodiversity resources was used
to develop natural resource management and alternative income-generation plans with the
communities as part of a ‘no regrets’ approach to building climate resilience in the
highlands. Component 2, Climate Modeling and Capacity Building, focussed on raising
awareness on climatic changes and developing initial local predictive capacity of weather
patterns and long-term climate change scenarios for the country. Component 3, Integrating
Climate Change into Rainfed Agriculture, focussed on integrating climate resilience into
rainfed agriculture. At the national level this was done through capacity development of
the MAI and development of a climte-resilient rainfed strategy and at the local level
through the development and piloting of a menu of coping strategies in partnership with
the communities. The activities of Component 3 were: (a) awareness generation; (b)
piloting coping strategies (network strengthening, planning, capacity for accessing grants
for micro-enterprises, coping strategies – infrastructure, and coping strategies – income
generation/diversification); and (c) Climate-resilient Strategy for Rainfed Agriculture.
Component 4, Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation, focussed
on project management, coordination, and M&E.

1.6 Revised Components

11.     The components under the GEF-funded ACAP were not revised. The JSDF Grant
built upon Components 3 and 4 of the GEF Grant and deepened their respective activities
by providing additional funding at the local and central levels.



                                             3
12.     The components of the JSDF grant were the following: JSDF Component 1 -
Community Natural Resource Management Planning, was to develop community natural
resource management plans for the preservation of local agro-biodiversity. This was linked
with Component 3(b) (see description of the Component 3 of the GEF grant mentioned
above). JSDF Component 2 - Establishment of Small Income Generation Projects, was to
develop and carry out small income generation projects in selected communities, and
particularly among women, for agro-biodiversity conservation and adaptation. This was
linked with Component 3(b). JSDF Component 3 - Small-Scale Upgrading and Capacity
Building, was to develop and carry out small-scale upgrading of infrastructure in selected
communities for agro-biodiversity conservation and adaptation. This was linked with
Component 3(b). JSDF Component 4 - Community Awareness Raising Program, that was
to carry out a community awareness program related to agro-biodiversity conservation and
adaptation in rainfed areas. This was linked with Component 3(a). Lastly, JSDF
Component 5 - Project Management, was to support project implementation management
and administration, including monitoring and evaluation and audits of the above activities
under the JSDF Grant. This was linked to the original Component 4 of the GEF Grant for

13.    The Project was restructured twice. The first restructuring (on June 27, 2013)
focused more on changes in the implementing agency, the financing plan, and the date of
the Mid-Term Review (MTR). Following the closing of the GSCP and its Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) on June 30, 2012, the implementation responsibility for ACAP
was transferred to the RALP’s Project Support Unit (PSU), which was also under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI). At the same time, the date of the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) of the Project was rescheduled from August 31, 2012 to March 31, 2014.
The second restructuring on July 30 2014 extended the closing date by about six months
from August 31, 2014 to March 5, 2015 to account for start-up delays associated with the
socio-political events of late 2010 and 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

14.    Incorporation of Lessons Learned. The project design drew on lessons from
ongoing and completed projects, including the GSCP, RALP, and the Seeds and
Agriculture Services Project. Some early lessons from analytical work on how to deal with
climate change, in terms of information, knowledge, and approaches, had also shaped the
design of the Project. The focus was rightly on rainfed agriculture because, in spite of the
potential for development, traditional rainfed and livestock production systems had been
neglected over the years. Hence RALP was developed to redress this shortcoming.

15.     Project Preparation. Within rainfed agriculture, ACAP correctly addressed the
crucial design issue of the choice of project sites. Yemen has a complex situation as the
country lies in the latitudinal band where global circulation models differ in projected


                                             4
precipitation trends. There was no consensus among the 21 global climate models in the
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report about the sign of the projected changes in winter, summer,
or annual rainfall or its distribution pattern over Yemen. This made the situation with
respect to rainfed agriculture particularly difficult as crop choice, cropping pattern, and
crop management are all rainfall-dependent.

16.    Site selection was undertaken through purposively selected biophysical agro-
ecological gradients to improve sample representativeness. Site selection was done to:
       (a)   include project sites located along a mesoscale geographic gradient;
       (b)   cover some of the most important areas of rainfed highlands;
       (c)   cover a range of altitudes within the highlands;
       (d)   cover a range of mean annual precipitation;
       (e)   cover a range of agro-ecological gradients; and
       (f)   overlap with the governorates of ongoing complementary projects to allow for
             scale-up.

17.     Another key design issue involved development of the institutions. At the national
level, the Government of Yemen recognized the climate risks, and demonstrated strong
commitment to addressing those through a number of initiatives that were expected to build
overall capacity of relevant institutions indicated above. At the community level, the
Project rightly built on the expertise of the GSCP/RALP relating to the participatory
approach for mobilizing and sensitizing the communities, and establishing and
strengthening of traditional farmer networks, including women’s networks. With the help
of sociologists, the Bank’s previous interventions had assisted with Water Users
Association (WUA) formation, capacity building, and implementation support for
sustainable WUAs. The ACAP was to use this extensive network of WUAs in working
with communities for piloting coping strategies in local landscape units. Bringing in the
JSDF-financed activities to strengthen specific areas, such as community resource
management planning or community awareness raising, was also quite astute even though
it increased the work of coordinating the various activities at the local level.

18.     Risk Assessment. Risks Assessment in the PAD was extensive but the PAD also
seemed to have indicated that, after the mitigating measures were in place, none of the
residual risk would be substantial. While the rapid deterioration in the security environment
was totally unanticipated at appraisal, it was still optimistic to conclude that all residual
risks, particularly those related to sectoral institutions, would be addressed quickly and the
risk would be reduced from substantial to moderate. Mainstreaming of climate change-
related policies and related institutional changes, even under favorable country
circumstances, are challenging. A more realistic risk assessment would have flagged the
weakness of coordination of various agencies at the national level and indicated that
substantial risks would remain in many categories even after attempts to mitigate them.
This shortcoming in coordination arrangements as well as new (climate-related) activities
at the local level led to moderately satisfactory Quality at Entry, instead of it being fully
satisfactory, even though the project was piggy-backing on two Bank interventions with
MAI.



                                              5
2.2 Implementation

19.     The ACAP became effective in late August 2010, within about two months of
Board approval, and was launched in September 2010. However, following the so-called
Arab Spring uprising throughout the Arab world, Yemen underwent a severe political
upheaval throughout 2011. Amid security concerns, the Bank suspended missions to the
country in March 2011, and then also suspended disbursements for the entire portfolio from
July 2011 to January 2012. This virtually brought the procurement and payment activities
to a standstill, and hampered implementation progress. Project ratings were downgraded
accordingly across the board. Notwithstanding, MAI continued to make progress towards
achievement of the PDO. This was confirmed in June 2012 when ratings were upgraded to
reflect continued implementation progress with key project activities.

20.      The high level of national ownership and commitment to the Project, and its steady
implementation progress in spite of very difficult country conditions, were the most
important factors that contributed toward a successful implementation after the hiatus in
2011-12. Since the lifting of the suspension of disbursements in Yemen, various
mechanisms for project implementation, which included coordination among entities at the
national level, contracting of various vendors, as well as organization at the community
level, progressed well. By the MTR in March 2014, although disbursements and progress
on deliverables were still lagging, most of project activities were being carried out as
planned. Subsequently, implementation progress picked up even further and most project
activities were completed by the closing date of March 5, 2015. At closing, about 96.6
percent of the GEF grant and 61.6 percent of the JSDF grant (82.2 percent combined; 84
percent total project funds) were utilized.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

21.     M&E Design. A monitoring system was put in place to track: (a) progress in
achieving scheduled activities and outputs; (b) expenditures against budget allocations; (c)
project impact on key outcomes and indicators of achievement; and (d) implementation of
the environmental and social management plan (ESMP). Given the pilot nature of this
Project, a baseline survey possibly would have shown “zero readings” for most activities
and was not carried out. Also, because of the pilot nature of the Project, simple indicators
sufficed. For example, the PDO of “enhancing capacity and awareness at key national
agencies responding to climate variability and change” required the relevant agencies to
have MOUs on sharing and harmonizing climate data, creating databases, and having
training, followed by having a strategy “adopted and implemented”. Follow-up Bank
interventions were expected to articulate further the details of strategy implementation, but
a comprehensive vision of what it meant to have the strategy implemented was unavailable
at appraisal of this Project. For the other PDO of “better equipping local communities to
cope with climate change through the conservation and use of agro-biodiversity”, may be
because the Project followed other interventions such as the RALP, the M&E design was
articulated in more detail. Even then, the pilot nature of the intervention created some
ambiguity. For example, “coping” implied just having many viable options, which the
Project was developing for the communities and individuals and, later in the JSDF,



                                             6
community plans developed. Lastly, in spite of an attempt to indicate the option value of
the interventions, the M&E system was not designed to track project benefits quantitatively.

22.    M&E Implementation. Implementation units (PCU/PSU) had been established with
adequate staffing, training and supervision under GSCP and RALP. The PCU/PSU
maintained data for this Project separately. This was particularly important for RALP
because there were some overlapping activities. The separation within the PCU/PSU
permitted Bank supervision missions to report M&E data accurately.

23.     M&E Utilization. M&E information was oriented more towards monitoring of
progress by components. The Project did make reallocations based on what was
progressing well (or based on what could be implemented well given the circumstances).
The M&E system did not permit cost-benefit analyses. Neither did it permit replicating
the calculation of project efficiency utilizing the options methodology in the PAD.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

A.     Safeguards Compliance
24.     Environmental Safeguards: The ACAP was classified as environmental category B
mainly due to the small-scale infrastructure-related activities, and was designed to ensure
compliance with the requirements of the following safeguard polices that had been
triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Pest Management (OP 4.09). An
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was undertaken which underscored
the largely positive environmental and social impacts expected to be generated through
ACAP. The ESIA was accompanied by an Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP) and a brief Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPM).

25.    Compliance with Environmental Safeguards: As indicated in the section above on
M&E, environmental monitoring followed the regular monitoring events established for
the Project and inclusion of updates in progress reports. In addition, a national
environmental consultant was hired in September 2014 to assess the environmental and
social impact of the Project, which also confirmed compliance with environmental
safeguards.

26.     Social Safeguards: Land for the construction of water tanks and other small
infrastructure was obtained through voluntary donations from the local communities (and
documented); thus, the Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) safeguard policy was not
triggered by the Project. Processes and procedures for voluntary land donation was
included in the Project Operational Manual.

27.     Third Party Monitoring (TPM). As a result of the socio-political and security
situation, Bank missions and site visits were suspended. However, to verify
implementation of the ESMP, a TPM firm undertook supervision of project activities, and
the ensuing reports confirm satisfactory compliance. The Bank team stayed closely
involved with the TPM firm during its work.



                                             7
B.     Fiduciary Compliance

28.    Procurement Management Arrangements: Because of the MAI experience with
Bank-financed operations, capacity for managing and implementing procurement-related
processes was adequate, and procurement activities were implemented efficiently and
transparently. A procurement post-review, based on a desk review, noted that procurement
had been handled well, and most payment reviews of project transactions noted that funds
were claimed for eligible expenditures, properly recorded and reported, and that all related
supporting documents were in order and filed accordingly. The performance of the
PCU/PSU procurement staff throughout the Project was generally fair. Ratings were
lowered once, largely because of the disbursement suspension by the World Bank (from
July 2011 to January 2012).

29.     Financial Management (FM) Arrangements: The Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation (MAI), through the PCU/PSU implemented all components, including those for
JSDF financed activities. The PCU/PSU maintained acceptable FM arrangements in place
(qualified staffing; automated accounting system, acceptable FM manual, monthly
reconciliation, and timely reporting). The PCU/PSU maintained a segregated Designated
Account for each Grant at the Central Bank of Yemen and used the traditional SOEs as the
main disbursement method beside the Direct Payments and Special Commitments. All
audit reports (by the external auditors) were submitted to the Bank with unqualified (clean)
opinions and found acceptable. Due to the security situation in the country, the final audit
report has been overdue since 30-Jun-2015 and is expected by 30-Sep-2015.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

30.      There is considerable uncertainty for the post-completion phase because of the
renewed and persisting political unrest since September 2014. This is likely to substantially
hamper climate-related database management and information dissemination as well as
activities within MAI. However, most of the project activities at the community level
(either under this Project or those financed similarly under RALP) were focused on the
farmer groups which assumed control of the assets/activities. For example, in each
governorate, one seed growers association, or a network of seed growers groups, is
distributing seed produced by seed grower groups. They are expected to continue with their
activities even with a non-functioning national government. ACAP is also expected to
influence the design of forthcoming operations in the sector, such as that of the Climate
Resilience of Rural Community (CRTC) Project. Forthcoming sectoral operations are
expected to utilize participatory beneficiary involvement similar to that in ACAP, where
beneficiaries were involved in planning/design of activities as well as in implementation.
Similarly, these operations are expected to extensively rely upon field-level coordination
among various agencies (and the private sector/universities where feasible because of
ACAP’s very positive experience with such coordination). In addition, operational
arrangements in forthcoming projects are expected to utilize field units of MAI and benefit
from local government participation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High
31.      The FY13 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) covering FY13-14 had as one of its strategic
pillars, Achieving Quick Wins and Protecting the Poor. Within this strategic pillar, the
revised CAS objective was to Increase Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate Change.
The PPCR program, and this Project within the PPCR program, was a key to that CAS
Objective, thereby making the project objective highly relevant. The relevance of the
project objective could also be derived directly from the country conditions. As mentioned
in the country context above, the increased variability in precipitation (due to climate
change) raises the risk of crop failure and loss of livelihoods in a region where the level of
poverty is already high and water is already a scarce resource. The rating is also based on
the relevance of project design, which in turn reflects the relevance of project
components/activities and policy areas, as well as the quality of the results framework. In
terms of components, the project design relevance is rated high, as the project increases
options for affected communities and individuals within them. These options are expected
to strengthen their capacity to cope with climate change. In addition, the Project helped the
country to develop climate change-related policies by improving strategies at relevant
agencies. The quality of the results framework, including that for the JSDF activities, is
similarly good: The statements of objectives were clear for such a pilot project and were
linked to intermediate and final outcomes. The causal chain between funding and outcomes
was clear (provided the activities, such as training, met quality standards). There are,
however, many exogenous factors in this very fragile state which could derail the Project’s
efforts to build capacity at the relevant agencies. Some of these factors were identified at
the design stage.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial
32.     The PDOs were: (a) to enhance capacity and awareness at key national agencies
and at local levels, to respond to climate variability and change; and (b) to better equip
local communities to cope with climate change through the conservation and use of agro-
biodiversity. The ACAP “mostly achieved” PDO (a) and “achieved” PDO (b) as
substantiated by the indicators meeting or mostly meeting the targets. The list of indicators
can be found in the Data Sheet at the beginning of this report, but it is made available below
to present the requisite evidence here.

33.      The key indicator for PDO (a) was Indicator 2: Strategy for climate-resilient
agriculture for rainfed highlands adopted and applied by key national agencies. Towards
this objective, ACAP carried out: (i) data collection through surveys, collation,
collaboration with other agencies, etc., to create a database for climate projections; (ii)
facility analysis to identify and strengthen select weather stations; (iii) institutional capacity
analysis to determine staff training in technical aspects of climate modeling; (d) special
survey and modeling in select areas on impacts of rainfall variability and its feedback into



                                                9
the determination of a Climate Resilient Agricultural Strategy for highland areas in Yemen;
and (e) wide stakeholder consultations to validate and refine the Strategy.

34.      After refinement, the Strategy for Climate Resilient Agriculture for rainfed
highlands was prepared and finalized in consultation with key institutional stakeholders.
This led to signing of an MOU (with MAI, CAMA, EPA, and NWRA as signatories). This
MOU is expected to have sharing and harmonization of climate data strengthened and
institutionalized in relevant climate-related agencies. The related agencies are already
functioning with staff trained under the Project, with the number of trained technical
specialists in climate-related agencies to undertake climate modeling exceeding the target
by 88 percent and with data sets developed and training on climate change forecasting fully
completed. However, the final stage of formal adoption of the Strategy has yet to be
completed because of political crisis and ongoing war. Hence, the rating is “mostly
achieved”.

35.     The key indicators for PDO (b) were Indicators 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (GEF-financed)
and 7, 8, and 9 (JSDF-financed). Towards PDO (b) the ACAP: (a) carried out an inventory
of the landraces; (b) had 46 races tested for climate resilience (target of 5); (c) had races
that exhibited stability and climate resilience under different environmental zones
submitted to the General Seed Multiplication Corporation for multiplication and
dissemination; and (d) identified and disseminated coping options for income generating
micro-enterprises based on the preferences of the farming communities which had agro-
biodiversity conservation as its basis.

36.     In addition, towards PDO (b), the ACAP also generated awareness of conservation
(agro-biodiversity and natural resources, including water) and coping mechanisms to
address climate change at the community level in eight targeted districts. It worked with
10 pilot villages under GEF and, beyond the pilot villages, under JSDF. It led to the
preparation of community natural resources conservation plans with various water users
group under the JSDF as well as implementation of coping strategies based on
infrastructure and engineering interventions (GEF and JSDF), and income-generating
coping interventions (GEF and JSDF). For details on this extensive work completed under
the project, please refer to Annex 2 Component 3 items (d) and (e). Lastly, to facilitate
replication after project closing, the Project documented the modalities and approaches,
and the lessons learned. Although ACAP could have implemented even more infrastructure
and engineering interventions, because the JSDF was utilized only about 62 percent of what
was estimated during the grant preparation, the results demonstrate that the constraint was
not availability of financial resources but implementation capacity at the local level.

37.     PDO (b) was achieved, based on the project exceeding the targets of all its
indicators except that for Indicator 1, and partly achieving the target for Indicator 1. For
Indicator 1, while the lessons were learned, captured, and mostly disseminated to the
targeted farming communities, the scaling up was delayed due to the political crisis. But
balancing this shortfall, the Project:




                                             10
   a) Achieved 111% of target in terms of beneficiaries that included beneficiaries
      involved in upgrading of terraces, construction of water storage tanks, flood
      protection works, soil conservation, and small income generation projects. The
      project also achieved 105% of its target of female beneficiaries (Indicators 3 and
      4);
   b) Achieved 146% of target for client days of training provided within the
      communities and 148% of target for client days of training to women within the
      above outcome (Indicators 5 and 6);
   c) Achieved 125% of target for pilot communities that developed plans for natural
      resource management focusing on conservation and adaptation planning based on
      agro-biodiversity resources (Indicator 7);
   d) Achieved 125% of target for beneficiaries, especially female, that were trained on
      water conservation, nutrition, natural resource conservation, etc., beyond the 10-12
      pilot villages (Indicator 8); and
   e) Vastly exceeded the target (achieved 250% of target) for the number of community
      pilots using local knowledge & agro-biodiversity resources that were designed and
      developed (Indicator 9).

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
38.     At appraisal, financial and economic analysis had been carried out based on the real
option methodology that was designed as a pilot application with the hope that this
approach could later generate guidelines for the economic analysis of the other adaptation
projects. Given the lack of data and the impossibility to conduct field work due to the
security situation, the analysis conducted at project completion does not attempt to
reconstruct analysis conducted at appraisal. Instead, the analysis of efficiency is based on
cost-effectiveness both at the project level as well as at the level of components. In Annex
3, the cost-effectiveness analysis is supplemented by an assessment of the relevance of the
assumptions made at appraisal based on key M&E data and documents provided. In
particular, the analysis looks at the benefits appearing from the components 1, 2, and 3 and
provides a detailed review of the potential economic return of the technologies introduced
by the project.

39.      The project focused on the operations in four governorates: (i) Al-Mahweet, (ii)
Ibb, (iii) Taiz, and (iv) Sana’a. Within these four governorates, ACAP targeted 14,000
households. With an estimated average size of 6.5 people per household, the total number
of beneficiaries targeted amount to 91,000 people. To evaluate the economic efficiency,
the cost-effectiveness of ACAP was compared to that of the IFAD-financed Murat River
Watershed Rehabilitation Project (MRWRP), which had similar objectives and targeted
about 80,000 beneficiaries. The cost per beneficiary of ACAP of US$ 55.8 compares
favourably with that of MRWRP’s US$ 481.4, leading to the above rating of efficiency.
The efficiency rating is also substantiated by the component-by-component efficiency
analysis shown below.

40.   Component 1: Agro-biodiversity and Local Knowledge Utilization and
Assessment. Under various scenarios of a changing climate, reducing the sensitivity of


                                            11
systems to shocks such as floods or droughts, through use of climate-resistant crop
varieties, will reduce risks effectively 1 . This is particularly important in drought-prone
areas where irrigation is not available. The traditional open pollinated cultivars could
expect a yield of about 900 kg/ha, compared to about 300 kg/ha for the hybrid cultivars
that were used before ACAP. The difference represents about 600 kg of losses avoided per
hectare, or a value of about US$ 115.8/ha and per year (see Annex 3). The component cost
was US$ 390,000, implying that if just 3,368 ha benefited from the use of climate-resistant
crop varieties, ACAP’s Component 1 would be cost-effective in one year.

41.     Component 2: Climate Modeling and Capacity Building. For Yemen, both
global and local climate change impacts matter, given the country’s high levels of food
import dependency, food insecurity, and poverty. Quantifying the impacts of natural
disasters is important to design appropriate mitigation strategies and, therefore, is one of
the main economic benefits of climate modeling. For example, Yemen faces a number of
natural hazards every year with floods constituting the most important and recurring form
of disaster in the country2. Over the last twenty years Yemen has suffered through 19 floods
and flash floods. The costs of flood damages collected over the past years vary from US$
1.5 million to US$ 1.2 billion. The Project’s climate modeling activities will facilitate
introduction of climate change mitigation strategies and, therefore, reduce the likelihood
of destructive flooding and landslides in the future. Consequently, the very high economic
and human costs of lives lost, losses to fix damaged infrastructure, agricultural losses, as
well as the cost and misery from relocation of the population are also expected to be
reduced. If ACAP is able to reduce the losses of one of the really large (over US$ 1 billion)
flood losses by only about 0.15 percent, its Component 2 cost of US$ 1.58 million would
be cost effective.

42.     Component 3: Integrating Climate Change into Rainfed Agriculture.
Incremental net benefits from this component were mainly generated by two types of
investments: (i) interventions to reduce and mitigate climate change damages at the
community level (terraces, water tanks, wadi banks, soil conservation) and (ii) small-scale,
income-generating activities. As shown in Annex 3, the benefit-cost ratio for the first type
of interventions ranged from 1.0 to 2.9 (average 1.75), signifying cost-effectiveness.
Among the second type of interventions, sheep/goat rearing was possibly the most
representative. They generated net benefits greater than the initial investment by year
three/four and were cost-effective as well.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

43.   The overall outcome rating for the Project is “Satisfactory” as it is rated “High” on
Relevance and “Substantial” on both Achievement of its Objectives, and Efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

44.    The Project was designed to have poverty reduction impacts, to address gender
aspects and social development, and it and was implemented accordingly.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

45.     In terms of institutional development, one of the main issues addressed under
ACAP was the capacity of climate change-related agencies of Yemen and improving their
coordination. The ACAP initiated various activities in this direction but, given their initial
weakness and the challenges they face, the institutional development has to be continued
through other initiatives for the foreseeable future. In parallel, ACAP was expected to
develop the institutions that would deliver the appropriate seeds and water-related
infrastructure to poor farmers in the rainfed areas which are also often quite remote.
However, much of the work involved the strengthening of communities with less reliance
on sole operational capacity of the Government entities involved. The ACAP, like RALP,
was able to develop both the demand and the supply side of this support and build the
framework to address climate change at the community level.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

46.     A Beneficiary Assessment Survey (BAS), planned to be undertaken at the end of the
Project, could not be completed due to the current security situation, although the BAS had
carried out some interviews and focus groups with beneficiaries. It could be completed by
MAI if the situation improved; a BAS with institutional stakeholders would then be
undertaken as well. The preliminary indication from the incomplete BAS was that the
beneficiaries’ assessments were in line with the findings of the BAS for similar activities
carried out under the RALP. Essentially, there are two observations from RALP that could
be reasonably applicable to ACAP: (a) a vast majority (close to eighty percent) of
interviewed beneficiaries rate as positive the benefit to their communities of investments
to improve the sustainable management of natural resources (watershed management,
terrace rehabilitation, etc.); and (b) almost everyone (about 94 percent) of beneficiaries
assessed the women’s participation as good or fair.




                                             13
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

47.      The current situation of air raids and civil war has resulted in a high risk to
development outcome. The Project’s sustainability utilizes both national institutions and
communities. The above risk would materialize mainly for activities under public sector
institutions. The institutional arrangements at the national level, including that at relevant
climate change-related institutions, such as CAMA, are highly vulnerable. On the other
hand, many working arrangements developed under the Project within a community
require very little continuing support from the state.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48.    The rating is based on the following strengths:
  a) The Bank identified that the increased variability in precipitation raised the risk of
     crop failure and loss of livelihoods in a region where the level of poverty was already
     high and water was already a scarce resource. Based on progress under other Bank
     interventions in the sector, the Bank identified ways on how a GEF project could
     support agro-biodiversity of the highlands and traditional knowledge of farmers,
     which had been the cornerstone of communities’ ability to adapt to changing climatic
     conditions in the past;
  b) Specifically, within the beneficiary group, the Project addressed gender and
     environmental aspects related to availability of water, and broken-down terraces and
     water harvesting infrastructures that had diminished water assets of the poor;
  c) The Bank appraised the strengths and weaknesses of relevant public entities, and
     developed a plan to improve their capabilities through coordination, development of
     databases, use of climate models, and training; which are balanced by
  d) Overambitious use of real options methodology for economic and financial analysis
     that was not documented well at appraisal and that was disconnected with the M&E
     system established under the Project.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

49.    The Bank was proactive in identifying small shortcomings in project design and
redressed them through JSDF-financed activities. In addition, the rating is based on the
adequacy of supervision inputs and processes, particularly after the 2011-12 hiatus. During




                                             14
that period, the supervision team regularly provided detailed Aide Memoires covering,
among other things, fiduciary aspects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.     Overall Bank performance is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory,” reflecting the
“Moderately Satisfactory” rating for Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and the
“Satisfactory” rating for quality of supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

51.      The rating is based on the following: Ownership that included providing
counterpart funding as planned and senior leaders availing themselves to Bank missions
without fail. GoY supported implementation arrangements, including appointment of key
staff, and initiated restructuring requests.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies’ Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

52.     The rating is based on the following: MAI implemented the Project, first using the
PCU of GSCP and then using the PSU of RALP. Both were quite committed to achieving
the project development objective. Fiduciary performance (FM, and procurement) was
adequate at MAI throughout the implementation period. The above rating possibly does
not do adequate justice to reflect counterpart support from the PSU, particularly during the
current stage of the security situation when many buildings, including part of the building
where the Bank had its office, were damaged from air attacks. It is true that implementation
lagged planned levels throughout the implementation period, but by having a solid
mechanism in place, the implementation agency could improve matters in the last year and
bring the Project to a successful close.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

53.     Overall Borrower performance is rated as “Satisfactory,” reflecting the
“Satisfactory” rating for both the Government and the Implementing Agency performance.

6. Lessons Learned

54.     To improve relevance of a project, utilize participatory beneficiary
involvement in planning/design of activities. Beneficiary participation made the Project
more relevant to the needs of a specific community, even when similar activities were
carried out in different locations. This was the case with coping strategies where, because
of community participation, there was often an increased demand for smaller water tanks.
It also led to easier transition to participatory beneficiary involvement during
implementation. With beneficiary involvement during implementation, temporary jobs
were created and targeting improved because the unemployed/under-employed were more
available to participate.

55.     To improve coordination among various agencies, invest in field-level
coordination. At the field level, ACAP (and RALP) experienced considerable success in
coordinating the work of various agencies. This might have been due to outside-the-office
connections among this educated group of people even when coordination at the
headquarters level was insufficient. Lack of resources in the field units of various ministries
might also have played a role in bringing them together when financing from the Project
became available.

56.      When one must have inter-agency coordination at the national level, develop
iteratively with communication and coordinated action supported through Bank
resources. In ACAP it was a considerable challenge to overcome the bureaucratic tension
on the topic of climate change between the climate-focused agency CAMA, the water-
focused agency NWRA, and the rainfed farmer-focused agency MAI/PSU. The
coordination challenge could also not entirely be finessed away by developing most of the
coordination at the field-level, because of the centrality of developing national policies and
priorities (see next lesson below). The goal is to ultimately have integrated action from the
various agencies, but it can come only in stages.

57.     Even when the goal is to deliver climate change-related global benefits, one
must build national policies and priorities, because global benefits will be achieved
and sustained only if they are consistent with national policies and priorities. In
addition, project activities at the local level can be sustained only if they fit national policies
and priorities. The centrality of developing national policies and priorities cannot be
overstated. Specifically, ACAP’s approach to development of national policies relied upon
climate modeling and database-related training, among other things. In addition, much of
the priority setting at the national level required focusing on rainfed agriculture, which had
been achieved through RALP and which preceded this Project.

58.     For community-based biodiversity/climate change projects to succeed, one
must build over a period of time partnerships and understanding among project
implementers and communities. The understanding was achieved under two Bank
projects, GSCP and RALP, which preceded ACAP. Although the reduction in overhead
cost from piggy-backing PCU/PSU of Bank projects is often acknowledged, this benefit to
GEF projects, from past Bank interventions in building partnerships, is not well understood.

Annex 2: Outputs by Component

Component 1: Agro-biodiversity and Local Knowledge Utilization and Assessment

a) The Project took stock of existing inventories of the landraces, and added new
   landraces collected from targeted project areas. A total of 1603 crop landraces and 9
   landraces of famous fruit trees were collected and kept in the Gene Bank at AREA.
b) From landraces collected, 46 landraces were selected and tested for climate resilience
   profiles at three sites in each district.
c) To carry out the selection and testing, the Project utilized AREA a laboratory that had
   been financed under the Project with all the requisite equipment and chemicals. The
   laboratory enabled AREA to conduct molecular analysis for the first time.
d) The landraces that had stability and climate resilience under different environmental
   zones were then submitted to the General Seed Multiplication Corporation for
   multiplication and dissemination.
e) The Project also identified options for micro-enterprises based on the utilization of
   agro-biodiversity. It carried out a survey among the farming communities to determine
   their preference to the type of income generation projects. The communities'
   preference for collection and packaging of medicinal plants as well as food processing
   was, however, very low because of other alternatives such as raising sheep and
   beekeeping.
f) Under this Component, three training programs were implemented on raising
   awareness of selected landraces among the farming communities, strengthening of
   community organizations, preparation of community plans, etc. The Project also
   helped AREA to disseminate the results of its research work to various stakeholders.

Component 2: Climate Modeling and Capacity Building
a) Under this Component, the Project carried out a meteorological data survey and
   collected historic climate data. The activity involved survey, collection, entry, and
   scanning of the available printed data at various stakeholders within ACAP
   intervention provinces. The printed data was transferred to digital data and entered in
   a database.
b) The above metadata survey identified gaps for ACAP's intervention in the targeted
   provinces, and selected weather monitoring stations were upgraded.
c) A study for small-scale rainfall variability including the rainfall index and rainfall
   variability over some locations (rainfed mountain areas) was carried out.
d) With the support of various stakeholders on this topic (CAMA, MAI/AREA, EPA, and
   NWRA), the Project developed a sustainable climate information system (CIS) with
   harmonized standard information and requisite organizational arrangements associated
   with climate data collection. The CIS is equipped with required equipment and tools.
   The stakeholders can access the CIS via the web.
e) The Project made an assessment of institutional capacity of CAMA, NWRA, MAI, and
   EPA and their requirements for weather stations. It also prepared a plan to establish
   new meteorological climate and agricultural measurements stations and sites. Based
   on the above, eight automatic weather stations (with software and communication


                                           19
   units) were installed at the following selected sites: (a) Sana'a Governorate (Bani
   Behlol), (Bani Mattar), (b) Taiz Governorate, (Almoasat), (Saber), (c) Ibb Governorate,
   (Al-Sadah-Badan), and (d) Almahweet Governorate, (Almahweet town-Alrogm).
f) Local data sets were developed and local capacity to predict regional climate change
   based on global circulation model output was improved. CAMA assumed the charge
   to manage the eight data sets developed under the Project. Fifteen technical specialists
   from CAMA (9), MAI/AREA (2), EPA (2), and NWRA (2) were trained on climate
   modeling and prediction of climate change.
g) The plan for long-term training for M.Sc. degree was replaced by various more cost-
   effective capacity building training. These included: (a) 10-day training on collection
   of data for 20 participants; (b) 10-day training on exchange of data between relevant
   institutions for 20 participants; and (c) 12-day training on climate modeling for 14
   participants.

Component 3: Integrating Climate Change into Rainfed Agriculture

a) The Project made a detailed assessment of the vulnerability of rainfed agriculture to
   climate change, followed by consultations with stakeholders to develop a climate
   resilient rainfed agriculture strategy. Staff in MAI and associated institutions provided
   specialized training in climate awareness and in developing a coherent response
   strategy.
b) The Project implemented the project awareness program for three days in each of the
   eight targeted districts. 921 community participants -- 520 men and 401 women -- from
   the eight targeted districts attended. The training was on the importance, utilization,
   and the role of farmers’ communities in agro-biodiversity conservation and coping
   mechanisms to address climate change. With additional funds obtained under JSDF
   Component 4, the Project sought to support an education and awareness-raising
   program targeting the rainfed areas beyond the 8-10 pilot villages by using community
   facilitation teams and technical experts. These facilitation teams were established in
   each of the eight targeted districts.
c) The coping mechanisms included small-scale infrastructure and income generation
   activities that use local agro-biodiversity, which not only help in sustainable
   management of natural resources, but also help in the diversification of income sources
   for the communities.
d) The small-scale infrastructure included upgrading of terraces, construction of efficient
   small water storage, soil conservation, and small flood protection structures. Against a
   target of 20 coping mechanisms, the Project completed and tested 122 small-scale
   infrastructure items (43 terraces, 52 water tanks, 13 soil conservation and 14 wadi
   banks). Specific training was also provided to community associations on
   organizational aspects and the role of the associations in the community to maintain
   project interventions. With additional funds obtained under JSDF Component 3, 91
   small-scale infrastructure upgrading projects were undertaken, which were tied to
   conservation of water, soil, terraces, crops, and seeds and which sought to maximize
   the use of local knowledge and adaptation practices.
e) Income generation activities initially included 20 projects distributed in the three
   districts (i.e. 5 community income-generation projects in each district). About 200
   families benefitted from these projects, 75% of whom were poor with a female head


                                            20
   of the household. This was due to the objective, transparent, and set criteria-based
   process followed by the committee for the distribution of income generation projects.
   With additional funds obtained under JSDF Component 2, an additional 54 income
   generation projects were made operational, dominated by beekeeping and animal
   raising – activities that created most demand among the farmers. In addition, under
   JSDF Component 4, the “first phase” of a new community awareness program
   (involving facilitation teams) trained 70 beneficiaries on income generation activities
   in Al Mahweet and AL Rujum districts.
f) The Project trained the communities on how to prepare their community plans and
   implement them. 734 of the community leaders -- 368 men and 366 women -- attended
   this training. At the national level, the Project provided training to senior officials from
   MAI, NWRA, CAMA, AREA, and EPA on climate change and consequences for
   unsustainable natural resource use. In addition, in various stakeholder agencies,
   specific training was provided, such as field inventory training at AREA and climate
   change impact on rainfed agriculture at MAI.
g) With JSDF Component 1 financing, the Project provided four two-day training
   workshops for the Water Users Groups (WUGs) and the Associations in all the targeted
   districts on how to formulate their own community plans, supporting natural resources
   conservation and with emphasis on agro-biodiversity. 480 participants from the WUGs
   participated in these workshops and 10 WUGs developed their plans.
h) The Project constructed community infrastructure (community seed stores and
   community centers) in two governorates out of four, because the seed stores and the
   associated building constructed by the SFD under RALP in Al Mahweet and Sana'a
   governorates were considered to be adequate with no need to construct additional seed
   stores under ACAP. The Project also established two model farms at two locations.
   The model farms were cultivated with fruit trees: almonds at Bani Matter in the Al
   Mahweet governorate and coffee at Bani Hamad in the Ibb governorate.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

                                     I. Introduction

1.      This Annex presents the financial and economic analysis of the Agro-biodiversity
and Climate Change Adaptation Project (ACAP) at its completion stage. The financial
analysis aims to demonstrate that income-generating activities on-farm as proposed by the
Project, have been profitable and are therefore sustainable. The economic analysis aims at
demonstrating that, from an economic perspective, the project as a whole is viable, taking
into account, as much as possible, all quantifiable additional costs and benefits with and
without project.

2.      At appraisal, financial and economic analysis was carried out based on the real
option methodology that was designed as a pilot application with the hope that this
approach could later generate guidelines for the economic analysis of the other adaptation
projects. Given the lack of data and the impossibility to conduct field work due to security
reasons, the analysis conducted at project completion does not attempt to reconstruct the
analysis carried out at appraisal, but will assess the relevance of the assumptions made at
appraisal based on key M&E data and documents provided. In particular, the analysis will
look at the benefits resulting from components 1, 2 and 3 and will provide a detailed review
of the potential economic returns of the technologies introduced by the Project.

                         II. Data sources and general assumptions

3.     Sources. The data used in this analysis have been collected from the Social Fund
for Development (SFD), World Bank’s supervision reports, and the PSU of the Agro-
biodiversity and Climate Change Adaptation Project.

4.     Currency and exchange rate. The Central Bank kept the official rate of the
Yemeni riyal (YER) at the official rate of YR 215 = USD 1.00, despite the unrest that began
in 2011. The same exchange rate has been used throughout the present analysis.

5.     Prices. Input and output prices were collected in January 2015 and expressed in
constant terms. These prices were updated using World Food Programme (WFP) Market
Surveillance lists from June 2015.

6.      For non-traded items, the entire production, at least in the areas of project
intervention, is destined for local markets; hence the market price is a fair measure of the
willingness to pay and is the best estimate of the opportunity cost. Therefore financial
prices are found to be reliable approximations of their economic value for most of the items
used in the analysis. A distortion was perceived in the market prices with respect to border
prices for sorghum grain, honey, and coffee; their economic values were calculated on an
import (for sorghum) and export (for honey and coffee) parity basis. Shadow prices for




                                            22
rural labor were estimated at 70% of the prevailing market wage rate, while for skilled
labor, the market rate was assumed to reflect its opportunity cost.3

                                          III. Financial Analysis

7.      Financial benefits analyzed are coming from components 1 and 3. Financial
evaluation was chosen randomly from the most representative type of small producers. The
evaluation was to provide some idea of the projects’ financial benefits. The sample is not
representative of the projects’ universe, but the analysis gives a sense of the possible
economic and financial benefits. While it is difficult to draw general conclusions from this
study, it shows, however, that, with the proper design and management, most of the
reviewed projects are sustainable and financially viable.

8.     Component 3: Integrating Climate Change into Rainfed Agriculture.
Incremental net benefits from this Component were mainly generated by two types of
investments: (i) interventions to reduce and mitigate climate change damages at the
community level (terraces, water tanks, wadi banks, soil conservation), and (ii) small-scale
income-generating activities. The technical data is based on the feasibility study4 by SFD,
project supervision reports, and ACAP M&E information. The financial evaluation
conducted by the study focused on the most representative types of projects promoted by
ACAP. The evaluation provides some idea of the projects’ financial benefits and gives a
sense of the projects’ possible economic benefits.

(i) Interventions to reduce and mitigate climate change damages at the community
level:
9.      A) Terraces and soil conservation measures. Large areas within the project area
were severely degraded and most of terraced land has been abandoned5. Most of farmers
don’t have any open grazing land, so they graze the animals on the abandoned and
unmaintained terraces. This uncontrolled grazing is unsustainable and is aggravating the
vegetative cover of the slopes and increases erosion. The project facilitated transition to a
more sustainable use of slopes, thereby securing long-term productivity of those areas and
raising incomes for local people.

10.     Terraces. Data has been collected in 17 locations targeting 81 beneficiaries and
covering 35.41 ha, distributed in three governorates (Al-Mahweet/Al-Rogom district (Ozlt
Rohan and Ozlt Al-Bddee), Sana'a/Blad Arross district (Ozlat Aroba Asharqe) and Hajja
(Watershed Bane Massan). The total capital cost for 35.41 ha (including cost of digging,
stones, workmanship) was estimated at about USD 290,385 (USD 8,201 per ha). Recurrent
costs were estimated at about 26,238 USD/year (including production costs and annual
maintenance cost of terraces). The annual production of sorghum on the total surface of

terraces rehabilitated has increased from 23.7 tons (about 670 kg/ha) in the first year to
39.7 tons (1,120 kg/ha) in the fourth year, which represents about a 65% increase. The
Project presents a Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 30%, an NPV of USD
191,946, a benefit-cost ratio of 1.5, and a payback period of about 4 years, which shows to
be an attractive investment, given the fact that before project unmaintained terraces
remained unused, therefore the financial benefit from the Project is all incremental, with a
rapid increase in crop yields (due to terracing).

11.    B) Soil conservation/regeneration measures. Maintenance of natural pastures.
Data has been collected from 11 locations within the project area where pastures
maintenance was carried on 5.325 ha. Total investment cost has been estimated at about
USD 20,970 and recurrent costs (annual maintenance of the pastures) at about USD 230.

12.     With the project annual production of grass increased from 6.9 tons in the first year
to 16.9 tons in the fifth year of the project (from 0.75l to 1.5l of milk per animal), allowing
grazing of 70 animals (goats and sheep) and an annual milk production of 19.9 liters. Given
the low recurrent cost level, together with an important increase in milk production, the
project shows to be financially attractive to farmers, presenting an FIRR of 48%, an NPV
of USD 38,910, a benefit-cost ratio of 2.9, and a payback period of about 3 years.

13.     C) Water tanks. The purpose of the Project was to provide water (through
rainwater harvesting) for human and animal consumption during the drought periods. In
total, 44 water tanks have been analysed. Project investment costs are about USD 308,430
for 8 drinking water tanks, and USD 902,786 for 36 animal watering tanks. These costs
include drilling, stones, transportation, and construction. Recurrent costs (annual
maintenance) were estimated at about USD 223 for drinking water tanks and at about 1,005
USD for animal watering tanks. The quantity of drinking water collected annually
represents 12,272 m3 which is equivalent to 91,702 USD saved by rural households that
otherwise would have had to by this water at market price (7.44 USD/m3). Furthermore,
79,128 m3 of water with a value of USD 552,056 (at 6.98 USD/m3) are collected annually
for animal watering. The human drinking water project presents a FIRR of 26%, an NPV
of USD 160,913, a benefit-cost ratio of 1.6, and a payback period of about 3 years, which
can be considered an attractive investment for rural households. Furthermore, it has to be
noted that maintenance costs are largely covered by the economies made from water
collection which contributes to the sustainability of the Project.

14.     D) Wadi banks. The purpose of the analysed project is to build protection walls
for the banks of the agricultural land and the entrances of irrigation canals in the valley.
The investment cost of the wadi bank protection has been estimated at USD 70,590. The
command area within the wadi is 35 ha. Sorghum has been used as a proxy for agricultural
production. Recurrent costs (including crop production costs and wadi banks and canals
annual maintenance) are estimated at USD 35,493. The main project benefits came from
the increased agriculture productivity with the yields that increased by 30% at the end of
the project, from 1.23 t/ha to 1.63 t/ha. The analysis didn’t take into account the sorghum
fodder production as it’s usually not commercialised. The project is financially viable with

an FIRR of 14%, an NPV of USD 3,801, a benefit-cost ratio of 1, and a payback period of
about 2 years.

(ii) Small-scale income-generating activities (IGAs)
15.     AREA, in consultation with local communities, carried out an assessment study of
agro-biodiversity-based micro enterprises. The study has resulted in the identification of
about 10 potential income-generating activities preferred by the beneficiaries such as sheep
fattening, beekeeping, nurseries establishment, almond trees planting, and waste recycling.
Collection and packaging of medicinal plants and food processing have also been
considered but the communities’ preference for these activities is very low since they are
not traditional ones and not known. Two IGAs will be presented in the analysis: (i) sheep
fattening, and (ii) beekeeping.

16.     Sheep fattening and goat rearing. The model illustrates the likely returns over
time to smallholders participating in this Project and adopting improved husbandry
practices (new stables, better hygiene, vaccination, and supplementary feed) as well as
having better access to irrigation infrastructure and animal watering. Sheep fattening can
potentially be pursued in most districts, and it is carried out under a stall-fed system, thus
avoiding possible negative environmental impacts. Good housing conditions are required
and new entrepreneurs are advised on appropriate housing to be constructed for sheep to
provide a healthy and hygienic environment, and the cost of housing is included in the total
investment costs. The existing animal husbandry practices limit the milk and meat yields,
keeping them below the potential. Low animal productivity and profitability in livestock
husbandry is due to inappropriate livestock feeding practices, limited availability of clean
drinking water, and poor housing and livestock husbandry practices. Investment costs
include 10 animals, housing, fencing and equipment (USD 2,595 for goat rearing and USD
2,410 for sheep fattening). Recurrent costs represent USD 1,821 and include food, hired
labour, and veterinary services. The cash flow remains negative during the first year of the
project due to the investment costs, then annual net benefits from the project increase from
USD 2,196 in PY2 to USD 4,219 at the end of the project.

17.     Beekeeping and honey production. Farmers engaged in subsistence production
on small areas, and given that they have on average only one cow and few small ruminants,
they need to diversify their sources of income. Given the difficult terrain (limited
agricultural land, terraces in Western mountainous districts, etc.) farmers need to grow high
value, low volume crops or initiate some off-farm IGAs. The Project provided interested
farmers with beehives, bees, necessary equipment, and training in order to start a
beekeeping activity. With the high premium price paid for local honey, beekeeping is an
attractive IGA. The beekeeping model illustrates the establishment of new bee hives.
Investment cost include bee hives and colony, queen screen as well as some basic
equipment (face nets, smoker, brush, and feeding equipment). Honey production increased
from the initial level of 5 kg per year to 10 kg in PY4, resulting in a short pay-back period
for the investment cost. The beekeeping project achieved positive net revenue increases
during the first year of the project from USD 172 to USD 3,026.

                                     IV. Economic Analysis

18.     Project beneficiaries. The Project focused its operations in four governorates: (i)
Al-Mahweet, (ii) Ibb, (iii) Taiz, and (iv) Sana’a. Within these four governorates, ACAP
and JSDF targeted 14,000 beneficiary households. With an estimated average size of 6.5
people per household, the total number of beneficiaries amount to 91,000 people.
Economic assessment of climate change adaptation investments is structured as follows:
(i) presentation of economic benefits for components 1 and 2, and (ii) cost effectiveness
analysis of the overall project.

19.     Component 1: Agro-biodiversity and local Knowledge Utilization and
Assessment. Under this sub-component an agro-biodiversity inventory has been prepared
and 46 landraces were selected and tested for climate-resilience in three sites in each district
of the project area. The landraces presenting stability and climate resilience under different
environmental conditions were submitted to the General Seed Multiplication Corporation
for further multiplication and dissemination through climate change-relevant projects.

20.     This activity is expected to generate substantial financial and economic benefits
over the long-term through strengthening resilience of the seed system to climate risks that
are often translated into poor crop yields and suboptimal performance of agricultural and
livestock enterprises. Furthermore, at farm level, climate risk resilience alters other risks
such as asset depletion (damage and loss to assets as a result of extreme climate events),
and therefore prevents major financial losses to the farmers. Reducing the sensitivity of
systems to shocks such as floods or droughts through use of climate-resistant varieties will
allow to effectively reduce risks and bridge the farm-level yield gaps.

21.     There is abundant scientific evidence showing that crop biodiversity has an
important role in adaptation to a changing environment, as increasing the biodiversity of
an agro-ecosystem can help maintain its long-term productivity and contribute significantly
to food security. Genetic or species diversity within a field provides a buffer against losses
caused by environmental change, pests, and diseases. Biodiversity (on a seed-to-farm
scale) provides the resilience needed for a reliable and stable long-term food production
(Diaz et al., 2006).

22.     Under present and future scenarios of a changing climate, farmers’ reliance on crop
diversity is particularly important in drought-prone areas where irrigation is not available.
Diversity allows the agro-ecosystem to remain productive over a wider range of conditions,
conferring potential resistance to drought (Naeem et al., 1994). In the dry-hot habitats of
the Middle East, some wild wheat cultivars have an extraordinary capacity to survive
drought and make efficient use of water, performing especially well under fluctuating
climates (Peleg et al., 2009). Researching the diversity and drought-coping traits of wild
cultivars provides scientists with new tools to breed crops better adapted to less rainfall. In
semi-arid Ethiopia, growing a mix of maize cultivars in the same field acts like an insurance
against dry years. Research shows that fields with mixed maize cultivars outperform
monocultures with 60% more yield in dry years (Tilahun, 1995).




                                              26
23.      Given the average open pollinated maize yields in the project area of 1,000 kg/ha
(data collected in 2015 for RALP) and the yield of a hybrid maize of about 1,580 kg/ha
(FAOSTAT, 2014), and using the results the Ethiopian research as a proxy, we can see that
under a scenario of a severe drought the traditional open-pollinated cultivars could expect
a yield of about 900 kg/ha, compared to about 300 kg/ha for the hybrid cultivars (chart 1
illustrates these calculations). This represents about 600 kg of losses avoided per hectare,
or a value of about 24,897 YER/ha (US$ 115.8/ha) and per year6.

24.    Component 2. Climate Modeling and Capacity Building. For Yemen, both
global and local climate change impacts matter, given the country’s high levels of food
import dependency, food insecurity, and poverty. Yemen imports between 70 and 90
percent of cereals and is a net importer of many other food items (Ecker et al. 2010). A
sharp decline in oil exports and tourism, together with double-digit inflation since the
beginning of 2011, have increased the number of poor and food-insecure. Climate change
would only add to already important development challenges that Yemen is facing. In this
context, climate change modeling allows to assess how far climate change is likely to affect
Yemen and thus needs to be considered in future development strategies.

25.    Quantifying the impacts of natural disasters is important in order to design
appropriate mitigation strategies which is one of the main economic benefits of the climate
modeling. Yemen is a disaster-prone country that faces a number of natural hazards every
year with floods constituting the most important and recurring form of disaster in the
country 7 . It will become even more important in the future, given that global climate
change may increase the severity and frequency of extreme weather events (Salinger 2005).
Over the last twenty years Yemen suffered through 19 floods and flash floods. Table 1
below presents the floods for which financial damages have been estimated between 1993
and 2008.

26.     The project’s climate modeling activities will facilitate introduction of climate
change mitigation strategies and therefore reduce the likelihood of destructive flooding and
landslides in the future, and so decrease the very high economic and human costs of lives
lost, repairs to damaged infrastructure, agricultural losses and of the relocation of the
population. The costs of flood damages collected over the past years vary from USD
1’500’000 to USD 1’200’000’000. The damage estimates are based on quantities of the
damaged assets without taking into account the spill-over effects of such shocks, given that
losses of livestock and perennials can be spread over four years (time it takes until replanted
trees start bearing fruit and young animals produce meat and milk).

27.     Cost effectiveness. In order to discuss the economic efficiency of the project,
ACAP costs were compared with a project with similar impact. The comparable IFAD-
financed Murat River Watershed Rehabilitation Project (MRWRP) had similar project
objectives and targeted about 80’000 beneficiaries, respectively. The cost per beneficiary
of ACAP of US$ 55.8 compares favourably with that of MRWRP’s US$ 481.4, leading to
the above rating of efficiency.

Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)

A Beneficiary Assessment Survey (BAS), planned to be undertaken at the end of the Project,
could not be completed due to the current security situation, although the BAS had carried
out some interviews and focus groups with beneficiaries. It could be completed by MAI if
the situation improved; a BAS with institutional stakeholders would then be undertaken as
well. The preliminary indication from the incomplete BAS was that the beneficiaries’
assessments were in line with the findings of the BAS for similar activities carried out
under the RALP. Essentially, there are two observations from RALP that could be
reasonably applicable to ACAP: (a) a vast majority (close to eighty percent) of interviewed
beneficiaries rate as positive the benefit to their communities of investments to improve
the sustainable management of natural resources (watershed management, terrace
rehabilitation, etc.); and (b) almost everyone (about 94 percent) of beneficiaries assessed
the women’s participation as good or fair.

                                  EVALUATION SUMMARY

OVERALL PROJECT RATING
1.      Overall implementation of the ACAP was delayed by 12 to 15 months to the
severe start-up delays; the socio-political events of late 2010 and 2011 in Yemen also
influenced Project implementation. Nevertheless, ACAP performed well with regard its
key activities of both grants and achieved most of its stated objectives and results by the
closing date of March 5, 2015 (see Section III below for details). The overall project rating
is assessed as Satisfactory.

Result Framework Analysis
Country and Sector Issues
2.      The ACAP is one of the first pilot operations to address adaptation on the
ground, in a country selected for the PPCR program. This project complemented RALP
by creating a framework for mainstreaming climate considerations, particularly through
the components and activities related to soil and water management, terrace rehabilitation,
and identification and conservation of selected land races which are resilient to harsh
climatic conditions. In addition, ACAP addressed the 'Strategic Priority on
Adaptation'. It piloted and tested the design of improved coping strategies through the
use and conservation of agro-biodiversity resources in the rainfed highlands. The situation
with respect to rainfed agriculture was made particularly difficult as cropping patterns and
crop management are rainfall-dependent.

Higher level objectives to which the Project contributes
3.      The goals for the agriculture sector at the macro level include “increased
efficiencies and average annual growth of 4.5%, with due attention to environmental
sustainability, increased income from agriculture through developing/promoting rainfed
agriculture, and building dams and water dikes.” The ACAP directly contributed to this
vision for agriculture which is “protection of Yemen’s agricultural diversity from
degradation, maintaining agricultural resources and developing sustainable agricultural
programs, taking climate variability and change into consideration”. Specifically, it
addressed the priority adaptation activities identified in the agriculture and water sectors,
through rehabilitation and maintenance of mountainous terraces, development and
implementation of sustainable land management strategies to combat desertification and
degradation, and promotion of research on drought resistant and heat- and salinity-tolerant
crops.
4.      The Government of Yemen’s rural development and agricultural development
strategies also took advantage of local agro-biodiversity and local knowledge to prevent
further land degradation and to help farmers adapt to climate change. The National


                                             33
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan include the short-, medium-, and long-term
objectives and activities on all aspects of biodiversity, including agricultural biodiversity,
which were addressed by ACAP.
5.      Lastly, ACAP was consistent with the GEF-4 under the Climate Change focal
area. The experiences and lessons from ACAP would assist other communities, both in
the region and globally, as they seek to address the issue of adaptation to climate change.
6.      Current strategic plan/National Agricultural Sector Strategy (NASS): The
overall objectives of the agriculture sector are to increase growth, sustainability and equity
by raising agricultural output and to increase rural incomes, particularly for the
economically disadvantaged.
7.        The NASS and its update place new emphasis on:
         Improving productivity of rainfed agriculture, including through terrace restoration,
          watershed management, and water harvesting;
         More efficient agricultural water management through adoption of modern
          irrigation techniques and agronomic packages within sustainable community-led
          water resources management plans and increased efforts to improve productivity in
          rainfed agriculture;
         An increased recognition of the role of rural women in meeting food needs,
          improving nutrition and protecting the environment;
         Improving productivity in irrigated agriculture through modern irrigation
          techniques and advisory services;
         A strong focus on improving productivity and sustainability of livestock production,
          as this sub-sector has growth potential and as livestock are the principal asset and
          economic activity of the economically disadvantaged and landless;
         Diversification of cropping patterns into new or revived cash crops (coffee, honey,
          almonds, and oil crops) and into more nutritious foods to help improve and
          diversify household nutrition, and development of related value chains and parallel
          reduction of area planted with Qat.
8.      The sector now focuses on both growth and distribution and prioritizes the poverty
reducing and nutritional role that agriculture and agricultural services can play. According
to the report, “Although this strategy applies to all farmers, the balance differs somewhat
between: (1) rainfed and smallholder agriculture; and (2) irrigated commercial agriculture.
The growth strategy in rainfed and smallholder agriculture focuses more on inclusion and
adding value to the assets of the poor and on improving their nutritional status.

     I.   PROJECT FORMULATION
9.      Project concept and design: The project design drew on lessons from ongoing and
completed projects, including the GSCP, RALP, and the Seeds and Agriculture Services
Project. Some early lessons from analytical work on how to deal with climate change, in
terms of information, knowledge, and approaches, had also shaped the design of the Project.
The ACAP was one of the first pilot operations to address adaptation on the ground, in a
country selected for the PPCR program. As such, it benefited from the Bank’s wider role
in the climate change dialogue with Yemen and at the same time demonstrated adaptation
for scaling up through the PPCR. This Project complemented the RALP by creating a


                                               34
framework for mainstreaming climate considerations, particularly through the components
and activities related to soil and water management, terrace rehabilitation, and
identification and conservation of selected land races which are resilient to harsh climatic
conditions. Synergies had also been explored with another ongoing IDA project. Thus, the
ACAP was designed to test and pilot coping options along a mesoscale transect that
covered a range of altitudes, mean annual precipitation, and agro-ecological gradients
within the rainfed highlands. Based on the above, its concept and design are considered
Satisfactory.

10.     Relevance: Rainfed agriculture is the primary means of livelihood and a safety net
for a majority of the rural poor in the highlands in Yemen. More than half of the country’s
cultivated area is under rainfed and subsistence farming conditions. For the nearly 84% of
the poor in the rural areas that depend on rainfed agriculture, it is the primary source of
livelihood and food security. The Government of Yemen’s Socioeconomic Development
Plan for Poverty Reduction (SDPPR 2006-10) identified increasing the efficiency of
rainfed agriculture as one of its strategies to address rural poverty. Hence relevance is rated
Satisfactory.

11.     Stakeholder participation in formulation: At the community level the ACAP
follows closely the approach adopted by the PSU, where the main focus is to work in
partnerships with local formal or informal/traditional institutions. Farmers and
communities participating in the community projects under the sub-component that involve
upgrading small-scale community infrastructure and agro-biodiversity-based income
generation activities are responsible for managing their resources sustainably. In-kind
community contributions (such as labor) are emphasized for local ownership and
sustainability of the projects. During implementation, he Project put immense efforts on
enhancing the capacity and awareness at both the national and community level in terms
of organizing workshops and awareness programs. Consequently, the stakeholders in the
communities have acquired adequate knowledge to cope with climate change. The Project
efforts to better equip the local communities to cope with climate change through the
conservation and use of agro-biodiversity within the project timeframe, seem also to be
reasonable. The farmers’ interactions and responsiveness to these coping strategies seems
to be very high due to their indigenous knowledge related to the importance of the activities
under the coping strategies. Based on the above, the stakeholder participation in
formulation is considered Satisfactory.

II     PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
14.     The Project targeted the 8 poorest and most disadvantaged districts in four
Governorates including Sana’a (Bilad Ar Roos and Bani Matar), Al-Mahweet, (Al-
Mahweet and Ar Rugum districts), Ibb (As Sadah and Ba’adan), and Taiz (Saber Al-
Mawadem and Al-Mawaset). These governorates were selected based on the prevalence of
rural poverty and of the importance of rainfed agriculture. Within the project districts, the
project was targeting about 100,000 households. Depending on seasonal agricultural and
non-agricultural employment, these households include landless households, rainfed
farmers with little irrigable land, households with small numbers of livestock, and
pastoralists with little or no crop lands.
15.      Project Governance: The ACAP was implemented under the overall supervision
of a Steering Committee (SC) under the MAI, chaired by the minister of agriculture and
irrigation, and includes representatives of MOPIC, MOF, CAMA, AREA, EPA, NWRA.


                                             36
The Project Support Unit (PSU) in the MAI was in charge of procurement, coordination,
and project implementation through the 2 Field Units (FUs) located in 4 governorates to
implement project activities on the ground. The implementation responsibilities of ACAP
& JSDF projects transferred to the RALP/PSU of MAI to effectively handle these
additional responsibilities. Therefore, the project governance is rated Satisfactory.

16.      Administration and Management of the Project: The Ministry of Agriculture
and Irrigation (MAI) was the main implementing agency for the Project and responsible
for providing strategic oversight, coordinating funds flow, coordinating with other agencies
and, monitoring and reporting on the results. Project administration was carried out by the
Project Support Unit, with the field units (FUs) taking the responsibility of ACAP
implementation. Quarterly review meetings were undertaken by Steering Committee and
the National Project Director (NPD). Ten Review Missions by the Bank officials took
place during Project duration; some of these reviews were desk reviews and phone
consultations (e.g. via Skype and Video-conference on October 30, November 6 and 13,
2014). The PSU had an acceptable and qualified financial management and procurement
staff and satisfactory arrangements for sound internal controls, a well-functioning
automated accounting system, and organized record keeping throughout implementation.
The PSU had an FM manual for RALP which was used for ACAP as well and the two
JSDF grants. An acceptable disbursement plan and updated Project budgets were prepared
periodically. The Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) are reviewed quarterly, and the Project
Financial Statements were audited annually. The previous IFRs were timely received and
found acceptable. Both financial management and procurement closed with Satisfactory
ratings.
17.     Stakeholder participation on project implementation and partnerships: At the
community level the ACAP followed closely the approach adopted by the PSU and was
built on the expertise of the RALP. It followed a participatory approach for mobilizing and
sensitizing the communities, and establishing and strengthening of traditional farmer
networks, including women’s networks. With the help of sociologists, RALP had assisted
in WUAs formation, capacity building and implementation support for sustainable WUAs.
ACAP used this extensive network of WUAs in working with communities for piloting
coping strategies in local landscape units. This had been done by expanding the capacities
of the WUAs with technical support from a team of specialists in adaptation planning and
natural resource conservation.
18.     Public Awareness and Community Sensitization Activities: The PSU supported the
implementation of public awareness campaigns in the communities on climate change
phenomena, the consequences of unsustainable natural resource use, and strategies for
dealing with floods and droughts, and extreme weather events that have increased in
frequency in the last few years. These campaigns were conducted in the project area by
the FUs and the PSU national specialists that included sociologists, income generation
specialists, and gender specialist. So participation is rated Satisfactory.
19.    Risk management: The overall risk management is rated as Moderate. As
reported and outlined in the CAS of 2009, poor governance remains a critical issue in
Yemen. Investments in the institutions, equipment’s and civil works, and services to
communities are likely to be required in coming years. Continued investment in


                                            37
institutional development, equipment, and buildings also will require sustained funding
from the donors and government, which is likely to be available. However, a lack of
progress was observed on achieving budget comprehensiveness and implementing a
broader fiscal framework based on multi-year expenditures framework. Efforts to move
forward in reforming budget implementation, cash management, accounting, and reporting
have started through the IDA-supported Accounting Financial Management Information
System (AFMIS), but it has been experiencing significant delays. In addition, the rating is
based upon the government not achieving budget comprehensiveness.
20.     Co-financing: The ACAP was implemented with support from the GEF with a
USD 4.0 million grant extending over four years. The financing instrument is deemed
appropriate as this was designed as a pilot operation. The operation had complementary
parallel financing from the PHRD CCI Grant (under the Climate Change window), and
in part through complementary activities from the IDA-financed Ground Water and Soil
Conservation Project (GSCP) with which it shared the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).
Overall, the project disbursed 84% of the grants. Consequently, Co-financing is considered
Satisfactory.
21.     Project Restructuring: The first restructuring of ACAP was signed on July 16,
2013. The purpose was to: (a) formalize the transfer of project implementation
responsibility to the MAI/PSU following the closing on June 30, 2012 of (GSCP) and its
Project Coordination Unit (PCU); (b) reschedule the (MTR) date of ACAP from August
31, 2012 to March 31, 2014 (due to the severe start- up delays associated with the socio-
political events of late 2010 and 2011 in Yemen);, and (c) introduce the modality of
“individual consultant” as a procurement method to access consultant services needed to
strengthen the capacity of MAI/PSU to handle the additional implementation
responsibilities of ACAP. Delays of responsibility implementation transferring took a lot
of time as procedures of amending convention were completed only in June 2013. The
second restructuring approved on July 8, 08-Jul-2014, extended the closing date of the GEF
grant until March 5, 2015.
22.     Monitoring and Evaluation: The M&E system was designed to track
performance of the PSU in relation to: (i) progress in achieving scheduled activities and
outputs for each component, (ii) expenditure against budget allocations, (iii) project impact
on key outcomes and indicators, and (iv) implementation of the environmental and social
management plan. Mechanisms and processes were established for monitoring key
dimensions of the Project activities, quality and administrative/managerial efficiency
audits, compliance with Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) conditions, and
implementation of the Tribal Development Plan (TDP). Monitoring of project
implementation and impact has been continuous throughout the Project. It was designed to
collect data for on-going evaluation depending on the key performance indicators and to
ensure ability to assess whether the Project has achieved its main objectives after
completion. The monitoring as adopted for the IDA Credit (3860-YEM) was made
applicable for the ACAP Project. Environmental monitoring followed the regular
monitoring events established for the Project. A national Environmentalist Consultant was
hired in September 2014 to assess the environmental and social impact as well as to ensure
the project compliance with safeguards. Lastly, FUs also prepared quarterly reports on
progress within project implementation, internal audits, and compliance with conditions


                                             38
submitted to respective Boards of Government. Thus, monitoring and evaluation is
considered Satisfactory.

III. ATTAINMENT OF OBJECTIVE AND OUTCOMES:

The Project Development Objective and Key Indicators
23.     Objectives and Key Indicators: The development objectives of ACAP are: (a) to
enhance capacity and awareness at key national agencies and at local levels, to respond to
climate variability and change; and (b) to better equip local communities to cope with
climate change through the conservation and use of agro-biodiversity. At completion,
results indicate that management of natural resources has significantly been improved;
therefore the fulfillment of this objective is Satisfactory.

below by GEF and JSDF financing:

GEF Results
25.     Result 1: Information to enhance and develop agro-biodiversity- based coping
strategies in place. This is rated Highly Satisfactory. By YR2, the stocktaking of
inventory of agro-biodiversity resources was completed and documented 100%. By YR2,
climate resilience profiles of at least 5 landraces were developed, and these landraces
piloted. At Completion, AREA had tested 46 landraces for five crops (920% of target
achieved). 1603 crop landraces and 9 landraces of the famous fruit tree were collected and
kept in the Gene Bank at AREA. In addition, 870 landraces for 32 crop types were collected
earlier and kept in the Faculty of Agriculture. Gene Bank as follows: Sana'a governorate
ranked #1 with 390 collected landraces, Taiz governorate ranked #2 with 250 collected
landraces, Ibb Governorate ranked #3 with 164 collected landraces, and Al Mahweet
governorate ranked #4 with 66 collected landraces.
26.      Result 2: Enhanced capacity of national agencies to develop climate scenarios
based on regional climate models. This is rated Highly Satisfactory. By YR1, the
existing MOU on sharing and harmonization of climate data was strengthened and
institutionalized in relevant climate- related agencies. Signatories of the MOU were:


                                                              40
CAMA, MAI, EPA, and NWRA (100% completed). By YR4, the number of trained
technical specialists in climate- related agencies to undertake climate modeling: 15
technical specialists from CAMA 9, NWRA 2, EPA 2, and AREA 2 trained on climate
modeling. The technical training was implemented in Sana'a, and thus more trainees were
included (target was 8: 188% Completed). Improved local data sets developed and local
capacity to predict regional climate change based on global circulation model output
enhanced on a pilot basis. 8 data sets are developed and training on prediction of climate
change is completed. For specialists from CAMA, NWRA, EPA, and AREA. However,
CAMA is managing the collected data sets. (100% completed).
27.     Result 3: Designed and piloted coping strategies for climate resilience using
agro-biodiversity resources, in select communities in the rain fed highlands & policies
and investment plans of rain-fed agriculture reflect climate considerations. This is
rated Satisfactory. By end of YR 2, number of community coping strategies had been
developed at 145 sites developed (target was 100). Due to the smaller capacity of the water
tanks, the results exceeded the original target. (145% completed). By end of YR3, the target
was at least 20 coping strategies to be tested and piloted in local landscape units. Results
vastly exceeded the target: 43 terraces, 52 water tanks, 14 wadi banks, and 13 soil
conservation measures were completed and tested in local landscape units. (610%
completed). This excellent performance was due to available budget resulting from the
implementation of smaller capacity of the water tanks and smaller areas of upgrading
terraces and wadi bank.. By end of YR3, the target was to have the draft strategy for
climate- resilient agriculture for rain-fed highlands endorsed by MAI. Rainfed agriculture
strategy for climate- resilient finalized in consultations with key stakeholders (including,
CAMA NWRA, AREA, EPA, and MAI) and was submitted to MAI for final endorsement.
But formal adoption is pending due to current political crisis.
28.     Result 4: Effective project management, monitoring and improved
coordination. This is rated Moderately Satisfactory. By end of YR1, the target was to
have a monitoring and evaluation system in place, and following the MTR, its findings and
lessons learned being incorporated into PIM. The Arab Spring- related disturbances
delayed the establishment of the M&E system. The PSU hired an M&E expert only on
September 15, 2013 for 12 months in two periods of 2 -3 months every year. The
Consultant prepared the progress reports for RALP and also prepared a monitoring system
for ACAP. The findings of the ACAP mid-term review (which was delayed) and lessons
learned were added to the PIM. The Project contracted an Environmental Consultant to
prepare the ESMF for the ACAP & the Coping Strategies. The Consultant submitted his
work plan in November 2014 and submitted his draft final report in early February 2015.
After reviewing the draft final report, comments were conveyed to the Consultant. The
draft final report was accepted. The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) covered all
necessary details for carrying out the implementation of all activities of the “Agro-
biodiversity and Climate Change Adaptation Project (ACAP)” of Yemen and the sub-
projects. It provided implementation reference documents for all the parties involved in
project implementation.

JSDF Results
29.      Result 1: Community Natural Resources Management Planning. This is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Ten community agro-biodiversity plans were developed in seven
districts. In one district (the Bilad Al Ros district of the Sana'a Governorate) the activity
was cancelled (target was 12 plans; 83% achieved).
30.     Result 2: Establishment of Small -Income Generation Projects. This is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Criteria for selection of projects was finalized, and beneficiaries
selected based on the finalized criteria (100% achieved). In addition, by YR3, 54 sub-
projects were up and running (target was 20; 270% achieved). Income generation projects
were dominated by beekeeping and animal raising. Lastly, conservation methods were
documented and documentation of community local knowledge was completed (100%
achieved).
31.     Result 3: Community Small-Scale Upgrading and Capacity Building. This is
rated Satisfactory. The results include 62 completed terrace locations and 23 water storage
tanks, as well as 6 flood protection works in Northern & Taiz (910% achieved). The main
reason behind this achievement is the high demand by farmers for small works, which were
not expensive, and the available budget to implement these works. Committees have been
set up to oversee the process, including 8 associations for construction supervision & O&M
(100% achieved). The kinds of projects envisaged include: Upgrading of terraces,
Creation or enhancement of community seed storage facilities to store wild relatives and
landraces of seeds that have an important resilient value, construction of efficient water
storage, establishment of community center for conservation, establishment of model farm,
soil conservation, and small flood protection structures.
32.    Result 4: Community Awareness Program. This is rated Satisfactory.
Awareness raising and dissemination programs were designed and dissemination launched
in April, 2014. Four meetings were held; two days in each district (100% achieved). First
phase of community awareness program was also launched. These two-day awareness
programs were undertaken by national experts in each district (100% achieved). The First
phase Awareness program was done jointly with the GEF-financed awareness program and
completed by October 2014.
33.     Result 5: Project Management and M&E. This is rated Satisfactory.
Achievement include: (i) TORs for TA; Fiduciary and Grant Monitoring and reporting
system was in place. The M&E expert has prepared and/or reviewed the TOR for the
recruited national Consultants as well as the M&E system for RALP, and ACAP. Required
tasks from the M&E Expert are 100% completed; (ii) Periodic Progress Reports and
Implementation Completion Report. The M&E consultant has also prepared the semi-
annual progress reports for RALP, and the ACAP. The M&E prepared the projects
progress reports for RALP, and ACAP. PSU has contracted Techman Consulting
Services to prepare both the Beneficiary Assessment Study (BAS) and the implementation
completion report (ICR).
