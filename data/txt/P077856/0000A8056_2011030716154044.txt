                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After showing signs of early improvement, the implementation progress has been further deteriorated. There are four areas of concerns - (a) The continuing unsatisfactory project/
                         contract management, (b) Slow progress of contracts 5, 7 and 8, (c) continued lack of staffing at the Road Safety Cell (RSC) of NHAI and (d) Unsatisfactory implementation of GAAP.

                         is a risk of achieving project development objective.
