A.     Introduction
1.      The restructuring has been necessitated by the poor performance, over an
extended period of time, of four (4) out of twelve (12) civil works contracts being
financed under the project. The Government of India (GOI) and the National Highways
Authority of India (NHAI) have requested that the Bank remove these poorly-performing
contracts from the Banks financing as the funds allocated for those may not be utilized
prior to the loan closing. Some part of the resulting savings (see description of proposed
changes to the project and cost estimates in ANNEX 1) would compensate to finance cost
increases in the remaining works.
2.       The restructured project reflects the request from the GOI to remove activities that
are covered by four contracts from the project description as well as include follow-up
activities to the LMNHP Action Plan agreed between the Bank and NHAI in December
2008 (and, modified in January 2009) to address the unsatisfactory implementation
performance of the project. The Action Plan included actions to improve progress on
five poorly performing civil works contracts, construction safety, contractor and
consultant performance, fiduciary controls, and also initiated a number of institutional
development measures to support NHAI in strengthening program implementation.
Implementation of the Action Plan has generally been satisfactory with the exception of
progress on four of the five poorly performing works contracts. The original action plan
and its implementation status as on March 2010 is attached as ANNEX 5. The revised
Action Plan (ANNEX 6) presents and incorporates those actions, arising out of the
present restructuring, primarily focusing on safety aspects and fiduciary controls and is
part of the restructured project.

B.      Background and Reason for Proposed Restructuring
3.      The Loan was approved in December 2004, and became effective in December
2005 with a closing date of end-June 2010. The project had one component, key activities
of which included civil works on 12 highway upgrading work contracts (ongoing);
construction supervision (ongoing); LA R&R (ongoing); road safety awareness campaign
(completed); cement concrete performance study(completed); road users satisfaction
surveys at the EOP and; the RAP impact assessment. The bids received for the 12
highway upgrading works contracts in December 2004 were much higher than the cost
estimates, and were consequently rejected. NHAI re-invited the bids for all 12 contracts
with an alternative procurement strategy, in consultation with the Bank, to reduce the
possibility of collusion. The re-bidding was done in batches and on the basis of revised
estimates (costs and quantities) and produced bids close to the updated cost estimates,
and the 12 contracts were awarded in batches between August and November 2005.
Since the borrower preferred to sign the loan agreement only after the works contracts
were awarded, the loan only became effective only in December 2005.
4.     Upon mobilization of the contractors, various implementation problems emerged,
such as non-availability of land for the highway upgrading, delays in receiving
permissions to cut trees, deficiencies in the Detailed Project Reports (DPR) quality,
inaccurate identification of the land to be acquired, in addition to the poor performance
by few contractors. As a consequence, all the work contracts progressed slower than
planned. The four contracts, activities of which are being removed from the project
description, have progressed at the slowest pace, with noticeable weak contractor

                                             1
performance, having achieved only about 36% of the contract value as of February end
2010, even after the original three year contract duration has already elapsed. Further,
these four contracts have been progressing at a monthly rate well below 2 percent of
original contract value, whereas the rate required even under a restructured project, with a
2-year time extension, would be about 3 percent per month. The GOI therefore has
concluded that these four poorly performing works contracts are unlikely to be able to
utilize the loan within the time available even with an extension of the loan closing date.
Consequently, GOI requested the Bank to consider restructuring the project. The latest
supervision carried out in December 20009 has suggested that the rate of progress and the
performance of the 8 contracts kept under the restructuring has been better than four
contracts to be removed and it is likely that their completion can be well achieved under
the proposed loan closing date of June 30, 2012. Following is the progress on all 12
contracts as of February 2010.

    Contract      1      2       3        4       5        6        7    8    9    10   11   12
    Progress      71     79      70       72      46       81       63   66   18   36   45   48

    (%) **

5.      In addition to the implementation issues with the civil work contracts, NHAI and
the Bank were also concerned about deteriorating safety on the project, including
construction safety. The occupational health and safety of construction workers in the
work zone is required to be adequately addressed. Presence of live traffic and
linear/scattered nature of works in the road and bridge construction/rehabilitation works
further add to the work zone safety challenges. The governments current impetus on
transport infrastructure and consequent high demand on speed of construction has
probably further exacerbated the work zone safety challenge. The project also witnessed
two construction accidents in quick succession. In September 2008, a girder of the
flyover under construction fell in package 1 and in January 2010, three girders of a bridge
under construction fell in package 2. There were fatalities involved in both accidents. The
investigation reports of both accidents have been received by the Bank.

6.      Construction accidents pose a considerable cost to the economic development and
reputational risk to various infrastructure development programs of the GOI. While
accurate statistics in the Indian context are not available, International Labor
Organization (ILO) fact sheet1 reveal that approximately 4% of the worlds gross
domestic product is lost with the cost of injury, death and disease through absence from
work, sickness treatment, and disability and survivor benefits. The restructured project
will address this issue by supporting NHAI to strengthen construction safety aspects in
preparation, implementation and operation of their projects. The project implementation
experience also suggests need to further enhance the environmental management on the
NHAI network.

7.      Current Safety Situation: Since November 2008, NHAI has taken considerable
steps in the area of work safety and all actions agreed as per the original Action Plan
(Nov 2008) has been complied and/or partially complied with (please refer ANNEX 5).
A review of the safety level undertaken in December 2009 and January 2010 has found a
further scope of improvement on ground but the team is satisfied with the increasing
attention by senior management of NHAI as demonstrated by various workshops held
and handling of the January 2010 accident.
8.      In addition to the contractors performance and road construction industrys
capacity constraints, the poor project performance also indicates a need to enhance the
NHAIs institutional capacity and effectiveness in implementing GOIs ambitious
National Highway Development Program (NHDP). Taking cognizance of this, GOI has
requested the Bank to prepare a separate Technical Assistance (TA) Project with the
NHAI to address broader institutional strengthening issues. The proposed TA project
would support NHAI in undertaking institutional reforms to address current
implementation challenges, including reforms in the areas of contract management,
environment and social management, governance, safety, design quality, performance
monitoring of concessionaires/contractors/consultants, Public Private Partnership and
interoperability of toll collection systems. The TA project will be separately processed
using the new risk based approach to investment lending in accordance with the ongoing
Investment Lending Reforms and is likely to be presented to the Board by the end of
FY10.
9.      In the area of financial accounting and reporting, there were shortcomings in the
existing systems which were pointed out during various missions. In response NHAI had
improved their fiduciary controls considerably in last six months and further expressed
interest to put in place an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to replace their
existing systems in order to meet the needs of scaled up operations of NHAI. The ERP
system would encompass all major activities of NHAI and strengthen the fiduciary
controls through enhanced management systems and accounting based on business
principles.
10.     Given the above difficulties described in paragraphs 3 to 7, the project was
unlikely to meet its development objective of "an improved journey between Lucknow
and Muzaffarpur" within the duration of the Loan. The project was also rated
"unsatisfactory" on implementation performance since December 2008. The four
contracts, activities of which are to be removed from the project description, were
unlikely to meet the targets for progress as was stipulated in the Action Plan. The
proposed changes under this restructuring allow the loan funds released from these poorly
performing contracts to be put to more productive use. It is expected that successful
implementation of the restructured project and agreed action plan could lead to upgrading
of the project rating. Moreover, the continuous partnership of the Bank and NHAI during
the implementation of restructured project will also provide an opportunity to enhance the
scope of engagement to meet the current sector challenges.
11.      The implementation of the restructured project would benefit from its
interdependence with the proposed TA (refer to paragraph 8 above), as many of the
institutional and process weaknesses which contributed to the sub-optimal performance
of the project to some extent, would be addressed through the proposed TA, thereby
addressing institutional capacity risks in the future implementation of the remaining

                                            3
contracts, especially on construction safety and contract management. Please refer to the
ANNEX 11 for list of activities proposed to be included in the proposed TA and current
progress made by NHAI. Furthermore, an enhanced supervision strategy has been
developed for the remainder of the project implementation period (see ANNEX 7), which
includes Annual Independent Reviews of project performance by a panel of experts
appointed by the Bank management.

C.     Proposed Changes in the Project
12.    Proposed changes include, the removal of the activities that are covered by the
four contracts from the project description; changes in the Project Development
Objective; Extension of the Loan Closing Date; changes in the result monitoring
framework and addition of following activities in the project description - introduction of
a new 55 km pilot Safer-Greener Highways Pilot; strengthening of the Road Safety Cell
(RSC) and Implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.

13.    Development Objective: The inclusion of activities to support NHAI in improving
safety and sustainability of the highway network and reduction in the works financed
necessitated a revision to the Project Development Objective. The revised objective is:

"To improve the journey on NH-28 between Lucknow and the Uttar Pradesh/Bihar
Border, and to support NHAI in improving safety and sustainability of the project
corridor."
14.     Project Outcomes: The removal of the activities that are covered by the four
contracts from the project description will result into deletion of 32 percent of the
distance between Lucknow and Muzaffarpur from the project, consequently the present
outcome indicators (travel time and cost savings) would only partially be realized, and
are to be revised accordingly. Expected additional development outcome is reduced fatal
accident rates on project corridor both during construction and operation.
15.    Project Outputs:
       The removal of the activities that are covered by the four contracts from the
       project description will reduce the length of the highway converted to 4-lane dual
       carriageway standard under the project to 328 km from the original 483 km.
       The Safer-Greener Highways Pilot would retrofit 55 km of the existing six-lane
       Delhi-Panipat section of NH-1, the countrys most heavily trafficked highway,
       with enhanced safety and environmental measures (see ANNEX 8) as a pilot for a
       broader program to improve the safety and user friendliness of the NH network.
       Strengthened Road Safety Cell to enhance safety of designs, construction
       practices, and network operations including empowerment to enforce safety
       aspects.
       Strengthened fiduciary controls through enhanced management systems and
       accounting based on business principles - Implementation of a new Enterprise
       Resource Planning (ERP) system.
16.   Costs and Financing Plan: Detailed cost estimates for the restructured project are
in ANNEX 1. The highway upgrading costs have changed since the scope/length has
                                            4
reduced but there has also been an increase in the cost of the remaining works due to
price escalation and physical variations. The table below summarizes the revised project
costs and financing plan.

*See ANNEX 1 for detailed cost estimates
17.    Closing Date: It is necessary to extend the closing date for the loan from June 30,
2010 to June 30, 2012 to allow completion of the new activities as well as the ongoing
eight works contracts.
18.     Financial Management: During the period December 2008 till date NHAI has
brought about several improvements in the financial management arrangements for the
project. NHAI has agreed the Terms of Reference (ToR) with the Comptroller & Auditor
General (C&AG) for the Annual Project Financial Management Audit and the C&AG has
already carried out the audit and issued a clean report for FY 2008-09. A revised risk-
based ToR for entity-wide internal audit has been agreed with NHAI. Internal auditors
have been appointed and the internal audits are in progress. Reconciliation of claims with
C&AG audit certificates and disbursements by the Bank has also been completed. In
order to replicate these fiduciary control improvements, the restructured project will
support the implementation of entity wide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). The
program management consultants for overseeing ERP implementation is already on
board.
19.    Disbursement Arrangements: There will be no change in the disbursement
arrangements. However, the current quarterly Financial Management Reports (FMR) /
Quarterly Progress Report (QPR) will be replaced by quarterly Interim Un-audited
Financial Reports (IUFRs) agreed with NHAI. There is also an option for NHAI to
progress to IUFR based disbursement at a future period.
20.     Implementation Arrangements: The implementation of the restructured project
will require direct and continuous involvement of the NHAI senior management in the
implementation arrangements, and the project will be the direct responsibility of the
Member of the NHAI Board. Implementation progress will be reviewed at NHAIs
internal meetings, headed by the Chairman, once every month. Please refer to ANNEX 9
for the agreed implementation arrangements.
21.    The Restructured Project will be carried out in accordance with the "Guidelines
on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans

                                            5
and IDA Credits and Grants", dated October 15, 2006; the "Guidelines: Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in
October 2006 and; the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers" published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in October 2006.

D.        Analysis of the Effects of the Restructuring
22.     Economic Analysis: The costs and benefits of the project have undergone
significant change. The restructured project however remains viable although the
benefits have reduced, since the improvements will be over a shorter length of highway
(328 km vs. 483 km previously). The costs have also changed since the scope has
reduced but there have also been an increase in the cost of the remaining works due to
price escalation and increases in quantity estimates. Despite the reduced benefits and
increased costs, the restructured project will have an EIRR of more than 12%. Please
refer to ANNEX 2 for further details.
23.    Environmental and Social Safeguards: The restructuring of the project has no
incremental adverse environmental or social impact as the only change in the physical
components is a reduction in the length of highway upgrading works. Please refer to
ANNEX 2 for details.

E.        Expected Outcomes
24.    The expected outcome of the original project is identified as reduction in travel
time and cost between Lucknow and Muzaffarpur. With the removal of four contracts,
we have revised these targets as follows:

                              Time and Cost Reduction Targets

26.     Outcome indicators have also been defined for the new activities introduced into
the project. However, since these would take time to produce outcomes, it is unlikely the
targets could be achieved by loan closing; therefore intermediate outcomes, which are to
be achieved by the proposed loan closing, are provided in the table below. Please refer to
ANNEX 4 for result framework and monitoring.

project monitoring and to develop the baseline outcome indicators immediately.
Subsequently, the consultant would track and report the progress and will prepare a report
on the Outcome Indicators and Intermediate Outcomes at the loan closing.

F.        Risks and Mitigation Measures

28.     The key project implementation risks and mitigation measures are presented in
ANNEX 3. In addition, a Governance and Accountability Action Plan (ANNEX 10)
identifies and propose mitigating measures for addressing various institutional risks.




                                                     7
                              Annex 1: Proposed Changes


a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

1.      Changes to the project have been made as follows: The removal of the activities
that are covered by the four contracts from the project description; introduction of a new
55 km pilot Safer-Greener Highways Pilot; strengthening of the Road Safety Cell (RSC)
and Implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
Development Objective: The inclusion of activities to support NHAI in improving safety
and sustainability of the highway network and reduction in the works financed
necessitated a revision to the Project Development Objective. The revised objective is:
"To improve the journey on NH-28 between Lucknow and the Uttar Pradesh/Bihar
Border, and to support NHAI in improving safety and sustainability of the project
corridor."
Project Outcomes: The removal of the activities that are covered by the four contracts
from the project description will result into deletion of 32 percent of the distance between
Lucknow and Muzaffarpur from the project, consequently the present outcome indicators
(travel time and cost savings) would only partially be realized, and are to be revised
accordingly. Expected additional development outcome is reduced fatal accident rates on
project corridor both during construction and operation.

The removal of the activities that are covered by the four contracts from the project
description

2.      Activities covered by contracts 9, 10, 11, 12 of LMNHP will be removed from the
project description. Considering the savings in the loan amount accruing from removal of
four contracts and addition costs increases in the eight remaining contracts that would
continue to be financed by the Bank, the saving in the project were estimated at about
US$21million as of February 28, 2010, to fund the new activities discussed below.

55 km Safer-Greener Highways Pilot

3.      The safety concerns in the LMNHP implementation caused safety enhancements
to feature prominently in the restructuring of the project. This includes strengthening of
the RSC, undertaking Safety Audits to identify possible areas of weakness and
strengthening of contractual frameworks on work site safety management. To bring these
together and to create a demonstration effect, a pilot program to retrofit the most
congested national highway corridor (NH-1) with enhanced safety and environmental
management is proposed. The section selected is the 6-8 lane Delhi-Panipat section of
NH-1 which presently carries the highest traffic volumes in the country. The retro-fits
will include features such as pedestrian facilities, median openings, water conservation,
dust suppression, landscaping, etc. The total cost of these improvements is estimated to
be about US$ 25 million, out of which US$10.9 million will be provided through the
loan. Details on the pilot are in ANNEX 8.
                                             8
Strengthening of the Road Safety Cell (RSC)
4.      NHAI has created the RSC at Head Quarter (HQ) with responsibility to establish
safety policies and procedures covering design, construction and operation stages of road
development including monitoring of safety performance. The restructured project will
support following activities to strengthen the RSC:
        Engagement of a full-time safety expert with international expertise for two years
        to advise NHAI on all safety-related aspects
        Activities to be identified / determined by the international safety expert in
        consultation with NHAI management to improve safety aspects in the road
        development and operation process.
        Preparation, adoption and publication of a manual on construction safety.
        Organization of training programs to sensitize and develop capacity on
        construction safety.

These activities are estimated to require financing of about US$ 2.75 million from the
loan.
Implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.

5.     In order to strengthen the fiduciary controls through enhanced management
systems and accounting based on business principles, NHAI is in the process of
implementing an entity-wide ERP system. The program management consultants have
already been procured and they are in the process of finalizing the Request For Proposal
(RFP) for the implementation vendor. The total cost of the ERP implementation is
estimated to be about US$ 34 million, out of which US$ 6.8 will be provided through the
loan.

Economic and financial analysis                               ___Yes        ___No
If, yes, please explain:
The costs and benefits of the project have undergone significant change. The restructured
project however remains viable although the benefits have reduced, since the
improvements will be over a shorter length of highway (328 km vs. 483 km previously).
The costs have also changed since the scope has reduced but there have also been an
increase in the cost of the remaining works due to price escalation and increases in
quantity estimates. The table below presents a revised economic analysis, which has
been developed using certain simplifying, though conservative, assumptions as noted in
the table. Despite the reduced benefits and increased costs, the restructured project
retains a positive Net Present Value (NPV) at a 12 percent discount rate (and
consequently an Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) above 12 percent) even
allowing for a further combined 15 percent increased costs and 15 percent reduced
benefits.

The restructuring of the project has no incremental adverse environmental or social
impact, as the only change in the physical components is a reduction in the length of
highway upgrading works. The expected improvements in construction safety, in fact
would enhance the occupational health and safety aspects in the project implementation.
There is, however, concern regarding the Environmental and Social Safeguards on the
activities which are proposed to be removed from the project definition. In this regard,
NHAI has agreed to continue to adhere to the provisions of the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) and the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for those works,
regardless of those being financed from the Governments own resources. The Bank will
continue to monitor the EMP and RAP compliance on the four works contracts, activities
of which are to be removed from the project description. NHAI would continue
providing quarterly monitoring reports on the EMP and RAP for those contracts.

Civil works required for executing the Safer- Highways Pilot would be carried out within
the existing Right of Way and are expected to be largely minor in nature. The changes
proposed would not alter the Environment Category of the restructured project or trigger
new safeguard policies, and no waivers of Bank policies are needed. Therefore, for the
Safer-Greener Highways Pilot, the generic EMP, which has already been
approved/cleared for LMNHP, will be used as a base document with modifications as
necessary, to reflect the site specific requirements. The modified EMP will be integrated
into the preparation and implementation stages of the pilot (please refer to ANNEX 8).

b)     Interim missions between full ISMs, so that Bank engagement occurs on a three
       monthly basis.

of the reports prepared by an entity designated to provide Third Party Works Quality
Audit of the civil works. NHAI will arrange meetings between the Bank ISM missions
and Third Party agency(ies) at least once a year with a formal report submitted by such
agency(ies) presented to the ISM at least seven days prior to the meeting.

3.     Annual Independent Review (AIR): The Task Team Leader (TTL) for the project
will organize annually for the AIR to be conducted by a panel of experts appointed by
the Sector Manager Transport for South Asia. The Panel will be provided full
documentation on the project including all preparation and supervision documents and
legal agreements, reports produced relevant to assessing project performance.

4.     Activities covered under four contracts, which are to be removed from the project
description: Agreement has been reached with NHAI (in a side letter) that the four
contracts (9, 10, 11, 12) removed from financing under the loan would continue to
conform to the requirements of the existing/agreed Environmental Management Plan and
Resettlement Action Plan for the project, including on all safety related aspects. The
Bank would supervise these contracts with respect to the environmental and social
safeguards only. NHAI will ensure that the Project Implementation Units overseeing
these contracts will provide the Bank with relevant progress reports as required under the
EMP and RAP.

The ,,Safer-Greener Highways pilot seeks to demonstrate safety and environmental
streamlining and stewardship in the operations and maintenance stage of the highway
life-cycle. The concept emphasizes ,,safety and sustainability as the driving force in
infrastructure development operations.

2.     Road Map for `Safer-Greener Highways' Pilot

For the ,,Safer-Greener Highways Pilot, a stretch of about 55 kms of National Highway
No. 1 from Delhi/Haryana border up to Panipat in Haryana has been proposed.
At this conceptual stage of the pilot, it is envisaged that aspects pertaining to use of
environment friendly material/technology, landscaping, drainage management and
improvements in natural environment through reduction of dust and noise will form a
dominant part of the pilot. However, the final selection of the green initiatives/practices,
its extent and method of treatment will be worked out as part of the Detailed Project
Preparation (DPR) for this component of the pilot project. The DPR preparation will
include the following key steps:
       Establishment of the baseline or existing conditions
       Analysis of the baseline data and the various alternatives
       Finalization of locations for various activities/practices
       Preparation of detailed design including technical drawings, site specific EMP
       (using the already approved comprehensive Generic EMP prepared for LMNHP)
       and cost estimates
       Preparation of bidding documents
       Design of a result monitoring framework to estimate the impacts of the initiative

Extensive consultation with various stakeholders including NHAI officials (both at
headquarter and in field), state Public Works Department (PWD) officials from Delhi and
Haryana, Environmental Experts, Local Communities, NGOs, Construction Industry
(Contractors) will be undertaken during each stage of the pilot project cycle - planning;
design preparation and finalization; construction; operation and maintenance. Particular
emphasis will be given to identification of local safety and environmental issues and
developing solutions in close consultation with the affected population. Information
dissemination and disclosure of documents will be carried out as per Banks policies.

3.     Safety Initiatives under the Proposed Pilot Project

A Road Safety inspection was undertaken on the proposed NH-1 section to be included in
the Project. The Inspection was done by the International Road Assessment Program
(iRAP) and funded by a grant from the World Bank Global Road Safety Facility. The
study developed engineering countermeasures that will be considered under the pilot
project. The countermeasures to be implemented will be chosen based on a cost-benefit
analysis. It is expected that the adopted countermeasures will reduce the current 125
fatalities per year on the section by about 25% and cost around US$ 15 million.
       These countermeasures include the following: Shoulder sealing ( > 1m)
       Installation of median and side barriers
       Grade separation
       Delineation and signage at intersections
       Provision of pedestrian footpaths separated from the road
       Provision of pedestrian foot-over bridges
       Improve delineation (including marking and signage)
       Installation of traffic signals at intersections and crossings
       Parking improvement
       Regulation of roadside commercial activities
       Traffic calming and other innovative traffic management in urban and semi-urban
       sections

4.     Green Initiatives under the Proposed Pilot Project

The proposition/initiative to include a pilot on ,,Greener Highways under the
restructuring of Lucknow Muzaffarpur National Highway Project can help in
demonstrating environmental stewardship in the transportation infrastructure in the
country. Some specific practices that are being considered under the ,,Green Highway
pilot project include the following:
       Demonstration of Innovative Storm Water Management Practices ­ this could
       include practices like rain water harvesting and bio-retention apart from
       preventing/improving water logging conditions in the adjoining settlements
       affected due to raising of the highway.
       Revitalization and harnessing the potential of neglected/abused natural resources
       along the highway such as stream or pond restoration
       Promotion of energy management technologies ­ use of energy efficient lighting
       for toll plazas, street lights and other way-side amenities.
       Landscaping including creation and maintenance of green areas in and along the
       highways - this includes landscaping of medians, fly-overs and avenue plantation
       along the highway.
       Noise reduction measures such as provision of noise barriers (hard or soft,
       depending on the receptor and area availability), particularly for sensitive
       receptors such as educational and health facilities.


                                          31
       Improvement in ambient air quality by reducing Suspended Particulate Matter
       (SPM) from highway sources (e.g. unpaved areas, earthen shoulders and
       construction activities) in particular dust suppression by landscaping to eliminate
       bare earth.
       Slope protection measures to reduce erosion and scouring of embankments and
       siltation of water bodies.
       Provision/improvement of bus-bays, bus stops and rest areas.
       Enhancement of cultural properties, water bodies and rest stops along the
       highway.

5.     Safeguards and the Pilot Project

The ,,Safer-Greener Highways Pilot has no incremental adverse environmental or social
impacts as the only physical components are all environment augmentative measures.
The proposed initiatives/activities under the pilot would not alter the environment
category of the project or trigger new safeguard policies.
In fact the pilot is expected to contribute towards the improvements in physical and
natural environment through various activities during the operation and maintenance
stage of the highway life-cycle. Such a pilot will be relevant to the entire developed
network of highways in the country ­ the pilot project can benefit about 23,000 kms of
National Highway network that have been or are being developed in the country apart
from several hundred kilometers of state highways where widening and upgrading has
been undertaken and which could benefit from retro-fitting enhanced safety and
environmental measures.
It is proposed that the pilot initiatives will be undertaken only within the existing Right of
Way (RoW) i.e. no fresh/new land acquisition, forest land diversion or tree cutting would
be required for the pilot project.
Any civil works required for executing the Safer-Greener Highways Pilot would be
carried out within the existing Right of Way and would be minor in nature. The planning
and execution of such civil works will be carried out as per the already agreed/approved
Generic EMP for LMNHP, which will be fine-tuned during the DPR preparation to
address any site specific concerns/issues that may be identified during analysis of
baseline conditions or may emerge during the public consultation process. Site specific
details and requirements will be added to this base document (Generic EMP) to reflect
and address field level issues that may be typical to the Delhi-Panipat section of the
National Highway. The EMP for the pilot project will include monitoring indicators,
reporting formats (specific to works of the pilot project) and will be integrated into the
bidding documents to ensure effective environmental management and safeguards
implementation during execution of the pilot project. All these agreements will be
recorded in the minutes of negotiation for the restructured project.

                                          33
                        Annex 9: Implementation Arrangements

1.      Safety Initiatives: NHAI has established a Road Safety Cell (RSC) headed by a
full-time Chief General Manager (CGM) and with one full-time General Manager (GM).
In addition, it is proposed to have two Deputy General Managers (DGMs), seven
Managers (four at headquarter and three in field) and other support staff. It is proposed
that the RSC will have a well reputed Senior Advisor having international experience to
help develop the Safety Cell and to advise the Safety Cell on all aspects of its activities
for two years. One DGM and one manager level position could be for officials with
qualification and experience on occupational health and safety aspects. The Safety Cell
will implement various safety-related activities (to be identified) under the restructured
project. Such activities could include, holding training / safety awareness programs,
conducting safety audits (other than the compulsory safety audits to be undertaken by the
respective project units) and preparation of safety manual for each stage of design,
construction and operation.

2.      Design Review Initiatives: This activity is proposed to be implemented under
the separate TA project being prepared. NHAI has established a temporary Design
Review Cell headed by a CGM holding additional charge. NHAI will appoint a
consulting firm for technical assistance to NHAI for establishment of a full-fledged
Design Review Cell and to assist NHAI in the initial functioning of the Cell. The
consultants team is likely to comprise Senior Advisors highly experienced
internationally who will be stationed at NHAI headquarter with all logistical support from
NHAI, for a period of two years. The team of advisors will initially advise NHAI on
staffing / responsibility / authority / procedures etc for the Cell, and thereafter will assist
NHAI in implementation of the same. NHAI will implement the staffing and resources
(equipment, software, etc) as required for full functioning of the Cell in consultation with
the team of advisors.

3.    Improved Program Management: NHAI has established a Working Group
which will identify the existing procedures resulting in critical delays and will make
recommendations for improved procedures including delegation of power / authority.

4.      Performance Evaluation of Consultants, Contractors and Concessionaires:
This activity is proposed to be implemented under the separate TA project being
prepared. NHAI has constituted a committee with representatives from NHAI,
Department of Road Transport and Highway (DoRTH), Indian Road Congress (IRC) and
Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) to work on procedures for performance
evaluations. NHAI has also decided to engage a consultant to assist the committee in
formulating the performance review system. NHAI will appoint an agency who would
help NHAI in the development and implementation of a comprehensive Performance
Evaluation, Rating, Monitoring and Sanctions system, which will be funded by the Bank
under the restructured project. The agency will work closely with the committee
established by NHAI for this purpose. The agency is expected to provide support to
NHAI in implementing the system for one year. Thereafter, NHAI is expected to appoint
an agency for continued support in implementing the system.



                                              34
5.      Improvements in Fiduciary Controls and Financial Management: NHAI will
implement an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software system to provide overall
management and accounting control encompassing all its activities through an
experienced agency to be funded by the restructured loan. NHAI will continue to
strengthen its internal audit as per its plan and submit internal audit reports of the project
to the Bank in a timely manner along with its action taken report. NHAI will also address
the statutory audit observations in accordance with the action plan.

6.      Third Party Works Quality Audit: Audit of the project materials and works
quality will be carried out through local engineering institute(s) at every six months.
NHAI will provide the Bank with the reports of such audit and will also arrange meetings
between the Banks Implementation Support mission (ISM) and the audit agency.

7.     Safer-Greener Highways Pilot: This activity under the restructured project will
be implemented jointly by the RSC and its Environmental Unit. Safety Audit and
Recommendation of Remedial Measures (countermeasure) for Completed NH 1corridor
have already been undertaken through the grant of Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF).
NHAI will appoint reputed consultants for detailed safety audit and design of safety
interventions and for preparation of detailed environmental enhancement plans including
bidding document for the about 55 km long Delhi-Panipat section of National Highway 1.
NHAI will also appoint a Supervision Consultant to administer the works contract.

                 Annex 10: Governance and Accountability Action Plan

1.     The NHAI has a detailed works manual that covers implementation of national
highway projects comprehensively. The Governance and Accountability Action Plan
(GAAP) for this project seeks to build upon these procedures and NHAIs existing
systems. In addition, it seeks to ensure compliance with Indias Right to Information Act
(RTIA) that mandates public disclosure of basic project related information. The GAAP
is premised on enhanced transparency through better information disclosure and effective
complaint handling mechanisms at NHAI to address public concerns, grievances and
complaints. The underlying assumption is that such enhanced disclosure and redressal
mechanisms will increase public and civil society participation and support for projects.

2.      The GAAP has been developed based on relevant road transport issues identified
from the Guidance Note on Transport Sector GAAP (which was itself evolved after a
thorough value-chain analysis of the entire sector), and a review of existing systems at
NHAI through detailed discussions with its officials. As detailed in the restructuring plan
and the table below, the risks will be primarily mitigated through better disclosure
policies, strengthened institutional capacity, and effective systems for monitoring
construction quality, contractor/consultant performance, and public complaints. The
actions listed in the GAAP are a part of the project implementation plan, making it
obligatory for NHAI to comply with the same.

Key Governance Issues
3.     Successful accomplishment of the project development objective would flow
from good governance and accountability mechanisms in every stage of the project cycle,
namely, project preparation/design/planning, procurement and implementation. Some of
the key governance risks are as follows:

        Traditionally, design issues have hampered implementation of several highway
        projects due to a variety of reasons such as too little time for preparation, lack of
        adequate scrutiny and impacts on the mode of procurement. This poses a risk of
        deficient designs, leading to higher costs and/or delays during project execution.
        Delays in making the needed land available encumbrance free to the contractor
        before start of work continue to be an issue on projects.
        Inadequate monitoring of works quality during project implementation poses
        significant risks of sub-standard work that results in low value for public money
        spent.2
        Since the NHAI projects are invariably large, it is imperative that information
        about the projects and their implementation is widely disseminated for effective
        public/civil society participation in project selection/implementation to ensure
        project quality and sustainability. However, NHAI does not currently provide key
        project specific information online such as detailed project reports of various

       ongoing projects, contact information of project director(s), grievance redressal
       officer details, etc.
       The lack of enforcement of contract provisions in a timely manner during
       implementation.
       Bidding process has risks of collusion and coercion
       The lack of speedy dispute resolution mechanisms poses a risk to timely project
       completion as the contractors are more likely to take legal recourse to resolve
       their disputes.
       Inadequate financial management system that is unable to generate error free
       financial statements and does not allow for reconciliation between physical and
       financial progress or comparison between budgeted and actual expenditures.
       Weak internal controls and procedures.
Some opportunities
4.      The NHAI has recently started several initiatives on its own to upgrade some of
its procedures and processes. For instance, a working group has been set up to identify
procedural bottlenecks and recommend changes. It has also set up a Design Review Cell
to review all designs prior to approval, and a Road Safety Cell to look into all safety
aspects during design, implementation and highway operations.

5.      The GoI passed the Right to Information Act (RTIA) in 2005, which became
operational for all government agencies, including public sector undertakings in October
2005. It mandates both suo moto and on-demand disclosure of information in the public
interest and places the burden of such disclosure on the government agencies. This Act
applies to NHAI as well.

6.      NHAI has a website, which provides information on the administrative set up as
well as status of projects undertaken under various programs, including a section on
externally aided projects. Information regarding the agencys grievance redressal cell is
also provided on the website. Annual reports of the organization are also available up to
2005-06.

7.    NHAI already has a system of appointing quality audit consultants (such as CRRI,
Engineers India Limited) to review the works quality on large projects.

                      included in the Proposed TA loan to NHAI

A. Institutional Strengthening Actions

1.    Support to facilitate implementation of key recommendations of the Report
of the Inter Ministerial Committee on Restructuring of National Highways
authority of India, March 2008.

(i)     The report recommend various actions, including (a) The Tenure of the Chairman
        to be fixed for at least three years ; (b) Increase in the number of part-time
        Members by two (from 4 to 6); (c) permanent employees to be about 50% of the
        total work force and 25% to begin with and; (d) engaging, where required, outside
        experts (with relaxation of age if required) specifically for the posts of financial
        analyst, transport economist, contract management specialist and legal expert; on
        compensation to be determined by the Authority in line with the experience and
        availability of the appropriate personnel

(ii)    There has been considerable progress in implementation of these key reforms.
        The 'NHAI Rules 2003' has been amended by Notification in the Gazette of India
        on July 24, 2009 to fix the tenure of NHAI chairman. The increase in the number
        of Members requires an amendment to the NHAI Act 1988. A review of the act
        in totality is under process. NHAI had also made the Regulation under the NHAI
        Act about making 25% permanent staffing. Selection process for these permanent
        positions is ongoing. The current strength is about 15%.

(iii)   The NHAI has also made regulation under the NHAI Act to engage experts from
        open market. The TA loan proposes to support NHAI in this regard.

2.      Stakeholder Participation:

(i)     Strengthen the system to review/advice NHAI on its operations through
        interaction with other stakeholders - representation of users (e.g. truck owners),
        funders (public and private), and specialized technical agencies (IRC,
        Construction Industry Development Council (CIDC), C&AG) - to be convened by
        NHAI at its headquarters twice a year;

3.     Corporate Governance Assessment: NHAI will commission a Corporate
Governance Assessment (CGA) of the NHAI, and will take appropriate actions with
respect to the recommendations of such CGA. NHAI could either adopt the
recommended actions or parts of it or provide reason(s) for non-adoption of the
recommendations and provide alternative approaches, satisfactory to the Bank

4.      Preparation and implementation of a comprehensive exposure and training plan
for NHAI staff including twining arrangements with agencies/institutions of repute
abroad.

5.   Support to populate and update the existing Road Information System (RIS) of
NHAI

B. Actions to address program level implementation challenges

6.     Design Improvements

(i)    Technical assistance (TA) by a team of international experts to assist NHAI in
       establishing and operationalizing the Design Review Cell for 2 years
       Implementation of the recommendations of the TA consultant for establishing the
       Design Review Cell

(ii)   Pilot program on 2000 km Kolkata-Mumbai corridor to create database of
       national highway land assets utilizing latest survey technologies and data
       verification techniques.

7.     Performance Evaluation of Consultants, Contractors and Concessionaires

(i)    Services of an independent agency for developing and implementing the
       performance evaluation system (US$ 250,000).

8.     Project Preparation Manual
        Currently, the quality of outputs of consulting firms (including design and
supervision) engaged in project preparation and implementation has been varying
significantly. To ensure more consistent and quality preparation and implementation of
projects, the NHAI intention is to develop industry best-practice guidance, in the form a
manual for project preparation and implementation which could be adopted nationally.

9.    Third Party Quality Audit: Improve overall accountability for the quality of
highways delivered by

(i)    strengthening the system of Third party quality                 audit   of   NHAI
       contracts/concessions by specialized technical experts.

10.    Nation-wide Tolling Strategy and interoperability of toll collection systems
        Tolls are an important revenue stream for NHAI/NHDP. This revenue accrues
through two broad routes: (a) revenue share in case of viable BOT-Toll projects; and (b)
direct tolls, if any, collected from of BOT-Annuity and "Engineer Procure Construct
(EPC)" projects. At present, many stretches of NHAI projects are being tolled using a
variety of systems/technologies and contracting/management arrangements, thereby
making it difficult for NHAI to efficiently garner its due share of revenue from tolls.
Also, frequent and multiple stoppages at toll booths increases costs for the road users in
terms of idle time, transaction costs and inconvenience. Yet another area of concern is the
inadequate capacity and underdevelopment of the tolling industry, which is evident in the
dearth of professionally-managed tolling companies. Keeping these in view, NHAI
wants to develop an integrated, nation-wide strategy to achieve more efficient and
uniform collection of tolls.

11.    Assistance on the proposed Express Way Authority and Advisory Assistance
in structuring selected Mega Projects
        NHAI has identified a few mega projects (including four expressways) to be
structured following the PPP model. In comparison to the other projects of NHAI, these
will be of larger size (of, say, 500 km contiguous stretches) and, hence, are expected to
pose a new set or magnitude of challenges and risks in project preparation, structuring
and contracting. Accordingly, NHAI would like to avail assistance of technical, financial
and legal experts who have had the experience of structuring similar projects, to guide
and advise them in the development of these projects. The primary role of these experts,
is to augment NHAIs capacity to better define and manage the scope of work of
consulting firms who would be engaged by NHAI for addressing various critical aspects
of the project development, viz., project design, preparation of feasibility reports,
financial analysis, risk appraisal, project structuring, contract documents, bid-
management including process design, evaluation and awarding.


12.    Improvement of Environmental and Social Safeguards Management

(i)    Adopt an uniform system of environmental and social safeguards acceptable to
       the financial institutions public, private, bilateral or multilateral, expected to
       finance NHAI programs, and build a capable institutional structure to implement
       those;
(ii)   Strengthen in-house capacity, mainly qualified staffing, for social and
       environmental management administration in-line with the growing demands of
       NHAI programs.
