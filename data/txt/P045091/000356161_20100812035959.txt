F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main objective of this project is to build up Rwanda's human resources and
institutional capacity to deliver education services following the 1994 genocide, with
attention to the poorest members and regions of the country. Specific actions are geared
to: (i) improve access to basic education by increasing its intake capacity through
community participation in rehabilitating, constructing and equipping schools; (ii)
improve the quality of inputs (teaching, instructional materials, methods of supervision)in
primary and secondary education; (iii) heighten awareness and train students, parents and
educators to combat the AIDS epidemic; (iv) build institutional capacity and improve
efficiency in the management of the education system through focused training, studies
and policy development, and initiation of a Sector-Wide Investment Program.

  Note: The above are consistent with the objectives agreed at negotiations but were
reformulated for clarity in October 2004 by the Government and Bank teams (ref. letter
from Rwanda Finance Minister to IDA on October 18, 2004, regarding expenditures for
the second half of the project; see following sections of this PSR.)

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal


  1. By the turn of the millennium, Rwanda was only beginning to recover from the human and economic
     devastation caused by the war and genocide of 1994. After its military victory in 1994, the Rwandese
     Patriotic Front (RPF) established a coalition government which was faced with ominous internal and
     regional security issues. By late 2006/early 2007, there was a massive repatriation of Rwandese exiles
     from neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and the then Zaire.

  2. At the time of project preparation in 1999/2000, Paul Kagame had just become President of the Republic
     of Rwanda , the internal security situation had dramatically improved and the focus had shifted towards
     promoting National reconciliation and economic growth.

  3. Despite the untold havoc caused by the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan education system was recovering
     extremely well, at least in quantitative terms, by early 2000. There was a government-wide effort to
     improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures and within the education sector, to
     improve donor coordination and support through a broader Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp). Funding
     for the social sectors became more of a priority after the genocide and by 2001, public expenditure on
     education was approximately 5.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in addition to increased donor
     aid. Only five years after the genocide, the number of children in primary school had already surpassed
     the number that would have been enrolled had the system expanded at historical rates of increase. By
     2000, the gross enrollment ratio for primary school was 104 percent which exceeded the corresponding
     ratio for the average low-income countries in Africa at the time.

  4. The challenges for the education sector and the entire Rwandan economy were immense and the
     government was faced with the colossal task of rebuilding the social and economic fabric of the country
     at the time of project preparation. The central theme in the government's agenda was nation-building
     which sought to engage communities and social networks to build an environment of partnership. The
     needs were diverse, ranging from infrastructural development to reintegration of vulnerable groups such
     as female heads of household, unaccompanied children, orphans, out-of-school youth, internally
     displaced people and returnees. The education sector had firmly moved into a development stage with a
     focus on increasing coverage and quality of education, particularly for the poorest and most isolated
     children as well as improving the education system management.

  5. Building on the experience of the First Education Sector Project (FESP), the Human Resource
     Development Project (HRDP) was conceived as a bridging operation between the first project which
     closed in September 1999 and a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) for the education sector which was to
     be developed by 2003/04.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
  6. The main objective of the project was to assist Rwanda in its effort to develop and implement a sustained
     program of capacity building through education and skills development in order to redress human
     resources deficiencies and develop a critical mass of trained human resources. Specific actions were
     geared towards: (i) increasing access to primary and secondary education through the involvement of
     local communities in school rehabilitation and construction; (ii) improving the quality of primary and
     secondary education; (iii) heightening awareness of HIV/AIDS and promoting behavioral change



                                                   1
      prevention strategies among children and youth; (iv) building capacity within the education sector and
      the overall economy including support for the provision of focused training in key areas; and (v)
      undertaking analytical work and experimentation in preparation for a Sector-Wide Investment Program.

  7. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as per Annex 1 in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) are
     shown in Table 1. There was no reference to the KPIs within the Development Credit Agreement
     (DCA) and it should be noted that this was not a requirement at the time the DCA was signed.

    PDO Indicators
 1.       Transition rate from primary to secondary education increased from 35% to at least 50% by
          the end of the Project.
 2.       The success rate in the national examination at the end of primary education to increase from 40%
          to at least 70% by the end of the Project.
 3.       The qualification level of the teaching corps to increase by the end of the Project from:
 -        49% to 65% by the end of the Project at the primary level;
 -        6% to 52% at the secondary level.
 -        5% of professors with doctorates at the tertiary level to at least double

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
8. The PDO did not change during project implementation. However, the objectives agreed at negotiations
were reformulated for clarity in October 2004 by the government in collaboration with the Bank team. The
wording of the PDO in the PAD lacked clarity and precision which made it more difficult to track effectively.
This new wording of the PDO, which was the same as the old PDO in terms of intent, was reflected in the
December 2004 Implementation Supervision Report (ISR). The principal difference is that the clarified PDO
sought to; (a) target of the poorest members and regions of the country; (b) focus on improving the quality of
education inputs rather than broadly addressing the quality of the primary and secondary education; (c) focus
on building capacity within the education system rather than the economy as a whole.

9. The main objective of this project was to build Rwanda's human resources and institutional capacity to
deliver education services following the 1994 genocide, with attention to the poorest members and regions of
the country. Specific actions were to: (i) improve access to basic education by increasing its intake capacity
through community participation in rehabilitating, constructing and equipping schools; (ii) improve the quality
of inputs (teaching, instructional materials, methods of supervision)in primary and secondary education; (iii)
heighten awareness and train students, parents and educators to combat the AIDS epidemic; (iv) build
institutional capacity and improve efficiency in the management of the education system through focused
training, studies and policy development, and initiation of a Sector-Wide Investment Program.

10. The ICR will focus on achievements related to "clarified" PDO as it was used for most of the Project
period.

11. The key performance indicators were revised and refined through the course of the Project and there are
different iterations of the KPIs within the ISRs (see Annex 11). There were two main turning points with
respect to the KPIs; one was in October 2003 when MINEDUC held a workshop to review project indicators
and build consensus on what indicators to track for the remainder of the Project. The workshop participants
were able to document more detailed indicators based on two years of implementation experience, particularly
with respect to HIV/AIDS, the capacity building program, studies and development of the SWAp.

12. The more strategic revision of the KPIs was reflected within the second extension of the Project in May
2008 and in what constituted a second order restructuring, when the Project Results Framework was updated
and refined as per the table below. The revised KPIs included some of the Bank's core indicators for the
education sector. However, given that almost 85% of project funds were disbursed by the time the project was
restructured, this ICR focuses on achievement of the original KPIs with some discussion of achievement of the
core indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
13. The primary beneficiaries were students; teachers; parents and community groups; non-governmental
organization (NGOs); Ministry of the Education, educational institutions; local governments and employers.
Clearly, stakeholders within the education system directly benefited from the implementation of the Project
through increased access to educational infrastructure; improved quality through capacity-building of teachers,
parents, inspectors, and education sector managers; textbook provision; improved knowledge of HIV/AIDS;
and more efficient resource allocation within the sector through the SWAp.

14. The benefits of the Project extended beyond the education system to include local governments and the
private sector who were involved through local level contracting of civil works activities.

15. Though the project was supposed to target the poorest members and regions of the country, no data was
collected to assess whether the poor were indeed reached through the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

I. Community Based School Rehabilitation and Development Program (CSRDP) (US$ 8.48 million), the
main objective of which was to support local community initiatives and demand-driven sub-projects such as
the rehabilitation of classrooms, the provision of equipment, and the construction of new schools. This
component was designed building off the success of the Community Reintegration and Development Project
(CRDP), a US$5million project approved in 1998, which sought to introduce an innovative implementation
mechanism to nurture partnership between communities and the communal administration as well as the
decentralize planning, project cycle and financial management to the community level.

II. School Quality Improvement Program (US$ 17.17 million), which sought to raise the quality of
education by improving the quality of inputs to the education system with specific focus on (a) teachers
training; (b) textbooks and pedagogical materials; (c) curriculum development; (d) strengthening the
examination/assessment system; and (e) improving the quality of teaching in science and technology (S&T).

III. HIV/AIDS (US $3.31 million) prevention and education was to protect children and youth ( both in
school and out of school) and teaching staff from the AIDS epidemic. Activities within this component


                                                   4
included: (a) sensitization activities including seminars and conferences education officials and local
authorities, class instruction for students and anti-AIDS clubs; (b) curriculum development and teacher
training on HIV/AIDS and life skills from primary school through university; (c) culturally-sensitive
materials production and dissemination through radio, theatre, music and art; (d) strengthening AIDS program
management by MINEDUC; and (e) providing quality counseling, caring and testing to assist students and
teachers infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.

IV. Capacity Building Program, Studies and Development of a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp)
(US$ 6.64 million), which aimed to: (a) strengthen capacities for educational management and planning; (b)
reinforcing the system of decentralization and general inspectorate; (c) focused training and staff development
in key tertiary institutions; and (d) undertaking strategic studies which would facilitate the development of the
SWAp.

V. Project Technical Support, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.47 million) which supported capital
and operating expenditures of the Education Project Office (EPO) to effectively carry out its coordination and
monitoring responsibilities.

1.6 Revised Components
16. Whereas the components themselves were never formally amended, there were two modifications to the
Project documented in the project extensions and reallocation of credit proceeds in June 2006 and May 2008.
The first modification was introduced by the government in 2006. The modification was for the construction
of the Forum for African Women Educationists (FAWE) girls' secondary school for a total projected cost of
US$ 1.4 million (4percent of project costs), which sought to focus on improving science and technology
education for girls.

17. This activity did not fit within component 1 that focused on community-initiated construction, nor did it fit
within the component 2, which included the extension and rehabilitation of six science and technology centers.
This was a new activity that expanded the scope of the project beyond its existing components. The Credit
Agreement was not amended to explicitly include the FAWE School. However, the Agreement did require the
appraisal of the construction of the FAWE School, including the consideration of appropriate environmental
and social management, as a condition of the extension. There is no Bank documentation on why the FAWE
School was added to the Project.

18. The second modification was related to the HIV/AIDS component. The government and the Bank decided
to focus on awareness-raising, rather than a larger agenda of prevention and treatment. This change was first
documented in the April 2006 aide-memoire, though formal agreement from management on the change and
related KPIs was only approved in the 2008 extension. The narrowing of focus within the HIV/AIDS
component was a response to new interventions provided by donors and partners that focused on treatment and
care of infected and affected persons and insufficient capacity at the EPO and MINEDUC to implement the
component effectively.


1.7 Other significant changes
19. The Project was extended three times from June 30, 2006 through the final closing date of December 31,
2009.

20. The first Project extension and restructuring was in June 2006. This extended the Project by two years
through the end of June 2008. The restructuring reallocated funds towards civil works, consultancies,
strengthening monitoring and evaluation and operating costs as well as added an appraisal for the construction




                                                     5
of the FAWE school to the Project. It should be noted that the scaling down of the HIV/AIDS component,
which was initiated after the April 2006 supervision mission, was not addressed in this extension/restructuring.

21. The second extension was in May 2008 to (i) extend the closing date of the Project by 12 months through
end June 2009 in order to complete the construction of the FAWE school as well as; (ii) reallocate funds from
civil works activities (given many subprojects were approved at lower cost) and from savings in operating
costs towards the acquisition of textbooks in mathematics, social sciences and the English language and (iii)
update and refine the Project Results Framework to provide greater focus on the outcomes of the Project, i.e.
amending indicators for HIV/AIDS in line with scaling down activities within the HIV/AIDS component and
including the Bank's core indicators for the education sector.

22. The third and final extension was in June 2009, taking the Project through to completion in December
2009. The extension was to facilitate a resettlement audit to assess whether the individuals affected by the
construction of the Forum for African Women's Educationalists (FAWE) secondary school for girls were
adequately compensated; and the completion of the construction FAWE school.

23. There were four funding reallocations, three corresponding with the extensions mentioned above and one
in February 2005. Lastly, an amount of US$ 1.56 million was cancelled from the Credit for misprocurement of
goods in December 2005.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
24. At the time of project preparation in 1999/2000, Rwanda was viewed as a special case for assistance to
overcome the legacy of the genocide, with strong support and political commitment within the country.

25. Project preparation took 12 months during 1999/2000 period with a US$ 600,000 Project Preparation
Facility (PPF). In the view of senior MINEDUC officials, the HRDP preparation was a more consultative
process compared to previous Bank funded projects because it was led by the Government of Rwanda ensuring
a sense of Project ownership. In addition to working closely with representatives from government, the Bank
team consulted widely with NGOs as well as the donor community in forging consensus on the main
objectives of the Project. While the ICR of the FESP pointed to an acute lack of collaboration with partners,
the HRDP include one component focused on the development of a SWAp that consequently encourraged
greater coordination and alignment of donor resources in support of a locally owned comprehensive sector
strategy.

26. The project successfully engaged government and partners in preparation but failed to address other
lessons learned through the FESP, some of which are highlighted below.

27. The mid-term evaluation of late 2003, criticized the HRDP for its complex design and structure and for its
ambitious scope. This was against the backdrop of the recently completed FESP, which was also criticized for
being over-ambitious in scope given the inherent capacity constraints within the country and unrealistic time
frame for implementation. The HRDP would also be extended three times from its original target completion
date and experienced staff shortages much like the FESP. Within the Bank, the Project was faulted for not
being selective and prioritizing needs within the sector by simplifying the components to accommodate the
limited implementation capacity during the post-war/genocide period. It should be noted however, that the
time of preparation the needs of the country were immense and the political pressure to deliver services was
strong. The country context and needs were such that a more streamlined project was not an option for the
government at the time as all aspects of the education sector were in dire straits.



                                                    6
28. Risk identification and mitigation measures. One of the critical risks identified at preparation was the
sustainability of project outputs given the weak resource capacity of government to adequately finance
recurrent costs of facilities established by the project. The previous operation had identified the limited
capacity of communities to maintain new infrastructure and recommended the government and Bank put in
place arrangements to ensure the preservation of new assets, such as instituting trained site inspectors to
supervise construction. However, the HRDP continued to shift the burden of school maintenance back to the
community.

29. While the limited government capacity to implement the program and maintain the integrity of the
approach was identified at preparation, there were insufficient mitigation activities to address this issue. In
addition, the implementation arrangements required the participation of representatives from seven ministries,
donor partners, private sector and civil society who were all part of the oversight committee (which was to
provide overall guidance during implementation). The complexity of involving a range of actors in the
implementation of the project should have been identified as a critical risk during preparation.

30. Project-specific risks such as the availability of qualified private sector contractors to work in remote areas
to support the community-based school rehabilitation program were not addressed even though it was
identified as a concern following the FESP. Further, the procurement assessment of 1999 showed a weakened
construction sector during the war and genocide.

31. The inevitable policy changes following the genocide and the second Congo war, particularly with respect
to decentralization (which was already underway at the time), and its potential impact on the community
construction process, were also overlooked. In particular the consolidation of districts through decentralization
would have an impact on who was responsible for engaging communities within each new jurisdiction. These
issues became critical bottlenecks in the implementation of the first component of HRDP.



2.2 Implementation
32. The five year project was extended three times and took eight and a half years to complete. Though the
project achieved some of its objectives (as outlined in Section 3.2), it faced several constraints in
implementation.

33. The School Quality Improvement and the Capacity Building/SWAp components (2 and 4) began well,
with the civil works activities of various science and technology schools underway within the first year and the
formation of the SWAp mechanism by 2003. In contrast, components 1 and 3 (community based construction
and HIV/AIDS) were slow to start. By the end of the third year, the actual disbursement level was 30 percent,
which was about half of the planned expenditure. The main constraints to implementation are summarized
below.

34. Lack of staff and continuity throughout the project. A critical issue leading to the lag in
implementation was understaffing in both the Education Project Office (EPO) and the World Bank. By mid-
term, the project had only filled three of the required seven managerial/technical positions and did not have a
dedicated procurement officer, social scientist, education or HIV/AIDS specialists. This lack of human
resources, according to the mid-term review, resulted in weak forward planning and slow implementation
which continued to persist through the life of the project.

35. The understaffing within the EPO as well as the lack of capacity below the director level within
MINEDUC was compounded with a lack of adequate support from the World Bank to provide continuity in
policy dialogue and practical backup. During the first five years of the project, there was no education



                                                     7
specialist within the Kigali Bank office and the procurement support was provided by Washington, DC until
2005.

36. In addition, there was high staff turnover within key project positions which potentially had some negative
repercussions in terms of continuity and institutional memory over eight and a half years. From the Bank's
side, there were three task team leaders (TTLs) and from the EPO side, there were three project coordinators
and three chief financial officers (CFOs).

37. Insufficient involvement of MINEDUC in the management of the project: During the first half of the
project, the relationship between the EPO and technical staff within MINEDUC was challenging. Members of
MINEDUC expressed significant ownership through the preparation of the HRDP but did not feel adequately
involved in the management of the project after effectiveness. This was accentuated by geographically
locating the EPO outside the MINEDUC offices until 2008. The lack of ownership and involvement in the
management of the project was further compounded by a largely dormant oversight committee (comprised of
representatives from MINEDUC, other ministries and the EPO), which was supposed to be responsible for
providing overall guidance and oversight during implementation.

38. The disconnect between MINEDUC and the EPO seemed to be resolved with the appointment of the
national coordinator in 2007, who is also the Director for the National Curriculum Center. While the project
lacked a full-time national coordinator, it benefitted from having a MINEDUC staff member to coordinate the
HRDP which increased collaboration with the EPO, and facilitated greater involvement and ownership by the
ministry in managing the project.

39. Insufficient understanding and ownership of the Community School-Based Reintegration and
Development Program (CSRDP): The CSRDP lagged at inception of the HRDP for three main reasons; (i)
insufficient training of beneficiary CDCs and their local governments, (ii) latent mistrust between communities
and the government against the backdrop of the genocide aftermath and (iii) difficulties in raising the 10
percent community contribution. It appears the CSRDP may have been ahead of its time in designing a
component which required close collaboration between communities and government. Communities were still
recovering from the war and the value placed on education by communities was potentially overestimated.
While communities may have been hesitant to work with government, there was little effort made by the EPO
(nor did it have adequate capacity) to train communities on the design and implementation arrangements of
this component, which were detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The PIM itself was never
translated from French to Kinyarwanda, nor was it distributed to stakeholders.

40. The mid-term review in October 2003 noted that CDCs had difficulty in meeting the 10 percent
contribution (cash or in-kind) criterion and that basing project applications on a District Development Plan had
not proved realistic since most districts did not have one. The CSRDP initially stagnated for the reasons
mentioned above, but implementation gained momentum when the EPO started working directly with the
districts rather than targeting the CDCs. Though the districts put forward the 10 percent contribution, there is
little evidence of community involvement in the construction, supervision or management of the schools
beyond the functions of the Parent-Teachers Associations (PTAs).

41. Institutional changes through decentralization: Project implementation was adversely affected by
changes in local government jurisdiction over the course of the project. At project preparation, there were
approximately 150 districts in Rwanda. The decentralization policy led to the consolidation of these districts
by phases to approximately 106 in 2002 and finally, to 30 districts in 2005. This became a huge administrative
burden for the project since contracts with districts for the CSRDP had to be shifted to the newly formed
district entities. While some contract transfers were smoothly executed, other transfers created confusion and
in some cases, led to a temporary void in accountability as some `new' districts were not able to provide
detailed financial reports on advance payments that were made by MINEDUC.


                                                    8
42. As stated previously, the EPO did not provide any training to districts on procurement, financial reporting,
monitoring and evaluation or contracts management. Compounded by the lack of district level capacity, this
resulted in irregular and insufficient reporting by the district to the EPO on the community construction
component. It should be noted that the project never formalized the proposed collaboration between the
Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) and MINEDUC.

43. Delays due to misprocurement: Project activities more or less came to a halt with the detection of
misprocurement in the October 2005 audit and the Post Procurement Review (PPR) of FY06. The EPO
National Coordinator of HRDP was suspended by the Minister in October 2005 and by December 2005 (six
months prior to the original closing date of the Project) an amount of $1.56 million was cancelled from the
Credit for misprocurement of goods for the Teacher Training Centers during the period June 2004 through
May 2005. Project activities only began to resume approximately seven months later in April 2006.

44. Involuntary Resettlement: During the April 2009 supervision mission, the Bank team received verbal
information that 42 people, who used to cultivate the publicly-owned land where the FAWE School was built,
were expropriated for the purpose of the construction. In response to this information the Bank conducted a
resettlement audit. The audit found that the process followed to identify affected persons and determine the
compensation level was, by and large, satisfactory though the cultivators were asked to vacate the land before
the end of the harvest season which contravened the Environmental and Social Management Plan (EMSP).
There were substantial delays in paying compensation to affected persons (details in Section 2.4).

45. The resettlement issue led to further delays and the project was extended for the third and final time in
June 2009.

Changing landscape in the fight against HIV/AIDS:
46. At project preparation in 1999/2000, large-scale international assistance for HIV/AIDS was limited to the
World Bank's Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) but by 2002, the Global Fund to Fight Aids Malaria and
Tuberculosis (GFATM) had become the main financial institution for mobilizing and disbursing funding for
HIV programs and in 2003, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) pledged
US$15million over five years to deliver a comprehensive response to the epidemic. Annual funding for
HIV/AIDS programs in low and middle income countries had increased from US$300 million in 1996 to
US$8.3 billion in 2005.

47. With the increase in global financial support for HIV/AIDS, the EPO and the Bank task team decided to
narrow the focus of component 3 in 2006 to awareness-raising by shifting activities related to counseling,
caring and testing to other partners such as the GFATM, PEPFAR, UNICEF, UNCESCO and the Commission
National de la Lutte contre le SIDA.

48. The HIV/AIDS component had been problematic since inception of the HRDP, with a lack of staff to
direct the program as well as a lack of vision in terms of activities and achievable outputs/outcomes from the
project. This coupled with the changing landscape of HIV/AIDS in terms of funding sources, and new
strategies to deal with the epidemic, created confusion within the project on the roles and responsibilities of the
HRDP in relation to other stakeholders (particularly CNLS and the HIV/AIDS unit within MINEDUC). It also
lacked direction with the absence of a dedicated HIV/AIDS specialist to drive activities in this arena forward.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
49. Data compilation for the Project by the EPO and MINEDUC's Department of Planning was impressive
given the design of the project included over 15 implementing units and the Districts to be responsible for


                                                     9
monitoring project performance. However, the Bank task team repeatedly expressed frustration in the time
taken by MINEDUC to finalize the Project indicators (the Ministry only conducted a workshop to agree on
indicators towards the end of 2003) as well as the poor quality of information on performance outcomes.

50. It should however be noted, that the key performance indicators (KPIs) outlined in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) were not included within the legal agreement of the Credit. As such, the KPIs evolved
during the Project (see Annex 10), but not necessarily in line with changes in the scope of the Project. For
example, the inclusion of the FAWE school were not reflected in the Results Framework nor were the
rehabilitation and construction of six science schools, the faculty of Science at the Kigali Institute of Education
(KIE) and the National Examinations Center captured.

51. The main document used in tracking performance during the early years of the Project was the annual
action plan and while this provided details on each activity and its associated outputs, it did not capture higher
level outcome indicators. Further, focusing on annual plans created an issue of moving targets ­ for example,
the target for the capacity building program which was measured as "an average of at least 20% of planned
trained programs executed every year" would depend on the GoR's training program, which could shift
dramatically from year to year.

52. In contrast, some of the PDO indicators in the Results Framework were broad, sector level indicators
which formed part of the Joint Review of the Education Sector (JRES) in 2006. However many of the sector
level indicators could not be specifically attributed to the Project. For example, the gross and net enrollment
increases were national level data that were affected by other factors beyond the scope of the HRDP, least of
which was the introduction of fee-free primary education in 2003.

53. Some of the indicators were ambiguous such as "proportion of schools with functioning anti-AIDS clubs
by the end of the project, with an approach appropriately targeting girls and boys". For one, it is unclear what
a functioning anti-AIDS club is defined as given that clubs could exist but not have sufficient funds to operate
effectively. Further, the data was not disaggregated by the numbers of girls and boys participating in the clubs.
There were no outcome indicators related to HIV/AIDS awareness such as general knowledge, attitudes and
behavior surveys of students, teachers or parents.

54. Capacity building indicators were output based such as "in-service training provided to 1000 teachers
every other year for the duration of the Project", which tends to miss how the quality of teaching changed due
to skills/knowledge acquired during training. While quality could potentially be measured through increases
in "transition rates" from primary to secondary schools, the challenge here again is attributing the increase to
better quality of teaching through the in-service teacher training program.

55. Though data was captured on a regular basis, it was neither consistent in the type of data being collected,
nor was there a clear link between the PDO indicators and the project. As such, the focus seemed to shift from
outcome towards output indicators, collected by the EPO.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
56. Financial Management: HRDP conformed to most of the identified best financial reporting practices
though the Bank pointed to the poor quality of financial monitoring reports, non operation of the internal audit
function and lack of clear budget systems in various reports. Despite this, the audit opinions through the
project have all expressed that financial statements have been fairly stated.

57. Though the project required the districts to prepare and submit monthly financial statements, this was not
consistently followed. According to the EPO, most districts only sent reports when seeking a replenishment of
funds. However, it should be noted that the districts never received any training on financial management nor



                                                    10
were they given a template specifying the requirements for reporting. Further, there was no evaluation process
in place to determine the reliability and efficiency of districts to manage funds by EPO.

58. One issue that was raised repeatedly by the Bank in its financial management reviews is the lack of backup
or data recovery system of the HRDP's financial information. It appears that this issue was not resolved by the
close of the project.

59. Procurement: The project developed a procurement manual that contained internal procurement
procedures and regulations.

60. The World Bank's Independent Procurement Review (IPR) carried out in Oct 2005 detected 21 contracts
awarded were in violation of World Bank procurement regulations which resulted in US$1.56 million being
cancelled from the Credit. A large contract was fragmented in order to avoid the thresholds for International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) and all awarded to the same supplier without seeking the Bank's non-objection.
The reasons given for the misprocurement were: (i) contract fragmentation to avoid prior review by the World
Bank; (ii) prices were higher than usual and from the same supplier; (iii) international competitive bidding
should have been used for a large consolidated contract; and (iv) non-objection should have been sought from
the Bank.

61. The IPR report put in place an action plan and the Ministry of Finance intervened in the process of
implementing the action plan. There was a person designated from CEPEX to follow the HRDP
implementation and a new national coordinator and procurement officer were hired. A new procurement plan
was prepared with contracts grouped by the procurement and Bank review method. These factors all
contributed to steering the project back on track though the project was still delayed due to several reasons
highlighted in Section 2.2.

62. The Bank repeatedly reported that the EPO lacked sufficient information on file related to several
procurement activities. For example, the asset registry was not frequently updated, though it was eventually
provided.

63. Safeguards: The HRDP was categorized as C under the Environmental Assessment OP 4.10, which did not
require the preparation of an EMSP at the time of project preparation. Even so, the design of schools under the
CSRDP took into account the need to ensure little if not minimal destruction of vegetation cover, landscaping
and re-vegetation, construction of pit latrines and sanitation blocks among others.

64. As part of this ICR, the World Bank undertook an environmental and social management review (see
annex 12) to assess whether the HRDP was in compliance with the World Bank safeguards as per the current
policies and procedures. The review found that the HRDP supported all the CSRDP schools visited with new
sanitary facilities (pit latrines); tap water including portable water in toilets and showers; trees had been
planted all around the school compound and landscaping undertaken, which contributes towards the carbon
sequestration process and reducing soil run off. However, even though the schools visited had sufficient pit
latrines, these were found to be dirty and a potential health risk. Further, the project did not follow the PAD
proposal to construct the schools with hydra form blocks in order to reduce the need for firewood, but used
baked bricks for all schools with the exception of FAWE School. This component of the project does not have
any social concerns in relation to resettlement. Of the 10 schools visited, only 2 of these had to deal with the
issue of resettlement; in both cases, the project affected persons (PAPs) were consulted and duly compensated
in a timely manner.

65. The Bank approved the construction of the FAWE school on condition that an EMSP be submitted, which
was completed in July 2007. In April 2009, the Bank supervision mission aide memoire reported concern that
the construction of the FAWE School was adversely affecting its surrounding community through the


                                                   11
resettlement of persons who were cultivating the public land on which the school was being built. Contrary to
the recommendations of the ESMP, the construction work began before the harvest season leading to clearing
and loss of crops before maturity. The resettlement process (asset inventory, socio-economic survey and
valuation) occurred during November-December 2008 and by January 2009 all the PAPs had vacated the land
for construction work to commence. The resettlement audit (August 2009) found that a total of 42 PAPs were
to be compensated for land lost and crops destroyed as a result of school construction. The ESMP stipulated
that the PAPs be accorded priority in terms of securing jobs in the construction site and it has been ascertained
to be the case by the audit which confirmed that over 75 percent of the 42 PAPs were workers on the site
offering skilled and unskilled labor.

66. While PAPs were eventually compensated (completed on December 12, 2009), the delays in compensation
were in contravention of OP 4.12 which requires that displacement must not occur before all necessary
measures for resettlement are in place. The World Bank recommended an increase in payment amounts by
approximately 2.5 percent of the originally awarded amount to make up for the delay and inappropriate timing
of resettlement, but the government deemed it unnecessary.

67. Apart from the resettlement issues related to the FAWE school project, the HRDP complied with the
Bank's environmental and social safeguards according to the findings of the Bank's assessment. However,
there was limited monitoring of the expropriation process for FAWE. There was no Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) or Resettlement Action Plan (RAPs) but the significant outcome is that the process and
procedures followed by HRDP in spite of the absence of these documents were, to a high degree and quality, in
compliance of environmental and social safeguards.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
68. The establishment of the SWAp in 2003 facilitated the Government of Rwanda's acceptance to the
Education for All ­ Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), when it received US$70 million in the form of an EFA-
FTI Catalytic Fund Grant for 2007 and 2008 and follow-on "bridge grant" for US$35 million. Rwanda intends
to apply in 2010 for a new three-year grant for the period 2010-2012 based on the Education Sector Strategic
Plan for 2010-2015.

69. In addition, the GoR has requested IDA support for a four-year Skills Development Program which aims
to alleviate the current and longer term skills constraints to contribute to Rwanda's transition to a lower-middle
income, export- and service-oriented knowledge economy by 2020.

70. Maintenance of civil works activities related to teacher training colleges and science and technology
schools will be responsibility of MINEDUC, while maintenance of the CSRDP schools will be the
responsibility of the schools. While some maintenance can be financed through the school capitation grants,
the state of some of the pit latrines within schools currently indicates that the grants may be inadequate for the
routine maintenance. Inevitably, partial funding for maintenance and repair will fall back on the communities
and PTAs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the project is substantial because: (i) the objectives of the HRDP were highly relevant to the
post-conflict development priorities of the GoR in terms of capacity building, infrastructural development and
national reconciliation; (ii) the objectives of the project sought to bridge the gap between the former FESP
project and the establishment of the SWAp mechanism; and (iii) the project was consistent with the World




                                                    12
Bank's country assistance strategy for Rwanda. However, implementation was constrained, amongst others,
by limited in-country capacity and complex project design.



3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
71. As stated in section 1.3, the PDO was clarified in 2004 and as such, this section will use this more recent
PDO for assessment. According to Bank's current procedures, this change should have been formally effected
by restructuring the Project but at the time, restructuring was a less common practice and clarification did not
warrant approval from the Regional Vice President or the Board. The clarification of the PDO was
documented in ISRs and was used consistently since 2004.

72. The clarified PDO itself was broad and several of the outcome indicators referred to sector- rather than
project-specific performance. This was not atypical of projects designed during this time, prior to the launch
of the Results Agenda within the Bank, which brought a greater focus on attribution of results to specific
projects. However, in the case of the HRDP, the focus on sector performance had an unintended, positive
outcome, since a major goal of the Project was to develop an education sector-wide approach. Many of the
activities that were originally planned under the HRDP were delivered by other partners or through the
Education For All-Fast Track Initiative Grant (see section 3.2 (iv) for more details). The conundrum is that
although most of the KPIs were met (and some surpassed), the PDO and its associated indicators were too
broad to attribute success to the Project. Furthermore, sector integration and partner harmonization was
precisely one of the goals of the Project.

73. Consequently, this assessment of the project's achievements also examines the explicit objectives of the
project components. While this section does track achievement of the PDO indicators, it rates the project on
the basis of the intermediate/output indicators of the four components, which can be evidenced through a
results chain back to the Project. In cases where outputs/outcomes measured by the intermediate/output
indicators were funded by other donors, it is specifically mentioned.

74. In addition, performance is assessed based on the indicators established in 2003, as well as the revised
ones. However, the 2003 set of indicators are privileged in this analysis, since the project was only
restructured in 2008 when more than 85% of funds were disbursed.

75. PDO: Build Rwanda's human resources and institutional capacity to deliver education services
following the 1994 genocide, with attention to the poorest members and regions of the country.
Original KPIs: Transition rate from primary to secondary education; Success rate in the national examination
at the end of primary education; Qualification level of teaching corps

76. Transition rates from primary to secondary education increased from 37% at the beginning of the Project
to 55% by the end (the target was 50%). However, the success rate for the national examination which at the
beginning of the Project was 40% did not reach its target of 70% (52.5% by the end of the Project). Both
outcomes could possibly be linked to the introduction of the fee-free nine year-basic education policy in 2007.
Prior to this, primary school constituted 6 years followed by 3 years lower and 2 years upper secondary school.
This could be one reason why there was a big increase in transition rates as lower secondary schools became
free of school fees. Similarly, the fee-free policy increased participation of children from the poorest
households with more intense learning difficulties, and this is perhaps one of the reasons for the tempered
increase in the success rate of the national examination.

 % of Qualified Teachers                Baseline (2001)        End of Project (2008)            Target
               Primary                       49%                            99%                  65%
              Secondary                      26%                            36%                  52%
               Tertiary                       5%                            18%                  10%

77. Rwanda has seen a phenomenal increase in qualified primary school teachers over the last decade, with
close to 100% of its staff qualified by the end 2008. Further, the percentage of qualified tertiary level teachers
(18%) far exceeded the target of 10% The underachievement in terms of the target for qualified secondary
school teachers is not surprising for several reasons such as poor incentives in the teaching profession and the
lack of continuous professional development amongst others (further details in Section 4).

Revised KPIs, 2008: (NEW) Gross and net enrollment rates as a consequence of the Project;
78. Gross and Net Enrollment Rates (GER and NER) for the country increased during the project period
(Baseline GER: 103.7 percent and NER: 74.5 percent to end of Project GER: 127.9 percent and NER 94.2
percent), though the project's contribution to this increase is not possible to quantify. One factor which could
have potentially led to this increase was the implementation of the fee-free primary education policy in 2003,
when school fees were abolished and replaced by school capitation grants. The fee-free policy was extended
to nine years of basic education in 2007, following the adoption of the Nine-Year Basic Education Policy in
2006.

79. It should be noted that there were no indictors to effectively track whether the poorest members and
regions of the country benefitted from the project. Annex 11 shows that all provinces in Rwanda were reached
through the CSRDP with the least number of sub-projects in Kigali City, which is the wealthiest of the
provinces. Most of the sub-projects were located in Eastern and Western provinces, which were sites of the
conflict for several years. However, it is unclear if the distribution of sub-projects within provinces targeted
the poorest communities, since the poverty data available through the "Enquête Intégrale sur les Conditions de
Vie des ménages de Rwanda, 2005/06" survey is grouped by the old districts prior to the decentralization
process. As described in Section 2.2, the requirement that districts submit District Development Plans in
addition to a 10% contribution towards the sub-projects may have limited the participation of the poorest
districts in this program. In the absence of specific indicators and a clear definition of the `poorest members of
the country', it is difficult to determine whether this aspect of the PDO was achieved.


(i) Component 1: Improve access to basic education by increasing its intake capacity through
community participation in rehabilitating, constructing and equipping schools (US$ 7.68m disbursed)
Original Intermediate/Output Indicator: At least ten sub-projects planned and executed by local communities every year
(total of 50).

80. Achievement of this Component Objective is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Civil works activities were
initiated in 124 schools (with an initial target of 50), with 89 percent of site construction completed and 11
percent incomplete (see Annex 11). 765 classrooms, 172 latrine blocks, 111 administrative offices, 6
laboratories and one library have been completed through the project. There were 2,093 primary schools in
Rwanda according to MINEDUC's 1999-2000 School Census1 and this number increased to 2,432 by 20082.
The share of schools supported through the HRDP is about 6 percent of the national total in 2000.

81. The results indicate that targets in terms of sub-projects/schools to be built (target was 50, and
achievement 125) were exceeded. However, the design of the project (per the Project Implementation Manual)
was more in line with building the capacity of communities to rehabilitate, construct and equip schools, which
as explained in section 2.2, was not achieved given the lack of capacity of the EPO to train communities and
the lack of ownership by communities to focus on education in the post-genocide period. Instead, the
government worked through the districts to facilitate the construction of the schools. There was no evidence of
involvement of Community Development Committees (CDCs) and it is unclear whether the districts
themselves necessarily had the capacity to engage effectively with the communities.

82. In the absence of adequate capacity at the EPO level, it devolved responsibility for this component to the
districts, though the districts were not given training nor was there evidence that they received the
implementation manual for the CSRDP. The districts were therefore not only responsible for preparing district
development plans that incorporated the education sub-projects, but had to monitor the projects both
technically and financially as well as contribute 10 percent of the total value of each sub-project. The huge
burden placed on the districts presumably meant that the better-off districts with relatively more capacity, were
able to access the funds compared to poorer districts.

83. The quality of the civil works construction under the CSRDP was variable across schools as per the
findings of the PER, 20093. For the most part, the PER found the quality of construction to be good, but in a
few cases it noted classrooms had no ceilings, interior walls were not plastered and fences not installed. The
variability of quality is presumably tied to the capacity of districts to supervise contractors. Most of the civil
works activities that were not completed (11 percent of the total) were as a result of the contractor abandoning
the project due to disagreements with the districts, arising from the re-organization through the decentralization
process.

Revised KPIs, 2008: (NEW- core indicators) Additional number of pupils due to additional classroom
construction of HRDP; Classrooms built and/or rehabilitated;
84. Given 765 classrooms were built through the HRDP and assuming 71 students per classroom (average
classroom size for basic education according to the forthcoming CSR, 2010), there were approximately 54,000
pupils within HRDP financed classrooms. However, in the absence of baseline data, it is difficult to get a
precise measure of additional pupils as a result of the new classrooms. Since several of the classrooms were
not new, but rather rehabilitated (and in some cases, taught outside under a tree), the students were potentially
already enrolled within that school.

(ii) Component 2: Improve the quality of inputs (teaching, instructional materials, methods of
supervision) in primary and secondary education (US$13.09m disbursed)
Original Intermediate/Output Indicators: In-service training provided to 1000 teachers every other year for the duration
of the Project; Primary pupil/textbook ratio of 2:1 in mathematics and one teacher's guide per teacher; 45 technical
personnel trained and able to evaluate examination results every year; Science and Technology taught at primary level by
end of project

85. Achievement of this component objective is rated moderately satisfactory. The project trained a total of
10,920 primary and secondary school teachers far exceeding its end-of-project target of 5,000. (1,264 primary
school teachers were trained in teaching methodology, sciences and elementary technology and mathematics;
424 lower secondary school teachers and 172 upper secondary school teachers were trained in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology and teaching methodology financed through the HRDP.) A further 9,000 primary
school teachers received training in French and English languages. The HRDP funded the recruitment of 50

specialist teachers from Kenya in 2005 to assist in teaching science and technology in secondary schools
through Rwanda. Though the targets for in-service teacher training were exceeded, there were no assessments
on how the training contributed towards the overall improvement in the quality of teaching.

86. Despite some constraints in the initial procurement process for textbooks in 2006, Primary school
textbooks for mathematics (2.7 million), social studies (378,000) and English (378,000) were purchased and
distributed by the end of May 2009. This accomplishment has contributed to achieving the desired increases in
pupil to textbook ratios for Rwanda's pupils, particularly in the area of mathematics, where the ratio is now 1:1,
outperforming the original target of 2:1.

87. The Rwanda National Examinations Council (RNEC) manages examinations for primary and secondary
schools. By the end of the Project, RNEC had a trained staff contingent of 504, exceeding the target of 45.
Over 80 percent of staff has varying levels of university education. In addition, RNEC appears to be well
managed: (i) in 2008 there was no leakage of examination items; and (ii) in 2006 RNEC won the United
Nations Public Service Award in the category of "improving transparency, accountability and responsiveness."
Though the HRDP did not specifically fund the training of RNEC staff, it funded the construction of the RNEC
Center in Kigali.

88. In the course of 2009, the mandate of addressing science and technology in schools was transferred from
the Ministry of Science, Technology and Scientific Research (MINISTR) to MINEDUC. This transfer came at
a time when the Cabinet was discussing proposals to strengthen the institutional framework for the
implementation of the Government's Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy. The HRDP did not
support this aspect of the Government's program given the African Development Bank agreed with
MINEDUC to provide further support for teaching of science in schools5.

Revised Intermediate/Output Indicator: (NEW) Education facilities built and/or rehabilitated (units);
89. The complete list of achievements for this component are reflected in Annex 2, but amongst them are the
extension of the faculty of science at KIE (graduates of KIE teach in secondary schools and teacher training
colleges, which will enable the training of more primary school teachers.); rehabilitation of six teacher training
centers (TTCs) and six science schools; construction of the FAWE school; construction of the Rwanda
National Examinations Council; construction of the Kigali Health Institute Laboratories, as well as the
provision of equipment and furniture for some of these institutions.

(iii) Component 3: Heighten awareness and train students, parents and educators to combat the AIDS
epidemic (US$ 1.81 disbursed)
Original Intermediate/Output Indicators: HIV/AIDS related teaching, learning and informational materials available
and used in all schools; At least 70% of schools with functioning anti-AIDS clubs with an approach appropriately
targeting girls and boys; Decline in teenage pregnancy rate (as a proxy for an increase in condom use); All known pupils,
students and teachers infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS offered information on the nearest testing, counseling and
support activities

90. Achievement of this component objective is rated unsatisfactory. Progress within this component was
slow given the lack of a dedicated HIV/AIDS Specialist within the EPO except for the period 2005-2007.

91. One indicator for this component was the existence of functioning anti-AIDS clubs within 70 percent of
schools, though as described in section 2.2, the indicator itself is rather ambiguous. A recent evaluation (2009)
of the anti-AIDS clubs found that they existed in 90 percent of schools, but 93 percent had no source of
funding, office space, materials or equipment. In the absence of these, it is hard to see how these clubs are
`functional' beyond having a name and potentially, some members.

92. The HRDP purchased and distributed of 6,000 radios to the schools (to facilitate mass media
communication of the topic of HIV/AIDS), which given there were 2,432 primary and 689 secondary schools
n Rwanda in 2008, would mean that each school got close to 2 radios each. However, the recent Performance
Evaluation Review of the HRDP found that in some schools there was no evidence of the radios and in others,
they were either broken or not used. This was the same finding of the World Bank ICR mission which also
found no evidence of printed materials on HIV/AIDS within the schools.

93. The difficulties experienced under this component were accentuated by the lack of formal collaboration
with other ministries (particularly the CNLS) given the nonfunctional oversight committee. There also
appeared to be some level of inertia by the EPO management to move forward with this component (as
evidenced by the gradual scaling down of the component through the life of the project), given there was no in-
house HIV/AIDS specialist for several years to strategically guide them on how to address the issue within
schools and its surrounding communities effectively. MINEDUC has not had an HIV/AIDS specialist to run
its health in schools unit since the departure of the last specialist in 2008.

Revised Intermediate/Output Indicator: (NEW) AIDS prevention program integrated into curricula, school manuals and
activities
94. The HIV/AIDS lifeskills program was integrated into the standard primary school curriculum, and thus
this indicator was met. However, the corresponding activity was not directly funded through the HRDP.


(iv) Component 4: Build institutional capacity and improve efficiency in the management of the
education system through focused training, studies and policy development, and initiation of a Sector-
Wide Investment Program (US$ 9.66 disbursed)
Original Intermediate/Output Indicator: Gender-sensitive education policy framework formulated; An average of atleast
20% of planned training programs executed every year; Sector-Wide Investment prepared and adopted and
implementation initiated; Report of project studies prepared, approved and adopted by MINEDUC

95. Achievement of this component objective is rated moderately satisfactory. The Education Ministry is
acclaimed in Rwanda as the first to have moved to sector-wide planning using indicators commonly agreed
with all donors. Rwanda established a sector wide approach (SWAp) in education in 2003 and several
development partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Rwanda in
2006 to provide sector budget support for implementation of the Education Strategic Sector Plan (ESSP)
through government systems. Though the education sector continues to display commitment to the SWAp, it
is not clear how the HRDP itself directly contributed towards its development.

96. Sector Budget Support (SBS)6 increased substantially in 2006 (from 60 percent in 2007, to 90 percent in
2008 i ) after agreement on the Joint Education Sector Support (JESS) program, which included the
development of an education capacity building pooled fund. This combined with the establishment of the

    The education sector in Rwanda receives three types of aid which can be categorized as sector budget support, or hybrid
  approaches which show some characteristics of sector budget support: (1) un-earmarked general budget support (GBS)
  programs with a specific education window; (2) sector budget support (SBS) programs notionally earmarked as additional
  resources to the education sector; and (3) earmarked support to the education capacity building pooled fund through earmarked budget
  support.



                                                                    17
SWAp facilitated the Government of Rwanda's acceptance to the Education for All ­ Fast Track Initiative
(EFA-FTI), when it received US$70 million in the form of an EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund Grant for 2007 and
2008 and follow-on "bridge grant" for US$35 million.

97. The PAD indicated that the HRDP would finance several studies ranging from costs and financing of
higher education to a training needs assessment in order to develop the analytical basis for the ESSP. Only one
study on costs and financing of the education sector was financed through the HRDP while other donors, such
as DFID, undertook other studies. In the end, the analytical basis for the development of the ESSP was the
education Country Status Report for Rwanda in 2003 funded through the Education Program Development
Fund (EPDF) and administered by the World Bank. Given this, there was perhaps no need for the HRDP to
allocate resources towards research but the Project was never adequately restructured to reflect downsizing of
this PDO.

98. The Girls' Education Policy, which particularly addresses girls' participation and achievement at
secondary levels, was ratified by Cabinet in 2008. The ratification of this policy constituted one of the prior
actions for (DPO) the 2008 EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund Bridge Grant, which was a Development Policy
Operation.

Revised Intermediate/Output Indicators: (NEW) Regional offices for school inspectorate established and operational;
Focused training and management capacity within the education system
99. Training was provided for 123 school inspectors in addition to constructing and equipping the country's
six existing regional Inspectorate offices in order to improve decentralized teacher management and
supervision.

100.      The HRDP made a significant contribution towards improving institutional capacity to efficiently
manage the education system by providing scholarships for lecturers from various educational institutions.
The project financed 119 lecturers to undertake a Masters degree and 15 to undertake PhDs as shown in the
table below. The Performance Evaluation Review traced the whereabouts of 87 of these Masters and 6 PhD
staff. About 4 percent did not return to Rwanda after their studies abroad; 33 percent returned to their
respective institutions; 24 percent returned to their institutions but are pursuing further studies (indicating a
drive for professional advancement); but more worrying is that close to 40 percent of the staff left the
education sector after their studies. This issue is explored further in Section 4, Risk to Development Outcome.

into the education budget in 2007 and 2008 resulted in a marked increase of resources from 2006.

103.       Despite the abolition of school fees at the primary level in 2003, the amount invested by households
at this level still remains high compared to 2000 (22 percent against 19 percent). However, it has allowed
almost universal access to primary education in Rwanda. The probability for a generation to access primary
education was estimated at 96 percent in 2006 which represents a substantial improvement since 2000 when
the entry rate to primary 1 was estimated at 88 percent (DHS 2000, CSR 2003). The abolition of school fees
allowed children from the poorest households to join school and thus increased the number of children with
more learning difficulties and at risk of dropping out. This potentially affected the internal efficiency
coefficient (IEC) at primary level which dropped from 56 percent in 2002/03 to 39 percent in 2008, implying
that 61 percent of public resources are used for repeated years or for school years of students who drop out
before completing the cycle.

104.      Data show that gender parity has not been an issue at the primary level through the life of the HRDP,
with 51 percent of girls enrolled in 2008 and 50 percent in 2000/01. In terms of income group disparities,
GERs increase with the level of income and that discrepancy across income groups grows as one progresses up
the education ladder. Improvements were registered at the primary level with the wealth parity index
improving from 0.78 in 2000 to 0.87 in 2006. However, the challenge of retaining the poorest students in
primary schools and ensuring their transition to post-primary cycles persists.

105.      At the project level, most of the Intermediate/Output Indicators were met in 8.5 years, three and half
years longer than expected. In some cases (such as teacher-training and the CSRDP), targets were met even
before the end of the original five years allocated to the project. Though the project was extended three times,
there was no additional financing allocated to achieve the original targets. The targets were not revised during
the course of the project and most of them were surpassed at project close.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
106.       As mentioned above, the PDO of the project was highly relevant to the development priorities of the
GoR and overall most of the KPIs were achieved, though it is difficult to attribute achievements directly to the
HRDP in some cases. However, progress towards the KPIs (and thus the PDO), as defined in the results
agreement could not be attributed to the activities financed under the project. Consequently, the project is
assessed on the basis of the Intermediate/Output Indicators of the components. On that basis, overall outcome
rating is moderately unsatisfactory based on substantial relevance and an average of moderately
unsatisfactory performance towards the component objectives (Component 1: MU, Component 2: MS,
Component 3: U, Component 4: MS). Considering that the funding for Components 2 and 4 combined was
over 68% of the total project costs and since its ratings were both moderately satisfactory, the overall outcome
rating is pulled down to moderately unsatisfactory due to the moderately unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory
ratings of the CSRDP and the HIV/AIDS components respectively.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
107.       The Community Based Rehabilitation Program was operational is all 30 districts in Rwanda. The
districts themselves decided on which schools would be targeted based on the needs of their respective
communities. The assumption is that resources were allocated in a pro-poor manner to communities with
inadequate access to education services. Clearly, the addition of sanitation facilities (172 pit latrines) within
the schools contributes towards the well-being of students.



                                                   19
108.      Regarding enrollment of girls, data show that gender parity has not been an issue at the pre-primary
and primary levels, with 51 percent of girls enrolled in 2008 and this proportion remaining quite stable over the
last decade7. Disparities according to geographical location are apparent with sixty rural students are enrolled
against every 100 urban students at the end of primary. The HRDP sought to address this by targeting the
Community Schools Program within rural areas.

109.     Though the PAD indicated that the component 1 would help allocate and channel funds to poor
communities, it is unclear how many communities actually benefited from either designing the projects
themselves or how many were remunerated for services rendered during the civil works construction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The partnership principles and the Joint Education Sector Support (JESS) program provided a framework
which gave donors confidence to move to sector budget support in a harmonized way. The establishment of
the annual Joint Review of the Education Sector (JRES) also addressed an important gap in the monitoring of
sector performance and contributed to increased trust and transparency. These structures have provided the
institutionalized basis for the SWAp mechanism which continues to function as evidenced by: (i) the
development of the revised Country Status Report for education (forthcoming, 2010); (ii) ESSP (2010-2015);
and (iii) the Long-Term Strategy and Financial Framework (2008-2012) through collaborative consultation
between the Government of Rwanda and development partners.

110.       While the HRDP may not have been successful in building the capacity of communities to develop
initiatives in the area of school rehabilitation and development, it perhaps planted the seed for effectively
involving communities in education infrastructure development. By the end of January 2010, the GoR
announced the completion of construction of 3,172 classrooms and over 10,000 pit latrines in four months
through a community driven process. The school construction program cost the government RwFr9.9 billion
as opposed to over RwFr35billion if it had gone through the regular tendering process (see annex 13).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

111.       The assessment of the risk to development outcomes is moderate because: (i) there continues to be
strong commitment from the GoR to building human resources and institutional capacity for education
services; (ii) the SWAp mechanism continues to operate in Rwanda with the ESSP built upon strong analytical
base of the Country Status Reports; (iii) the quality of construction under component 2 is good and the
buildings continue to be maintained by MINEDUC; and (iv) the engagement of communities to participate in
schools rehabilitation/construction has been strengthened through the GoR's recent program.

112.       The main risk to the development outcome is with regards to the maintenance and repair of the
school construction. Aside from the Capitation Grant, there are no arrangements in place for maintenance and
repairs of the schools. Some of the schools already show signs of the poor maintenance as ascertained through
the environmental and social management review (Section 2.2). The financial burden for maintenance will

more than likely fall on the PTA and indirectly, upon poor rural households which is a risk to the sustainability
of the investment in school construction and rehabilitation.

113.       Another apparent risk is that return on investment in training teachers (through Masters and PhD
programs), will not go directly back the education sector (see section 3.2(iv)). The forthcoming CSR 2010
reveals that the net income wage of a degree holding teacher is almost three times less than that of other
similarly qualified civil servants. Further, teacher salaries for primary teachers are 2.6 times the GDP per
capita, compared with 4.8 times, on average in the region. As long as teacher salaries remain low compared to
others, trained staff will continue to leave the sector for better paying jobs in other sectors.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
  (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
114.      Bank performance at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The Project clearly fit within the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda and the project team spent significant effort in preparing the
Project collaboratively with the GoR and other partners. However, the Project design was complex and was
expected to be implemented within a short time frame without ensuring sufficient human resource capacity up
front. The assessment of risks was inadequate given the post-conflict nature of the country in terms of (i)
access to private civil works Contractors; (ii) the engagement of communities to work alongside the
government; and (iii) ensuring sufficient human resources to manage the Project itself.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
115.       The quality of Bank supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank team did not
sufficiently document changes within the Project namely, (i) reasons why the FAWE school was included in
the HRDP (which was in effect a new component in the Project); and (ii) changes in the implementation
arrangements for the CSRDP (i.e. working through Districts instead of Community Development Committees).
In addition, the KPI's were only revised one year before closing of the Project (at the request of the Quality
and Knowledge Learning Group (QK), which had not requested it in the past) through a restructuring process.
In addition, the EPO reported significant delays in the processing on non-objections at the beginning of the
Project, which was also documented in aide-memoires by the Task Team Leader (TTL).

116.       On the other hand, the Bank processed three extensions and four reallocations during the course of
the project. It also accurately identified and handled the misprocurement and involuntary resettlement issues
in a timely and efficient manner. Further, the Bank appointed procurement and education specialists within the
Kigali country office by 2005 to provide closer, hands-on support to the Project.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
117.       The overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank was able to
collaboratively work with the GoR and partners in preparing the Project as well as accurately detecting and
addressing fiduciary and safeguards issues. However, the Bank did not give sufficient credence to ensuring
adequate capacity to support the Project, particularly given the complex nature of the Project within a post-
conflict setting. Further, it failed to adequately document changes within the Project, particularly why the
FAWE school construction was added.




                                                    21
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
118.      Government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The GoR contributed USD2.07
million towards various components of the Project. There was political support for the Project at preparation
though there was insufficient collaboration with the EPO during the first few years of the Project. Further, the
Government did not focus on finalizing the results indicators early on in the Project, which led to some issues
of tracking achievements through the life of the HRDP.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
119.      The EPO performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The EPO did not hire sufficient staff as
per the Project's design early on. Staffing shortages were acute which led to implementation lags throughout
the Project, thereby extending the Project by three and a half years. The misprocurement and involuntary
resettlement issues detected adversely affected the Project and led to further delays. Despite these delays and
staffing shortages, the EPO managed to implement several activities within Component 2 (which had the
largest share of financing) and Component 4. It also found a way to work through Districts in implementing
the community construction program to deliver substantially more sub-projects than originally anticipated.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
120.       The overall borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The GoR and the EPO
achieved some of the project results which were substantial, though sometimes not directly in line with the
stated PDO and not in the time frame anticipated. Other shortcomings include the misprocurement, the failure
to appoint adequate staff to implement the project and the involuntary resettlement issues related to FAWE
School.


6. Lessons Learned

Balancing technical realism with political pressure and social needs of post-conflict States
121.      At the time of project preparation, the education sector in Rwanda faced numerous challenges which
were complex and diverse. The post-conflict nature of the country meant there was significant political and
social pressure to address a multitude of issues through the HRDP. However, one of the lessons learned from
the former education project (FESP) was that project objectives need to take account of local implementation
capacity. Specifically, it noted that project activities should not commence until the technical and
implementation capacity had reached the required level. Post-conflict societies will continue to face the
tension between the urgent need to do address a plethora of issues and balance these against limited human and
financial resources. In future, it would be prudent for projects to include the hiring of all project
implementation unit staff as a condition of effectiveness.

Weak institutions in post-conflict States
122.       In most cases, post-conflict States have weak or dysfunctional institutions and policies. In the case
of civil works activities, there may be very few local contractors within the private sector who could provide
the required services given the risks (i.e. security of contractors staff and property andconcerns that the
country will revert back to conflict and the government may not honor outstanding payments) of working in a
post-conflict environment. In addition, the risks for international contractors may be too high to warrant their
involvement. Post-conflict societies have weak systems to regulate the building industry and thus the quality
of the civil works may suffer. Future projects should ensure that: (i) the public sector have sufficient technical
capacity (i.e. civil engineers and quantity surveyors) to regulate, monitor and supervise civil works activities;
and (ii) there is sufficient supply of contractors to provide quality services. If the latter is not the case, the
project should potentially consider procuring services of contractors by increasing the thresholds for "shopping"
in order to expedite the process.



                                                   22
Readiness of communities to work with government in post-conflict period
123.       Though the objective of nation-building through increased participation and ownership of
communities of school construction and maintenance was noble, it was perhaps too soon after the genocide to
forge partnership between the government and communities. There was an inherent assumption by the project
preparation team that communities considered education a priority for themselves and their children but
evidence from the Country Assistance Strategy of 2002 reported a survey of the population found that
poverty/economic hardship, security, healthcare, and lack of trust/sincerity as the major social problems-
education did not feature within communities top priorities. Since communities were only beginning to secure
their basic needs, their ability and willingness to contribute 10 percent to the cost of building the schools was
perhaps overestimated. There was also latent mistrust by communities so soon after the genocide and war. In
this kind of situation, it was ambitious to assume that communities would participate to the extent envisaged in
the HRDP.

Providing sufficient support to build capacity at the community level
124.       Project designs which involve community-driven development processes need to nurture and support
the huge potential that exists at the community level. However, it is unrealistic to think that communities have
the infrastructure and fiduciary capacity to deliver services and monitor progress without significant training
and continuous guidance. Future project designs should consider what communities are willing and able to
contribute instead of setting rigid criteria (e.g.10 percent contribution to civil works) which does not
acknowledge the diversity of communities both across and within countries.

Integrating demand-driven development with supply-driven Projects
125.      The HRDP was building upon the success of the Bank-financed Community Reintegration and
Development Project (CRDP) in order to engage communities. However, the success of the CRDP was based
on communities deciding their needs (e.g. in the area of health, education, water and sanitation, roads etc.). In
the case of the HRDP the focus was predetermined. It was decided that the focus would be
construction/rehabilitation of schools and these activities would be delivered through active engagement and
contribution of communities which was very similar to the CRDP implementation arrangements. The CRDP
implementations arrangements were created for a more demand-driven model of development. This may have
been confusing for communities since one Bank-financed project focuses on the demands/needs of
communities whereas in the other had a predetermined focus. Future Bank operations teams should be aware
that success in one type of project may not translate into success in another substantially different type of
project. They should also be aware of the conflicting messages it gives to communities by following different
models of development with similar institutional arrangements.

Adequately documenting changes and additions to projects
126.       The addition of the construction of FAWE girls' secondary school in 2006 was not adequately
documented by the Bank. The inclusion of such a large activity costing US$1.4 million (4 percent of project
costs) during the year the project was initially scheduled to close, was not sufficiently justified. Bank
documentation did not include detailed justification of why the FAWE school project was included and it
incorrectly related the activity within the overall components of the project. It's possible the HRDP would not
have been extended multiple times had the FAWE school not been added. Bank task teams should weigh the
impact of adding new activities (regardless of the availability of funding) towards the end of the project period.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

 1.     The project related reforms sought to improve the internal and external efficiency of the
education system. Project investments were expected to yield direct benefits through the construction of
schools and provision of equipment as well as indirect benefits, such as increased access to primary
education, improved quality of education and a long-term joint government/partner approach to
developing the education sector.

 2.      As mentioned earlier 765 classrooms were built through the project which, assuming a ratio of 71
pupils to 1 classroom, means a total of over 54,000 students have access through the classrooms built by
HRDP. This constitutes about 3.7 percent of enrollments in 2000/01 and 2.5 percent of enrollments in
2008. It should be noted that in the absence of baseline data for the HRDP, the enrollments within the
HRDP schools may not necessarily have increased the total national enrollment, since the students may
have been attending the school before the classroom was built or attending a nearby school.

 Public Expenditure on Education
 3.      In nominal and real terms, recurrent and development budgets have increased since 1999.
Education nominal recurrent expenditures increased from RwFr 22 billion in 1999 to RwFr 82 billion in
2008. At the same time, the nominal development budget rose from RwFr 6 billion to RwFr 18 billion
over the same period. The pooling of US$70 million from the Education for All-Catalytic Fund Grant
into the education budget in 2007 and 2008 resulted in a marked increase of resources from 2006. The
majority of the budget was allocated to recurrent expenditures (between 68 percent and 99 percent,
averaging 86 percent over the last decade).

 4.     Across the sub-sectors, the share of secondary and primary education has increased to the
 detriment of tertiary education, with the share of the latter decreasing from a high 35 percent to 26
 percent in 2008. The trend reflects the GoR's decision in 2003 to reduce the relative share of the higher
 education budget, following various recommendations to limit expenditures at this level (both in
 absolute and relative terms, and in spending per student) (PER, 2007). The cut in public support relied
 on a growth in private financing to support the development and continued expansion of higher
 education institutions.




                                               31
  5.     The share of spending allocated to primary education has increased since 2005 to reach 46
  perecent in 2008. If one takes into account support budget allocated to primary education, Rwanda is
  investing nearly 49 percent of its recurrent budget in primary education, which is similar to what is
  found on average in other African countries. Rwanda's spending on primary education is also
  approaching the indicative benchmark set by the Education For All- Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI),
  which is 50 percent. However, the country is still far from universal primary education (only 54 percent
  of children have access to primary 6). The GoR recognizes this challenge and is seeking ways to

  6.     Data show that gender parity has not been an issue at the primary level through the life of the
  HRDP, with 51 percent of girls enrolled in 2008 and 50 percent in 2000/01. At the primary level, GERs
  have structurally exceeded 100 percent and have registered an upward trend over the period, to reach 151
  percent in 2008, since GERs are artificially inflated by repetition and late entry.

  7.      According to the forthcoming Country Status Report (2010), the fee-free education policy
  (instituted in 2003) has allowed almost universal access to primary education in Rwanda. The
  probability for a generation to access primary education was estimated at 96 percent in 2006 which
  represents a substantial improvement since 2000 when the entry rate to primary 1 was estimated at 88
  percent (DHS 2000, CSR 2003).

  8.      In terms of income group disparities, GERs increase with the level of income and that
  discrepancies across income groups grow as one progresses up the education ladder. Improvements can
  be registered at the primary level with the wealth parity index improving from 0.78 in 2000 to 0.87 in
  2006. However, the challenge of retaining the poorest students in primary schools and ensuring their
  transition to post-primary cycles is a major issue.

  9.      Despite the abolition of school fees at the primary level in 2003, the amount invested by
  households at this level still remains high compared to 2000 (22 percent against 19 percent). Data from
  the Enquête Intégrale sur les Condition de Vie (EICV) show that while school fees accounted for 23
  percent of household spending on education in 2000 (for children in public primary schools), 45 percent
  as allocated to pay for uniforms and 24 percent for the purchase of books and school supplies. Overall,
  household spending on education in 2000 amounted to approximately 1.5 percent of GDP, at US$5
  annually per child in public primary schools to US$318 in higher education.

    11.     The table below displays the results corresponding to the benefit analysis. Urban people, while
    accounting for 17 percent of the total population of 6 to 30 year-olds, benefit from 49 percent of public
    resources for education, or 4.6 times more than their rural counterparts. Boys are also more favored than
    girls, benefiting from 50 percent more of the resources than girls. Important disparities also exist
    between socioeconomic groups: while each group accounts for a fifth of the population, the top 20
    percent richest benefits from 59 percent of public resources against 7 percent for those coming from the
    poorest households. This is reflected by an appropriation index of 7.7 times higher for the richest than
    for the poorest. Major gaps appear in relation to the last quintile, while little differences appear across
    groups belonging to the first four quintiles.

     12.     The internal efficiency coefficient (IEC) at primary level remains particularly low at 39 percent in
     2008, implying that 61 percent of public resources are used for repeated years or for school years of
     students who drop out before completing the cycle. The system requires 18 student-years to produce one
     graduate instead of 6 years with perfect efficiency. The situation has worsened since 2002/03, when the
     IEC was 56 percent. High dropout rates have the greatest adverse impact on the internal efficiency in
     primary schools. The abolition of school fees in 2003/04, which allowed children from the poorest
     households to join school and thus increased the number of children with more intense learning
     difficulties and at risk of dropping out, has negatively affected schooling retention.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


The Government of Rwanda submitted its ICR for the HRDP to the Bank at the end of
April 2010. This is a summary of the GoR's ICR:

Project Preparation: (i) The design of the project was complex with too many disparate
components; (ii) the results indicators were not well-designed (some of the indicators
were not useful, such as number of training programs, since it had no indication of the
quality of training); and (iii) the institutional arrangements for staffing of the EPO did not
include an internal audit function, which was a key element for effective monitoring of
the CSRDP, which had several sub-projects.

Implementation: The reorganization of local government at the end of 2005 led to
issues supervision and accountability of the CSRDP. Given that several of these local
governments were in their infancy, the implementation arrangements (as set out in the
Project Implementation Manual of the CSRDP) were unrealistic. Further, reliable
building contractors were in short supply in many rural parts of the country.

The GoR's ICR noted a serious shortage of staff in the HRDP, particularly education and
social specialists as well as engineers and procurement specialists. These shortages
potentially led to the poor quality of Terms of References submitted to the Bank for non-
objection, which were consequently rejected.

The Government's decision in 2005 of "zero fleet" affected the EPO's ability to
supervise the 124 sub-projects around the country, as no official vehicles were available
for site visits.

The Government noted significant delays on the Bank's side in responding to requests for
non-objection, particularly during the period of 200-2004. The Government's ICR states
that in some cases, responses to non-objections could take up to six months. This issue
was only conclusively addressed in 2007 with the following actions: (i) An Education
Specialist was posted in Kigali; (ii) monthly video-conferences between the EPO and the
Bank task team were instituted; (iii) a new TTL was brought on board.

Achievement of Project Development Objective: The ICR states that the project
achieved its objective of improving efficiency in primary and secondary education.
There was also improved capacity in the Ministry and other agencies to lead changes in
the education sector. Amongst the achievements are:
    (i)     Increased transfer of pupils from P6 to S1: In January 2009, 100% of
           students (compared to the HRDP target of 50% by the end of the project) were
           enrolled in Senior 1 due to the Nine Year Education Policy established by the
           Ministry of Education.
    (ii)   National examinations: The success rate for primary school examinations was
           74% in 2008 (compared to the HRDP of 70% by the end of the project).




                                             39
   (iii)   Primary level qualified teacher status: By 2008, 80% of primary school
           teachers in Rwanda had achieve qualified teacher status, with the support of
           the HRDP.
   (iv)    Secondary level qualified teacher status: The percentage of graduate
           secondary school teachers increased from 33% in 1999 to 53% in 2007.

Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome:
The main risks identified in the GoR's ICR were: (i) There are signs of `rapid
depreciation' of the CSRDP constructed schools, though maintenance is supposed to be
funded through the school capitation grants; (ii) Infrastructure constructed under the
second component, i.e. examinations center, teacher training centers etc, appear to be of
much higher quality than the CSRDP schools however, the sustainability of other inputs
(such as curriculum, materials and human resource development) is dependent on the
strategies adopted within the ESSP and technical and financial support from development
partners; (iii) there is currently no HIV/AIDS focal person within MINEDUC; (iv) there
needs to be a more comprehensive framework for in-service and human resource
development across the sector.

World Bank Performance
The Bank's performance was rated satisfactory. The ICR states that the Bank was
helpful in framing and facilitating the GOR in designing the Project. However, the GOR
reports that during implementation, all the principal project staff were based in
Washington and the Bank had its own internal capacity shortcomings, particularly in
procurement and financial management. Further, the ICR states that the Bank did not
respond quickly or constructively to the issues of poor capacity within the EPO as well as
complaints about delays in granting non-objections.

Government of Rwanda's Performance
The GoR's performance is rated satisfactory. The ICR states that the GoR monitored the
project closely through annual reviews of project activities. It also contributed more than
its share of counterpart funding towards the project. However, the national
administrative reform adversely affected the CSRDP component.

Lessons Learned
The main lessons outlined in the GoR's ICR were:
    Competent staff should be hired and training provided by the Bank at the time of
      loan effectiveness
    The oversight mechanism (in the HRDP's case, the Steering Committee) should
      be formalized at loan effectiveness and should monitor activities through the life
      of the project
    If a substantial portion of project resources are to be transferred to local
      authorities, there needs to be some basic assessment of their capacity as well as
      associated risks. The central management unit should provide orientation and
      training to local authorities on the specific project expectations.

Annex 12: Environmental and Social Safeguards Review
Executive Summary
1. The Human Resource Development Project (HRDP) became effective in January 2001
and was completed in December 2009. The objectives of the HRDP were to: (i) improve
access to basic education by increasing its intake capacity through community participation
in rehabilitating, constructing and equipping schools; (ii) improve the quality of inputs
(teaching, instructional materials, methods of supervision) in primary and secondary
education; (iii) heighten awareness and train students, parents and educators to combat the
AIDS epidemic; and (iv) build institutional capacity and improve efficiency in the
management of the education system through focused training, studies and policy
development, and initiation of a Sector-Wide Investment Program.

2. As part of the project, about 765 classrooms (spread across 125 sub-projects) were
constructed or rehabilitated through the Community-Based School Rehabilitation and
Development Program.        In addition, 6 Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) were
rehabilitated/extended and in December 2008, the Federation of African Women
Educationists (FAWE) secondary technical school for girls was constructed as part of the
project's activities.

3. In mid-2009, there was concern that the construction of the FAWE school was adversely
affecting its surrounding community, namely through the resettlement of persons who were
cultivating the public land on which the School was being built. A resettlement Audit was
conducted following this close and prior to the project close out.

4. Given this background, it was deemed necessary to conduct a broader review of the
environmental and social issues related to the HRDP as a whole before its official close out.
This review will form part of the Project's Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR), which is a self-assessment of the Project experience.

5. This study was undertaken by reviewing relevant literature related to the project
including land acquisition, land valuation and expropriation in Rwanda, environmental
regulations under the Organic Law and how they relate to this project as well as the review
of the bank's policies on involuntary resettlement and environmental assessment.

6. Stakeholder consultation and field surveys were conducted targeting the Project
Affected Persons (PAPs), relevant HRDP and government staff at the selected districts.

7. In each of the 5 provinces in Rwanda, a total of 2 schools funded under the HRDP were
randomly selected using the lottery method, where all the schools were listed in a piece of
paper by province and then 2 schools were randomly selected and became the study subject
for the review.

Quality of environmental safeguards plans/activities
8. The environmental safeguards plan prepared for the FAWE school was adequate and
comprehensively addressed the potential adverse effects associated with construction and
operation of schools (boarding) including plans to address solid and waste water disposal


                                           47
from construction debris, wastes from the toilets, showers and kitchen, borrow pit
reclamation plans, greening and landscaping of schools among others. A few issues could
have however made the ESMP much more robust and better including addressing issues
related to fire hazards in the school (school lacks fire suppression equipments), security
concerns (school has no wall boundary) and energy conservation strategies (equipping
school with CFLs bulbs, training on energy saving techniques) etc.

9. Even though there were no ESMP for the Community Based Schools Rehabilitation
Program, and primarily because the project was categorized as C under the Environmental
Assessment OP 4.10, the design of the schools took into account the need to ensure little if
not minimal destruction of vegetation cover, landscaping and re-vegetation, construction of
pit latrines and sanitation blocks among others. A major proposal was to have the schools
constructed with hydra form blocks instead of baked bricks that increase pressure on the
biomass.

10. These were proposed in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) but did not feature in
the sub project design and hence as observed in the study most of the schools visited were
constructed with baked bricks with the exception of the FAWE school.

Quality of environmental mitigation measures implemented
11. The mitigation measures proposed for the FAWE school construction is considered
fairly adequate with most of the measures having been fulfilled except for the lack of
clearance of constriction debris including glass and wood that was observed to be still
within the school compound in spite of the completion of construction and handing over of
the facility by the contractor to the school administration.

12. The ESMP stipulated that the PAPs be accorded priority in terms of securing jobs in the
construction site and this has been ascertained to indeed be the case by the audit which
confirmed that over 75% of the 42 PAPs are workers in the site offering skilled and
unskilled labor.

13. However, contrary to the recommendations of the ESMP, the construction work began
before the harvesting season leading to clearing and loss of crops before maturity.

Quality of social safeguards plans/activities
14. A social safeguard plan (Resettlement Action Plan) or Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) was not prepared for the overall HRDP or for individual sub project as required by
the bank operational procedures. The FAWE school project certainly features higher up in
this review owing to the numbers of PAPs involved in the displacement.

15. In spite of the lack of a RAP for the FAWE school project, it must be noted that the
Government of Rwanda through the Kayonza District (location of school) had committed to
compensating the PAPs. Similarly there were no social safeguards plans for the
Community Based School Rehabilitation Project and hence making it difficult to assess the
quality of the same.




                                           48
Quality of social safeguards mitigation measures implemented
16. It must be noted that even though there were no social safeguards mitigation measures
against which to measure compliance during resettlement and compensation, the actions or
processes that was used by the Government of Rwanda (GOR) especially the Kayonza
District Land Authorities was immensely similar to the banks OP 4.12 ion involuntary
resettlement.

17. The resettlement process (asset inventory, socio-economic survey and valuation)
occurred in November-December 2008 and by January 2009 all the PAPs had vacated the
land for construction work to commence.

18. The 2009 resettlement audit study found out that the resettlement and compensation
process undertaken by the Kayonza District Land Authorities was very much compliant
with the Bank's OP 4.12 in terms of socio-economic survey, stakeholder consultation and
valuation of assets. Even though the grievance redress mechanism was not fully explained
to the PAPs, it is noted that they were at least informed that any displeasure should be
reported to the District Land Officials or the Mayor.

19. The only set back to the process was the delay in compensation which not only
contravened the OP 4.12 but has been the single most factor that can be concluded as a
cause of project negative impact to the PAPs. The national land acquisition legislation
requires that property must be handed over 90 days after financial compensation has been
paid, while OP4.12 requires that displacement must not occur before all necessary measures
for resettlement are in place. In this project the land was handed over before the
compensation was paid to the PAPs but was in complete contrast with the national
legislation as well as the bank's policies all which require expedited compensation before
vacating the land.

20. There was also limited monitoring of the expropriation process a role that could have
been performed by HRDP staff especially by ensuring participation in all meetings, asset
valuation process, recording of complaints among others. This way record of all meetings,
communications and data would have been available for reference.

21. The Community Based School Rehabilitation Development component of the HRDP
according to the findings of the environmental and social review does not have any social
concerns in relation to resettlement. Of the 10 schools visited, only 2 of these had
resettlement background issues and were well handled with the PAPs consulted, engaged
and compensated duly in time and using rates that were acceptable to the PAPs.

Conclusion
22. Apart from the resettlement issues related to the FAWE school project, the HRDP is
fairly compliant to the bank's environmental and social safeguards according to the findings
of this review. There are inadequacies identified including the lack of a Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) or Resettlement Action Plan (RAPs) but the significant outcome
is that the process and procedures followed in spite of the absence of these documents were
of a high degree and quality in diligence albeit with slight shortcomings as is the case of the



                                            49
delayed payments of the PAPs for the FAWE school.

23. Environmental safeguards were well handled starting with the preparation of an
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the FAWE school which was
equally adhered to almost to the last detail.

24. Capacity building and training in environmental and social safeguards especially for the
MINEDUC and local communities was lacking and could be the reason why monitoring
during implementation was somewhat weak.

 Rationale for the Review
25. In mid-2009, there was concern that the construction of the FAWE school which was
one of the target infrastructures to be constructed under this project was adversely affecting
its surrounding community, namely through the resettlement of persons who were
cultivating the public land on which the School was being built.

26. While the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) prepared in 2007 for the
FAWE school ensured that environmental standards were applied throughout the project's
activities, the implementation of the FAWE school sub-component was assessed for
consistency with the Bank's resettlement policy.

27. As reported in the Resettlement Audit (August 2009), a total of 42 Project Affected
Persons (PAPs) were compensated for land lost and crops destroyed as a result of school
construction.

28. The findings of the audit indicated that the compensation process was in compliance
with Bank's policies and procedures for involuntary resettlement; involvement of PAPs in
identification, valuation, and compensation was consultative and participatory, and a
grievance mechanism was sufficiently operational throughout the process.

29. The project also ensured that appropriate procedures were used in the acquisition of
additional land for installation of a water tank for the FAWE school.

30. However, the Audit also found the delays in finalizing compensation and the timing of
construction (before the harvest season) to be problematic. The interview of PAPs showed
some dissatisfaction for the project and was inconsistent with national legislation that
stipulated timely payments.

31. Given this background, it was deemed necessary to conduct a broader review of the
environmental and social issues related to the HRDP as a whole prior to the project close
out. This Review will form part of the Project's Implementation Completion and Results
Report (ICR), which is a self-assessment of the Project experience

Objectives of the Review

The Review will cover the following aspects:

32. Update of the Involuntary Resettlement aspects of the FAWE school since the audit.
This includes an assessment of the quality of implementation of safeguards mitigation
measures. i.e. have all the beneficiaries been paid due compensation and are there any
arising issues?

33. Review of FAWE school compliance with all aspects of the ESMP, beyond resettlement
issues.

34. Review of environmental/social issues for the other activities within the HRDP which
involved construction (such as the Community-Based School Rehabilitation and
Development Program and the rehabilitation of Teacher Training Colleges).

35. Evaluate changes in capacities of institutions (MINEDUC, the Education Project Office
and communities) for implementing environment and social safeguards programs.

Scope and methodology of the review

36. A consultant was hired for the review of environmental and social safeguards mitigation
measures undertaken by the project. The following topics were to be addressed in the
review:
Quality of environmental safeguards plans/activities
Quality of environmental mitigation measures implemented
Quality of social safeguards plans/activities
Quality of social safeguards mitigation measures implemented

Tasks and Methodology

The consultant would evaluate the following key areas:

37. FAWE School- (i) follow-up on the resettlement audit, compensation of PAPs and any
arising issues; (ii) ESMP implementation particularly on environmental and social aspects
not covered in the resettlement audit and (iii) capacities developed for ESMP
implementation and monitoring.

38. Community-Based School Rehabilitation and Development Program and TTCs: The
consultant will conduct site visits to 10% of the schools built through the Community
Project (13 schools) and one TTC to gather the necessary information on (i) whether there
was any resettlement; (ii) which environmental standards were followed and assess its
consistency with appropriate national and local legislation and regulations; (iii) how the
environmental and social practices of the Project compare with the World Bank's practices.




                                          51
Literature Review
39. The consultant reviewed appropriate national and local legislation and regulations in
Rwanda related to land acquisition and compensation. The consultant also undertook a
detailed review of the World Bank safeguards policies related to Involuntary Resettlement
OP.4.12 and Environmental Assessment OP4.10.

40. The local legislation and regulatory materials reviewed included;-

Rwanda's Land Expropriation Law 2007
Rwanda's Land and Crops Valuation Law 2007
The Rwandan Constitution, promulgated in 2003;
Organic Law
Land and Crop Compensation Rates
Presidential Order N° 54/01 of 12/10/2006 determining the structure, the responsibilities,
the functioning and the composition of Land Commissions; and
Ministerial Order N° 001/2006 of 26/09/2006 determining the structure of Land Registers,
the responsibilities and the functioning of the District Land Bureau.
Stakeholder Dialogue and Consultation
41. A series of consultation and stakeholder engagement was conducted by the consultant
during the 5 day field study as part of the review. Those consulted included;-
Project Affected Persons at the project site
HRDP Project Implementation Unit
District Officials
School administrative staff in the districts of focus
Officials from Rwanda Environment Management Authority

42. A total of 13 individuals representing the school administration and HRDP staff and
REMA were directly interviewed by the consultant during the 5 day field study.
Field Survey
43. The consultant conducted a 5 day visit to the project sites primarily to evaluate the
extent to which the HRDP complied with the environmental and social safeguards of the
bank including the quality of the same. The consultant also visited the 2 PAPs whose land
were most recently acquired to pave way for the construction of the FAWE school water
tank with an aim of ascertaining the compensation process and overall compliance to the
Bank's operation polices for involuntary resettlement.

44. The consultant visited all the 5 provinces (Southern, Western, Eastern, Northern and
Kigali Provinces) respectively. In each of the 5 provinces, 2 schools constructed or
rehabilitated under the HRDP were randomly selected using the lottery method bringing the
total number of schools evaluated to 10.

Findings and Conclusion
Status of the Involuntary Resettlement aspects of the FAWE School since the 2009
audit including an assessment of the quality of implementation of safeguards
mitigation measures.
45. The Resettlement Audit study conducted in 2009 concluded that the resettlement and
compensation process undertaken by the Kayonza District Land Authorities for the FAWE
school was very much compliant with the Bank's OP 4.12 in terms of socio-economic
survey, stakeholder consultation, grievance redress mechanism and valuation of assets.

46. The only set back or exception to the process was the delay in compensation which not
only contravened the OP 4.12 but was concluded as the single most factor that was the
cause of project negative impact to the PAPs. The Rwanda national land acquisition
legislation requires that property must be handed over 90 days after financial compensation
has been paid, while OP 4.12 requires that displacement must not occur before all necessary
measures for resettlement are in place including payment.

47. In this project the land was handed over for the construction of the school by the PAPs
before the compensation was paid to the PAPs (which is understandable based on the
explanation given on need to hasten the construction and end it before June 2009) but was
in complete contrast with the national legislation as well as the Bank's policies both which
require expedited compensation before vacating the land.

48. The 2009 FAWE resettlement audit study recommended that the PAPs be compensated
with immediate effect in order to avoid any further adverse impacts owing to the
displacement by the HRDP activities.

49. Similarly, the audit study recommended that since PAPs had already lost out on the
second harvest because of the delay in compensation which could have afforded them the
opportunity to lease other parcels of land in time and undertake cultivation they should thus
be compensated for the first and second harvest lost in order to minimize the adverse
impacts.

50. Status following 2010 March Review;- This review study has determined and is able
to conclude that as per the recommendation of the audit study in 2009, the PAPs were
expressly paid after the GOR expedited the payments which also included compensation for
loss of second harvest following loss of land. Copies of the individual cheques paid to each
PAP based on the valuation of assets and agreement by the PAPs are attached as annex.
PAPs met during the field study visit also indicated that they were fully satisfied with the
process now that they had all received payments.




                                           53
Compensation for the Proposed Land Acquisition for Water Tank Construction
51. The FAWE school project had in 2009 also identified another piece of land adjacent to
the existing land where the school is constructed and wanted to acquire the land for
constructing a water tank to supply water to the school.

52. The owners of the land been identified by the time of conducting the 2009 audit. The
local administration has already approached the 2 PAPs with intention to acquire the land.
One of the PAPs had however refused negotiations or consultation citing the delay in
compensation of her FAWE school land as in indicator that the same fate will befall her
again if she obliges to give out her land for the tank before payments are made.

53. The audit study had recommended that the owners of the land identified for construction
of the water tank be duly engaged, consulted and compensated before acquisition occurs. A
repeat of how the FAWE school land was acquired before compensation was cautioned.

54. Status following review; - This review has determined and is confidently concluding
that the land targeted for construction of the school water tank was duly acquired and all the
procedures for land acquisition and compensation for the Bank and Rwanda were followed
to the letter in displacing these 2 PAPs before transfer of land ownership occurred. There
were no delays in payment, the PAPs were meaningfully consulted and the valuation was
done as required by the Bank's procedures. The PAPs agreed to the land valuation rates
including crops which involved asset valuation and measurement of land conducted in their
presence. They finally signed an agreement indicating their acceptance to offer their land
for the construction of the water tank and received compensation before moving from the
land.
During the field visit, the consultant held discussions with the 2 PAPs to find out if they had
any issues or complaints related to the compensation process. The PAPs were fully satisfied
with the process and had no complaints whatsoever in relation to this issue.

55. Preparation of Implementation Completion Report
The audit study had also recommended that an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of
the entire resettlement process for this project be prepared as required by the Bank and
should include a hand over certificate which will ostensibly provide a verification of when
the compensation and assistance were undertaken and to whom these services were
provided as well as to indicate that indeed all the compensation has been delivered.

56. Status following review;- This report is under preparation and this Environmental and
Social review report will form part of the ICR that is being prepared and led by Ms.
Elizabeth Ninan Human Development Specialist from World Bank Washington DC.

57. Monitoring and Evaluation of Expropriation Process on FAWE project
There was also limited monitoring of the expropriation process according to the 2009 audit
report a role that could have been performed by HRDP staff especially by ensuring
participation in all meetings, asset valuation process, recording of complaints among others.
This way record of all meetings, communications and data would have been available for
reference. The audit report recommended that HRDP should move quickly and engage



                                            54
intensively on the compensation process including monitoring as is required by the Bank's
OP 4.12

58. Status following review;- This environmental and social review is able to report that
HRDP staff took up the recommendation seriously as shown by their involvement that
ensured the quick payment of the PAPs after several months of delay including the equally
prompt payment of the 2 PAPs whose land was to be acquired for the construction of the
water tank.

Review of FAWE school compliance with all aspects of the ESMP, beyond resettlement issues.
59. The aim of this objective was to determine the extent to which the FAWE school
complied with all the mitigation measures outlined in the 2007 Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) that was prepared prior to construction. This objective is to
specifically look into issues that are not resettlement related because these had already been
highlighted in the resettlement audit report.

60. It must be noted that the ESMP document is divided into 2 main parts in terms of
projection of potential adverse impacts namely; - (1) Construction Phase Impact and
Mitigation Measures and (2) Operational Phase Impacts and Mitigation Measures.

61. Reviewing compliance to mitigation measures proposed during the construction phase
of the project is somewhat difficult at this point because the construction is complete thus
making it difficult to make conclusions or analysis but inferences can be made based on
observable indicators which would point towards non compliance or otherwise.

62. Environmental compliance at operational phase of the project was possible through
direct observation and cross checking with the ESMP document as well as consultation with
the school administration and local community members.

63. Construction Phase Compliance Review Indicators
The following tables below highlights the key issues (adverse impacts) that were identified
in the ESMP and which required compliance during construction.

                                                                    ESMP implementation.




                                              57
64. In summary, the review can ascertain that there was a high degree of quality in
compliance to the ESMP especially on issues not related to resettlement as shown in the
tables above.

65. However, there are issues that the ESMP should have addressed and was lacking which
could equally improve compliance and minimize potential adverse effects hence
highlighting the inadequacy of the ESMP in terms of quality based on the stated oversights
highlighted below. They include;-

66. Energy Consumption;-The ESMP left out major components which include energy
saving measures. There is need to have the school use energy saving bulbs (CFLs) and
inculcate the principles of saving electricity in the school as a whole. This can include
routine switching off of lights when not in use.

   1. Fire hazards;- remain part and parcel of an institution of this nature and thus
      require that fire safety prevention and safety training including installation of
      appropriate fire suppression equipment be available in the school compound. This
      critical element was lacking in this school and action is needed urgently before a
      hazard of this nature occurs.

   2. Security;- The FAWE school lacks a boundary wall or fence thus making it easily
      accessible and could be a target for intruders. There is need to erect a fence all
      around this school to enhance security and privacy needed for such institutions and
      more so an all girls' boarding facility.

   3. Sanitation; - This is a boarding facility and requires adequate and constant supply
      of clean water to avert disease outbreaks. Even though it has a water tank there is no
      supply from a regular source. The machine that is providing water to the tank is
      located 60 kilometers away from the school and has broken down (during the review
      period). The school is now buying water from Kayonza Town which is not adequate
      especially since the toilets use the flush mechanism to dispose the wastes. There is
      need to both have RECO/RWASCO engaged and assure consistent water supply to
      the school or alternatively roof catchment and borehole should be considered as
      viable alternatives if not complimentary.

67. Review of environmental/social issues for the other activities within the HRDP
which involved construction (such as the Community-Based School Rehabilitation and
Development Program and the rehabilitation of Teacher Training Colleges).
The main objective of the CSRDP was to support local community initiatives and demand-
driven sub-projects such as the rehabilitation of classrooms, the provision of equipment, and
the construction of new schools. The grant was part of the first pillar of an education
strategy for Rwanda which included: (i) participation of communities in the rehabilitation,
extension and construction of community primary and secondary schools; (ii) generation of
employment and rural liquidity; and (iii) generation of resources to restore and improve the
delivery of adequate levels of essential private and public education services.




                                           58
68. This approach was in line with the Rwandan government's decentralization policy. This
component was envisaged to build on the successful experience under the Bank-financed
Community Reintegration and Development Project (CRDP) which was developed as a
learning and innovation loan (LIL).

69. The environmental and social review of the HRDP component involving the
construction and rehabilitation of Community Based School including Teacher Training
Centers (TTC) was guided by the following sampling protocol.

70. The total number of schools constructed or rehabilitated under this component were 125
including Teacher Training Centers and the review randomly selected 10 schools using the
lottery method with 2 schools out of the total per province standing an equal chance of
getting selected hence representing 10% of total schools constructed.

71. The schools selected and the province/district location are shown in the table below;-

Resettlement Issues
72. There were no major resettlement issues of the schools that were selected (randomly) for
the social review with the exception of FAWE School. Of all the 10 schools visited, only 2
(G.S. Ntarama and Nyakabanda Primary School) required compliance with the Bank's and
Government of Rwanda's procedures for land acquisition. The rest of the schools already
existed in land that was either owned by the Government of Rwanda (GOR) or the Catholic
Church and hence the rehabilitation or improvements did not trigger resettlement issues or
safeguards.

73. This section highlights the schools visited and the support that the Bank provided upon
which a determination of whether resettlement issues were triggered or otherwise was
evaluated.

   1. G.S Rwamashyongoshyo; This school is Rwamagana District in the Eastern
      Province of the country. Through the HRDP component, 3 classrooms, 1 office
      block and 4 pit latrines were constructed. The construction was done in an already
      existing school so there was no resettlement issues triggered.


                                            59
   2. G.S Karugunda; This school is based at Gakenke District in the Northern Province.
      Through the HRDP, 3 classrooms, 1 office and 14 pit latrines were built. The land
      was already hosting the school so these were additional facilities. The land is the
      property of the Catholic Church which runs the school in collaboration with
      MINEDUC.

   3. G.S Shingiro; this school is based in Musanze District of the Northern Province.
      The HRDP built six (6) classrooms, 1 office and 14 latrines. The land belongs to the
      Republic of Rwanda and the school was already in existence hence no resettlement
      issues were triggered.

   4. G.S Rega Catholic; this school is situated in Nyabihu District of Western Province.
      The HRDP component built 15 classrooms and an office in the school together with
      14 latrines. The land belongs to the Catholic Church which runs the school together
      with MINEDUC.

   5. EMP TTC Save; this Teachers Training Centre is situated in Gisagara District of
      Southern Province. The HRDP constructed 2 Laboratories, 16 classrooms, a hall and
      toilets including shower blocks. The land belongs to the Catholic Church through
      the Marist Brothers, they also run the school.

   6. Ecole secondaire de Nyanza; Situated in Nyanza District of Southern Province the
      HRDP constructed 3 classrooms, 1 office and 14 latrines. The school is built on
      government land hence no issues of resettlement.

   7. Kacyiru II Primary School; this school is located in Gasabo District in Kigali City.
      Through the HRDP 12 classrooms, an office block and 14 latrines were constructed.
      The land belonged to the Police hence no resettlement issues arose.

   8. G.S Ntarama; This school is based in Bugesera District in Southern Province. It is
      also known as Cyugaro. The school is built on land that formerly belonged to The
      Rwanda Women's Association (ASOFERWA). The former owners of the land were
      compensated through an exchange whereby they had new homes built for them in
      alternative land. This form of compensation is known as land for land and included
      the complete construction of the houses destroyed which is another highly accepted
      and recommended compensation process by the Bank especially when dealing with
      vulnerable groups like women etc.

There are no grievances, the community is happy with he school as it's the only one serving
the locals

   9. Nyakabanda Primary School; This is a primary school located in Kicukiro District
      of Kigali Province. It has a student population of 900 students. The school is new
      i.e. it was not in existence before 2005. The land the school is built on belonged to
      Mr. Murenzi who was compensated for the acquisition of his land. 12 classrooms,



                                           60
       an office, a store and 14 latrines were constructed through HRDP.

74. There were no individual Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for each of the schools or
an overall Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the HRDP and hence it is impossible
to determine the quality of the social safeguards plans. However, as shown from the
schools sampled above, there were little instances where the involuntary resettlement policy
of the bank was triggered and in cases where individuals were to be displaced 9as shown in
the 2 cases) the procedures followed indicating a high degree of quality in implementation
of social safeguard plans or processes.

Environmental Issues
75. It is worth beginning by stating that for this component of HRDP (Community-Based
School Rehabilitation and Development Program) there was no ESMP prepared because the
project is categorised as C under the Bank's Environmental Assessment Policy OP 4.01, BP
4.01 and GP 4.01.

76. According to the Banks PDA prepared in 2000:-The project is not expected to have
any negative impact on the environment. On the contrary, the CSRDP will provide a unique
opportunity to develop environmental awareness and education activities in association with
parent associations and school clubs. There will be a limited amount of civil works and
these will be mainly rehabilitation of existing structures. New schools or classrooms to be
constructed under the project will be small and dispersed in rural areas. Construction
methods would avoid putting pressure on scarce natural resources. The project would
explore the use of hydra form block technology (based on pressure on a mixture of lots of
soil and very little cement) and not baked bricks, in order to reduce the need for firewood,
avoiding any detrimental impact on the environment. Field research to verify the
sustainability of soil for clay compaction in the brick making process of hydra form blocks
should be executed in advance in order to avoid design modifications. Meanwhile, the
construction of new schools and the rehabilitation of existing structures should result in
improvements in sanitary conditions (potable water in schools and building of latrines). The
planting of sapling shade trees and landscaping to prevent erosion will also have positive
effects on the environment.

77. Except for the FAWE School which was correctly identified during the HRDP extension
in 2006 as potentially leading to negative impacts and for which an ESMP was prepared,
the review can confirm that the categorization of the project and identified negative impacts
are correct.

78. HRDP has supported all the schools visited as summarized above with new sanitary
facilities (toilets) and tap water including portable water in toilets and showers for washing,
trees had been planted all around the school compound and landscaping undertaken thereby
increasing the ambience, contributing to the carbon sequestration process and reducing soil
run off.

79. The schools visited did not have any major environmental concerns worth highlighting
other than the one major one which is hygiene and sanitation in relation to the pit latrines.



                                            61
80. Even though pit latrines constructed in each of these schools remain the first and most
significant step in ensuring good hygiene and sanitation and hence minimizing
environmental health risks, there is need for the school administration to step up the
cleaning bit as most of the toilets were dirty and could certainly cause health related
infections.


81. The other issue of concern is the fact that the HRDP recommended the use of hydra
form blocks for construction in order to reduce pressure on natural soils and wood products
that was being used to construct baked bricks made from clay. The review observed that
most of the schools were constructed using bricks made from clay and could in effect have
exacerbated the pressure on firewood.
Environmental standards followed and assess its consistency with appropriate national and
local legislation and regulations;
In 2000 the Government of Rwanda (GOR) did not have an Environmental Law as is the
case at present and thus, the project followed the Bank's environmental procedures as
evidenced above. (The Organic Law is the existing legislation in Rwanda responsible for
addressing environmental protection in the country including the need for preparation of
ESMP for projects).

82. In 2006 with the extension of the HRDP, the Bank policy for Environmental
Assessment was again followed in the case of the FAWE School which was identified as
potentially causing adverse effects on the environment. The citation below highlights the
keen attention paid by the project to ensure environmental safeguards following the project
extension.

83. The 2006 amendment made the extension of the project conditional upon the appraisal
of the construction of the FAWE School (an activity which was not foreseen in the original
project), including the consideration of appropriate environmental and social management
of the FAWE School.

84. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the FAWE School,
including the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), was submitted to the
World in June 2007. In December 2007, the World Bank issued a no objection to issuing
the call for tenders for construction of the FAWE School (contingent on a number of
changes to the architectural plans). In February 2008, the Project Implementation Unit
transmitted the Dossier d'Appel d'Offres for the FAWE School to the National Tender
Board. In October 2008, the World Bank provided a no objection to the bid evaluation
selecting a contractor for the construction of the school.

Oversight
85. The single oversight in all this was the lack of involvement of Rwanda Environment
Management Authority (REMA) in this process especially for the FAWE School ESMP
which was prepared in 2007 when REMA was fully functional and should have been
provided with the report for review and approval. REMA would have perhaps provided



                                          62
oversight roles in ensuring adequate monitoring even though this institution is still under
staffed and would probably not paid keen attention to this project in terms of priority and in
comparison with other high profile projects with the potential for adverse impacts as
compared to the HRDP.

Comparison of the Project environmental and social practices with the World
Bank's practices.
86. The HRDP compares fairly well if not extremely well with the Bank's practices in
relation to ensuring environmental and social safeguards. This is demonstrated by the
recognition in 2007 that even though the project was overall categorized as C under the EA
OP 4.01, the FAWE School was certainly going to trigger this OP and hence an ESMP was
prepared specifically for this sub project.

87. The bank policy also prescribes compensation and other resettlement measures to
achieve its objectives and requires that borrowers prepare adequate resettlement planning
instruments prior to project appraisal of proposed projects. The objective of this policy to
avoid where feasible, or minimize, exploring all viable alternative project designs, to avoid
resettlement.

88. The policy requires the displaced persons and their communities, and any host
communities receiving them, are provided timely and relevant information, consulted on
resettlement options, and offered opportunities to participate in planning, implementing, and
monitoring resettlement. Appropriate and accessible grievance mechanisms are established
for these groups. In new resettlement sites or host communities, infrastructure and public
services are provided as necessary to improve, restore, or maintain accessibility and levels
of service for the displaced persons and host communities.

89. In the case of the FAWE schools project, all the above requirements were met and
fulfilled with the exception of payment which was somewhat delayed.

90. In order to comply with this policy, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which is a
document that sets out the resettlement objectives and principles, organizational
arrangements and funding mechanisms for any resettlement that may be necessary during
project implementation is required by the bank.

91. This document (RPF) was not prepared as required during the initial appraisal phase of
the project because the HRDP was not anticipated to trigger OP 4.12 in 2000 because this
construction was not anticipated.

92. Similarly, for any resettlement activity, a Resettlement and Compensation Action Plan
(RAP) or an Abbreviated resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) is required before the execution
of the project. The policy specifically states that;-

"Where the impacts on the entire displaced population are minor (i.e. if affected people
are not physically displaced and less than 10% of their productive assets are lost) or fewer
than 200 people are displaced (economically or physically) for the entire project, and then



                                            63
the bank will approve the preparation of an Abbreviated Resettlement

93. Resettlement issues were certainly not well handled in the case of the FAWE School as
reported in the 2009 audit which highlighted the weaknesses including primarily the lack of
preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for this project. Even though the GoR had
committed to compensating the Project Affected Persons (PAPs), for the loss of crops and
land, since this is a Bank funded project, the Bank should have gone ahead and facilitated
the RAP preparation as demanded.

94. However, it must be noted that the process followed by Kayonza District in relation to
land acquisition, involved stakeholder consultation, asset valuation, census survey and
provision of channels for grievance redress. These are all hallmarks of the Bank's
Involuntary Resettlement procedures OP 4.12. The only inadequacy was the delay in
paying the PAPs that led to complaints and thus getting the Bank involved through the audit
which in the end resolved the impasse.

95. Resettlement issues of the 2 PAPs whose land were acquired for the construction of the
community schools were apparently well handled unlike the FAWE school with payments
made on time. This is probably because the numbers of PAPs involved were not as many as
that of the FAWE school hence not complicating the process.

Evaluate changes in capacities of institutions (MINEDUC, the Education Project
Office and communities) for implementing environment and social safeguards
programs.
96. There were no capacity building actions integrated in the HRDP in terms of
implementing environment and social safeguards. The staff from MINEDUC, the
Education Project Office and communities received no form of training or capacity
enhancement to equip them with ensuring safeguards.

97. There was also limited monitoring of the expropriation process a role that could have
been performed by HRDP staff especially by ensuring participation in all meetings, asset
valuation process, recording of complaints among others.

Conclusion and Recommendations
98. This environmental and social review attests that the involuntary resettlement safeguards
process undertaken by the HRDP was very much compliant with the Bank's OP 4.12 and
OP 4.01 in terms of socio-economic survey, stakeholder consultation valuation of assets and
environmental safeguards. In the case of the FAWE school, the Kayonza District Land
Authorities followed a process that was 100% similar to the bank in terms of compensation
for loss of land and crops with the only set back or exception to the process was the delay in
compensation which not only contravened the OP 4.12 but has been the single most factor
that can be concluded as a cause of project negative impact to the PAPs.

99. The main recommendation of the 2009 audit was the need to expedite the compensation
of the PAPs including payment for loss of second season of crop harvest. These
recommendations were embraced quickly by MINEDUC through the facilitation and urging


                                            64
by the Bank and thus leading to the full compensation of the PAPs by the December 12,
2009.
The HRDP had also identified another piece of land adjacent to the existing land where the
FAWE School is under construction and wanted to acquire the land for constructing a water
tank to supply water to the school. The main recommendation during the 2009 audit study
was that the PAPs in this area should be compensated to the letter in accordance with the
bank procedures and a repeat in delay of payment as was the case with the FAWE School
was cautioned against. During the overall project review, it was noted that these 2 PAPs
have been fully compensated and they have no issues with the process which they state was
smooth and efficient.

100. The CSRDP component did not trigger any major resettlement issues based on the
schools sampled. It can be concluded that since this component focused heavily on
rehabilitation of schools, it would not lead to land acquisition or crop losses hence
triggering the OP 4.12. As shown in the section 4 of this report of the 1o schools visited,
only 2 of them triggered resettlement concerns because the land was owned by private
individuals. However, the compensation was undertaken through procedures that are found
to be satisfactory and consistent with the Bank's procedures.

101. Environmental safeguards did not feature prominently in this project in terms of
concern mainly because the project was already determined as Category C under the Banks
Environmental Assessment OP 4.01. This determination indicated that the HRDP would
not have any negative impacts on the environment with minimal civil works and vegetation
loss expected through out the county where the projects are located.

102. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Environmental and
Social Management Plan (ESMP) was prepared for the FAWE school and this document
interpreted in detail the potential negative impacts and proposed feasible mitigation
measures which has been duly followed during construction and operation almost to the last
detail with only a few oversight issues.

103. Even though there were no ESIA or ESMPs for the community school projects and
deservedly so because they involved rehabilitation of existing schools infrastructure hence
limited negative impact, due consideration to environmental safeguards was all the same
observed. Pit latrines were constructed in all the schools, vegetation was re-planted in areas
where destruction occurred and water provided aspects which indeed helped improve the
environmental situation.

104. The HRDP project is more or less closed and the recommendations should be used
primarily to help in the design of future projects through the lessons learned which should
be documented and used to improve other projects in Rwanda of similar nature.

105. The projects are now going to be fully run by the school administration under
MINEDUC and a key recommendation is the need for the school administration to elevate
sanitation and hygiene issues by keeping the latrines clean as they can be to avoid disease
spread or public health and sanitation concerns.



                                            65
106. Select staff from MINEDUC should be exposed to training in Environmental and
Social Safeguards especially those from the Department of Infrastructure. This form of
capacity building will help in monitoring of safeguards in future projects not necessarily
supported by the bank.
