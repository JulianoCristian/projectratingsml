loan was\n            approved. Both projects were cancelled in February of 1975\n            at the Borrowers request for the following reasons: (a) the\n            Borrower's reluctance to accept Bank procedures; (b)\n            the Borrower's changing view of reform and its impact\n            on specific project; (c) project management; (d) lack of\n            continuity of Bank and Borrower personnel. There were a few\n            lessons learned from these projects and are as follows: (1)\n            a more explicit analysis of risks might have suggested that\n            more modest targets would have been preferable. (2) The\n            extent to which flexibility could have been built into the\n            two projects, in such a way as to retain both a reform\n            complexion sufficient to justify Bank participation and\n            Spanish freedom to adapt reform en route, was not discussed\n            in advance. Such an advance discussion might have revealed\n            whether there was sufficient common ground (on such things\n            as procurement, the powers of the project unit, reform and\n            the projects themselves) on which to base project financing,\n            or whether there was consensus only for the more loosely\n            specified sector financing which the Borrower wished. (3)\n            The project experience emphasizes the need for project\n            implementation units (where they are deemed necessary) to be\n            closely linked with existing project services and\n            appropriately staffed and directed."}, "docdt": "1977-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
