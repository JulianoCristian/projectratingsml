The Third\n            Stage, to be carried out in three years at a total cost of\n            $30.4 million, would permit the further settlement of 17,700\n            hectares of irrigated land and the further improvement of\n            the 14,300 hectares already settled, bringing the total\n            settlement area in San Lorenzo to about 32,000 hectares. The\n            Third Stage would include equipment, facilities, consulting\n            services and credit to enable the settlers in the project\n            area to develop their farms in the most economical and\n            balanced way. The project would also include studies and\n            appropriate works to relieve the conditions of poor drainage\n            and salinity which threaten to affect the San Lorenzo\n            Development Area. Furthermore, the loan would provide funds\n            to finance the cost of a basin resources study as it has\n            become more and more evident that a basin program is needed\n            to assess, on a regional rather than on a piecemeal basis,\n            the water and related resources in the region and to chart\n            the implementation of a sound program for their utilization."}, "docdt": "1965-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
