The project was successful in\n            implementing most of its physical targets, however,\n            institutional strengthening components and the performance\n            of the borrower in providing a supportive policy and funding\n            environment has been disappointing. The key lessons learned\n            centered around the needs of a project in several areas\n            including: a) a strategy and broader conceptual framework;\n            b) sustainable water pricing and operation and maintenance;\n            c) participatory irrigation management and water user\n            associations; d) institutional development; e) integration\n            with agricultural development; f) coordination between\n            governmental agencies; and g) multi-disciplinary bank and\n            borrower staff inputs."}, "docdt": "1999-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
