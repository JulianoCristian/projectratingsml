                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of the proposed project, derived from the overarching program objective of NRAP, is to provide year-round access to basic services
                         and facilities in the rural areas of Afghanistan covered by the project. This will be achieved through rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access infrastructure by
                         contracting with the private sector and, to a lesser extent, with the communities. The achievement of the PDO will enhance the well being of the population and promote
                         equitable licit economic growth in the country.

                         contracts (709 km) and 205 tertiary road contracts (866 km) have been completed and opened to traffic. The pilot routine maintenance scheme has been going on covering 1858 km
                         of rural roads through direct contracting with 221 nearby communities. The institutional strengthening activities showed mixed progress. Few roads and bridges contracts encountered
                         delays attributed to security and weak contractor's capacity.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         -MPW and MRRD need to monitor the improvement in progress of problem projects and take measures to let the projects continue or other measures as per the action plan and
                         report to the Bank bi-weekly.
                         -The progress of activities under component C has been slow and will not likely be finished before the Grant closing date. MPW and MRRD to quickly submit a proposal to the bank to
                         restructure the Component.
                         -MRRD and MPW have concerns to implement the existing price adjustment mechanism and decided to simplify it.
                         -NERAP has engaged local communities for road rehabilitation and routine maintenance works. MRRD will launch an assessment of the performance of the scheme and disseminate
                         it at appropriate forums.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
