                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of the proposed project, derived from the overarching program objective of NRAP, is to provide year-round access to basic services
                         and facilities in the rural areas of Afghanistan covered by the project. This will be achieved through rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access infrastructure by
                         contracting with the private sector and, to a lesser extent, with the communities. The achievement of the PDO will enhance the well being of the population and promote
                         equitable licit economic growth in the country.

                         of rural roads through direct contracting with 288 nearby communities. The institutional strengthening is realigned and remaining activities have been started.

                         Considering the difficult environment and challenging security situation in Afghanistan, This is a significant achievement for both the Bank and the Client team. The roads already

                         opened to the traffic has made substantial impact on people's daily life by providing access to main economic and social centers across the villages and districts in Afghanistan. The
                         provision of year round access is made possible for these communities with rehabilitated road by the project and well received by the rural population. It has also generated
                         employment for the rural population by mobilizing the community in their area for road improvement and maintenance. The community based road rehabilitation proved to be a
                         successful mechanism to implement road project where security is a challenge.

                         Also, the project successfully implemented the pilot community based routine maintenance mechanism both secondary and tertiary road network by moralizing nearly 300 rural
                         community councils. The result of this pilot implementation has been praised by both the government and donor community. The project team has recorded the lesson learned from
                         the pilot and plans to incorporate them for the national roll out of routine maintenance program.

                         The data collection and processing for the follow up survey for impact evaluation has been completed and the team is working on data analysis and report writhing. Once the final
                         report released, we then will be able to update the outcome results.
