F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project's development objective was to provide year-round access to basic services
and facilities in rural areas of Afghanistan. This was to be achieved through rehabilitation
and maintenance of rural access infrastructure by contracting with the private sector and,
to a lesser extent, with the communities.



                                                 ii
  (The Financing Agreement has slightly different wording: "The objective of the Project
is to assist the Government in enabling the population living in its rural areas to benefit
from year-round access to basic services and facilities, through the rehabilitation and
maintenance of rural access infrastructure under the National Rural Access Program".)

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       After more than two decades of civil war and political turmoil, the Bonn Agreement in
2001 set the start to political transformation in Afghanistan, forming the basis for state-building
and development. In particular, the development of road networks made strides in reducing travel
times and improving rural access, school enrollments reached historic highs, health facilities
reached out into rural areas, commercial banks opened for business, and micro-finance programs
extended their services to thousands, especially women. While progress was made over the
following 5-6 years and GDP grew rapidly, the situation was far from normalized. The security
situation deteriorated in many parts of the country, spreading from the South to other regions,
hampering development efforts particularly in education and health. By 2007, nearly four out of
five Afghans still lived in rural areas and rural poverty remained widespread. One of the causes
was the lack of access, constraining the transition from opium poppy cultivation to licit rural
livelihoods 1.

2.       Rural reconstruction and improvement of livelihoods became a top government priority,
underpinned also in the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) developed for the
period 2008-2013. The National Rural Access Program (NRAP) was formulated as one of a series
of national priority programs in 2003; its first phase focused on generating rural employment,
covering all 34 provinces. By 2007, it had improved nearly 10,000 km of rural roads. The
program then evolved into carrying out a more conventional civil works program, including with
the development in 2007 of the National Emergency Rural Access Project (NERAP), which was
designed as part of the NRAP and to help improve accessibility, integrating the village economy
with regional and national markets. It aimed to induce higher productivity rates and outputs,
diversification of income sources, and technology transfer. NERAP also capitalized on the
Community Development Councils (CDCs), which had been set up under the National Solidarity
Program 2 , to start a program of community-led maintenance that would lead to the regular
maintenance of rural roads.

3.       This project, like the National Emergency Employment Program (Phase 1) operation that
preceded it, was prepared and processed in accordance with the Bank’s operations policy OP/BP
8.00 governing projects recognized as ‘rapid response to crises and emergencies’. The core
attributes of such operations compared to normal projects are rapid preparation, appraisal,
negotiation and approval, in recognition of the urgency under which the government and other
donors are operating, offset by a closer-than-normal degree of implementation assistance,
especially as regards speeding up procurement and intensifying financial management, and close
cooperative relations with UN agencies and other donors.

 In 2004 Afghanistan was said to produce nearly all of the world’s supply of opium (from which heroin is
derived). Since then Mexico has increased its production substantially, so that Afghanistan is now less
dominant in the world market.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
4.       The Project’s development objective, as stated in the IDA Financing Agreement, was to
assist the Government in enabling the population living in its rural areas to benefit from year-
round access to basic services and facilities through the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural
access infrastructure. This was to be achieved through rehabilitation and maintenance of rural
access infrastructure under the Government’s National Rural Access Program.

5.     The key indicators in the PAD for monitoring achievement of the PDO were --after
completion of the planned roads:
    (a) Travel time of beneficiaries living along the improved road to the first available schools,
        health care facilities and administrative services would be reduced by 30%.
    (b) The number of trips taken by beneficiaries living along the improved road to district
        centers would increase by 30%.
    (c) Prices of key consumption and production commodities at beneficiary villages would be
        within 15% of the price in the nearest town. 2

6.       The NERAP project as appraised had a total cost estimated at $137 million equivalent,
and foresaw that the works would be carried out from 2008 through mid-2010. The original
project closing date was December 31, 2010.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
7.      The Project Development Objective was not revised during the life of the project.
However, the scope of the project was expanded and additional financing was agreed in
December 2010 (see below), increasing the number of rural roads and bridges to be improved by
about 24%. The project objective remained unchanged, as did the outcome indicators. Additional
output indicators (also known as intermediate outcome indicators) were introduced at this stage
(Indicators 14-17).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.      The primary target group was the rural population that would be served by the roads to be
improved. Improvements of rural roads would connect rural communities to the nearest towns
and markets, improving farmers’ access and enabling them to get better prices for their produce
while lowering the cost of consumption essentials as well as farm inputs. Improvements of roads
would help bring remote communities within reach of doctors and medical facilities in the
provincial towns. Road maintenance and improvement works would create employment for men
in local communities. It was hoped that the creation of new jobs and improved prospects for
farming would reduce the incentive for villagers to grow opium poppies.

9.      Rural communities throughout the country would be eligible. The target groups are all
sections of the rural population who has no access to all season roads within a certain radius (say
2 km) as per the Bank's core sector indicator which was not there when the Bank launched this
project. The Ministries have used population, availability of access, traffic on the existing


2
  A further objective, implicitly secondary, was mentioned in the appraisal report but not in the Financing
Agreement: to monitor the impact that the completion of project interventions had on agricultural diversity
in areas where opium poppy was grown.


                                                     2
tracks/trails, etc as the selection criteria to prioritize the limited investment. The geographic
distribution would favor –for practical purposes of implementation—provinces with low security
risk. However, districts in which opium poppy had been widely grown, such as Balkh,
Badakhshan and Nangarhar, were identified to receive assistance; accordingly, 20-25% of Project
roads were in high-security-risk areas.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
10.     The project had three components: (A) improvement of secondary roads by the Ministry
of Public Works (MPW); (B) improvement of tertiary roads by the Ministry of Rural
Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD); and (C) institutional strengthening, project
management and program development, implemented by MRRD in coordination with MPW and
the National Coordination Unit (NCU). Each ministry would carry over and expand the project
implementation unit (PIU) that it had set up to manage the earlier NEEP project.

11.     Component A. Improvement of secondary roads ($78.2 million equivalent, including
contingencies and taxes, of which IDA would finance $53.2 million equivalent). This component,
to be implemented by MPW, had four sub-components: (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of
about 1,075 km of secondary rural roads; (ii) emergency repair works to roads and bridges
following natural disasters such as heavy snow and rain, rock falls, landslides and flooding; (iii)
environmental and social safeguards management, monitoring and evaluation; and (iv) project
implementation assistance to MPW.

12.     Component B. Improvement of tertiary roads ($52.1 million equivalent, including
contingencies and taxes, fully financed by IDA). This component, to be implemented by MRRD,
had 5 sub-components: (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of about 925 km of tertiary rural
roads; (ii) emergency repair works to roads and bridge; (iii) maintenance mainly of the roads
already rehabilitated under NEEP1 and NEEPRA; (iv) environmental and social sector
management; and (v) project implementation assistance to MRRD.

13.      Component C. Institutional strengthening, project management and program
development ($6.7 million equivalent, including contingencies and taxes, fully financed by IDA).
This component, to be implemented by MRRD in coordination with MPW, had three sub-
components: (i) development of a rural roads management system including support for: (a)
formulation of a rural access strategy and its implementation, and (b) establishment of a
maintenance mechanism, maintenance programming for the short and medium term, and support
for its first year of implementation, along with support for routine and emergency maintenance
works; (ii) capacity building activities for staff who would be tasked to manage the rural roads
sector; and (iii) project management, monitoring and evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components
14.      The components remained essentially unchanged, except for increases in the quantities of
civil works and some adjustment of the institutional strengthening and project management
activities (see below).

1.7 Other significant changes
15.      Mid-Term Review. On June 2010, the actual Mid-Term Review took place one year later
than expected and five months prior to project closing. Physical targets and funding increased
after the Mid-Term Review, held in June 2010. Project financing requirements were re-assessed
against the slower-than-expected implementation progress and cost over-runs, mainly in the
secondary roads and institutional components. The opportunity was taken to seek additional


                                                3
financing from the same two sources, IDA and ARTF, to enlarge the physical targets by about
25%, and to extend the completion date three years to December 31, 2013 (see Table 1 below). It
is important to mention that the additional financing to restructure the project took place in
November 2010, just one month prior to project closing. At that time the disbursement rate
reached about 80% from the original financing. Given that the additional financing to restructure
the project came late in the process and given that the project had reached 80% disbursement, the
weight of the implementation period will be based on the disbursement percentage at the time of
restructuring. Therefore, the project will be assessed against the original target.

16.     Budget realignment under institutional development project component: During the
extension period the mixed progress of the project’s institutional development activities led to
reallocation of funds from subcomponent C1 (institutional strengthening) to subcomponent C3
(project implementation support) –needed as a result of the increase in works funded by the
Additional Financing.

17.      Project Closing: The original Project closing date was December 31, 2010 by which the
disbursement was about 80%. In response to the early implementation delays and to allow the
Project to be enlarged, it was extended by three years from December 31, 2010 to December 31,
2013. At the time of the final ISR (dated February 2014), it was expected that about less than
$500,000 of the total of $232 million would be canceled.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18.      Soundness of the background analysis and design: The project responded to the
Government’s rural transport priorities and provided substantial continuity from the previous
Bank-supported National Emergency Employment Program, with the same broad framework but
with the objective of scaling up to reach more rural communities. Lessons learned from earlier
operations included: (a) post-conflict projects required good understanding of local social
structures and an ability to work with local leaders; (b) projects should be kept simple, aligning
with the concept of an emergency project; (c) rapid rotation of staff on the client side had to be

                                                4
expected, which presented a big challenge for continuity; (d) capacity building efforts should be
targeted at those directly involved in project implementation, not at a general pool; and (e) Bank
management needed to be flexible and hold modest expectations.

19.    Participatory processes: The project was prepared in a participatory manner with the
involvement of key stakeholders including government ministries, designated government
implementation agencies, local and district government units, development partners,
nongovernmental organization (NGO).

20.     Adequacy of government commitment: The Ministry of Finance showed a high level of
commitment during the appraisal by funding $18 million from its own budget, subsequently
reimbursed by IDA as retroactive financing. This made it possible for timely commencement of
31 construction contracts.

21.     Risks and Mitigation Measures: Risk is inherently higher in these emergency contexts,
and expectations need to be adjusted in line with what can be reasonably achieved in the
reconstruction phase. Risk factors were identified during the Project design and mitigation
measures were proposed. Details on how these measures were implemented are given below (para.
23).

22.     However, four issues arose during implementation that had not been adequately
addressed during preparation, two of which caused long delays while the third distracted scarce
management resources from effective monitoring of results, and the fourth led to cost over-runs:

    (a) The condition of effectiveness –to have the (i) implementation consultant in place and (ii)
        setting up the National Coordination Unit--was not met until more than a year after the
        Board approved the funding, which was inconsistent with the concept of an emergency
        project. Either the project should not have been given that label, or appointment of the
        implementation consultant should have been a condition of Board presentation –or should
        not have been set at all.

    (b) The large-scale training program defined in the appraisal report (‘Technical Annex’)
        under Component C(2) seems to have been inadequately thought through before Board
        presentation. The many elements of the training program were packaged into a single
        contract with a consultant (referred to thereafter as the capacity-building consultant), for
        which $2.5 million were allocated –a solution which elicited no acceptable proposals,
        delaying implementation of the training tasks by two years before alternative solutions
        were put in place.

    (c) Among the many project performance indicators, pride of place was given to
        measurement of outcomes rather than outputs. The output approach (simple to carry out
        and providing useful feedback about progress during implementation) had already been
        tried and tested under the previous project, but not the outcome approach. It proved to be
        far more demanding to plan, carry out and interpret than the more basic output measures,
        and ultimately delivered ambivalent conclusions. In short, it was inappropriate for an
        emergency project in an insecure environment.

    (d) If specific design standards had been set for basic access roads --the minimum needed to
        ensure year-round access-- the gradual raising of design standards experienced in MPW
        could have been avoided.


                                                 5
23.    No official quality at entry assessment of this project was carried out by the Quality
Assurance Group.

24.           For the reasons given above, the quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
25.      Superimposed on the project design weaknesses noted above, deteriorating security since
early 2008 had a profound impact on the implementation timetable and delivery cost of the
project. Despite good working relations between the Bank team in Kabul and the two PIUs, some
developments slowed the implementation schedule severely:

      (i)         No specific design standard was adopted for basic access roads until late 2011;
      (ii)        Lacking such standards and specifications, the engineering studies tended to over-
                  design the roads and bridges relative to the ‘basic access’ concept, contributing to
                  increased prices;
      (iii)       Deteriorating security led to increases in contract prices and time overruns;
      (iv)        Poor compliance with fiduciary management norms on account of inadequate internal
                  controls, mainly pertaining to MRRD;
      (v)         Poor safeguard management on account of mainly inadequate staffing in the MPW.

26.      A major risk foreseen was the lack of management capacity among Afghanistan’s few
civil works contractors. In response, the PIUs have given them training in how to prepare bids
and manage their working capital. Project documents have been translated into local languages
and adjusted to match contractor capacity more closely. A further risk was the duplication of
initiatives by the two ministries, supported by the programs of various donors. The donors
recommended creation of a single road agency serving both ministries to pool the scarce human
resources available, but the Government did not accept this recommendation. Instead, the risks
associated with the shortage of management capacity were reduced by the development of a rural
access strategy and framework, to bring more uniformity into the setting of priorities and design
standards, backed by a geographic information system-based Rural Roads Management System
now operating in both ministries. Their staff have been given training and study tours.
Throughout, the National Coordination Unit and the inter-ministerial steering committee chaired
by MoF have worked to reduce the risk of duplication or disparate standards.

Emergency and Security Factors in Project Implementation
27.     The Project was designed and prepared under emergency conditions. However,
deteriorating security conditions at many sub-projects (see Annex 7) prevented the project staff
from carrying out detailed surveys and other field work to prepare designs for road rehabilitation
schemes. State institutions had severe capacity constraints, not only entailing security-related
expenses, but also diminishing the interest of international consulting firms to participate in
bidding for the technical assistance.

28.     As security deteriorated, it became harder for Ministry and Bank staff to visit project sites
regularly to make sure that works were being completed as planned and to the prescribed
standards. An effective solution was found by contracting an international private company
specializing in monitoring and reporting on civil works, using Afghan employees equipped with
smart phones (see Section 3.2).



                                                       6
Quality of Supervision Assessment
29.    No such assessment was carried out.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     M&E Design: Given the emergency nature of the project, the output, outcome and sector
indicators (Annex 1 of the PAD) were designed to focus on the emergency response and time-
bound objectives of facilitating transport and access in the shortest possible time. For each
indicator specific target dates were set. In hindsight they were too numerous and too demanding
to be monitored and reported systematically and consistently –especially the several output
indicators added at the time the Additional Financing was processed.

31.      M&E Implementation: The Bank supervision missions focused on assessing these
indicators and assisting the Government in overcoming implementation difficulties. The
supervision reports assessed achievement of these indicators at different time intervals. The
performance ratings focused more on the degree of achievement than the time taken. The M&E
effort that the Bank team put into the supervision helped the Government implement the Project
and achieve the development objective.

32.       Due to the deteriorating security in many of the regions, monitoring of progress at project
sites was difficult. Some civil contracts also suffered from poor performance due to heightened
insecurity, compounded by weaknesses in some contractors’ management of the works, for both
secondary and tertiary roads. Efforts to strengthen the M&E systems were thus made in the face
of these challenges. Both PIUs set up M&E units to collate and analyze data and produce the
required reporting. Action plans were formulated against which to monitor progress and the
MRRD made it a formal requirement for completion certificates of civil works to be tied to a final
site visit of the M&E team. Additionally, the third-party monitoring system mentioned above was
set up to verify the quality of civil works, funded by ARTF and implemented by an independent
international company. A mechanism was pro-actively established within each PIU to interact
with this firm’s engineers and to address the issues identified in the inspections. As reported in
the ISR of May 2013, in the space of 12 months alone, the third-party monitor was able to
conduct more than 200 site inspections of NERAP across all of Afghanistan. Through the life of
the project, the MRRD PIU was able to improve the M&E system significantly, while MPW
lagged in revising its framework to some extent. However, MPW was able to achieve some
important progress through establishing closer coordination of the regional engineers and
contractors in managing the resources at site.

33.      In support of M&E activities, a Geographic Information System was developed. Data
collection, which started under this project, will thus be continued with the succeeding project –
Afghanistan Rural Access Project (ARAP).

34.    Impact Evaluation: The key performance indicators (KPIs) by which to evaluate
achievement of the project development objective fell into two categories:
    (a) measures of outcomes: a set of socio-economic impact indicators that would capture

      (b) measures of outputs 3: a set of straightforward project implementation statistics, the central
      one being the length of roads and bridges built or improved.
35.     Assessing the project outcomes and impacts was based on a rigorously designed impact
evaluation, that proved hard to implement as intended. The survey design and its challenges are
explained in Annex 9.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance
36.      Environment: This project has seen a substantial improvement in the environmental
safeguards in both current arrangements and the compliance level, leading to a rating as
satisfactory. In the first years of project implementation the PIUs had very few qualified
environmental specialists, who were stretched thin. The compliance rating improved after the
mid-term review, as the PIUs hired more specialists and training was provided to strengthen the
expertise of each ministry. The safeguards units prepared a number of environmental
management plans and, over the latter project periods, monitoring, supervision and reporting
mechanisms have been enhanced with ample staffing to improve coordination between design
team and safeguards focal points. Both the quality of the works in the field as well as the plans for
safeguard compliance have been satisfactory.

37.     Social: In the early stages of the project, poor records of land transactions and the
borrower’s lack of social safeguards capacity to handle land/asset acquisition were key concerns
and in some cases led to substantial delay. This lesson learned should be adopted in the ARAP to
avoid similar issues in the future. However, the PIUs made progress in overall social safeguards
performance over the life of the project, now rated as satisfactory. In particular, the PIUs made
substantial progress in terms of documentation and maintaining records of land/asset acquisition
and consultation with affected communities. NERAP activities generally focused on the existing
rights of way and involved only minor land/assets acquisitions. For each sub-project, the
Borrower prepared site-specific social management plans with strip plans and, for the sub-
projects that involved land/asset acquisition, abbreviated resettlement action plans. Where
projects caused impacts on private or community structures (for example private boundary-walls
and irrigation channels), the PIUs included a budget for rehabilitation and restoration of the
affected structures as part of the contract.

38.      Lastly, project-level grievance redress committees were established for a number of sub-
projects implemented during the final two years. However, their scope and reach was limited.
Grievances could only be lodged with the Social Inclusion Committees, made up of community
members. Although headquarters-level Grievance Handling Committees were in place, the PIUs
made little effort to inform the relevant communities about this service. The PIUs should have
established multiple grievance uptake locations and multiple channels for receiving grievances.
Additional awareness-raising among the affected communities would also have been necessary. A
number of complaints were recorded by the PIUs, based on the third-party monitoring reports,
and land disputes comprised the single largest category of complaints.

Fiduciary Compliance
39.      Procurement: The last project implementation support mission of November 24 to
December 10, 2013 identified that all procurement activities under the project had been
successfully completed, except for two consultancy activities under Component C, which were
not finalized and would be completed under ARAP, i.e. the development of the rural road strategy
and maintenance strategy. The procurement capacity of the PIUs has significantly improved and
most of the activities are undertaken by the local procurement professionals. While the difficulty
to attract international consultants and the lack of local capacity affected procurement through the
life of the project, the implementing agencies pro-actively addressed these issues, including
through capacity building. For instance, some procurement functions related to community-based
construction and maintenance contracts were delegated to the regional/provincial offices on a
pilot basis. This helped cope with the management challenges of hundreds of small contracts
spread all over the country. No mis-procurement cases were recorded and the result of the PPR
assessment was satisfactory. The Client completed the simplified mechanism for price adjustment
clause and decided to apply it to contracts with delay as a result of technical issues, mainly
beyond the contractor’s control. During most of the six years of implementation procurement was
rated moderately satisfactory.

40.      Financial management capacity: The FM capacity of MRRD was relatively adequate
and strengthened through the life of the project, with support from UNOPS only when required.
However, the FM capacity of MPW was weak and FM functions were carried out entirely by
UNOPS until the last year of the project, when they were gradually handled by MPW through FM
consultants procured under ARAP. Overall, FM performance improved after the mid-term review
as a result of improved coordination between UNOPS, MRRD and MPW to carry out FM
functions. The FM performance rating for the project was upgraded from moderately satisfactory
to satisfactory in the last half year.

41.     Financial management reporting: In particular, quarterly interim financial reports
(IFRs) were submitted periodically and included all required information. Submission delays
occurred in the early stages due to coordination issues, but these were resolved and the timelines
of the submission improved in 2013. MRRD consolidated IFRs covering transactions of the two
government agencies and consultant agency, i.e. MRRD, MPW and UNOPS, which were
prepared by UNOPS. In the project’s early years financial management was rated moderately
unsatisfactory, but in the last three years improved gradually to end as satisfactory.

42.      Internal controls were satisfactory at both central and implementing agency level, as
well as for UNOPS. Internal audits carried out in the later years of the project did not identify any
significant issues. However, UNOPS internal audits were not made available to the Bank for
review. As regards external audit, all Bank-funded projects use the country systems, and audits
are carried out by the Supreme Audit Office with support from an international audit firm. There
were delays in submission in some years due to delays in mobilization of the audit team carrying
out the audit on the ground. The last audit was for FY1391 (March 21 to December 20, 2012) and
was submitted on July 17, 2013 (vs. due on June 20, 2013). The auditors issued an unqualified
(clean) opinion with no significant observations requiring client response or action. All previous
audit observations have been satisfactorily resolved. The audit report and management letter for
FY1392 (Dec 21, 2012 to Dec 20, 2013) are due by June 20, 2014. The audit is in progress.

43.     Disbursement: All grants closed on December 31, 2013, by which time the initial IDA
grant and the ARTF grant had been fully disbursed, while 0.1% of the IDA Additional Financing
grant remained undisbursed. All three instruments have a grace period up to June 30, 2014. The


                                                 9
designated accounts and float account outstanding balances to be documented by the end of the
grace period are to be found in Annex 4 (Financial Management).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
44.     Over the past decade the need for improved rural access has far exceeded the capacity of
the government and foreign aid agencies to deliver. The government and the donor community
continue to give priority to further funding for rural access, while encouraging the two ministries
to continue their efforts to expand and enhance their institutional capacity.

45.     These continuing initiatives are now being implemented under the follow-on project
ARAP, for which a grant of $125 million was approved in June 2012. It became effective in
October 2012, for implementation over a period of five years (completion target: September 2017,
closing date: March 2018). Its development objective and composition are very similar to those of
NERAP, with somewhat larger output targets: 1,250 km of secondary roads (under MPW) and
1,300 km of tertiary roads (under MRRD). Its institutional component elaborated on those of its
predecessor projects: network planning, a network development and managing system, and
setting appropriate design standards. It also stressed further capacity building in financial
management, maintenance contracting, and outsourcing of some government functions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.      Relevance of Objective. The project objectives remain highly relevant to the development
priorities. Rural Access has been central to the second pillar of the Bank’s Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) for 2009-2011 of “promoting growth of the rural economy and improving rural
livelihoods”. The ISN for 2012-2014 approved in 2012 focuses on “institutions and programs that
can sustainably ensure equitable delivery of basic services across the country and for all Afghans.
The improvement of access for rural communities has remained highly relevant, in view of the
very low indicators at the outset and the priority that the Government has given to these programs
-and continues to through the follow-on project, ARAP, now under implementation.

47.      It is significant that, to make sure that rural roads are maintained, the task has been
widely contracted out to the community development councils (CDCs), a core institution
established under the National Solidarity Program to strengthen governance at the village level, or
(where none has been set up) to the Shura of village elders. Even some improvement works have
been contracted out to CDCs; experience shows that they have performed at least as well as
conventional contractors and sometimes better. Accordingly, the relevance of the project is rated
high.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

48.       The Project’s development objective was to assist the Government in enabling the
population living in its rural areas to benefit from year-round access to basic services and
facilities through the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access infrastructure. This was
measured through the key outcome indicators of the project, which included reduction of travel
time, increase of number of trips, percentage prices of key consumption and production
commodities. Most of the project targets were achieved and/or surpassed.




                                                10
49.     Outcome targets: As noted above, the ‘baseline’ and ‘endline’ surveys have been
conducted and large quantities of data have been collected and processed. They confirm that
improvements in access to markets and health services have indeed occurred among rural
communities served by this project 4. The surveys’ findings are summarized in Section 3.6 below,
and in more detail in Annex 9.

50.     Output targets: By December 31, 2013, the closing date of the Grants, the main output
indicator targets had been achieved and even exceeded: by 68% in the case of secondary roads
and 62% in the case of tertiary roads (see Annex 2).

51.      Considerable improvement has been seen in the performance of both MRRD and MPW.
MRRD showed commitment and capacity from early on; MPW strengthened is performance over
time. The two ministries now work more closely together in a cooperative spirit. Both have
achieved the outputs of their respective component: by the closing date the funds were fully
disbursed on appropriate improvements to rural roads and bridges, with only moderate increases
in unit costs (more for MPW than MRRD). The capacity building component (C) has also shown
a substantial improvement since the 2010 mid-term review, notably through the transfer of
responsibility from UNOPS to each ministry for contract management, retaining UNOPS only as
a consultant/advisor.

52.     Support systems, notably monitoring and evaluation of project works, had dragged
ineffectually up to the time of the Mid-Term Review. Short-term advisors had designed
appropriate systems, assuming that local capacity would be available to implement them, but in
the absence of the planned Capacity Building Consultant, these remained only proposals awaiting
implementation. Since then, the management systems have become substantially effective within
each ministry. Both are using essentially the same systems for planning, subproject identification
and prioritization, and for financial management. The same applies to safeguards.

53.      As the NERAP project is completed, the follow-on project has started up to continue
further improvement of the rural network of roads and bridges. This is a very similar program; the
KPIs are the same. One of these –the number of people served by a year-round road passing
within 2 km of their home—was added in both projects in 2012 in accordance with a Bank-wide
policy instruction. ‘Year-round’ roads are from now on to be defined more specifically as
‘accessible to motor vehicles’ (i.e. rather than just mules or other beasts of burden).

54.     Efficacy of the Project in achieving its development objective is rated high.

3.3 Efficiency:
55.      No formal cost-benefit evaluation has been feasible for each works contract (road
sections rarely exceed 10 km), partly because the expected accessibility benefits are by their
nature hard to value, and partly because of the complications specific to Afghanistan arising from
the security situation. AUSAID has contributed a formal points-based evaluation system for
rating works needed on Afghanistan’s secondary roads (see Annex 3). For the various pavements
and terrain types, it suggests threshold volumes of motorized traffic that justify the corresponding
capital expenditure, so that sub-project economic viability can be estimated by reference to traffic



4
  The baseline survey showed that most schools are within walking distance of villages, so that road
improvements have not had much direct impact on school attendance.


                                                    11
counts and forecasts. Each ministry takes these thresholds into account in their annual planning
exercise, when they choose which road sections and which bridges requested by local
stakeholders should be given priority.

56.      The ‘grade creep’ mentioned earlier meant higher construction costs serving given traffic
volumes. While this persisted, it detracted somewhat from the project’s net economic benefits.
However, the setting of design standards more closely reflecting expected traffic volumes, and
their enforcement, has made sure that the works remain economically viable. No formal benefit-
cost analysis has been done for the maintenance component and emergency repairs, but
international experience shows that these almost always have a high economic return.

57.     Thus, the project’s efficiency (cost-effectiveness) is rated moderate.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
58.     The project was highly relevant to Afghanistan’s post-conflict recovery and central to the
Bank’s development strategy for it. The project achieved its primary development objective of
enabling the population living in its rural areas to benefit from year-round access to basic services
and facilities through the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access infrastructure. Some of
the project targets related to the institutional development were reached only partially, but will be
completed in the follow-up project. Overall, the two ministries have a good record of
implementing key steps of institutional reform.

59.      The operation was subject to a moderate time and cost over-run. The Additional
Financing (IDA and ARTF) enlarged the total funding by 63% to cover physical targets about
25% greater, doubling the implementation period from three years to six. The Project achieved
adequate economic efficiency in the major infrastructure components, and responded to the
client’s emergency needs under a difficult security situation. Weak capacity, sustainability, and
institutional reform issues remain, which continue to be addressed in follow-up Bank operations,
as well as in Afghanistan’s own programs.

60.      Considering the Project’s high relevance to country priorities, its high efficacy in
achieving the PDO and its moderate efficiency, its overall outcome is rated moderately
satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61.     In this post-conflict environment, the alleviation of rural poverty, while not an explicit
objective of the project, was nonetheless an implicit goal, since most of its beneficiaries fall
below the poverty threshold. Women and girls in Afghanistan face severe restrictions on their
mobility for social/religious reasons. A National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment carried out in
2007-8 with EU assistance, found that life expectancy among women was barely 50 years and
infant mortality was very high. Experience with similar projects in other countries (e.g.
Morocco 5 ) lends strong support to the premise that improved accessibility is central to the

  In about 1995 the Bank’s IEG published a detailed case study of Bank-financed rural roads in Morocco,
evaluating their economic impacts after ten years of use.


                                                   12
alleviation of rural poverty, as well as to improvement of many social indicators for women and
girls.

62.     In 2009 the project team commissioned a consultant to examine rural transport demand
and supply in relation to women’s health and education needs and the social constraints that limit
their mobility.

63.       The impact analysis gave the following findings:

      •   Positive but often insignificant effects were recorded on consumption. Such effects were
          stronger among the poorest 30 percent in the sample.
      •   Off-farm activity increased for both men and women; but this was also observed among
          control villages.
      •   The number of mothers who gave birth with a medically assisted delivery increased (but
          so did mothers in the ‘control’ villages).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64.      Building capacity in MPW and MRRD has been a central institutional development
objective from the start of the Bank’s involvement in Afghanistan in 2002. Recruiting and
training has enabled the ministries to appoint more than one expert per key function, and some
supervisory functions have been devolved to regional engineers and laboratories. Furthermore,
establishment of GIS-based networking planning, a cost estimation system, introduction of a rural
road maintenance scheme, development of a rural road strategy draft, and transfer of
responsibilities from UNOPS to ministries have been part of the achievements in institutional
change.

65.     The maintenance of rural roads under this project has been facilitated by taking
advantage of the National Solidarity Program (see para. 44). Community participation has been
more effective in maintaining the rural roads upgraded under the project, compared to traditional
force account maintenance by government-managed work brigades.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
66.     None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

67.     According to the impact evaluation surveys, at endline 54.6 percent of treatment areas
received a road project with which they were satisfied in the previous 5 years, while 52.5 percent
of control areas received a road project with which they were satisfied in the previous 5 years. If
the analysis is restricted only to the villages that received a road project, 78 percent of the
treatment villages report satisfaction with their projects, while in the case of the control group the
figure was higher, at 89 percent. (See Annex 9 for details.)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High




                                                 13
Security risk:
68.      Much will depend on the outcome of the April 2014 presidential election and the security
situation after the withdrawal of US military forces, planned to be nearly complete by the end of
2014 –unless the new president negotiates otherwise. If security deteriorates, it may deter travel,
and it may deter timely maintenance of the roads improved under the project. In Afghanistan’s
many mountainous provinces roads and bridges are vulnerable to snow and ice in the winter and
flash floods in the spring. Community-based maintenance contracts are designed to put the tools
of maintenance in the hands of the beneficiary communities, which have the strongest interest in
seeing their access roads kept open to motor vehicles. For these reasons the donor community is
expected to keep its funding level high.

Government capacity risk in managing the project:
69.      Apart from the security risk, other major risks are corruption in financial transactions and
especially the award of contracts and the payment of contractors’ invoices. Project managers have
addressed the controllable risks (the security risk being essentially beyond their control), putting
in place management systems to make transactions as transparent and consistent as possible.
Initiatives are being pursued to reduce the number of signatures needed in the award of works
contracts and the processing of invoices. And the development and dissemination of a strategic
plan for rural roads imposes constraints on political manipulation of the geographic distribution
of subprojects and the selection of the roads and bridges to be built.

70.      Another category of risk is that the ministries will continue to find it difficult to attract
and retain qualified managers, engineers and other specialists. The continuing shortage of skilled
staff leaves the above systems vulnerable.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e. performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
71.      At appraisal the Bank project team conducted a comprehensive analysis of the required
aspects, learning from the previous project and mobilizing all necessary skills. The appraisal
report (‘Technical Annex’) was exceptionally thorough and detailed, probably more than the
norm for an emergency operation. Its analysis of risks was comprehensive. On the other hand, it
raises questions about the proposed focus during implementation, which in keeping with
emergency operations should have aimed to ‘keep things simple’ and put special emphasis on
systems to guide and monitor procurement and financial management.

72.      For measuring success, the preceding project NEEP had used output indicators (length of
roads improved, etc.), whereas this project used as key project indicators changes in socio-
economic behavior among the beneficiary communities. While conceptually sound as
justification for the project design, in practice the complexities of monitoring and evaluating these
indicators during implementation proved difficult and to some extent inconclusive (mainly
because of contamination). The administrative complexity and risk of inconclusive results seem
not to have been adequately foreseen. In particular the risk that many control villages would
receive similar assistance from other donors was substantially underestimated. Had the baseline
survey been conducted before appraisal was completed, this might have become clearer, but it
was not launched until more than half a year after Board approval.

                                                 14
73.     The condition of effectiveness –that the Government should have entered into contracts
with the Implementation Consultant (UNOPS)-- was warranted, but it held up effectiveness for 11
months after Board approval. It can be argued that no such condition should have been set for an
emergency project.

74.     The risk was not foreseen that hiring the capacity-building consultant would take two
years and the team finally mobilized by direct negotiation would be so weak that its contract was
terminated.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
75.      Most team members have been resident in Kabul, allowing them to engage closely and
frequently with the implementing agencies, MPW and MRRD, thanks to their proximity and good
working relations. Implementation support missions were conducted with appropriate frequency:
twice every year, and reported soundly in detail. Reflecting the slow start to implementation, the
Mid-Term Review was delayed by a year, finally being conducted half a year before the planned
completion. It was very thorough and detailed, recommending appropriate adjustments in the
definition of targets and means to strengthen the project’s capacity building.

76.     One short-coming was the inadequate attention given to how the outcome indicators were
to be measured by the baseline and end-line surveys. This seems to be attributable to the fact that
the baseline survey was managed by a team from a different unit within Bank headquarters,
suggesting a lack of close dialogue with the Project Team, most of whose members were in Kabul.

77.     The additional financing introduced far too many intermediate outcome indicators that
added little value --not appropriate for an emergency operation that needed to be kept simple.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
78.     The overall rating reflects the Bank’s performance both at appraisal, during
implementation, and in the preparation of this completion report. It also takes into account that
the PIUs have expressed appreciation for the Bank’s support and have requested continued
operations. Overall the Bank team was able to accomplish and achieve all the outcome and output
indicators that warrant them an overall Satisfactory rating

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
79.     The Ministry of Finance showed a high level of commitment during the appraisal by
financing $18 million as retroactive financing. This made it possible for commencement of 31
construction contracts. The National Coordination Unit, the senior government entity overseeing
the project, has performed appropriately in giving strategic guidance to the two implementing
ministries. Its managers have provided continuity throughout the project’s implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
80.      Among the Bank’s 13 implementation support missions, the first (June 2008) rated the
Government’s implementation performance moderately unsatisfactory, the two in 2009 rated it
satisfactory, and all the other 10 ISRs (the second half of 2008 and all in 2010 through 2013)

                                               15
rated it moderately satisfactory (see Annex 6). The hiring of the institutional development
consultant was delayed two years by the need for re-bidding twice and finally, direct negotiation
with one firm, which then fielded a team that performed poorly. The shortage of qualified staff
(identified as a high risk) made it hard to devolve functions from Kabul to the regions during the
first three years. Cost overruns were significant among secondary roads. Since the mid-term
review drew attention to these two problems and the additional financing was launched, MRRD
has shown greater readiness than MPW to adopt and apply the management systems that the
Bank recommended. Procurement and financial management were rated moderately satisfactory
until the project’s final year, when they were upgraded to satisfactory. Application of safeguards,
initially moderately unsatisfactory, improved to satisfactory half-way through the 6-year
implementation period and remained so. In short, performance started low but built up gradually,
in difficult times.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
81.      This rating reflects the gradual improvement in the ministries’ performance of the various
key functions over time. It also sums up the achievement of most planned outputs, but with an
extension of the implementation period from 3 to 6 years and Additional Financing that increased
the financing by 65% while the output quantities increased by only about 25%.

6. Lessons Learned
1. The condition of effectiveness, which was inconsistent with the concept of an emergency
    project, should be avoided to ensure project implementation move forward quickly.

2. In a country emerging from decades of civil war, close coordination, collaboration, support,
    and training are essential. Given the implementing ministries’ limited institutional capacity,
    close and frequent contacts between them and the Bank project team, mostly resident in
    country, have been essential. Continuity of key staffing in both the implementing agencies
    and the Bank is very important but hard to deliver, especially where the security situation
    remains poor.

3. This project confirmed that the key management issues for emergency projects are to keep
    the design simple and performance rating system likewise - stick to outputs, not outcomes -
    and to put in place the capacity and systems to monitor implementation closely, especially
    procurement and financial management. Where implementation consultants have a key role
    to play, their appointment should be made a condition of Board presentation.

4. Where secondary roads are managed by one ministry and tertiary roads by another, but
   qualified managers and engineers are scarce, there is a strong argument for setting up a
   single road agency for levels of the road network, to take full advantage of the limited skills
   available.

5. For a simple project in post-conflict areas a defined road design standard agreed during
    preparation can prevent significant cost and time overruns. Such a road design standard
    should be part of the legal agreement.

6. Third-party monitoring has proved very effective in such a difficult security context.
7. Going to beneficiary communities for routine maintenance of tertiary roads has proved more
   effective than traditional force account maintenance by the government. This approach to



                                                16
    routine maintenance of rural roads may be replicable in other countries that are applying the
    community-driven development model.
8. In projects that warrant making socio-economic indicators their primary KPIs, it is crucial
    that the baseline and endline impact evaluation surveys be designed in a consistent and
    harmonized manner to ensure the usefulness between the two surveys.

                              Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component A – Improvement of 1,105 km of secondary roads and related activities:

Procurement of civil works: MPW has completed all of the 138 civil works contracts and
opened them to traffic. Their total length is 1,124 km (146% of the original target) for secondary
roads. It has also completed 1,458m of bridges (224% of the original target).

Component B-Improvement of 1,195 km of tertiary roads and related activities:

Procurement of civil works: Road construction/rehabilitation works as of December 31st, 2013
were 1,349 km for tertiary roads and 1,602 meter of bridges. The length of roads improved
exceeded by 13% the revised target adopted in mid-2010.

Piloting Routine Maintenance System: Good progress had been made toward setting up a
routine maintenance system and implementation of pilot routine maintenance of rural roads. The
MRRD PIU successfully had contracted out 2,400 km of rural roads to communities for routine
maintenance and from the assessment done by the PIU, it seems the system is working well and
the result is satisfactory. The program plans to roll it out nationally with necessary modifications
learned from pilot practice.

Component C - Institutional strengthening, project management and program
development:

1.      MRRD implements this component, in coordination with MPW and NCU. It is
disaggregated into three sub-components:

2.       Sub-Component C(i) - Setting up a rural roads management system: This sub-
component comprises: (a) the formulation of a rural access strategy, (b) the setting up of
maintenance mechanisms, maintenance programming for the short and medium term and support
for its implementation, complementing the routine and emergency maintenance works foreseen
under Components A and B.

3.       The maintenance mechanism is now in place with significant improvement. A draft for
rural road strategy has been prepared, but needs further improvement and enhancement. In mid-
2013 the project team mobilized a consultant who carried out the review and enhancement of the
strategy.

4.       Sub-Component C(ii) - Capacity Building Activities: This covers various activities
including: (a) capacity building of staff who will be tasked to manage the rural road sector, (b)
internships with NRAP for at least 100 engineering and 10 community development students; (c)
short-term and long-term overseas training for managerial staff, and (d) capacity building for
domestic contractors and engineering firms. At project conception, four priority areas have been
identified for training: (i) technical and engineering; (ii) broad-based training in environmental
and social safeguards; (iii) contractors’ training; and (iv) general skills in use of computers and
English literacy for staff. As part of the additional financing for the project, three new activities
have been included in this sub-component: (i) establishing a network planning and cost
estimation system, (ii) finalizing a rural road standard including basic road access, and



                                                 20
developing the accompanying technical specification, (iii) implementing a pilot for
mainstreaming gender inclusive planning.

5.       As with Sub-Component C(i), this was hampered by the departure of the capacity-
building consultant. In the area of staff training and skill development, many in-house and
overseas training have been conducted for the staff including English language training session
for the PIUs’ staff.

6.      The following four main tasks were completed in the last months before the funding
closed at the end of December, 2013:

    •   Enhancement of current network planning system to a GIS-based network planning to
        cover all rural road network.
    •   Final drafting of the Afghanistan Rural Road Strategy;
    •   Updating the rural road engineering design standard and improving the cost estimation
        system to the next level of advancement;
    •   Development of the maintenance guidelines and manual according to the Government
        Maintenance Strategy to cover all types of road classifications.

7.      Sub-Component C(iii) - Project Management Support: This sub-component covered
project management support, financing the National Coordination Unit’s operating costs, support
to monitoring and evaluation, audits and fiduciary support services for MPW and MRRD,
preparation of the Mid-term Review and technical expertise to support the Steering Committee.

                                                      C. Outcomes/Impact Evaluation

        The National Emergency Rural Access Project (NERAP) sought to rehabilitate much-
needed rural roads and improve access to services. In this regard, it has been a mixed success.
The impact evaluation provides suggestive evidence that access to an all-season road and the
number of trips taken to the district center increased as a result of the project; these changes
largely did not result in increased uptake of services, particularly health services, compared with
the control villages. However, almost 60 percent of the control villages also received road
projects and some of the treatment villages received other roads than NERAP as well. Thus, the
estimated impact of the project is difficult to interpret; it should be interpreted rather as impact
relative to other road projects. Other key findings include a slight increase in household food
consumption.




                                                                        22
Comparing the data from the endline survey against the baseline survey, and (where feasible)
netting out changes observed in control villages, gives the following findings.

    •   Suggestive evidence that travel time by motorized transportation from villages to the
        district center did decrease. Results suggest that the project resulted in a shorter travel
        time to the district center (around 2.2 hours) and a greater number of trips (roughly 25
        trips/year). However, the majority of the results are not significant. Still, NERAP seems
        to have significantly improved access to an all-season road by 18 percent. This result was
        significant at the 10 percent level.

    •   The number of trips taken to the district center is the only outcome variable that exhibits
        a lot of heterogeneity in outcomes. Those in farther-away villages were significantly less
        likely to have benefitted from the project than those in closer villages, though both farther
        and closer villages still increased their number of trips to the district center by a few
        dozen times per year. Those villages with greater populations were also more likely to
        have benefitted.

    •   Access to an all-season road increased and so did access to health services. A desired
        outcome of the road rehabilitation program was to decrease travel time to the nearest
        health facility and increase use of health services. Results are mixed. On the one hand,
        travel time to the nearest hospital seems to have increased in treatment villages, although
        this increase in time is insignificant. On the other hand, the percent of respondents
        reporting travel to the nearest hospital or clinic increased in treatment villages; these
        results are also not significant but are slightly stronger than the results for travel time.
        The point estimates are also relatively large; approximately 20 percent more of the
        population went to the hospital or clinic the last time they were ill. Therefore, people may
        be accessing nearest hospitals or clinics despite not reporting a decrease in travel time.

                        Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

 The programmatic nature of the civil works funded under the project –mainly hundreds of small
 contracts for improvement of roads averaging 10 km in length, as well as routine maintenance
 contracts and the purchase of equipment for emergency road repairs—it is infeasible to conduct
 an economic or financial analysis other than on a small sample of roads, from which general
 conclusions may be drawn.

 One of the project’s accomplishments, however, has been the development and adoption by
 MPW of a consistent rating approach by which it establishes priorities among competing requests
 for the upgrading of secondary roads.

 Prioritization Criteria for Higher-Standard Construction of Secondary Roads

 During the last two years in which NERAP was being implemented (2012 and 2013), the follow-
 on project, Afghanistan Rural Access Project (ARAP) was being prepared, appraised, approved
 (in June 2012) and its implementation launched. During this period IDA conducted a dialogue
 with MPW on the criteria for selecting secondary road sections for upgrading under one or other
 of the IDA-supported projects. After several iterations, agreement was reached on the following
 criteria and their target values, and the weights for summing them into a single indicator. (For
 this, thanks are due to a retired World Bank lead highway engineer, who for this task was hired
 by AUSAID).

                             Annex 4: Financial Management



The project operated under the steadily improving Project Financial Management reforms under
implementation by the Government of Afghanistan with the World Bank’s assistance. The overall
FM arrangements in Afghanistan are built around the Afghanistan Financial Management
Information System (AFMIS). This is managed by the MoF centrally. MoF is responsible for
payments, making withdrawal applications, recording transactions, preparation of annual
financial statements and other functions for all the projects. The project was implemented by
MRRD and MPW, with UNOPS as the Implementation Consultant supporting both ministries
including for financial management.

The financial management arrangements under the project were satisfactory. Consolidated annual
project budgets broken down by components were consistently maintained for the project.
Relevant books of records and supporting documents for project expenditures were maintained by
MRRD, MPW and UNOPS. Books of records in MRRD were maintained only in excel
throughout project duration, while ATLAS computerized system was used in UNOPS. The BPET
(Budget Planning and Expenditure Tracking) database in MRRD is being upgraded with support
from ARAP and gradually data is being migrated to the database. Reconciliation of the
designated accounts and the float account were done monthly. The disbursements under the
project were made through the designated account managed by MoF and the float account
managed by UNOPS. Funds flow to the project was timely. MRRD maintained operational cash
imprest under the project to the tune of $200,000 to meet expenditures relating to mission travel
in country and other day to day expenditures, this cash was held by the bonded cashier of MRRD.
These funds were managed properly and were used for project related purposes. During the initial
years of the project, many advances for project expenditures took considerable time to be settled.
However, MRRD showed significant improvement in this area post the mid term review. MPW
did not maintain operational/ petty cash under the project. An alternative solution for the
maintenance of the operational cash to avoid holding of large amounts of cash by the agencies is
under discussion with MoF.

FM staffing was adequate throughout the lifetime of the project and there was proper segregation
of duties. The FM capacity of MRRD was reasonably adequate and continued to be strengthened
over the life of the project, but the FM capacity within MPW was weak. A full time International
FM Specialist (professionally qualified) was engaged by UNOPS under the project who worked
closely with the FM staff of both ministries. While FM support to MRRD was provided as
required, the FM functions for MPW were carried out entirely by UNOPS until the last year of
the project when gradually FM functions were beginning to be handled by MPW through FM
consultants hired under ARAP. Coordination between UNOPS, MRRD and MPW to carry out
FM functions efficiently improved considerably after the mid term review and project FM
performance improved as a result. The FM performance rating for the project was upgraded from
Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory in July 2013.

The internal controls were okay at the central and the implementing agencies level, as well as in
UNOPS. Internal audit was carried out by MRRD and MPW (through consultant support) in the
later years of the project, and these audits did not bring up any significant issues. However, these
audits did not cover UNOPS transactions. The Bank was informed that UNOPS internal audit unit
does periodic reviews of UNOPS operations, however these reports were not available for the
Bank for review.



                                                25
Quarterly IFRs were submitted periodically and included all required information. While there
have been some delays in submission in the past due to coordination issues, the timeliness of the
submission improved in 2013. MRRD prepared reports for activities managed by it, and
consolidated IFRs (covering MRRD, MPW and UNOPS transactions) were prepared by UNOPS.

Annual audits were submitted under the project. The submissions were within the due date of six
months except in fiscal year 1387 (Mar 21, 2008 to Mar 20, 2009) and 1391 6 (Mar 21, 2012 to
Dec 20, 2012). However, this was beyond the control of MRRD and MPW. All Bank funded
projects use the country systems for audits, as such as all audits are carried out by the Supreme
Audit Office with support from an international audit firm. The delay in the submission was due
to delays in mobilization of the audit team on the ground and in carrying out the audit. The most
recently concluded audit was for FY1391, this was due for submission by June 20, 2013 but was
submitted only on July 17, 2013. The auditors issued an unqualified (clean) opinion and there
were no significant observations requiring client response or action. All previous years’ audit
observations have been satisfactorily resolved. The audit report and management letter for
FY1392 are due by June 20, 2014. The audit is in progress.

The Bank’s FM unit participated in all supervision missions and provided required guidance to
the project team. It collaborated with the Procurement team as required. It will continue to follow
up with MRRD and MPW to ensure smooth closure by the grace period. The project closed with
a ‘Satisfactory’ FM performance rating.

 In FY1391 the Afghan Government changed its fiscal year period from Mar 21-Mar 20 to Dec 21-Dec 20.
As a result, FY1391 was a year of only 9 months.

                         Annex 5: Environmental and Social Safeguards


Before project appraisal, the PIUs at MoPW and MRRD had jointly prepared an Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for NRAP. This policy was fully applied during the
implementation of NERAP and was able to minimize the negative impacts of access road and
bridge construction. The framework is also being used for the follow-on project, ARAP.

The Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during planning and
implementation of sub-projects and ensures the effective application of the World Bank’s
safeguard policies, those of the IFC/World Bank 7 Group, and relevant national laws and
regulation, such as the Environmental Law and Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation.
The Framework guides environmental and social impact assessment of project schemes and
outlines the process for identifying potential adverse social and environmental impacts due to
construction of rural roads and bridges. The ESMF includes a Negative List (exclusion of sub-
projects) which identifies features of subproject activities, such as adverse impacts on protected
areas, cultural heritage sites or land acquisition impacting more than 200 people and/or land
acquisition above 10% of total land holdings, and replacement of each tree removed by the
planting of at least two of the same species.

In general, road projects bring about changes in the natural environment and therefore are
considered environmentally sensitive. Implementation of this policy has reduced environmental
problems arising from such intervention to the extent possible. The overall impacts of the
NERAP program were not significant in nature and fell in Category “B” of the ESM Framework.

Mitigation Measures: The approach taken in NERAP to mitigate environmental impacts was
avoiding or minimizing negative impacts by changing the road alignment, if possible, or reducing
the level of intervention at a site, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing
potential environmental and social risks.

This Framework is based on the following principles:
• All proposed roads would be screened to ensure that the environmental and social risks could
  be identified and adequately addressed through the application of standardized guidelines.
• Regardless of the outcome of environmental screening, each subproject would have its site-
  specific ESMP for the construction package prepared during the preliminary engineering design
  process.
• An Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) would also be prepared, if any of the sub-
  projects required land acquisition affecting less than 200 PAPs, and the ESMF included
  guidelines for land and asset acquisition, compensation and documentation.

The ESMF included the following safeguard instruments:
   • public announcements in the subproject area
   • public awareness in the subproject area
   • social committee for grievance handling
   • transect walk with community for road alignment
   • environmental and social checklist for screening of sub-project.
   • Abbreviated Resettlement Framework (ARF)
   • generic Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), and
   • procedures for grievance handling to address complaints related to project activities.
   • consideration of mine risk issues in the program.
   • pre-bidding meetings with contractors
   • pre-starting meetings with contractors
   • pre-starting meetings and mobilizing of contractors with communities, especially the
      grievance redress committees at regional level

The screening criteria included:
Environmental factors such as;
   • sensitive areas, natural habitats, other state-declared sensitive areas
   • felling of trees
   • clearance of vegetative cover
   • endangered species
   • waste generation
   • air, water, soil and sound pollutions
   • loss of productive agricultural land
   • cuts across perennial streams or surface water bodies
   • vulnerability to natural hazards, landslides/slips, soil erosion and,
   • environmental features such as wetlands, protected ground water zone, etc

Social factors such as;
   • land availability
   • loss of structures and assets
   • loss of livelihood
   • impacts on common property resources
   • community conflict

NRAP had also produced a Gender Guideline and Community Consultation Manual.

The Gender Guideline was prepared by the ESM units of both PIUs and shared with the World
Bank team.
The Community Consultation Manual was prepared during NERAP implementation and was
used during the entire processes for each subproject (i.e. transect survey and preparation and
implementation of the site-specific ESMP and Abbreviated RAP) to consult with all relevant
parties about its likely impacts. During project implementation people living along the road
corridor right-of-way were informed about the proposed project activities and the likely impacts.




                                               28
Community Mobilization in NERAP
Community mobilization was one of the important activities that contributed to effective project
implementation in NERAP. Project-related information was shared with relevant communities, as
well as the likely beneficial and adverse impacts of the project. Suitable mitigation measures were
discussed and agreed.

Community mobilization was carried out in two stages as follows:

The initial community mobilization and consultations for all subprojects were conducted during
the transect survey stage. As per the approved policy, public announcement of the project for
public awareness was done to ensure the participation and support of the communities. The public
announcement was prepared by a regional ESM officer and posted seven days prior to the
transect survey works in public places such as Masjid Sharif, School, Madrassa, adjacent bazaar
or any other public area frequented by communities within the subproject area. After seven days
of the public notice, public awareness programs were conducted with relevant communities of the
subproject or villages people. The community mobilization and consultation was conducted
during this period by the ESM officer, explaining subproject activities, positive and negative
impacts and mitigation measures. A Social Committee for Grievance Redress was established for
each sub-project. The members of this committee were appointed by the communities along the
road segment. The ARAP’s safeguards staff have trained community members on handling
grievances related to access road activities.

During survey and screening of subprojects, for subprojects having Project Affected People
(PAPs), it further detailed how consultations with each PAP should be carried out, the type and
extent of the impacts to the PAPs were identified, and issues related to compensation for land,
crops, trees and any other structures were noted. The willingness of the PAPs to donate their land
voluntarily and/or community compensation was discussed and their consent documented in the
land donation forms. In addition to the concerned PAPs, the voluntary land donation papers were
also signed by at least two witnesses from the same village and approved by the Community
Development Council (CDC) and MRRD’s provincial department.

If any subproject had more than 200 PAPs and if any PAP was not willing to donate his/her land
voluntarily or the land affected was more than 10% of their land holdings, the subproject was not
considered for implementation.

The second phase of Community Mobilization took place during implementation of the
subprojects. During this period the ESM officer worked closely with the community and assisted
the Regional team in resolving any disputes or problems with the community. The ESM officer
was also responsible for monitoring the subproject in accordance with the subproject ESM
monitoring plan, which included Environment Mitigation Measures such as rehabilitation of
affected structures and planting of trees and any other social and environment-related activities.
The ESM monitoring continued till the subproject came to its end.

Conclusions:

The PIUs at the MoPW and MRRD extensively used the ESMF and Community Consultation
Manual during implementation of NERAP and all subprojects were completed with minimum
social and environmental impacts. With the introduction of ESMPs and matching BOQ items,
environment mitigation measures were implemented effectively under each contract. Adoption of
a Gender Guideline further enabled the PIUs to plan and manage sensitive gender issues during
project implementation.

                  Annex 7: Deterioration Of The Security Situation


At the time the project was appraised, the security situation in Afghanistan remained fluid and
was deteriorating. Careful consideration was given during project preparation to the possible
consequences if the insurgency and criminal activities increased further. An analysis was carried
out using the UN’s Program Accessibility Map of September 2007, which categorized the country
into three areas: low, medium and high risk. The proposed roads were ranked according to their
security risk, and those roads in the high-risk areas were reprogrammed for the second half of the
project, on the assumption that security would improve.

Following this ranking, about 63% of construction sites would be in low-risk, 10% in medium-,
and 20% in high-risk areas. Given the increasing overlap between opium production and
insecurity, this meant that some of the areas with the most intensive opium poppy cultivation
could not be prioritized by the program. Nevertheless, districts in which opium poppy had been
widely grown (and might return in the future) such as in Balkh, Badakhshan and Nangarhar, were
already identified to receive assistance. The ministries would keep the risk assessment up to date
and would make adjustments as necessary. Even within an area the level of threat could vary
substantially and local intelligence was vital. Therefore the communities would be much better
informed about the project than had been the case so far and every attempt had to be made to
build good relationships with the villagers, who would often be the guarantors of staff safety.

The Government was determined to deliver services across the country and the project would
adapt its implementation in order to be present even in less secure areas. In those localities, the
preferred delivery mechanism would be contracts that required less outside presence and would
bring direct cash benefits to the communities.

The Bank’s ability to supervise the construction sites either directly or through consultants was
substantially limited. Even if a construction site could be considered safe, the approach routes
might lead through high-risk areas. It was likely that the Bank would have to rely on third-party
auditors for verification. Community verification would also be used, and an effective complaints
mechanism would be put in place that would highlight irregularities and grievances.

The maps below show the steady deterioration of the security situation as preparation and
implementation of the project proceeded.

INTRODUCTION
  Background
As Afghanistan started to emerge from the conflict in 2001, only a very small part of the road
network was in good condition. Prolonged conflict had denied most of the rural population access
to essential social services including markets, health centers, schools and government
administrative offices.

National Emergency Rural Access Project (NERAP) was built on the successful design and
implementation of the previous IDA-ARTF funded NRAP projects. Launched in December 2007
NERAP was successfully completed, over a period of 6 years, in December 2013 with overall
cost of $232 Million.

  Project objectives
The project development objective (PDO) of NERAP was to assist the Government of
Afghanistan (GoA), in enabling the population living in its rural areas to benefit from year-round
access to basic services and facilities through the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access
infrastructure under the government’s National Rural Access Program (NRAP. To achieve this,
the project financed:
(i)     Rehabilitation of secondary rural roads, with Ministry of Public Works (MPW) as the
        implementing agency;
(ii)    Rehabilitation of tertiary rural roads, with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and
        Development (MRRD) as the implementing agency; and
(iii)   Project implementation support technical assistance and capacity building of MPW and
        MRRD.

PROJECT OUTPUTS
  Component A: Improvement of Secondary roads
This component was implemented by MPW.
Under this component the MPW carried out the rehabilitation and reconstruction of about 1,125
km of secondary roads and constructed 1,458 linear meters of bridges along the secondary roads.
All these works were carried out by national contractors through works contracts with 138
contract packages.

  Component B: Improvement of Tertiary roads
This component was implemented by MRRD.
Under this component the MRRD carried out the rehabilitation and reconstruction of about 1,349
Km of tertiary roads and constructed 1,602 meter of bridges along the tertiary road. All these
works contracts were carried out by national contractors and local communities (CDCs) through
413 contract packages.

  Component C: Institutional strengthening, program management & development
This component was implemented by MRRD in coordination with MPW and NCU.
Under institutional capacity building, MPW, MRRD PIU and NCU staffs were trained in the
areas of rural road network management, public procurement, financial management, engineering
skills, reporting, geographic information systems and financing of engineering students and


                                                34
community development /social inclusion students. Trainings and Study tours s were conducted
in-country as well as out-of-country were organized under this component to South Africa, Kenya,
India and China. Additionally, the NCU staff were sponsored for Master’s degrees.

PROJECT COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
PROJECT COSTS
NERAP commenced with original allocation of $137 million ($112 million IDA and $25 million
ARTF). Following the mid-term review of the project, the project funding was increased to $232
million. The additional funds were requested by the client and approved by World Bank in order
to compensate for cost overrun and scaling up of project scope.

PROJECT DISBURSEMENTS
By the end of NERAP in December 2013, NERAP was able to utilize almost all funds made
available from IDA and ARTF. The project disbursement rate was slow during the first two years
of the project implementation as both implementation agencies were building their capacities and
procurement of works was slower than anticipated. Also, the main targeted construction market,
i.e. small to medium size private contractors, had limited capacity and awareness of the NERAP
requirements. As all the mentioned capacities were building up and progress made in
procurement activities, the project disbursements began to pick up from the 3rd year of
implementation - 2009, before NERAP reached its peak performance in 2012.

PROJECT SCHEDULE
NERAP was originally envisaged to be implemented over three year’s period from January 1,
2008 to December 31, 2010. The project period was eventually extended by three years up to 31
December 2013 on account of additional scope of works and additional funds.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
INSTITUTIONAL SETUP
NERAP was successfully implemented with the institutional setup with distinct responsibilities
for project oversight, coordination and monitoring, and implementation and management.
Project oversight: An inter-ministerial Steering Committee (SC), chaired by the Minister of
Finance and comprising ministers of MPW and MRRD was responsible for the overall policy,
strategic planning and project oversight and for integration with other rural development
programs
Project coordination and monitoring: National Coordination Unit (NCU), set up under Ministry
of Finance, was responsible for the overall coordination of NERAP. The NCU worked in close
coordination with donors and project implementation units of MPW and MRRD. The unit
monitored the overall project implementation, and played a secretarial role for the SC. Moreover,
the NCU organized regular monthly coordination meetings between project stakeholders, as well
as several ad-hoc technical meetings.
Project Management and Implementation: Prime responsibility in implementing NERAP was
that of the ministries (MPW and MRRD). Both ministries established Project Implementation
Units (PIUs) and nine regional implementation teams. At the central level, each PIU established
its functional departments for planning, survey and design, environment and social management,
procurement, and contract management. The capacity of the functional units has been adequately
strengthened are able to execute most of the works with limited advice and support from



                                               35
Implementing Consultants. Each PIU has also set up Quality Control, Monitoring and Evaluation
and Reporting units supported by a well-functioning MIS system.
UNOPS (United Nations Office for Project Services) was selected as implementation consultant
(IC) to support both PIUs in the project implementation through competitive bidding process.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
NERAP was implemented by two ministries, MPW and MRRD, and the finance departments of
the two ministries were responsible for financial management of the components/activities
implemented directly by the ministries. The line ministries received the support of the
Implementation Consultant (IC - UNOPS) in the day-to-day operations as well as for
consolidated project level reporting. Detailed working relationships between the IC and MRRD/
MPW finance departments, Financial Management (FM) reporting requirements &
responsibilities, staffing, systems and other FM arrangements were included in the IC's contract
and the FM manual. IC - UNOPS maintained appropriate systems, procedures and controls to
plan, execute, monitor, record and report on the areas of activities assigned to them by the two
ministries under NERAP.

ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT
During NERAP, capacity and capability of the ESM units were significantly enhanced. The ESM
teams had been established in the PIU offices in Kabul along with ESM officers/assistants in all
the regions. All of them have been trained in managing social and environment issues during the
planning, survey and implementation phases as per the provisions of the Environment and Social
Management Framework of NERAP.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Both PIUs have setup monitoring and evaluation (M&E) units and are able to collate and analyze
data and produce necessary reports. The Monitoring Units prepared annual plans to visit all
subprojects at least two times during the implementation period and prepare their report.
The program benefited from third party monitoring arrangement which was put in place by the
Bank. The result of this exercise seems to be promising and value added specifically to the
quality of civil work on site.

The program also benefited from the Technical Audit Report prepared by an international expert.
The recommendations in the Technical Audit Report have been incorporated in the design and
implementation practices by both the PIUs.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS
In general, human resources are scarce in Afghanistan due to the prolonged conflict and the slow
return of qualified people from abroad; the construction market in Afghanistan is not an exception,
and –therefore- number of qualified contractors in the country remains low.
During initial stages of NERAP contractors were generally hesitant to work in higher risk areas in
the country, especially with government projects. NERAP was able to mitigate these risks by
tailoring procurement packages that are compatible with contractor capacity. Additionally,
significant capacity building of private sector contractors in contract management, works
planning and delivery of quality works were delivered through regional teams working directly
with the contractors, and technical training and orientation programs conducted throughout the
life of the project.


                                               36
Notwithstanding the security impact on delivery of contractors, there are still plenty of rooms for
improvement of construction sector in terms of timely and quality delivery, and overall
management capability of construction firms.
Submission of fake qualification documents by some of the bidders was initially a common
phenomenon, and it has been substantially reduced by taking punitive actions against the
defaulting companies.

IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANTS
The performance of the Implementation Consultant (UNOPS) for NERAP has been satisfactory
and cost effective. During NERAP, the IC transferred technology to national staff in project
planning, engineering, procurement, contract management and fiduciary management enabling
the PIUs to realize their aspiration in undertaking greater responsibilities in all areas of NERAP
implementation. Institutional memory and lessons learnt from the past projects enabled UNOPS
to support the PIUs effectively in successful implementation of NERAP.

The unique advantage of UNOPS as an UN agency mandated to undertake infrastructure and
project management initiatives enabled UNOPS to attract, recruit and retain qualified
international staff to support in project implementation in both PIUs. The role and responsibilities
of the IC continued to change to suit the requirement of the project and almost all of the project
management responsibilities were handed over to the PIUs towards the end of NERAP, with IC
role limited to advisory and fiduciary management activities.

WORLD BANK
The World Bank provided continuous support to the project through its regular Implementation
Support Missions twice a year, reviewing the progress against target and highlighting the key
actions agreed with the government to improve the project performance. This contributed in
aligning the project towards its objectives and introducing necessary changes in project
implementation approach. In particular, the Mid-Term Review Mission of the Bank in May 2010
was instrumental in introducing necessary capacity development activities in the project and
agreeing on suitable rural road design standards for NERAP to minimize the cost overrun and
scale up the project with additional funds from IDA and ARTF.
Bank Task Team participated in all monthly coordination meetings with the PIUs and NCU, and
provided timely feedbacks and No Objections to Prior Review procurement cases. Bank also
conducted several Post Procurement Reviews (PPR) and Financial Audit by external auditors in
both PIUs. Findings of PPR and Audit reports indicate satisfactory performance of NERAP and
adherence to WB procurement guidelines and financial procedures.
Regular interactions between PIUs and Bank’s Team Task Leader, Procurement and Financial
Units were helpful in resolving project implementation, procurement and financial management
issues on a timely manner.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNITS - PIUs
The two ministries had varying levels of skills in engineering projects, but both required
considerable training and ongoing capacity building to allow them to take over the management
of the project. With enhanced capacity in project management, the PIUs were able to assume
increased responsibilities from the Implementation Consultant. The PIUs now have established
Planning, Engineering Survey and Design, Procurement, and Contract Management units along
with Finance and Administration sections. They have also embedded Quality Control, ESM,
Public Relation, Capacity Building, Maintenance, M&E, MIS and reporting sections within each



                                                37
PIU. They are now capable of implementing large scale rural road projects with limited assistance
from implementing consultants.

PROBLEMS FACED IN IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNT
Given the prevailing post conflict environment and deteriorating security situation all over the
country, successful completion of NERAP was possible due to flexibility in project design and
ability of the PIUs to plan and manage the works effectively by ensuring ownership and strong
support from the local communities and the government. Practical and effective project
implementation approach adopted by implementation teams and key lessons learnt from NERAP
implementations are described below.

Planning
The capacity of the PIUs in planning and prioritizing road projects has been significantly
improved. All the subprojects under NERAP were successfully executed by both PIUs. However,
some of the subprojects were located in very difficult terrain, in terms of investigation, design and
work execution. Some of the selected roads were duplicated in plans of other agencies; this
resulted in wastage of resources and stakeholder dissatisfaction. The procurement plan of both
PIUs had to be updated several times to substitute for duplicated sub-projects and those which
could not be implemented
Considering the high demand for infrastructure - and more particularly roads, the selection and
prioritization of roads have to be approached on systematic, transparent and approved guidelines
involving maximum possible consultations with relevant stakeholders.

Engineering and Design
Some of the designs and drawings did not match the site conditions. Some subprojects required
changes in road alignments, location and size of structures. The quality and accuracy of
engineering survey and design need to be further improved by ensuring site visit by the design
engineer and also design verification prior to procurement. Preparing accurate cost estimation for
projects was a big challenge faced by both PIUs. Lack of standard schedule of costs for basic
construction materials, significant variation in prices between provinces, and the unpredicted
change in security situation in many areas contributed to major fluctuations in cost for materials.
Both PIUs have now established standard cost estimation procedures, including collecting price
of materials in the region on regular basis and are now able to prepare realistic cost estimates for
projects across the country.

Procurement
The quality of submitted bids in general has improved and most of the contractors have better
understanding of the bidding process and item rates quoted by most of them are adequate to meet
the established standards of construction quality.
However, procurement process continues to face challenges as the private sector construction
industry is still in its infancy in Afghanistan and large numbers of new contractors continue to
enter the industry. Government needs to continue to provide significant support to the
construction industry to ensure that projects are completed efficiently and to the required
standards.
There were several cases when bidders submitted fake qualification documents. All such bidders
were disqualified and punitive actions taken against them.
Although most of the NOL from WB was received on a timely basis, there were some instances
when the Bank’s prior review took unusually long time.


                                                 38
FIELD IMPLEMENTATION
Having overtaken most of the implementation responsibilities in the field from the
implementation consultants the establishment of effective and functioning regional team was a
challenge to both PIUs. However, with strong support from the PIUs central offices in Kabul and
effective and timely advice and guidance from the IC team, the regional teams are well
established and capable of planning and supervising the construction works in the field.

Contract Management
Considering security situation, it was not always possible to provide continuous and effective
works supervision of construction works. Additional site offices at the provincial level and
recruitment of site supervisors for each contract, was found to be effective in controlling the
quality of works implemented by contractors.
Lack of adequate material-testing facilities in the regions was a serious constraint to the regional
team’s ability to conduct all necessary quality tests on executed works. NRAP needs to make
necessary arrangements to establish facilities to conduct necessary quality tests in the site.
Number of reasons caused delays in project implementation. The primary causes were; Security
issues, community conflicts, contractors with multiple projects unable to provide the necessary
resources to meet the deadlines, adverse weather conditions, poor sub-project planning with
implementation, and delayed payments to contractors. Capacity and capability of some of
contractors to manage their works efficiently, and capacity of some of the regional project staff to
manage construction supervision effectively also resulted in implementation delays.
Limited numbers of signed contracts were terminated when the contractors could not perform the
works, particularly when the bid prices were significantly lower the engineering estimates. In a
few other cases the contractors were released from performing the works when it was observed
that the deteriorated security situation in the field made it impossible to the contractors to further
perform any works.
Community consultations and close coordination with community elders during contract
implementation was found to be very effective in successful project implementation. When such
consultations were absent, misunderstanding with the communities caused considerable delay in
contract completion.

Road Maintenance
One of the major achievements of NERAP was establishment of effective Routine Maintenance
System. This has not only provided employment to rural communities but also contributed in
preservation of road asset and its sustainability. The success of Routine Maintenance Practices
under NRAP for gravel roads needs to be scaled up and rolled out to all core road networks in the
country, including sealed roads. Similarly, road maintenance strategy needs to be established in
the country with policies for Routine, Periodic and Emergency Maintenance.

Community Contracting
Communities played very important role in successful implementation of NERAP. All routine
maintenance works were contracted out to the communities and implemented effectively.
Communities also carried out most of the emergency works including snow clearance of roads
blocked during winter. More than 25% of MRRD road works were executed by communities with
acceptable quality. This was possible by providing training to the community by the project team.
Quality of some of the works completed by the community has been found to outclass even those
completed by some of the private contractors.

WAY FORWARD
Based on lessons learnt from NERAP and in order to ensure success of future NRAP projects,
following improvements are recommended:

General
1. Adequate and effective involvement of the Steering Committee in planning and
   implementation oversight needs to be ensured to resolve critical project issues on time.
2. The role and responsibilities of the NCU needs to be defined clearly in the project documents
   to ensure effective coordination and monitoring of the project.
3. Ministries need to delegate more contractual and financial management authorities to PIUs to
   ensure timely decisions and avoid delay in budget allocation and processing of payments.
4. NRAP offices in the regions need to further strengthened and institutionalized with capacity
   building initiatives and construction of functional buildings along with material testing
   facilities.
5. Establishing the Road Agency is essential to ensure approach consistency, effective
   coordination and efforts streamlining of stakeholders involved in road sector.
6. Attract competent afghan female candidates to diversify the team – creating an enabling
   environment in the currently male dominated program operations.

Planning
7. Develop and apply suitable prioritization criteria for roads and bridges, based on network
   planning exercise and contribution of the road in providing rural accessibility.
8. Improve reliability of plans through adequate preparation of work packages, technical
   documents and realistic implementation plans that consider complexity of works, site location
   and working season in the regions.
9. Improve quality of survey and design to minimize change in scope of works and variations
   during contract implementation.
10. Publish and make available publicly in NRAP website, in particular to bidders, the standard
    set of prices for goods, materials and services in all provinces. This will help bidders to
    accurately estimate costs and submit realistic bids for sub-projects. Public knowledge of the
    pricing structure and norms for rate analysis could also reduce the chances of fraudulent
    practices or artificially inflated prices.
11. Conduct proper community consultations during engineering survey, and keep community
    well informed regarding the road alignment, and ensure clear understanding and commitment
    of the PAPs particularly related to voluntary land contribution and displacement of physical
    structures and vegetation.

Procurement
12. Modify Standard Bidding Document in regard to application of Bid Security, Performance
    Security and qualification criteria.
13. Improve knowledge and familiarity of bidders in preparing responsive bids and construction
    management through debriefing, trainings and workshops.
14. Ensure ownership and commitment of all stakeholders (Ministry, Regional Road Directorates,
    Provincial Governors and Local communities) from early stages of procurement till final
    handover.


                                               40
15. Further publicize NRAP activities to promote increased participation of local/regional bidders
    in bidding processes.
16. Make Performance Guarantee from the recognized banks mandatory to attract financially
    strong and capable bidders in the bidding process.
17. Include price adjustment clauses only in contracts with durations of 18 months or longer. The
    indices published by National Statistics Organization of Afghanistan should be used to
    calculate price adjustment.
18. Continue improvement and familiarity of new procurement staff regarding World Bank
    procurement and contract management procedures through on-the-job as well as formal
    trainings.
19. Discourage bidders from submitting fake documents and take punitive actions against those
    practice such fraudulent acts.
20. Include a technical expert with engineering knowledge as member of the evaluation
    committee. Conduct risk analysis when the bid amount and/or quoted price of key items are
    substantially lower than engineering estimates.
21. Complete translation of bidding documents in local language so that bidders are able to
    understand the provisions of contract documents.
22. Follow up with WB team for timely review of prior review requests.

Contract Management
23. Improve knowledge and familiarity of regional and site engineers and contractors in relation
    to conditions of contract through on-the-job as well as formal trainings.
24. Set up project based or provincial site offices to supervise the ongoing works effectively and
    to ensure quality of works.
25. Apply conditions of contract more stringently including liquidated damages to defaulting
    contractors to ensure timely completion of works.
26. Set up regional and central laboratory with trained lab technicians.
27. Ensure all contractors prepare payment certificates on a monthly basis. Process payments to
    the contractors on time. Ensure availability of budget throughout the year and timely
    replenishment of float accounts.
28. Promote proactive measures to manage the community expectations via environment and
    social management officers in the field. Ensure that the community understands the scope of
    work and the benefits from the project to the entire community.
29. Include lessons learnt as part of completion report in each contract and replicate positive
    lessons in ensuing contracts.

Road Maintenance
30. Rollout Routine Maintenance to all core rural road networks and establish guidelines for
    periodic and emergency maintenance works.
31. Review the cost of Routine Maintenance using the present practice and compare the cost with
    other countries with similar geographical and economical background.
32. Commence Routine Maintenance of sealed roads in addition to gravel roads.




                                                41
Financial Management
33. Develop and implement effective Financial Management System in both PIUs.
34. Ensure Float Accounts are replenished on time and reduce bureaucratic delays in processing
    payments through government channels. Reduce the number of signatories to minimum
    possible in certifying and processing payment certificates.

Community Involvement
35. Continue to work closely with the communities during project planning and implementation,
    and involve them in routine and emergency maintenance works.
36. Provide necessary training and guidance to the communities to strengthen their capacity to
    implement small contracts and to further improve quality of works executed.
37. Encourage females and Project Affected People to participate and have their opinion voiced
    during project planning and implementation.

     Annex 9. Impact Evaluation: Methodological Approach and Challenges


1.       Impact evaluations rely on identifying a counterfactual: what would have happened in the
absence of the project. Ideally, selection bias would be eliminated through a randomized control
trial, but this was impossible for NERAP. Instead, the evaluation tried to use information
collected about the areas in which road projects were undertaken and about a large collection of
roads not affected by NERAP to create a synthetic control group of roads that did not receive
treatment but are otherwise similar to those that did.

2.      To find a suitable control group, a matching procedure was used to identify unselected
roads that were similar along important characteristics to selected roads. The procedure, known as
propensity score matching, quantifies the selection process by identifying characteristics that
increase the likelihood of a road to be selected to receive the program. A control group was then
chosen from unselected units which had “propensity scores” similar to the treatment units.

3.       The evaluation split the sample between a treatment group of villages that lay along 73
roads to be rehabilitated under NERAP and a control group of villages that lay along 128 roads
with similar characteristics to NERAP roads but which were not scheduled for rehabilitation
through NERAP. Surveyed control group villages were initially selected through propensity score
matching based on crude geographical and demographic characteristics of roads and villages
obtained from the Government of Afghanistan. It was understood from the beginning that the data
on which the initial matching was based was of poor quality; therefore, more control groups were
identified than treatment villages with the understanding that after the gathering of more
information during baseline surveys, the villages would be re-matched for the final analysis. In
total, the sample covered approximately 560 villages, 227 treatment villages and 342 control
villages, across 120 districts in 22 provinces of Afghanistan. After the endline data were collected,
the matching was done again with an improved set of variables and using nearest-neighbor, 1:1
matching, based on a propensity score (or likelihood of being selected into the program) to ensure
the treatment and control groups were as similar as possible.

4.      To collect data for the impact evaluation, NERAP relied on four different surveys:
household survey (including male and female interviews in each household), village focus groups,
road quality surveys, and spot market survey. The data were collected in two phases: a baseline
survey and an endline survey. The baseline survey was launched in August 2008, prior to the
commencement of program activities along treatment roads, and was concluded in November
2008. The endline survey was conducted between September and December 2012. The surveys
were carried out in both areas in which NERAP was implemented, and in areas not affected by
NERAP - to create a synthetic control group of roads that did not receive treatment but are
otherwise similar to those that did. The baseline surveys were carried out in 566 villages across
120 districts in 22 provinces (out of 34, that is, about two thirds of the entire country) –a
commendable accomplishment, considering that security was deteriorating throughout this period
in much of the country.

5.       The size of the household survey sample at baseline was 5,660. The ‘treatment’ group lay
along 73 roads to be rehabilitated under NERAP, while the ‘control’ group of villages lay along
128 roads with similar characteristics to NERAP roads, but which were not scheduled for
rehabilitation works. To find a suitable comparison group, a matching procedure was used to
identify unselected roads that were similar along important characteristics to selected roads. A
control group was then chosen from unselected units which had “propensity scores” similar to the



                                                43
treatment units. Due to survey administration limitations the endline survey was implemented in
only 4,066 households in 506 villages.

6.       Because of the complexity of the task, the baseline report was issued in November 2010.
Partial results of the final report became available in late 2013, and processing was finalized in
February 2014.

7.      Some data related issues became obvious during the data analysis for impact evaluation.
These problems can roughly be categorized as problems with instruments design; problems in
survey administration; and problems relating to attrition/ and reduction in the sample size.

8.      First, the baseline and endline household questionnaires had some design limitations.
Questions often did not appear in both the baseline and the endline survey, or were modified
between the two waves of the survey, limiting their usefulness. Moreover, no adequate price data
was collected during the baseline surveys.

9.       In addition to these issues, the data collection encountered some administration issues.
Security remained a major challenge in conducting the endline survey. The security situation had
deteriorated drastically by 2012 as compared to 2008, when the baseline survey had been
completed. The real security threats in some of the provinces made a total of 68 out of 567
villages too risky to be surveyed. These were dropped from the sample villages. Within these
villages, not all of the households surveyed at baseline could be located at follow-up. Further,
many of the "unique household identifiers" at endline were not, in fact, unique. These also had to
be dropped. Finally, the number of endline households that could be matched with the baseline
sample reduced by more than 30%, to 3,508 households. After propensity score matching the
impact evaluation sample reduced further to only 2,661 households (from 5,660), which implies
that the statistical power of the impact evaluation is lower than designed, making it less likely for
any effect to be found to be statistically significant.

10.      Most important, a series of key issue that affected the interpretation of all results became
apparent during analysis: (i) contamination of the control group - 58% of the control roads were
actually subject to rehabilitation projects; (ii) some of the treatment roads were also subject to
rehabilitation projects outside of NERAP; and (iii) about 25 percent of the treatment roads were
not yet finalized at the time of the endline survey.

11.      The large number of project roads in the control group implies that the impact analysis is
actually measuring the difference between the project roads in NERAP areas and the other project
roads that were completed during this time in the control group. The results thus had to be
interpreted as a lower bound for what one might expect to be the effects of NERAP compared to
not having received any project roads. The contamination issue combined with the low statistical
power due to the reduction in the sample size significantly reduced the reliability of the results of
the impact evaluation analysis.
