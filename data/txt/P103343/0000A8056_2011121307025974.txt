                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of the proposed project, derived from the overarching program objective of NRAP, is to provide year-round access to basic
                         services and facilities in the rural areas of Afghanistan covered by the project. This will be achieved through rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access
                         infrastructure by contracting with the private sector and, to a lesser extent, with the communities. The achievement of the PDO will enhance the well being of the
                         population and promote equitable licit economic growth in the country.
