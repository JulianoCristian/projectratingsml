                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of the proposed project, derived from the overarching program objective of NRAP, is to provide year-round access to basic services
                         and facilities in the rural areas of Afghanistan covered by the project. This will be achieved through rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access infrastructure by
                         contracting with the private sector and, to a lesser extent, with the communities. The achievement of the PDO will enhance the well being of the population and promote
                         equitable licit economic growth in the country.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last ISR report for this project and provides the final updates of the project as of the closing date, December 31st, 2013.

                         The project successfully completed its road rehabilitation and maintenance planned target. The total achievement of secondary road is 1124 km (102%) and tertiary road stands at

                         1349 (113%). Also, achievements on secondary and tertiary bridges stands at 1458 (100%) and 1602 (102%) respectively.

                         Considering the difficult environment and challenging security situation in Afghanistan, this is a significant achievement for both the Bank and the Client team. The roads already
                         opened to the traffic has made substantial impact on beneficiaries' daily life by providing access to main economic and social centers across the villages and districts in Afghanistan.

                         The provision of year round access is made possible for these communities with rehabilitated road by the project and well received by the rural population. It has also generated
                         employment for the rural population by mobilizing the community in their area for road improvement and maintenance. The community based road rehabilitation proved to be a
                         successful mechanism to implement road project where security is a challenge.

                         Also, the project successfully implemented the pilot community based routine maintenance mechanism both secondary and tertiary road network by mobilizing nearly 300 rural
                         community councils. The result of this pilot implementation has been praised by both the government and donor community. The project team has recorded the lesson learned from
                         the pilot and plans to incorporate them for the national roll out of routine maintenance program.

                         The impact evaluation survey has been completed and the initial results show positive impact on beneficiaries' life in the rural Afghanistan.
