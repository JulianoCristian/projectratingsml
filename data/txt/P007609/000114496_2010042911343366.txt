                  Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Mr. Galan:
      We refer to Lic. Jose Garcia Torres' letter dated December 19,
1990, and agree to amend Schedule I to the Loan Agreement for the
above Loan in order to make the works for the underground power
house of the Zimapan Power Plant eligible for financing thereunder.
      Therefore, we propose to amend the wording of Category 1 (b)
of the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement to
read as follows:
      "(b) Civil works under Part A.2 (a) through (e) of the
      Project".
     If you agree with the foregoing, please countersign and date
the copy of this letter and return it to us.
                         Sincerely yours,
                      INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
                  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
