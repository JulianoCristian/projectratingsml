                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global development objective of the project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic sources by increasing the market share of low greenhouse
                         gas emitting technologies. The project will also test the viability of solar thermal technology and contribute to replication of integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)
                         power generation technology in Morocco and elsewhere. It is one of a number of similar projects in the world to be supported by GEF as part of a program to accelerate
                         cost reduction and commercial adoption of large-scale low greenhouse emitting generation technologies. The main global benefits of the project are: (a) contribution to
                         the demonstration o f operational viability of hybrid solar thermal power generation in Morocco; (b) contribution to accelerated market penetration of large-scale
                         backstop power generation technologies; and (c) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from power generation.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The construction of the solar field and the combined cycle plant is completed. The Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC)powerplantwas commissioned on October 19, 2010. The
                         plant operated at a lower capacity for over a year because of insufficientgasavailablefrom the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline. In November 2011, the Government of Morocco
                         negotiated successfully agas-supplycontract withAlgeria. Since then, the plant has been operating satisfactorily at the expected capacity.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project provides for useful lessons of experience for the implementation of future Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) projects worldwide. Against this background it would be useful
                         if further dissemination of these lessons to policy-makers and solar practitioners at both national and international events could be undertaken.
