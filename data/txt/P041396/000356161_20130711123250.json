 outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: the use of integrated solar-combined cycle (ISCC)\n            technology can be a stepping stone for scaling-up\n            concentrated solar power (CSP), provided that fossil fuel\n            supply is guaranteed. ISCC plants offer a unique solution to\n            build small capacity solar fields to substitute fossil fuel\n            in larger conventional plants. The choice of an optimal site\n            is a key to the development of an Integrated Solar Combined\n            Cycle (ISCC) plant. Extend the operations and maintenance\n            (O&M) period from two to five years. Suppliers of key\n            ISCC plant components need to be members of the Engineering\n            Procurement Construction (EPC) consortium. Encourage\n            independent solar irradiation measurements in order to\n            ensure a correct application of penalties. Plan the tender\n            to satisfy both utility and bidder needs. Set mirror soiling\n            goals and meet them by an appropriate frequency for mirror\n            panel washing. Establish a framework of open partnership\n            with the EPC contractor to resolve any potential incident as\n            soon as possible."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
