urgently needed capacity to the Moroccan power grid to help\n            cope with the sustained growth in electricity demand, to\n            increase the contribution of renewable energy sources in\n            Morocco's energy mix which would reduce greenhouse gas\n            emissions, and to contribute to a program of global\n            environmental significance. The project includes the\n            integration of a parabolic trough solar field with a\n            traditional natural gas based power generating unit\n            (combined cycle). The project involves the construction and\n            operation of a solar/fossil hybrid power station of about\n            472 MW, of which 452 MW2 from combined cycle gas turbine and\n            20 MW from the solar component with an expected annual net\n            production of 3,538 GWh per year. The solar output is\n            estimated at 1.13 percent of the annual production\n            representing 40 GWh per year. The project has nine basic\n            components: design, construction and operation of an\n            integrated solar combined cycle power plant; construction of\n            transmission lines; construction of a substation;\n            construction of access roads; drilling of boreholes; land\n            acquisition; gas pipeline construction; environmental and\n            social development management; and consulting services."}, "docdt": "2007-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
