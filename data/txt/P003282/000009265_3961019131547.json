The\n            project's main objectives were to: (a) improve\n            reliability and quality of power supply through\n            rehabilitation and extension of power facilities; and (b)\n            enhance institutional development of the power sub-sector\n            through manpower development, technical assistance support\n            for critical area of its operations, and through\n            establishment of a management information system.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: (i) unless supported by sound government\n            policies, policy-related conditionalities in loan\n            agreements, such as tariff adjustments, will not be complied\n            with; (ii) government's commitment to the operational\n            autonomy of the utility, particularly in the financial and\n            administrative areas and including remuneration setting,\n            should be a precondition to committing loan funds to power\n            projects; (iii) in addition to financial viability, easy\n            access to and availability of foreign exchange are critical\n            to sustain Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority's\n            (ZESA) operations; (iv) the need for detailed distribution\n            study has been reinforced by the low impact of the Second\n            Power distribution component on distribution losses, and\n            ZESA has embarked upon a study in preparation for a new\n            project; and (iv) coordination with cofinanciers,\n            particularly during project implementation, should be\n            improved and discussions arranged on critical issues\n            affecting achievement of the overall project objectives."}, "docdt": "1995-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
