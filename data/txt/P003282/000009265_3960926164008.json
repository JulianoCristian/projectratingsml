       the efficiency and reliability of power supply through the\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of power facilities.  The\n            project is of high priority and consistent with the\n            least-cost means of meeting the growing demand on the power\n            system.  Specifically, the project comprises the\n            refurbishment of generating units and auxiliaries at the\n            Kariba South Bank Hydropower Station, rehabilitation and\n            extension of the distribution and transmission networks.  It\n            also includes provision of equipment for workshops,\n            vehicles, training, power operations support, management\n            information systems and computer facilities.  Lastly, the\n            project entails engineering services, and studies of\n            transmission network development and power system behavior\n            and load frequency control."}, "docdt": "1987-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
