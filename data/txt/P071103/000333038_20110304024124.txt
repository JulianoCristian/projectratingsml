This ICR covers the reforms supported by the first Poverty Reduction and Growth Operation
(PRGO 1). This was the first in a planned series of three such operations. An ICR is typically
prepared for the entire program. However, due to a long delay between PRGO 1 and the
proposed follow-on PRGO 2, ICR guidelines for programmatic operations require that an ICR be
prepared at this time for PRGO 1 alone.

PRGO 1 was a one tranche operation supporting policy actions that had all taken place by the
time the operation was approved by the World Bank Board on June 18, 2007. The operation was
of a budget support type and was prepared jointly with the European Union (EU), Japanese
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Department for International Development
(DfID).

The ICR was prepared by Peter Miovic (Consultant) under the guidance of Stephane Guimbert
(ICR Task Leader). The ICR is based on a detailed desk review of materials from the project file,
relevant documents of the EU, IMF and the World Bank, a field mission that took place in late
May of 2010, and discussions with World Bank and Development Partner staff in Phnom Penh
and Washington.

The team is grateful to D. Adler, R. Carter, H. Chea, L. Chea, J. Clarke, A, Khiev, S. Ly, K.
Sophorn, and R. Taliercio. A list of people interviewed in the field is given in Annex 5.

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The operation's development objective is to support second generation growth and poverty reduction
based on an improving business climate, higher agricultural productivity, and more effective public
service delivery. The PRGO will support the next phase of policy and institutional reform required to
maintain growth and accelerate poverty reduction by facilitating trade and diversifying exports,
guaranteeing land tenure and increasing access to land for the rural poor, and making the budget a
credible management tool and reducing fiduciary risk to public funds. The PRGO program would support
outcomes that are driven by policy measures and expenditure policy, both of which are supported by the
development partner community as necessary for underpinning medium term growth and accelerating
poverty reduction. PRGO-1 features 10 prior actions across private sector development, public financial
management, and land and natural resources management.

Revised Program Development Objectives (if any, as approved by original approving authority)
The PRGO program (2007-09) had three objectives:

(a) To support a program of `second generation' growth and poverty reduction policies based on an
    improving business climate, more effective public service delivery, and higher agricultural
    productivity. The support to the reform agenda was identified as the program's main Development
    Objective (PDO).

(b) To provide support for the reform agenda by focusing the policy dialogue on results and
    achievements. It also aimed to build on the reform momentum where political opportunity existed.

(c) To harmonize and align development partner (DP) policy positions, build on agreed monitoring
    frameworks at the sectoral level, and provide financial support to the implementation of the NSDP.

The first PRGO (a grant of US$15 million) was approved by the Board in July 2007. It was prepared
jointly with the European Commission (EC), Japan, and the United Kingdom (each agency disbursed after
PRGO 1 was approved by the Bank's Board). Each operation specified a set of triggers which, when met,
were to provide the basis for proceeding with the next operation. Only the triggers for PRGO 1 have been
fully met so far. The World Bank guidelines for an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) specify that
an ICR be conducted for the entire series of operations. However, in cases where there has been an
interruption of over 30 months between two operations, as has been the case between PRGO 1 (done) and
PRGO 2 (not done), an ICR on PRGO 1 is required at this time. This ICR therefore focuses only on
PRGO 1 although, where relevant, it is put into the context of the entire proposed PRGO program.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance)

Country Context

At the time that the PRGO series was being prepared (late 2006/first half of 2007), Cambodia
was in some ways still a post-conflict country. Although the Paris Peace Accords formally
established a truce in 1991, politico-military violence continued until 1998. Important modern
institutions of governance and public sector management, which had been weak post independence
were decimated by the civil war and are still fragile despite state-building efforts of the past 20 years.
The conflict contributed to weak governance and low capacity, which were the primary constraints
on development in Cambodia in general and on the World Bank Group's program in particular.
Having achieved peace and a degree of political stability, Cambodia achieved very high
economic growth. Between 1998 and 2007, economic growth averaged 9.8 percent per year. There
was a boom in the garment and construction sectors, some growth in agriculture yields, strong
foreign investment in a number of areas, rapid growth of credit to the private sector, and a major
increase in export earnings that allowed a build-up in international reserves and diminished
dependence on foreign aid. These achievements were the result of the establishment of peace, good
macroeconomic management, some structural reforms, and favorable location in a rapidly growing
region. Economic growth was accompanied by social development, including a reduction in the
poverty rate to near 30 percent by 2007, from an estimated 47 percent rate in 1994.

Governance Context

Improvements in policy making and implementation were vulnerable to being undermined by
critical institutional weaknesses. Though public sector performance had improved in some sectors,
the structures that delivered stability and growth were challenged to deliver more in terms of service
delivery, business enabling environment, and sustainable management of natural resources. Overall
the state institutions continued to be challenged by low levels of capacity and resources while the
accountability of civil servants still remained unclear.

Despite these difficulties, there had been clear progress in a number of key areas. The Royal
Government of Cambodia (RGC) had developed an overarching national development strategy and
began to pursue a broad agenda of reforms. The series of Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations
(PRGO), the first of which is being assessed in this document, was designed to support RGC's
reforms in three critically important areas: (i) Private Sector Development (PSD); (ii) Public
Financial Management (PFM), including reforms to the civil service; and (iii) Land and Natural
Resources Management (LNRM). The reforms were targeted at sustaining rapid growth, reinforcing
the already existing trend to poverty reduction, and stopping the degradation of natural resources. In
each area the reforms entailed elements of governance.

The World Bank's rating system had begun to recognize improvements in Cambodia's
development efforts. For the first time in many years, Cambodia's Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) ratings showed consistent increases, with the overall rating increasing from 3.0
to 3.2 in 2005 and 2006. In comparison to 2004, the 2006 assessment found that economic
 management remained strong (at 3.5); the structural policy cluster rating increased from 2.8 to 3.2;
the rating for policies for social inclusion and equity increased from 3.0 to 3.3; and public sector
management and institutions cluster rating, while still relatively weak, increased from 2.5 to 2.7. As a
result, Cambodia's overall CPIA rating increased to 3.2, just under the IDA average of 3.3. The
reform efforts that led to the improved ratings were a major achievement.

Economic Context

Cambodia's real GDP grew by 10.8 percent in 2006, following an unprecedented 13.5 percent
growth rate in 2005, marking the third consecutive year of double digit growth. The stellar
performance was driven by garment exports, tourism receipts, significant growth in foreign direct
investment (FDI), the continuing construction boom, and robust crop expansion in agriculture.
Agriculture continued to be a crucial sector for the economy, accounting for some 60 percent of total
employment and growing by 5.5 percent in 2006.

The expectation in mid-2007 was that rapid growth would continue although perhaps not at the
double digit rates of recent years. Garment exports were expected to face increasingly stronger
competition from Vietnam after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and from
China once US quotas were removed. The export base was considered narrow and therefore
vulnerable to shocks. On the other hand, there were hopes that recent successes in oil and gas
exploration would turn into production by 2010-11 which would boost growth, but if poorly
managed, also carry with it dangers of "Dutch disease" (see below).

External developments were also positive in 2006. Despite pressure from high world oil prices, the
balance of payments improved and gross international reserves expanded by 20 percent to US$1.1
billion. FDI continued its upward trend reaching US$475 million. Consumer price inflation declined
to 2.8 percent (from 5.9 percent in 2005). The consumer price index was expected to remain low
(below 5 percent) for 2007 and, given continued prudent fiscal and monetary policies, the Riel
was expected to remain stable both in terms of dollars and in terms of other partner country
currencies.

The fiscal front saw some improvement in 2006 as the ratio of tax revenue to GDP grew
modestly from 7.6 percent in 2005 to an estimated 8.0 percent in 2006. As a share of GDP non-
tax revenue remained constant at 2.3 percent. Expenditure was estimated to have remained steady at
13.5 percent of GDP in 2006 but greater emphasis continued to be put on the social sectors. Total
capital spending was estimated to have increased modestly to 5.6 percent of GDP. In 2007 the overall
budget balance was anticipated to be stable at around -3.2 percent of GDP (excluding grants).
Similarly, the financial sector saw some improvement in 2006, although some management
vulnerabilities remained. Combined deposits (in Riel and foreign currency) of banks operating in
Cambodia rose by 43 percent and the lending-to-deposit ratio continued to trend upward. There were
20 banks operating in Cambodia, up from 18 at the end of 2005. There were, however, some
concerns about the soundness of some of the banks. Cambodia also remained a highly dollarized
economy with nearly 75 percent of broad money and 97 percent of the banking deposits made in US
dollars. The commercial interest rate was high at around 16.3 percent per annum in a relatively low
inflation environment.

External debt constituted nearly 95 percent of Cambodia's total public debt. At end-2006,
Cambodia's total external public debt was US$2.25 billion (31 percent of GDP; 22 percent of GDP in

                                                   2
net present value (NPV) terms), while domestic debt amounted to 2.0 percent of GDP. It should be
noted that Cambodia's relatively high debt stock was largely due to the historical legacy of
borrowing from the US and the former USSR. The RGC has tried to negotiate debt rescheduling
agreements with both these countries, but the efforts have so far been unsuccessful. In December
2005 Cambodia met the International Monetary Fund (IMF/Fund) criteria for the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative, which resulted in debt relief of US$82 million.

The joint IMF/Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concluded that Cambodia's debt was on
a sustainable path and that the risk of debt distress was moderate. In addition to having low
debt-to-GDP ratios, debt servicing was also very limited (at 4 percent of revenues). The
macroeconomic framework was, however, vulnerable to the weak revenue base in the short to
medium term.

The major opportunity, but also potential challenge, to Cambodia's medium to long term
growth was the discovery of significant amounts of offshore petroleum. According to the
Cambodian National Petroleum Authority (CNPA), the precise amounts of oil and natural gas in
Block A are not known, although Chevron had had some success with its exploratory wells. Block A,
operated by Chevron, is in the most advanced stage of operation. Discovery of commercial quantity
of petroleum is expected to be declared in 2010 leading to production of first oil by the end of 2012.

Both the staffs of the Bank and the Fund had concluded that Cambodia's macroeconomic
policy framework was appropriate and sustainable. The Fund's 2007 Article IV mission strongly
supported the RGC's macroeconomic and structural reform agenda. Nevertheless, the proposed
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was delayed due to a lack of resolution of the US
and Russian debt negotiations. However, in the short to medium term, the delay of the PRGF was not
expected to jeopardize macroeconomic stability or the attainment of the economic development
objectives of the proposed program (Annex 4 of the PRGO 1 Program Document, WB (2007)).

The Proposed Series of Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations (PRGO)

The principal purpose of the proposed Poverty Reduction and Growth Operation (PRGO)
program (2007-09) was to provide support for the implementation of RGC's "good
governance" reform program. The reform program was laid out in RGC's National Strategic
Development Plan (NSDP) (see RGC (2005)). The NSDP endeavored to operationalize the
Government's "Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency" (RS),
adopted in July 2004. The RS proposed to improve governance by: (i) fighting corruption; (ii)
pursuing specific legal and judicial reforms; (iii) reforming public administration; and (iv) deepening
decentralization and de-concentration. The World Bank's 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
followed the RS by recognizing governance issues as the primary obstacle to growth, poverty
reduction, and aid effectiveness in Cambodia. It also laid the basis for selecting the reform areas to be
supported under the PRGO program.

The PRGO program (2007-09) had three objectives:

(d) To support a program of `second generation' growth and poverty reduction policies based on an
    improving business climate, more effective public service delivery, and higher agricultural
    productivity. The support to the reform agenda was identified as the program's main
    Development Objective (PDO).


                                                   3
(e) To provide support for the reform agenda by focusing the policy dialogue on results and
    achievements. It also aimed to build on the reform momentum where political opportunity
    existed.
(f) To harmonize and align development partner (DP) policy positions, build on agreed monitoring
    frameworks at the sectoral level, and provide financial support to the implementation of the
    NSDP.

The first PRGO (a grant of US$15 million) was approved by the Board in July 2007. It was
prepared jointly with the European Commission (EC), Japan, and the United Kingdom (each agency
disbursed after PRGO 1 was approved by the Bank's Board). Each operation specified a set of
triggers which, when met, were to provide the basis for proceeding with the next operation. Only the
triggers for PRGO 1 have been fully met so far. The World Bank guidelines for an Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) specify that an ICR be conducted for the entire series of
operations. However, in cases where there has been an interruption of over 30 months between two
operations, as has been the case between PRGO 1 (done) and PRGO 2 (not done), an ICR on PRGO
1 is required at this time. This ICR therefore focuses only on PRGO 1 although, where relevant, it
is put into the context of the entire proposed PRGO program.

Analytical Base for the Proposed PRGO Program and its Relationship to other Bank Operations

The proposed reform program incorporated the finding and recommendations of a range of
recent and ongoing lending, analytical and advisory services from the Bank. Details on these are
provided in Section 2.2 below.

1.2 Original Program Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

PRGO's Program Development Objective was to support `second generation' growth and
poverty reduction based on an improving business climate, more effective public service
delivery, and higher agricultural productivity.

Policies leading to an improved business climate, more effective public service delivery, and higher
agricultural productivity were arranged under three broad reform areas:
     Private Sector Development;
     Public Financial Management, including Civil Service Reform; and
     Land and Natural Resource Management.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that were to be tracked in order to assess the success of the
program are presented in the last column of the PRGO Policy Matrix (Annex 2), along with
their baseline values. They comprise a subset of what are called Joint Monitoring Indicators (JMIs),
tracked jointly by the RGC and DPs. This is done on a periodic basis within thematic Technical
Working Groups (TWGs, of which there are almost 20).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)


                                                 4
There were ten Prior Actions carried out before PRGO 1 was approved by the Board, grouped under
the three broad policy areas previously mentioned. They are presented in Table 1 below.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

Policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

There were no significant changes in the design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, or funding allocations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from the policy matrix)

This section assesses Program Performance from a legal point of view. Section 3 contains a discussion
and assessment of Program Performance from the point of view of outcomes.

PRGO 1 was a one tranche operation. All conditions were met (Prior Actions taken ­ see Table 1) by
the time the operation was approved by the Board on July 17, 2007. The operation was made effective on
September 12, 2007, the tranche of US$15 million was disbursed a month later and the operation was
closed on April 15, 2008.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Governance Issues. While all Prior Actions for PRGO 1 were, by definition, taken before the
operation was approved by the Board, they covered very difficult areas and sustaining
implementation has been challenging. Perhaps the hardest were the measures related to land and
natural resources management. With rapid growth, interests in land and other natural resources for
(often large-scale) commercial use intensified. Land concessions for logging, mining, plantation
agriculture and construction (in more urbanized areas), often overlapped with the interests of people
who needed land and forests for their livelihoods, and conflicts arose. On the other hand, the focus on
regulatory reform and transparency in PRGO I actions (in particular in land and natural resources
management) left difficult questions relating to implementation open. The Merit-Based Pay Initiative
(MBPI, later renamed to Merit-Based Performance Incentives) also proved troublesome as its
asymmetric approach challenged equity within the civil service (a risk that materialized as the

                                                        6
scheme was eventually cancelled late 2009, see below). Finally, the automation and consolidation of
business processes in customs also potentially challenged past practices and opportunities created by
cumbersome processes.

Collaboration with the IMF. The Bank and Fund staffs collaborated closely on the proposed PRGO
series. Bank and Fund teams ensured that the proposed conditionalities (and structural policy aims in
the Article IV consultations) were complementary and mutually reinforcing. As indicated, the PRGF
did not go forward due to unfinished discussions regarding the rescheduling of official debt owed by
Cambodia to the US and the former USSR. The IMF has continued with its regular program of
Article IV consultations and other missions. Based on that, it provided a favorable assessment of
Cambodia's macroeconomic environment (see Annex 4 of the PRGO 1 Board document). An
adequate macroeconomic environment is a necessary pre-condition for a budget support
operation such as the PRGO.

Collaboration with other Development Partners. The PRGO is cofinanced by 4 DPs, working in
partnership with a broader group of DPs. After PRGO 1 was approved by IDA's Board in July 2007
the Japanese Government signed a JBIC loan for JPN¥1 billion (around US$8.5 million at March
2008 exchange rates). The European Commission (EC) approved a contribution of 22.2 million for
the period 2007-10 (plus 0.72 million for complementary technical assistance (TA) to support
building RGC's statistical capacity, and 0.18 million for the operations' evaluation). The first
annual disbursement equal to 5 million (around $7 million) was disbursed in December 2007. DFID
(UK) approved a £7.5 million program over 3 years (plus £200,000 complementary TA funds). The
first disbursement of £1.5m (around US$3 million) was made in March 2008. In addition, AusAid,
CIDA, SIDA, and the Spanish Cooperation have been closely engaged in the process. In total, US$31
million of budget support funds have been disbursed in support of PRGO 1.

Analytical Underpinnings and Relationship to Other Bank Operations

Each broad reform area of the PRGO program is underpinned by analytical work and
supported by complementary operations (Table 2). This complementary also reflects the fact that
the PRGO supports the pillars of the CAS. In many cases, these complementary products were
supported (or even led, as in the case of the FY08 Diagnostic Trade Integration Strategy) by other
DPs. Analytical work has played a catalytic role in identifying key issues, designing policy options,
and mobilizing stakeholders to design a reform strategy. At the same time, complementary TA and
investment operations were necessary to ensure implementation of the RGC's reform program. Given
RGC's weak implementation capacity, these projects typically had a strong capacity building
component. In turn, the PRGOs addressed high-level policy changes and cross-sectoral issues that
were important in creating an enabling environment for the investment projects.

In the area of Private Sector Development, the 2004 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) was a
key input to the design of the Bank's US$10 million Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project.
The project focuses on trade facilitation, export promotion, fostering private participation in
infrastructure, and legal transparency. In 2007, the Bank participated in a multi-donor effort led by
the UNDP to update the Diagnostic for Trade Integration Strategy. In 2008, further analytical work
was undertaken to update the ICA and study Cambodia's sources of growth. This was complemented
by a strong collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), including its Mekong
Private Sector Development Facility, which supports Government-private sector dialogue, business
enabling environment, financial sector reform, and sectoral developments (micro-finance, agro-
business, and tourism).
                                                 7
In the area of Public Financial Management, the 2003 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public
Expenditure Review, which was followed in 2004 by the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR, 2004) and in 2006 and 2007 by Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) in education
and health, served as important inputs to the RGC's PFM Reform Program (PFMRP). A major
PFMRP Stage 2 planning exercise was undertaken with a multi-donor review mission in November
2007. In FY06, IDA approved a US$14 million grant for the Public Financial Management and
Accountability Project, with the objective of strengthening: (i) the mobilization of public resources;
(ii) the management of public resources; (iii) the management of human resources; and (iv) external
audit capacity. The project focuses on revenue management, budget formulation and execution,
capacity development, and external audit. The project is cofinanced by a US$17 million Multi-Donor
PFM Trust Fund, managed by the Bank, and supported by AusAID, DFID, EC, and SIDA.

In the area of Land and Natural Resource Management, a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
(2004) was carried out in support of plans to implement a program of social land concessions, a
Rural Sector Strategy Note (2005) establishes a broad framework to explore options for Cambodia's
future directions for rural development, and an Agrarian Structure Study (FY08) deepened the
analysis on the role of various models of land distribution and farm sizes in the development of
commercial agriculture. A series of Environment Monitors helped raise the awareness on some of the
major environmental challenges of the country (such as the conservation of Cambodia's exceptional
bio-diversity). The Justice for the Poor AAA program (FY 05-07) threw light on issues relating to
land disputes and dispute resolution. The Strategic Partnership Framework for Natural Resources
Management, prepared by the World Bank, identifies cross-cutting as well as sub-sector specific

                                                     8
actions needed to progress towards Cambodia's broader socio-economic objectives. In FY02 IDA
approved the US$24 million Land Management and Administration Project (LMAP) to improve land
tenure security and promote the development of efficient land markets through: (i) development of
policies and institutions for land administration; (ii) issuance and registration of titles; and (iii)
establishment of an efficient and transparent land administration system. In FY08, IDA approved a
US$11.5 million Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED) Project which
supports RGC's efforts in the area of social land concessions. Other donors also provided funds to
strengthen community forestry, support biodiversity and protected areas (PAs), and encourage civil
society engagement in the implementation of social land concessions.

The PRGO also links to the World Bank's engagement on the demand-side of governance, one
of the CAS pillars. Increasing support for demand-side approaches to good governance ­ involving
the broader constituencies for reform; e.g. citizens, youth, media, Parliament, private sector, NGOs,
DPs, etc ­ complemented the reform program supported by the PRGOs (e.g. progress towards
transparency in PFM and LNRM). A US$2 million grant was mobilized in 2006 to build capacity of
the civil society in the area of social accountability. A Demand for Good Governance Project to
strengthen the accountability of state and non-state institutions was approved by the Board in January
2009 (US$20 million).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The main reform areas were presented in the PRGO Policy Matrix which specifies policy
actions to be taken, and performance indicators (with baseline values and targets to be reached
by the end of the program series). Targets to be reached were almost always quantified. The
indicators were a subset of the JMIs which are also tracked within the thematic TWG. The set of
indicators and targets was further refined during implementation (with technical inputs from an EC-
funded analysis) to improve the quality of the PRGO program and define a methodology for impact
evaluation.

The PRGO program also supported the monitoring of the NSDP and has been helping with statistical
capacity development. Together with DFID, Swedish Statistics, and the UNDP, the Bank supports
the Ministry of Planning and the National Institute of Statistics.

PRGO monitoring was based on continuous dialogue with government counterparts to assess
progress and bottlenecks. With most team members in the Phnom Penh office, synergies with
complementary TA projects and analytical work, and close coordination with field office staff of
DFID, EC and JBIC (through JBIC Bangkok and JICA Cambodia Offices at that time), monitoring
was done on a relatively continuous basis. In March 2008, an EC-funded consultant supported the
team in improving the monitoring framework and drafted a methodology for end-of-program
evaluation.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Dialogue has been continuing on the preparation of a follow-up operation (PRGO 2). Future
Development Policy Operations were envisaged as part of the CAS Progress Report submitted to the
Bank's Board in 2008.
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The PRGO program (2007-09) had three objectives (see Section 1.1):

Objective 1 was the main PDO. Policy actions to support the achievement of that objective were
grouped into three broad reform areas: (i) Private Sector Development aimed at improving the
business climate; (ii) Public Financial Management in order to improve public service delivery; and
(iii) Land and Natural Resource Management which, by devising a legal framework and procedures
to allocate land as equitably as possible to a range of users, would raise agricultural productivity
(including, sustainable management of forests). In each of the areas, there were policy actions that
were aimed at the improvement of various aspects of governance.

Policy actions in the three broad reform areas were chosen in line with the Government's
NSDP, the Bank's CAS (which was aligned with the NSDP, but with a focus on selective areas
covered in the PRGO series) and in discussion with the DPs that were cofinancing the PRGO, other
DPs and representatives of civil society (especially in the LNRM areas). The policy actions chosen
were relevant, based on evidence obtained through a series of analytical reports and supported in
almost every case with TA projects with strong capacity building components (see section 2.2). Each
reform area was monitored both in terms of process through various levels of dialogue with the
Government and through a series of quantified JMIs.

Tables 5 through 7 in Section 3.2 summarize the reform areas covered, policy actions taken in
each area and, to the extent possible, the performance indicator measures of outcomes. Prior
actions for PRGO 1 are also discussed in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) accompanying the
PRGO 1 Program Document (Annex 1, WB (2007)) where they are related to the relevant aspects of
the Government's RS. They are also laid out in full detail in the PRGO Policy Matrix in Annex 2 of
this ICR.

Objective 2. The PRGO Policy Matrix contains nearly 40 performance indicators, virtually all
quantified, to allow the RGC, DPs and civil society to track progress over time. The selection of
reform areas to be supported built on the reform momentum in these areas. One could argue
about the strength of the momentum in the LMRN area, but given that some 90 percent of
Cambodia's population live in the countryside, that 70 percent of all the poor derive their living from
agriculture, and that job creation in rural areas will remain important for the years to come (given the
size of the non-agricultural private sector) to absorb the surplus rural population, the PRGO took a
calculated risk by entering into some politically and technically thorny issues in land and natural
resources. Transparency in extractive industries and the asymmetric approach to civil service reform
were other complex risk areas.

Objective 3. The PRGO program was, in part, meant to be an instrument for the harmonization of
DP policy positions, as well as a test to see whether budget support (in tandem with TA support in
each reform area) would improve aid effectiveness, It was also to gradually tie into the budget cycle
of the government. The selection of performance indicators from among the existing JMIs was also
meant to improve DP alignment with the government. Given the fragmented nature of aid in
Cambodia and the RGC's leadership in aid effectiveness (under the Council for the Development of
Cambodia); this was a highly relevant objective for PRGO.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

Overall Program Development Objectives and macroeconomic framework:

Cambodia's macroeconomic framework was conducive to growth during 2007 and 2008. The
economy grew strongly in 2007 and at a somewhat more subdued rate in 2008. Gross investment,
led by private investment, continued to grow as a proportion of (strongly growing) GDP which
suggests that private investors found the business environment sufficiently conducive. FDI was
particularly strong in 2007/2008 (almost 10 percent of GDP in 2007). The one weak point was a
pick-up in inflation in late 2007 and the first half of 2008, largely driven by a world-wide boom in
commodity prices, including oil, the price of which at one point exceeded US$100 a barrel. This
supply-driven inflation was observed in many countries around the world but not at the level of
Cambodia's. This reflected a combination of domestically-generated overheating pressures and
weakness of the monetary instruments due to the extreme dollarization of the economy. Still,
Cambodia was able to keep the nominal exchange rate steady which meant a strong appreciation of
the real exchange rate (of the Riel) in 2008.

The main PDO of PRGO 1 was aimed at improving the business environment and agricultural
productivity in the medium term. Thus, almost by design it could not have had much of an
impact on macroeconomic outcomes in 2007 and 2008. Those were mainly due to the
momentum built up in the past few years. There were three PRGO performance indicators at the
macro level: (i) growth continuing at the rate of at least 7 percent a year: achieved; (ii) maintaining
debt sustainability and moderate risk of debt distress: achieved (see IMF 2009, Annex of DSA); and
(iii) poverty reduction in accordance with the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs):
unknown but likely. While data on the CMDGs is not yet available, the continued rapid growth in
2008 is likely to have translated into higher employment and reduced poverty rates. Higher prices of
food have increased vulnerabilities but have also created opportunities for poorer farmers (those that
are net producers of rice in particular). The translation of growth to other MDGs is more indirect but,
except in rare cases, growth (through higher revenues and therefore expenditures) tends to be
beneficial to most outcomes that depend on service delivery. The one area that could have been
impacted negatively is that of natural resources, which tend to get depleted if growth depends
strongly on their exploitation for commercial purposes. The NLRM reform area in the PRGO is
trying to help the RGC put in place legal frameworks and policies that would mitigate that.

A prudent fiscal framework (see Table 4) was continued during PRGO 1. Revenues, although
low (by international standards) as a percentage of GDP were well in excess of current expenditures
throughout the period covered in Table 4. This enabled the RGC to have capital expenditures

                                                   11
amounting to about 6 percent of GDP and still be able to set money aside for reserves (cash deposits
with NBC that could be drawn on in case of emergency). This was due mainly to strong grant and
(net) foreign financing inflows, of which budget support from PRGO 1 during 2007 represented less
than 10 percent. The flipside of Cambodia's fiscal prudence is that, at 14 percent of GDP, the
expenditure envelope might be too tight to accommodate adequate support for service delivery areas
such as education, health and the judiciary (needed to improve governance). This partly reflects
capacity constraints, but is a challenge that the Cambodian authorities face in mobilizing more
domestic revenues (through improvements in tax administration, new taxes or reductions in tax
concessions to foreign investors which are substantial). Future budget support operations may wish
to look at the tight fiscal space more closely as the authorities develop estimates of the levels of
support that Cambodia could productively absorb in the key identified service delivery areas.

Reform Program Outcomes in the policy area of Private Sector Development (PSD)

The RS and the NSDP placed PSD at the center of the reform agenda. By the time that the
PRGO series was being designed, Cambodia had already put in place a number of measures to
improve the business environment.

In the policy area of PSD, the PRGO series aimed at improving reform program outcomes in
three areas: (i) facilitating trade and improving transparency and accountability of all trade-related
procedures; (ii) increasing the volume of exports and diversifying the export base; and (iii) increasing
domestic and foreign private investment, including in infrastructure. The three reform program
outcome areas are marked in bold in the first column of Table 5 below (an excerpt from the PRGO
Operation Policy Matrix).

PSD reform program outcome areas (i) facilitating trade and improving transparency and
accountability of all trade-related procedures; and (ii) increasing the volume of exports and
diversifying the export base.

The first challenge to successfully attain these outcomes was to continue to make progress on
the regulatory and institutional front. On the regulatory side, the Customs Law was enacted in
2007 and a first batch of supporting regulations has since been adopted. The ASEAN Harmonized
Trade Tariffs were introduced in July 2007, further reducing tariffs. On the institutional front, the
Ministry of Commerce (MOC was restructured in 2007, in order to pave the way for future
performance related incentives).

A well designed risk management strategy was expected to reduce the number of containers
that are physically opened, while improving control. After the issuance of a sub-decree on risk
management in March 2006, progress has been made in a number of areas. First, a Risk Management
and Audit Office was created and staffed in the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE).
Second, progress was made in implementing a risk-based approach at the border: (i) a list of
prohibited and restricted goods has been agreed (and its length has been rationalized); (ii) service
level agreements between the relevant agencies were drafted (although there were significant delays
before their finalization in 2009 and 2010); (iii) standard operating procedures have been agreed; and
(iv) a Traders' Credibility Management System has been established to profile traders through risk
indicators and selectivity criteria and the system has been linked to ASYCUDA.

Computerization of Cambodia's customs system was expected to facilitate business for traders,
improve security through better screening and risk management, enhance revenue collection
and reduce the opportunities for rent seeking. Although there was a delay in implementation, an
important milestone was met in May 2008 with the launch of the ASYCUDA system in the Port of
Sihanoukville. With the expansion to the Phnom Penh dry ports and international airport, half of the
declarations are now lodged through the ASYCUDA system. A Steering Committee was created in
June 2008 to manage the development of the Single Window. The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) is
preparing a master plan to computerize its operations, in order to be able to link its trade-related
processes to the Trade Information Website. The GDCE is considering introducing a fee to finance
the operation and maintenance of ASYCUDA. This may offer an opportunity to review fees across
trade-related processes.

Simpler and more transparent documentary requirements would facilitate trade. First, a Single
Administrative Document (SAD) was implemented in its manual version in January 2008. Its
electronic version was subsequently implemented with ASYCUDA. The SAD simplifies and
standardizes the documentary requirements for imports and exports. Second, the MOC has
significantly enhanced the volume of information available to businesses and traders. A number of
regulations and processes were posted on the MOC website. An export booklet was prepared and
disseminated by the RGC and the private sector. The MOC has also started to design a Trade
Information Website (TIW) to enable the publication of trade-related information.

Progress was visible by 2009. Time for imports at the Phnom Penh International Airport had
dropped from 3 days for imports (2 days for exports) in June 2005 to a few hours by late 2009, and,
at the Port of Sihanoukville, from 5 days for imports (2 for exports) in June 2005 to 3-4 days by late
2009. ASYCUDA was functioning in the Port of Sihanoukville: during the first 9 months of 2009,
for example, less than 20 percent were physically inspected (red channel), with the rest going through
either yellow or blue channel.

Performance indicators in Table 5 above reflect these findings. Outcomes in PSD reform
program outcome areas (i) and (ii) are thus judged to be satisfactory (see Table 5 above).

PSD reform program outcomes in area (iii) increasing domestic and foreign private investment,
including in infrastructure.

A number of regulatory and administrative requirements were considered to be detrimental to
private investment. The "Doing Business Indicators" suggest that regulatory requirements remain
high. As a result the RGC has taken several actions. The amendments to the Law on Investment and
the associated regulations brought critical improvements to the process of foreign investments and
the role of the Cambodia Investment Board (CIB). In 2006, an investment guidebook for investors
was issued for the first time in the country. In 2007, a Handbook on Commercial Registration was
produced to help entrepreneurs understand the process to setup a business, a new commercial registry
was established at MOC, the decentralization of business registration was piloted in the province of
Battambang, a business licensing hotline was launched, and a one-stop information window was
created to provide information on all licenses affecting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

Commercial arbitration has been identified as a key issue for the investment climate. A Law on
Commercial Arbitration was enacted by the National Assembly (NA) in 2006, paving the way for the
creation of an independent Arbitration Center. The subsequent approval of an implementing sub-
decree and recruitment of a first batch of arbitrators pave the way for initial implementation in 2010.
                                                         15
The number of judgments issued by such a center was to be an indicator of performance later in the
PRGO series.

Progress in facilitating Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) in an effective and
transparent way is critical. The Law on Concessions was enacted by the NA in 2007, an important
milestone for PRGO 1. Adoption of the sub-decree for its implementation should facilitate the
implementation of sound PPI principles, such as the disclosure of concessions. Nevertheless progress
in 2008-10 toward that objective has been limited, with the sub-decree not approved yet.

Finally, the RGC has embarked on a policy to create Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in addition
to its efforts to facilitate necessary infrastructure development. First, the legal and regulatory
framework, now based on a 2005 sub-decree, was reviewed based on the implementation experience.
Second, services offered by the SEZ need continued improvement. One Stop Services (OSS) have
been introduced in the first operational SEZ in Bavet and in other SEZs in the future. Third, a
troubleshooting committee has been created and is considered as effective in quickly addressing
problems identified by SEZ-based firms.

Progress in all the areas was on track, with the exception of PPI. Outcomes in PSD reform
program outcome area (iii) is considered to be moderately satisfactory.

Reform Program Outcomes in the policy area of Public Financial Management

The RGC has placed PFM reform squarely on its development and poverty reduction agendas.
Weaknesses in the public expenditure and financial management system not only have high costs in
terms of allocative and operational efficiency but also create unacceptably high levels of fiduciary
risk to public funds. The critical test of a public expenditure management system is its ability to
deliver a predictable and timely flow of funds to the spending agencies. The cash-based payments
system was a major constraint to the achievement of this objective. Due to cash constraints, budget
execution suffered from delays and an unpredictable release of funds, undermining operational
planning, and leading to the build-up of arrears. The system was plagued by gate-keeping and
deficient accounting and reporting systems, thus leading to a weak control environment and
increasing opportunities for corruption.

Beyond PFM, one of the other major reasons for low quality public services in Cambodia was
the absence of an effective system of incentives and accountability mechanisms in the civil
service. Weak merit-based civil service management and low pay were the leading causes of
Cambodia's relatively poor standing on public sector performance. A strategically sequenced civil
service reform needed to be initiated in the short term and carried out over the medium term. The
reform program needed to take a broad approach to strengthening civil service management, by
introducing a merit-based system that guaranteed that human resource expenditures were subject to
controls (viz., on hiring and promotion) and were fully integrated with the budget formulation
process. Wages of the civil servants had to be raised, in order, to attract and retain skilled staff,
especially for high level management and priority sector staff.

In response to these challenges, the RGC formulated a ten-year Public Financial Management
Reform Program (PFMRP), launched by the Prime Minister in December 2004. Supported by
the PRGO series, it focuses on four development objectives: (i) ensuring that the budget is realistic
and implemented as intended in a predictable manner; (ii) implementing the policy agenda through a
comprehensive, orderly and transparent budget process; (iii) improving accountability and internal

                                                 16
control systems to strengthen compliance and transparency in the mobilization and use of public
resources; and (iv) motivating civil servants through an incentive system managed according to
meritocratic principles and procedures. The four reform program outcome areas are marked in bold
in the first column of Table 6 below.

PFMRP outcomes in area (i) ensuring that budget is realistic and implemented as intended in a
predictable manner.

A realistic budget depends on a strong revenue base which, in turn, depends on effective
collection of revenues. Cambodia has one of the lowest revenue to GDP ratios among developing
countries. A good portion of the revenues in the past came from import tariffs. As the economy
opened up, this source of revenues declined. The economy's rapid growth was also stretching the
capacity of the tax administration. In 2008, the MEF adopted an overarching resource mobilization
policy. This policy sought to progressively increase the revenue to GDP ratio to above 12.5 percent
by 2010 and clarified RGC's intent in the area of extractive industry taxation and non-tax revenues.
The MEF has also produced an approach paper for debt management policy.

A related issue was to maximize revenues from extractive industries and manage them
effectively and transparently. At the time PRGO 1 went to the Board, there was a prospect of a
major increase in revenues from the extraction of oil, gas, or mining resources. In 2007/08, the RGC
studied various options for the fiscal regime of petroleum production and revenue management.
Amendments to the Tax Law for the petroleum sector were prepared. The MEF prepared a paper on
oil revenue management options, including oil funds, stressing key principles of transparency and
budget integration. The RGC analyzed the pros and cons of implementing the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI). Given continued uncertainty of available resources, the RGC decided
to give priority to: (i) building its capacity to administer revenue policies in the sector; (ii)
strengthening fiscal transparency through regular disclosure of quarterly fiscal reports identifying
revenues from extractive industries; and (iii) improving accountability through better information-
sharing and discussion mechanisms (within the RGC and with civil society). An action plan to
implement this approach was approved and regular public fiscal reports started to incorporate
information on revenues from extractive industries in 2009.

Increasing RGC's reliance on the banking system would improve expenditure management
and revenue collection. The past system, relying on cash payments and transfers, is very ineffective
and vulnerable to leakages. On the salary side, bank transfers have been piloted since August 2006.
In 2007, the pilot was expanded to all civil servants in Phnom Penh with a salary of 400,000 Riels or
above (around US$100) and to all civil servants in Sihanoukville and Siem Reap with a salary of
200,000 Riels or above. Payments to creditors made by check increased from 41 percent in 2006 to
63 percent in 2008. GDCE obligations paid by check rose to 63 percent by 2006. Banking
arrangements were heavily fragmented, in part a reflection of poor aid practices including the
establishment of parallel bank accounts (the RGC closed some 760 of its accounts in 2007/08).

Weak procurement practices contribute to ineffectiveness of the PFM system (as evidenced for
instance by the 2006 INT investigations, which led to the hiring of an IPA for all IDA investment
operations). First, the regulatory framework needed to be further upgraded. The RGC took major
steps in 2005-07 to strengthen it, including the adoption of a sub-decree to modernize the
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRRs), which now provide greater clarity about roles and
accountabilities and increase transparency. Second, efforts to build capacity and redefine MEF's role,
as a steward of public procurement, stalled in 2008, in part due to the focus on the IPA.
                                                 17
Finally, budget execution processes need streamlining. The complexities in this area contributed
both to delays in implementing the budget (and gaps between budgets and actuals, which eroded the
credibility of the budget) and opportunities for rent-seeking. A first phase of streamlining was
implemented in January 2007, simplifying many processes (for salary payments, non-procurement
items, and petty cash), revamping commitment processes, and beginning the process of relocating
financial controllers to line ministries. As a result, MEF's processing time for commitment and
payment order approvals for procurement items has been reduced from 46 to 30 working days.
Further streamlining will depend on the implementation of the Financial Management Information
System (FMIS).

Progress in areas of budget realism was positive. Outcomes in PFMRP outcome area (i) are
considered to be satisfactory.

PFMRP outcomes in area (ii) ensuring that the policy agenda is implemented through a
comprehensive, orderly and transparent budget process, including better control of the civil service
establishment.

The quality of the budget preparation process has improved. Although the PFMRP recognizes
this as a medium term issue (a prerequisite is to improve the realism of budget implementation and
the quality of reporting), a number of initiatives are under way. First, the organization of the budget
cycle has been restructured to allow for a strategic phase early in the year (with the preparation and
discussion of a medium term expenditure framework), followed by line ministries' submissions of
Budget Strategy Plans (BSPs), budget negotiations, and the finalization of the budget for submission
to the NA. Second, the MEF has introduced program budgeting in 7 pilot ministries. Together with
the new chart of accounts and budget classification structure, BSPs and program budgets will
enhance the policy content of the budget. However, the approach remains limited as programs
currently cover only non-salary recurrent spending.

Despite some improvement, the budget continues to lack integration. Dual budgeting is evident
from budget preparation to budget execution, with different processes for the recurrent and the
capital budgets and different departments leading the process both in MEF and in line ministries. The
issue is compounded by aid practices. Some progress has been made in terms of reporting and, since
2010, through a breakdown of the "domestically-financed" capital budget by main ministries.

Linkages between the budget and civil service management remain weak. At the time that PRGO
1 was being prepared, the payroll and the establishment control was being managed by the Council
for Administrative Reform (CAR), with little coordination with MEF at the time of budget
preparation. In 2008, some progress was made through an improved flow of information for budget
preparation. The adoption of a fiscally sustainable pay reform would further enhance the linkages
between the budget and civil service management (see below).

Progress on the program budgeting side was on track, while the implementation of budget
integration and linkages between the budget and civil service management are moving slowly.
Outcomes in PFMRP outcome area (ii) are judged to be moderately satisfactory.

PFMRP outcomes in area (iii) improving accountability and internal control systems in order to
strengthen compliance and transparency in the mobilization and use of public resources

The RGC intends to automate and improve data management, accounting, and reporting. Since
2006, a number of preparatory steps have been taken to enable the implementation of a Financial
Management Information System (FMIS), including mapping out principles, roles, responsibilities,
and business processes for a more de-concentrated PFM system. Progress in 2007 was slower than
initially anticipated; nevertheless experience from other countries emphasizes the need to put the
right conditions in place before embarking on an FMIS project. A number of these conditions have
seen been put in place (and the second stage of the bidding process has been initiated): (i) approval of
an FMIS policy paper; (ii) review of roles and responsibilities, principles, business processes, and
controls included in revised FMIS specifications; (iii) recruitment of 10 ICT specialists (currently
undergoing training); (iv) recruitment of 10 business analysts (underway); and (v) deployment of a


                                                  20
team of FMIS experts to support FMIS implementation (ICT, functional, change management, and
legal experts).

Internal and external audits are important for strengthening accountability. While 26 Internal
Audit Departments (IADs), including a coordinating IAD in MEF, were created in 2006, only 23
were operational by mid-2010 and they were producing regular reports. The MEF is developing its
capacity to manage and oversee these IADs. In Nov 2009 and Apr/May 2010, MEF reviewed a
strategic plan for internal audit and internal audit modalities. On the external audit side, the National
Audit Authority (NAA) produced reports of the annual accounts of the 2005 was tabled to the NA in
2007. By law (2000 Audit Law), the report issued by the Auditor-General shall be deemed to be
public document (Article 29) unless the report affects the public interest and the legal business
(Article 37 and 38). A major development was the release in 2009 of the first annual audit report
covering the fiscal year 2006.

Progress on developing the FMIS was good, although slower than expected. Development of
the audit functions could have been stronger. While considerably more progress in the audit area
occurred by early 2010, it is not appropriate to count it as an outcome of PRGO 1. On balance, the
outcomes in PFMRP outcome area (iii) are judged to be satisfactory.

PFMRP outcomes in area (iv) motivating civil servants through an effective incentive system and
managing them according to meritocratic principles and procedures.

The RGC has recognized the critical role of an effective system of incentives and accountability
mechanisms in the civil service. Weak merit-based civil service, low pay, and pervasive corruption
are the leading causes of Cambodia's relatively poor standing on public sector performance. These
issues were compounded by the practice of uncoordinated salary supplements by DPs. CSR has been
discussed in Cambodia for more than a decade: some progress had been made in rationalizing the
civil service and raising general pay levels, but decompressing salaries and introducing merit and
performance-based practices remained challenging. The situation resulted in the introduction of a
targeting scheme, the MBPI, which sought to provide better salaries for key public officials,
rationalize salary supplements (which are rampant in Cambodia), and introduce the notion of merit-
based selection (into the scheme) and performance evaluation (each person selected would sign a
contract which included expected performance targets). The risks associated with the approach ­
including risks of inequitable or ring-fenced coverage, inherent to an asymmetric scheme, and risks
of poor sustainability (with sustainability based on a fiscal transfer onto Government funding which
was very gradual) ­ were recognized upfront. When PRGO 1 was being prepared, the scheme had
already been introduced into the MEF and the Minister of Commerce had requested that the Bank
work with him on introducing it into the MOC. There were also discussions in progress on
introducing it into the MOH.

In April 2008, the RGC passed Sub-Decree 29 to amend Sub-Decree 98, which had created the
MBPI. These amendments created a unified scheme that could be used in all ministries with
development programs. It was based on the MBPI and incorporated its key principles (merit-based
selection and evaluation, complaint mechanisms, sustainability, etc.). The approach was supported by
an effort from DPs to rationalize salary supplementation schemes and enhance coordination and
transparency. Under the leadership of the Council for Administrative Reform, a number of the
shortcomings identified from the pilot stage were addressed.



                                                   21
In parallel, the RGC started developing the framework for a comprehensive reform. In recent
years, the RGC had implemented across-the-board pay increases to reduce the gap between public
sector and private sector wage levels. Yet, these increases were neither creating the necessary
decompression of the pay scales, nor introducing better performance management practices. This led
to the start of a more determined longer term effort to redesign and sustainably fund a multi-stage
reform of the civil service. A draft National Program for Administrative Reform was prepared in
2009 and a number of human resource management policies are nearing completion.

However, the MBPI (as well as the related Priority Mission Group schemes, and all forms of
salary supplements) was terminated at the end of 2009. Concerns gradually emerged about the
divisive nature of an asymmetric scheme. The RGC has now put forward a two-track approach, with
an interim scheme ("Priority Operating Costs") to support in the short-term the implementation of
reform programs, and, in parallel, a compensation reform as part of the broader National Program for
Administrative Reform.

Progress on developing solutions to capacity constraints in the civil service was there for a
while but, at the time of writing, seems to have been unsustainable. It presents a dilemma that is
fairly common in developing countries with a weak civil service. Such countries badly need to
improve the capacities of their civil service, yet there are virtually no success stories to use as
"models". The MBPI was to be an interim solution while the groundwork was being laid for the
reform of the entire civil service. Unfortunately, it proved to be unsustainable. The PFM reform
program outcome in area (iv) is thus judged as unsatisfactory. But, there may be a silver lining to
this unsatisfactory experience. The policy dialogue after the cancellation of the MBPI, the MBPI
experience itself, which introduced merit-based practices in some programs, the RGC / DP consensus
to stop all forms of ad hoc salary supplements, and the Council of Administrative Reform's National
Program for Administrative Reform may pave the way for more robust outcomes in the area of civil
service reform in the future.

Reform Program Outcomes in the policy area of Land and Natural Resources Management

The RGC has indicated that stewardship of natural resources and secure access to land are of
vital importance to Cambodia's rural majority, yet major governance constraints--rooted in
non-transparent processes, a lack of public accountability, and complex historical legacies--
undermine the use of natural resources for pro-poor growth and poverty reduction. The key
document that reflects RGC's position in this area is the Statement on Land Policy approved by the
COM in May 2001. The Statement identifies three objectives for a pro-poor, pro-growth land policy
to: (i) strengthen land tenure security and land markets, and prevent or resolve land disputes; (ii)
manage natural resources in an equitable, sustainable, and efficient manner; and (iii) promote land
distribution with equity. The RGC has acknowledged past and current abuses of natural resource
management, and is taking an approach to reform that reflects the challenges of competing interests
within and outside government. Given this context, the RGC, in the years since 2001, has focused on
completing the legal framework, establishing delivery systems for key services required to establish a
more transparent and participatory approach to land and natural resources management and, where
necessary, piloting implementation of the delivery systems to build implementation capacity and feed
back into the development of the regulatory framework. This approach has facilitated incremental
reform, but has not yet effectively reduced pressures on land and natural resources.




                                                 22
The Land Policy objectives respond to the need to increase agricultural productivity by
addressing landlessness and tenure insecurity. The proportion of rural households lacking land for
cultivation has trended upward, from 13 percent in 1997 to 20 percent in 2004. While the major
causes of landlessness are population growth and low agricultural productivity, transfers of state
lands (including those occupied by the poor) to powerful interests is worsening the situation. At the
same time tenure insecurity weakens the agriculture sector's ability to underpin broad-based growth
and poverty reduction (World Bank, 2006). Thus, improving the administration and management of
land and natural resources is vital for increasing agricultural productivity, which lags in Cambodia in
regional comparison, and reducing social conflict.

In order to implement the policy statement, the RGC enacted a new Land Law, established the
Council for Land Policy (CLP), and mobilized DP financing. The new Land Law was passed in
2001 following an extensive consultation process. The CLP was established to coordinate
Government agencies involved in land resources management.

Steps taken by the RGC in the months preceding the preparation of PRGO 1 suggested a
degree of momentum on L&NRM issues. It: (i) passed a Sub-Decree on state land management
requiring that state land be registered prior to transaction; (ii) prepared a draft Sub-Decree on Land
and Property Acquisition and Addressing Socio-Economic Impacts Caused by State Development
Projects, setting out procedures for public appropriation of privately owned land (including
limitations on the instances in which land can be expropriated and frameworks for deciding on
compensation); and (iii) worked with GTZ and the World Bank to conduct a review of the
functioning of the Cadastral Commission (completed in 2006) providing a series of recommendations
for improving its performance. During this time the RGC also completed its first mapping and
registration of state lands--a key element of improving overall state land management--in the
context of allocation of land to the poor through social land concessions.

The PRGO series built on these steps in order to support the implementation of key elements of
the RGC's land policy strategic framework, so that improved utilization of land resources
could support sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The actions proposed in PRGO were
supportive of the Strategic Framework for Natural Resources Management (NRM) under discussion
at the time. The draft NRM framework emphasizes increased transparency, decentralization and local
empowerment, and partnership as the basis for moving from a situation of high conflict and minimal
public benefits to one which increases both local and national public benefits and increases
collaboration amongst state actors and state and private entities in the protection and use of natural
resources. The areas of PRGO focus--titling and dispute resolution, decentralized state land
management, increased transparency of state land utilization and land distribution, expanding use of
participatory approaches to natural resources management, and demarcation of production and
protection forests--potentially represent the basis for implementing a substantial shift in the
governance of land and natural resources in favor of local communities and the poor as well as
increasing public accountability.

The PRGO series supporting RGC's reform program in the policy area of LNRM is focused on
improving reform program outcomes in two broad areas: (i) accelerating the distribution of land and
the issuance of secure land titles; and (ii) improving the management of state land. The two reform
program outcome areas are marked in bold in the first column of Table 7 below.




                                                  23
LNRM reform program outcomes in area (i) accelerating the distribution of land and the issuance
of secure land titles

Security of tenure for private land must be ensured. First, with support from the LMAP, an
improved process of land registration and title issuance is now in place. As of June 2008 1.18 million
plots had been surveyed, 988,000 plots had been adjudicated, and 856,000 titles had been issued,
although concerns exist in relation to the process for deciding whether households are lawful
possessors and how they should be treated if they are not. To accelerate the process, the Ministry of
Land Management Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC) issued a Prakas to authorize
provincial governors to sign off on cadastral maps as the basis for title issuance. This has been
implemented in 15 out of 24 provinces. Second, the RGC has discussed adjusting the incentives for
formal registration as the pace of land transfers especially in urban areas is increasing due to land
speculation, with concerns that subsequent transactions are not properly registered in the cadastre.
Third, Cadastral Commissions (CC) and a National Authority for the Resolution of Land Disputes
(NARLD) were established (in 2003 and 2006 respectively) to resolve land disputes. CC
performance has improved gradually, even though resolving more complex or high-profile disputes
will remain an issue absent a stronger judiciary.

The basis for tenure security should be extended to those not covered by individual titles,
indigenous communities in particular. Despite some progress in setting up the legal framework for
titling land belonging to indigenous communities, these groups remain acutely tenure insecure and
progress needs to be accelerated on this front.

In 2007, a Policy on the Registration of Indigenous Community Land was developed by the
Council for Land Policy (CLP) and disseminated for public review and comment. A Sub-Decree
on the same subject was prepared in 2008 and adopted in 2009. The titling of land for these
communities follows a two-step process: (i) the Ministry of Interior (MoI) registers indigenous
communities as legal entities (12 had been registered by mid-2010 and 15 were expected to be
registered by the end of 2010); then (ii) MLMUPC leads the demarcation and registration of
community land (three pilot villages in Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri were coming close to completing
that process by mid-2010). Finally, some efforts have been made to take measures to prevent the
alienation of land prior to titling (most notably by the Governor of Mondulkiri who issued a
December 2008 order to cease land transactions in one village that had reached the stage of legal
entity registration). Progress to secure land for indigenous communities has however been slow,
owing to the complexity of the task of generating consensus and creating by-laws for communities
and the many public agencies involve in the process, while in parallel economic pressures on land,
including that of indigenous communities, have been increasing.

The RGC's Social Land Concession (SLC) policy is important for the landless poor. To
facilitate the allocation of land to poor people, the RGC is implementing its SLC program with the
support of the WB and GTZ funded Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development
(LASED) project in Kampong Cham, Kompong Thom, and Kratie Provinces. Progress has been
made in these provinces to distribute land, with the land use and allocation plan already approved for
745 families in Kratie and Kompong Cham (an allocation plan has been approved in Kompong Thom
and beneficiaries are now being selected). The program seems to have generated substantial interest
since, at the time of the interviews for this report; the author was shown a long list of communities
applying for the SLC land allocation program.



                                                 24
Progress in land allocation and issuance of secure land titles has been strong in the case of
securing private land titles of the existing land owners, while progress to allocate land to the
landless and the titling of indigenous people's community lands has been slow but positive. On
balance, the outcomes in the LNRM reform program outcome area (i) are satisfactory. It is however
noted that the design of the program did not fully address part of this reform program outcomes,
namely "resolution of land disputes quickly and transparently". In the design, no performance
indicator specifically monitored this outcome and only one milestone was directly related to it. As
noted above, despite a gradual improvement in CC performance, progress in the speed and
transparency of land dispute resolution has been limited.

LNRM reform program outcomes in area (ii) management of state lands through transparent,
participatory mechanisms, including review and check on commercial contracts and concession
agreements on natural resources and state assets.

Mapping of state land, together with better management procedures for state land are
important issues. The legal and regulatory framework, which sets processes for public participation
and transparency in management of state land, was put in place in 2005/06. In March 2007, the first
registration of state land was completed, following a process that is generally seen as appropriate in
the context of the SLC pilot in Kratie Province. This was supported by follow-up work on SLCs and
forestry demarcation. However, there remain ambiguities in the legal framework and in inter-agency
management regarding the mapping, demarcation, and management of land, Economic Land
Concessions (ELCs), forests, and PAs. Recent years have seen a continuation in evictions and
episodes of violent land conflict, in Phnom Penh, other important urban areas and in rural areas. The
issue is attributable in part to the high rate of economic growth and rapidly escalating land prices
throughout the country.

Another challenge was how to improve the situation with regard to ELCs. This requires that
their allocation is based on effective land assessment, local consultation, formal registration of
boundaries, competitive bidding and effective resolution of disputes with / compensation of existing
land users. An ELC Sub-Decree was signed in 2005 to improve the legal and regulatory framework.
In 2007/08, progress was made in the area of transparency, through the disclosure and regular update
of a list of ELCs on the website of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry (MAFF). In
addition, MAFF reports that seven ELCs, each exceeding the 10,000 ha limit under the Land Law,
have been reviewed and appropriate action consistent with Chapter 6 of the sub-decree on ELCs to
reduce or cancel is being taken. According to company profiles published in the MAFF website, as of
April 2010, two ELCs above 10,000 ha had been cancelled; five ELCs were still active but with
negotiations completed negotiation; and two were still under negotiations. An important further step
was taken in September 2008, banning the allocation of smaller ELCs by provincial authorities (the
implementation of the processes mandated by the sub-decree for these ELCs proved difficult to
monitor). Beyond the issue of ELCs that exceed the statutory limit of 10,000 ha, full enforcement of
the ELC sub-decree remains a challenge (e.g. to implement consultation process prior to land
allocation; or to ensure investment actually occurs).
                                                         26
The issue of forest and PA management, balancing the objectives of biodiversity conservation
and economic development, remains controversial. First, in the forestry sector, in 2007/08, the
Forest Administration (FA) piloted forest boundary demarcation (592 kilometers of state forest land
boundaries and 17 PAs have been demarcated). The experience with forest demarcation as well as
state land mapping and registration, PA demarcation, mining demarcation and establishment of
fishing lots and other processes related to state land demarcation, would provide lessons on how to
improve both efficiency and multi-stakeholder participation and resolution of claims by local
communities. Second as of April 2010 4 community forestry agreements had been completed with a
further 175 potential forestry communities identified. Eleven Community Protected Areas have also
been approved. Finally, with respect to bio-diversity and conservation, a PA Law was enacted in
2008.

Progress was made in the demarcation of forests and PAs, the development of the regulatory
framework for state land management, the coverage of community forestry and in the
provision of public available information about ELCs. However, though significant areas of ELC
have been cancelled, the area granted in new ELCs increased year on year in 2008 and 2009 and it is
not clear that regulatory capacity is keeping pace with demand. Progress on state land management
(e.g. toward state land maps) has been limited. The outcomes in the LNRM reform program outcome
area (ii) are moderately unsatisfactory.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

With the support of the PRGO program, Cambodia made significant progress towards achieving the
PDOs and a range of associated outcome goals, suggesting a satisfactory rating. However, the
proposed rating reflects the more limited progress in some areas (e.g. state land) and the uncertainty
on the sustainability of progress in other areas (e.g. civil service reform). In terms of the three
objectives discussed in Section 3.1 above:

Objective 1. The PRGO program was carefully aligned with RGC's RS and NSDP. These in turn
were reflected in the Bank's CAS and finally in the areas supported under the program. The key in
choosing the areas to be supported under the PRGO program was selectivity. There were and are
many potential areas that could have benefited from policy reforms in Cambodia. There was a severe
shortage of electric power (which in addition is very expensive), roads needed repair and
rehabilitation, and education and health were under-resourced. Yet, instead of focusing on these
service delivery areas, the PRGO selected three areas that would sustain growth and service delivery
in the longer run as certain aspects of governance were addressed first. That meant for example,
changing regulations that impeded business development, fixing PFM systems to provide budgetary
and revenue tools that would eventually improve service delivery as well as reduce fiduciary risks,
and creating the institutions and capacities that would lead to more equitable access to land and other
natural resources and encourage their efficient yet sustainable use.

The selection of areas to support was apt, the proposed reform actions were credible and the various
triggers and milestones robust, with perhaps a few exceptions (e.g. the likely success of MBPI down
the road, or the difficulties in adjudicating and registering communal lands, or how difficult it would
be to implement a fair and transparent oil and gas revenue regime had production come on stream as
expected in mid-2007). The overall average across reform program outcomes is moderately
satisfactory. This reflects a balance between various successes across most reform areas and the
                                                  27
difficulty and long-term nature of the challenges that were being addressed in areas such as civil
service reform and the adjudication and registration of indigenous people's lands. These were also
two areas where outcomes were less than satisfactory. The unsatisfactory rating of the MBPI scheme
in large part reflects the situation at the time of writing, and therefore may suffer to some extent from
a hindsight bias. The moderately unsatisfactory rating pertains to the area of the state land
management.

Objective 2. The objective was to focus the policy dialogue on results and achievements, and to
build on the reform momentum where political opportunity existed. The PRGO Policy Matrix
contains nearly 40 performance indicators, virtually all quantified, to allow the Government, the DPs
and the civil society to track progress over time. The indicators were chosen from among a larger
group of so-called Joint Monitoring Indicators (JMIs). They were plausible and did help focus
attention on achieving the agreed targets. In preparation for PRGO 2, there was an EC-supported
effort to re-examine the indicators for the relevance, availability, frequency and other attributes and
recommendations were made for possible adjustments. In terms of "political opportunity", the MEF
was a strong champion of the PFMRP as well as conducting a prudent fiscal policy. It, along with
the CAR, was acutely aware of the need to provide incentives to and build capacity of the civil
service. CDC and MOC had a strong interest in improving the environment for private investment
and facilitating trade. The area of land and natural resources was more diffusing with many potential
actors, at times at cross purposes. Further engagement on the PRGO series, in 2009/10, also suggests
a moderately satisfactory momentum. At the time of the pre-appraisal mission for PRGO 2, the Task
Team Leader prepared a set of one page assessments for each of the 10 Prior Actions (triggers) and
20 milestones. Each page stated what the action or the milestone was, how it would be measured,
what evidence would be needed for the Government and DPs to be satisfied that the action was
indeed taken and/or the milestone passed, and a brief comment as to the likelihood and timing of
achieving the Policy Action/milestone. These assessments suggested good progress--even beyond
what was envisaged under PRGO 1--implying that PRGO 1 was achieving satisfactory outcomes.
Of the ten Policy Actions that the one pagers assessed, two had been carried out by the time of the
mission (March 2008), six were well on the way, and two were proving challenging. On the
milestones side, six had been achieved, eleven were close to being achieved and three were lagging.

Objective 3. The process of preparing and implementing the PRGO series has had a significant
impact on further harmonization of DP policy positions. The success of aligning budgetary support
with the Government's cycle, however, has been elusive, not least because PRGO 2 has not yet been
taken to the Board almost two years after originally envisioned. The Government cannot build donor
budget support into its proposed budgetary expenditures, unless they are certain they will receive it.
The DPs on the other hand are supporting various ministries with TA and investment projects, with
much of that support benefiting NSDP processes. The fact that the PRGO monitoring system was
built on Government's pre-existing JMI's and existing sectoral TWGs was highly relevant, even
though the quality of monitoring was uneven across these groups (with the PFM TWG having the
most structured and regular monitoring process).

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The horizon of PRGO 1 was too short for the operation to have an identifiable impact, growth,
poverty, gender, or social development. The fact that rapid growth continued during the PRGO 1
implementation was overwhelmingly due to the underlying momentum. One could, of course,
speculate about the medium to longer run impact of the PRGO series, and that should be positive
since in all respects the ultimate aim was to foster broad-based growth (not least due to potential
improvements in agricultural productivity, including through smallholder agriculture and protection
of land rights) and to improve the volume and scope of service delivery.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Much of the operation has been focused on strengthening institutional capacity and its various
aspects have been discussed in Section 3.3 above, in particular the second pillar on PFM and CSR.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Risks that the outcomes achieved under PRGO 1 might be jeopardized at some point over the
next few years are high, despite the mitigation measures built into the operation. These risks can
be grouped into the following categories: (i) country risks; (ii) fiduciary risks; and (iii)
implementation risks.

Country Risks

The main country risk is economic: (i) given the narrow economic base of the country, Cambodia
is prone to exogenous shocks; (ii) rapid growth has generated some vulnerabilities, including in the
financial sector; and (iii) the global financial turmoil could exacerbates some of these vulnerabilities.
Risks include a sharp slowdown (or reversal) of capital inflows, a further degradation of terms of
trade (from oil or food prices, for instance), intensified competition in the garment sector, increasing
regional insecurity and global economic slowdown, ill effects of health-related problems such as
avian flu or SARS, and natural disasters. All these could cause a widening of the external financial
gap and disrupt macroeconomic stability as Cambodia depends heavily on exports. Macroeconomic
stability could also be put at risk by poor and non-transparent management of oil, gas, and mining
revenues, should they finally materialize. This risk is somewhat mitigated by the PRGO objectives to


                                                    29
raise revenues in the medium-term, the reform actions on fiscal transparency, and reforms aimed at
diversifying the economy.

There is also a risk that the World Bank and other `traditional' DPs could lose influence. The
flow of revenue from extractive industries in a few years' time could alter the rules dramatically.
This could mean that the role of the PRGO as a catalyst for reform would derive principally from TA
in the form of analytical and advisory services from the DPs.

Fiduciary Risks

With respect to fiduciary risks, corruption and weak PFM systems are a critical constraint.
They have a direct adverse impact on growth itself as well as on the implementation of the
Government's development strategy. The PRGO series was helping build a stronger PFM system and
progress has been good. But it is nowhere near complete and reversals are possible.

Implementation Risks

The first implementation risk relates to the difficulty in coordinating Government agencies. By
supporting a number of cross-cutting issues, implementing the program supported by the PRGO
requires a capacity for cooperation across agencies. This significant risk was apparent during the
implementation of PRGO 1 and can be partly mitigated by supporting MEF in its coordinating role.
Intensive field-based supervision can also help reduce this risk

The second implementation risk relates to a possible wavering commitment to reform. The
Government's ownership of the reform program is the key to its successful implementation. While
there is strong ownership in MEF, the commitment in some of the other agencies involved has been
more diffused in part because of the relative weight of the PRGO support program ­ and the
uncertain benefits for those ministries ­ in comparison to large TA programs under implementation
in these ministries.

Third, implementation could be stalled due to capacity constraints in individual ministries. This
has been largely mitigated through complementary TA programs, albeit with the risks highlighted in
the previous paragraph.

Finally, implementation of the reform program could fail to generate the expected impact. This
risk is particularly apparent for a complex sector like L&NRM, where progress in improving the
legal and regulatory framework can often be insufficient to impact outcomes on the ground. This
needs to be mitigated through broader efforts at monitoring sector developments.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                                          30
The PRGO program was designed well. As argued earlier, it was aligned well with the various
strategic documents of the Government and the Bank. It was by and large selective in the areas
chosen for support. It kept its focus fairly narrow, emphasizing the building of technical and
institutional capacities that would improve governance. This in turn would lead to better allocation of
a strengthened resource base, a better business environment, and sustainable improvements in the use
of land and other natural resources.

Most of the potential future triggers for second and third phase of the PRGO series were sensible (a
few actions for PRGO 2 were either insufficiently defined at the outset or were technically too
stretched targets). The likely problem areas were identified (and a couple of them came to pass,
resulting in repeated delays in the PRGO 2 operation), but they were and are important and it made
sense to include them, even at the risk of future delays. Although risks were high going in, and
remain high with respect to the likelihood that the satisfactory outcomes of PRGO 1 will stick in the
years to come, the PRGO series built into it various mechanisms that had the potential to mitigate
many of the risks involved.

Nevertheless, the number of challenging reforms that were covered under PRGO (including for
instance risk management in trade, transparency in extractive industry revenues, civil service reform,
state land management, protection of indigenous people's land rights) was very high for a new
instrument. The approach in some areas ­ such as the MBPI ­ was risky and, with hindsight, had
important limits (see above).

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was good. There was a mission to review the situation and look towards the preparation
of PRGO 2 in November of 2007. The pre-appraisal mission of March 2008 for PRGO 2 assessed
progress further and designed the "one pagers" (discussed earlier) that helped the Government and
DPs focus on what has been achieved and what remained to be done. The missions also provided a
useful paper trail for this review. A challenge for supervision, however, was that sector engagement
was still dominated by the supporting TA projects, weakening the role of the PRGO policy dialog.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government agencies engaged in the PRGO dialog include the various Ministries, or
departments within Ministries, involved in the three main reform areas supported by the
PRGO program: PSD, PFM/MBPI, and LMNR. The PSD policy agenda was carried out mostly
in a satisfactory fashion, in part because it was largely concentrated in two fairly self-contained

                                                  31
Ministries (MOC and CDC) and in part because the policy actions in facilitating trade and creating
an enabling environment for private investment have been tried in many countries and the
components of success were well known. Implementation picked up momentum over time and the
results became increasingly encouraging, particularly later in 2008 and 2009. The PFM reform
program, run by MEF, made good progress, with some weakness in improving the auditing functions.
The MBPI at first showed promise but it was a controversial program to implement in ministries
beyond MEF and was, in the end, stopped in January 2010 for a variety of reasons. The LMNR was
probably the area with the hardest challenges. Implementation involved handling potentially
conflicting situations, and had to be coordinated across several ministries. Solutions to the issues, not
least because they involved many stakeholders, were complicated and took time. There was also
uneven ownership of the reform program across the ministries involved in the LMNR area. On
balance, the Government performance is judged to have been moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The implementing agency was the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The MEF was the
"champion" of the PRGO program. It was committed to piloting a budget support operation and
coordinating the agreed policy agenda that was spread across a half a dozen other Ministries. It was a
challenging task, particularly since it was the first operation of its kind in Cambodia. It also
coordinated its work with the four co-financing DPs of PRGO 1 as well as with other DPs,
particularly those involved in TA projects relevant to the implementation of the PRGO series. In
addition, the MEF was in charge of two other important components of the policy agenda: ensuring a
continued enabling macro-economic environment and implementing the PFM reform program. It
carried both of these tasks out ably. The monitoring aspect of the two areas was strong. The MEF
piloted the MBPI, the outcome of which was not satisfactory, but for reasons beyond MEF's control.
Its performance was therefore satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Guidelines for ICR specify that in cases where one of the components is moderately satisfactory
(Government Performance) while the other is satisfactory (MEF Performance), the overall rating has
to be moderately satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Ownership. One of the principles of effective aid is ownership of an operation on the part of the
Government. The impression in the case of PRGO 1 was that it was strong in the MEF, but not as
clear elsewhere. However, in every case, the government officials interviewed were aware of the TA
projects in their ministry. The TA part is not surprising since it brings resources to the ministry in
question. But so does the budget. However, it is likely that the benefits of the TA project are more
obvious, whereas those from potential budget increases are more remote. It is not clear that this can
be remedied in the short run. Over time, however, it might help if the designers were to build a
"budget education" component into budget support operations and its monitoring processes (as has

                                                   32
been done during PRGO 2 discussions to finance the implementation of activities supporting
indigenous community registration), in order to help line ministries learn how to bid more effectively
for budget resources for their ministries in each annual cycle.

Capacity Constraints. Capacity constraints make it imperative to run complementary TA projects
alongside budget support operations. In the PSD area, for instance, technical support to implement
the risk management strategy was critical given that the concept of risk management was new.
Beyond technical capacity, support to institutional capacity turned out to be critical as well. Slow
progress in some areas ­ such as the protection of indigenous people's land rights ­ can be partly
accounted for by the gaps in inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms. The PRGO dialogue in
TWGs and other fora proved a good opportunity to make progress in some of these areas.

Scope of the PRGO program. Despite the selectivity of reform areas to be supported when the
PRGO series were being designed, the scope may in the end have still been too broad for a first
budget support operation in Cambodia. The MBPI scheme, for example, could have been left out and
the civil service reform pursued through other channels. Other areas where vested interests were
likely to be strong and/or were process-intensive might also have been put on a less ambitious
schedule.

Monitoring. While the quality of monitoring is good in the PFM area, the other sectors have not
reached the same level. Monitoring remains weak in general, and is in particular not integrated across
the various sub-themes of each sector. The situation is improving as various sectors develop Sector-
Wide Approaches (as in PFM). A budget-support instrument could be used even more strategically as
a catalyst for faster improvement in reform monitoring. This would also require a further investment
in monitoring higher-level outcomes. This would mitigate the risk that a narrative of progress
emerges from reform monitoring while the broader trajectory is more ambiguous, for instance
reflecting that reforms focus on the legal and regulatory framework, with implementation lagging
behind.

One Pagers. These were discussed in Section 3.3 above. At the time of the pre-appraisal mission for
PRGO 2, the Task Team Leader prepared a set of one page assessments for each of the 10 Prior
Actions (triggers) and 20 milestones. Each note stated what the action or the milestone was, how it
would be measured, what evidence would be needed for the government and the DPs to be satisfied
that the action was indeed taken and/or the milestone passed, and a brief comment as to the
likelihood and timing of achieving the Prior Action/milestone. It is an interesting tool both from the
point of view of monitoring and for fostering dialogue. It could sharpen the focus in discussions by
keeping everyone on the same page.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Government has reviewed a draft implementation complementation report and most of the
comments have been incorporated. The Government's view is that progress in all public financial
management outcomes was satisfactory, as was progress on state land management. This would lead
to an overall rating of satisfactory. This position is grounded on the fact that all prior actions were
met and momentum was apparent at the time of approving PRGO 1 and until its closing in early 2008.

While recognizing the challenges of the longer-term development trajectory, the Government
considers this as evidence that outcomes should be rated satisfactorily.

While Bank staff agree with the Government's view that prior actions were met, Bank staff took a
different approach in the ICR, factoring in developments beyond the PRGO 1 approval, including
areas where the reform program has accelerated, slowed down, or being reversed. The evaluation
reviews progress in performance indicators beyond the closing of the project because the PRGO 1
was designed in the context of a multi-operation program.

(b) Cofinanciers

The draft ICR has been discussed with the three development agencies partnering with the World
Bank to finance the PRGO.
