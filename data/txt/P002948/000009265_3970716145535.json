Agricultural\n            Rehabilitation Project (SWRARP) in Uganda. The\n            project's objectives were toincrease food production,\n            incomes, and living standards of small farmers in the\n            region. The projectoriginally included the following\n            components: (i) launching of an adaptive research program\n            andreviving extension services; (ii) procurement and\n            wholesale distribution of agricultural inputs; (iii)\n            rehabilitation of 2,000 km of rural access roads; (iv)\n            project management; and (v) monitoring and evaluation.\n            Emphasis was given to rural road rehabilitation and input\n            supply components, which together represented about 80\n            percent of total project costs. Some key lessons learned are\n            as follows: The project recorded impressive achievements in\n            activities such as the road spotimprovement program; the\n            pilot credit scheme; Continuity of Bank staff for task\n            management, particularly in the second half ofthe project,\n            and close liaison with and involvement of Resident Mission\n            staff insupervision, as part of a team, contributed to\n            achieving project objectives. More attention needs to be\n            devoted to devising satisfactory arrangements for\n            procurement and making contingency plans at appraisal. It is\n            recognized that the addition of the Small Valley Dams\n            component towards theend of the project was based on a\n            decision at the highest level of Government.Generally,\n            however, when borrowers and lenders agree to add a sizeable\n            component towards the end of the project, the Bank should\n            make a full assessmentof the capacity of project management\n            and of potential contractors to undertakethe additional\n            works.In a project such as SWRARP, Technical Assistance (TA)\n            was required to play a crucial role. In order to limit the\n            risks of excessive turnover of key TA staff, such as the\n            financial controller, every effort should be made by\n            Government to choosesuitable candidates for key technical\n            assistance posts.The adaptive research program gave priority\n            to the screening of exotic, newly introduced crop varieties.\n            In addition to screening exotic crop varieties,consideration\n            should be given to local varieties, to their improvement\n            throughproper seed production, and to the possibility for\n            their incorporation in local breeding programs.To yield\n            significant impact, the release of superior crop varieties\n            should be accompanied by sustainable seed production\n            systems, especially simple, localfarmer-based seed\n            production, as successfully experienced by the project for potatoes."}, "docdt": "1997-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
