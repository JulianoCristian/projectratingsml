To that end, the project\n            includes:  (a) adaptive research and extension; (b)\n            agricultural input supply; (c) rural access roads; and (d)\n            management, monitoring and evaluation.  As a result, the\n            project will increase production of food by smallholders,\n            resulting in increased incomes and nutrition. Reductions in\n            transport costs from improvements in rural access roads will\n            reduce the costs of inputs and consumption goods in the\n            area, and increase producer prices through improved access\n            and competition in the food market."}, "docdt": "1987-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
