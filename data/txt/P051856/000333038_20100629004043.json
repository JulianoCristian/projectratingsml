Lessons learned\n            include: it is vital to ensure that the project\n            implementation unit (PIU) be provided with adequate budget\n            and resources to carry out its responsibilities effectively.\n            The PIU was anchored in the Beijing National Accounting\n            Institute (BNAI). At the project outset, this made sense as\n            the PIU was responsible for financial management reporting,\n            procurement and monitoring only for the one training\n            institute and consolidating the information from the\n            accounting reform component. However, as the project\n            progressed and disbursements increased, two new NAIs were\n            established, the procurement and reporting responsibilities\n            increased significantly as a result. It is essential to have\n            the project structure flexible enough to adapt to changes in\n            the environment. In 2006, Ministry of Finance (MOF) issued\n            Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBE). The\n            new accounting and auditing principles required several\n            courses to be adjusted accordingly. The importance of\n            project ownership and technical knowledge of the accounting\n            profession should not be underestimated. At the beginning of\n            the project, the most senior government counterparts had\n            fairly limited knowledge of the international accounting\n            profession. However, when leadership changed, and the\n            government put in place individuals with a more broad vision\n            of accounting, the project impact accelerated dramatically.\n            Project staff needs to be rewarded professionally for\n            responsibilities under the project. Throughout the project\n            the staff of the NAIs was directly involved in course\n            development and procurement of the related consulting\n            services. At times these activities proved complex and time\n            consuming and staff were often not rewarded for additional work."}, "docdt": "2010-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
