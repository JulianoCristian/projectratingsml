The project comprises\n            two related components. The component supports the\n            continuing professional education of China's certified\n            public accountants, and other finance managers and\n            professionals, to familiarize them, on a large scale, with\n            new accounting, auditing, and business administration\n            principles and practices that are generally accepted in\n            market economics. The project helps establish a large\n            residential continuing education facility in Beijing, which\n            offers a wide selection of short courses on specific\n            accounting and business topics and issues. Bank assistance\n            focuses on providing educational and training equipment and\n            materials, designing the curricula, financing of high level\n            trainers who can help build local training capacity, and\n            providing overseas training for trainers. The second\n            component continues support for the government's\n            ongoing effort to develop and promulgate accounting\n            standards that conform to internationally accepted\n            accounting standards. Bank assistance comprises issuing and\n            disseminating standards, developing and publishing new\n            accounting standards and their dissemination to high-level\n            officials, monitoring the application of standards and\n            developing an on-line best practices service for users, and\n            developing a study tour and training program with supporting\n            equipment and training materials."}, "docdt": "1999-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
