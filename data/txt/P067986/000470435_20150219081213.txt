                                      In 2001, El Salvador was rocked by two
                                      earthquakes that killed 1,260 people and
destroyed eight hospitals. Furthermore, 113 of the country’s 361 health care facilities       Additional information
were destroyed or seriously damaged. Altogether, 55 percent of the Ministry of
Health’s (MOH) supply of health care services was affected.                                       Project document

Due to the damages caused by the earthquakes, the country faced serious challenges                Interview with Rafael Cortez, World Bank task
in terms of health care efficiency and coverage, mainly for poor households. Only 66              manager  s
percent of Salvadorans had access to health care services, meaning that 2 million                 World Bank health sector efforts in Latin
lacked or had limited access to these services. This situation, which still persists              America

today, mainly affects the population from rural areas or marginalized urban areas.

Progress in Hospital Reconstruction


                                               Although one can not dismiss the backwardness in relation to the original timetable for
                                               implementation, since the first half of 2005 the project has achieved a major breakthrough in
                                               tenders and the start of construction of the works in the hospital network. To date, there have
                                               been more than 90 activities and technical analysis-flat-architectural designs needed to begin the
                                               bidding process and start the rebuilding of hospitals. As reflected elCuadro not. 1, four hospitals
                                               are in full execution of construction contracts (San Vicente, Zacatecoluca, Usulután, and San
                                               Miguel), and hospitals de San Rafael and Cojutepeque have been completed, inaugurated and
                                               put into operation.

                                          As for the Maternity Hospital, the results of the study on "Review and update the study of
                                          structural repairs, lifelines and terms of reference for the National Maternity Hospital" were
San Rafael Hospital. World Bank mission   presented during the month of June 2008. According to the recommendations emanating from
overseeing construction sites.
                                          this study were defined and started the bidding process and are now on sale documents for
national or international companies interested in participating in that process.

Progress in Health Care and Nutrition Service Coverage
 
In relation to extending the coverage of health services, project goals are met more quickly than initially planned. Currently serves
1,200,000 people in 136 municipalities in the country surpassing the target set initially for the project.

                                                                     Chart 1

Progress on the institutional strengthening of the MSPAS

Under this component has been invested in critical issues related to: (i) The management of human resources and training plan of the
MSPAS, (ii) The development of a national plan of hospital waste and environmental sanitation, (iii) The development of a communications
strategy and promoting health, (iv) Improving the information systems of health MSPAS and (v) The emphasis on public health priorities
related to dengue and HIV / AIDS and other significant damage. Today, in order to update and standardize criteria in the rules of
institutional MSPAS, has already made the training of medical staff, nurses and ministry officials. Finally, it has developed the proposal for
the creation of the Directorate of Extension of coverage to ensure continuity and sustainability of the expansion of health and nutrition
services in the long term.
Advances in the monitoring and evaluation component

This component has financed the technical and administrative staff of the Project Coordination Unit (RHESSA) as well as their equipment
and office expenses. Additionally, under this component has created a unique system of financial administration for all components of the
project, and a monthly statistical report of activities for the integration of information from NGOs and health units with different
instruments. At the same time, is the impact assessment program linked to the Solidarity Network. This component has started in 2007, an
analysis of the impact of the two modalities used in the Component II for the extension of health services: the institutional strengthening of
the MSPAS and the hiring of non-governmental organizations, survey completed to date.

FAQ

When is expected the works of the hospitals?
At the end of the year 2007 was completed and handed over the hospital in Cojutepeque and for the end of he year 2008se includes
works in the San Rafael hospital (except in one building that would be delivered in the first months of 2009) and San Vicente ( presents a
physical progress of 65%). In 2009 envisaged that the project's Hospital of San Miguel, Zacatecoluca, Usulután, along with the Maternity
Hospital

In the original design of the project included the reconstruction of the Maternity Hospital in the city of San Salvador. Why was
the doubt about its construction?

When preparing the project was deemed to build seven hospitals, including maternity. The budget estimated at that time used the
reference prices of similar buildings in the years 2000 and 2001. At present, and after having conducted a competitive bidding process for
the first 5 hospitals (see table no.1), the total construction costs of the same has been higher than what was originally estimated as a
result of the cumulative effect of inflation in recent years.

Some months ago there was talk of a feasibility study for the Maternity Hospital. Especially it was stated that the results of that
dictate the way forward for construction of the hospital.

Actually were conducted feasibility studies of the technique Maternity Hospital and the results showed that there should be a
rehabilitation, that is, strengthening and improving all the vital services of the hospital so that it is functional, ie, that it can operate as well
as a new hospital. Technical considerations are what have defined the way forward. It is worth mentioning that this is something different
from a building, as the rehabilitation is a gradual process of reconstruction by considering the current work being played and technical
equipment and human.

Why were delays in the approval of the bidding process for Parenting?

All processes that have led to this tender document had been made on the basis of many studies of pre investment. Usually a bidding
process is a lengthy process, but the mother has not been extensive in relation to other hospitals.

First, a tender document is a report where it should be very clear specifications of what they want to do, so that the bidders have very
clear what is not built and built, as well as the conditions under which will be governed. What has happened here is that there was no
clear process as such, ie the tender initially involves items such as the pre qualification (for a review of the information before having a
final shortlist of bidders, lasts approximately) and post qualification (where there are clear criteria for selection on the basis of information
received).

The unit executing the project requested the World Bank the exception of the pre-qualification process for technical reasons because this
is not a complex, if no intermediate complex. As a result of this request and the approval of the Bank, we will have is an international
invitation in three or four capital cities of countries throughout the Latin American region, which are usually large corporations that are
associated with local companies to apply and that guarantees us increased competitiveness.

Took a while to be clear on the process, but the World Bank and the Ministry of Health have reached a positive agreement which will have
a more finished work.
