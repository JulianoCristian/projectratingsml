hospital operations, and improve the provision of health\n            assistance, specifically to vulnerable groups in the\n            country's earthquake-damaged areas, in particular the\n            underserved populations of the poverty-stricken Northern\n            Region. The components will support: 1) an emergency\n            reconstruction of the Ministry of Health (MOH) hospital\n            network in the earthquake affected areas, through a phased\n            construction that will meet current seismic structural\n            codes. Equipment supply will include computerization,\n            medical waste disposal equipment, and medical equipment.\n            Technical assistance (TA) will be financed to cover\n            environmental impact studies, topographical analyses, and\n            engineering drawings; 2) the extension of essential health\n            and nutrition services to damaged, and poor areas, by\n            forming partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and\n            local government agencies, to strengthen MOH capacity,\n            towards an integrated service delivery of health and\n            nutrition services. Participatory outreach programs with\n            communities will be established, including the development\n            of management reforms in those reconstructed hospitals, to\n            establish accountability systems, and health coverage in\n            rural areas; 3) strengthening of MOH's capacity to\n            perform public health programs, with improved quality and\n            disease surveillance, regulation and performance-based\n            monitoring; and, 4) project management, including the\n            project's overall impact evaluation, and financial audits."}, "docdt": "2001-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
