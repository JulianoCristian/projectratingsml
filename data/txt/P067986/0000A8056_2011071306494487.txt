                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project seeks to restore hospital operations and minimize losses in health status to vulnerable populations living in the country's earthquake-
                         damaged Central and Para-Central Regions and to improve the health status of underserved populations elsewhere, with special emphasis on the poverty-
                         stricken Northern Region. This will be achieved by: (i) rebuilding and improving health sector infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the earthquakes; (ii)
                         extending the coverage of essential health and nutrition services through a community-based outreach approach; and (iii) strengthening the institutional
                         capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop and implement policies and priority programs for the health sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last project extension, granted by Bank Management in November 2010, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been satisfactorily implementing the agreed action plan
                         (which was a condition for the extension). To date, five of the seven original hospital works have been completed and are fully functioning. A sixth hospital, Zacatecoluca Hospital will
                         be completed by June 30, 2011. Construction of the seventh hospital (Maternity hospital) was eliminated from the Annual Operational Plan in October 2009 as per the Government#s
                         request. The project financed the design for this hospital which will be constructed with financing from other external funds. Activities under Components 2 and 3 were completed by
                         February 2009, with health care coverage targets exceeded by 82% under Component 2 and substantial progress was made in Component 3 in vaccination coverage and dengue at
                         the national level. Data from November 2010 indicates that targets for prenatal coverage and child health which had not been achieved by the last ISR have now been achieved. As
                         of June 20, 2011, US$142.6 million was disbursed (100% of the total loan). On June 6, 2011, the Ministry of Finance of El Salvador requested a reallocation of proceeds of eligible
                         expenditure among different categories of the Loan. The reallocation was executed to obtain the necessary funds to liquidate all commitments related to Project implementation.
