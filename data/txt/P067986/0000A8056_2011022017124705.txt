                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project seeks to restore hospital operations and minimize losses in health status to vulnerable populations living in the country's earthquake-
                         damaged Central and Para-Central Regions and to improve the health status of underserved populations elsewhere, with special emphasis on the poverty-
                         stricken Northern Region. This will be achieved by: (i) rebuilding and improving health sector infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the earthquakes; (ii)
                         extending the coverage of essential health and nutrition services through a community-based outreach approach; and (iii) strengthening the institutional
                         capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop and implement policies and priority programs for the health sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         On November 2010, the GoES requested an additional and last extension of the project closing date that was granted by the Bank Management. The GOES action plan, a condition
                         for the extension, was satisfactory to the Bank, and included the necessary actions to ensure the completion of four remaining hospitals. Up to date it is being executed as planned.
                         As of February 7, 2011, four of the seven original hospital works have been completed and are fully functioning, and two remain under construction. Progress on the two remaining
                         hospitals is as follows: Zacatecoluca (80% completed) and Usulutan (83% completed). It is expected that the two hospitals be completed and fully functioning by mid April 2011.
                         Construction of the seventh hospital (Maternity hospital) was eliminated from the POA in October 2009 as per the GOES request. This hospital is currently under construction with
                         financing from other external funds
                         Activities under Components 2 and 3 were concluded and fully disbursed by October 2009. The activities of project component 2 were successfully completed. Implementation
                         exceeded the targets on health care coverage by 82%. Although substantial progress was reached in Component 3, key results such as vaccination coverage, prenatal coverage,
                         child health, and dengue were not achieved.
                         As of October 28, 2010, US$138.3 million was disbursed from the loan account (equivalent to 97% of the loan) and US$4.3 million committed but undisbursed.
                         By January 2011, the disbursed loan was US$141.7 million (99% of the total loan). Given the new closing date of June 30, 2011, the project objectives continue to be achievable.
                         The implementation of the action plan is in good speed.
