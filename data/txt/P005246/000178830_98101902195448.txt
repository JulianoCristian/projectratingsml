INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO JORDAN
FOR THE SECOND AMMAN WATER SUPPLY
AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to Jordan for the equivalent of US$8.7 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance the second Amman water supply and sewerage project,
and studies for the development of Aqaba. US$8.33 million of the
proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Amman Municipal Area
Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) for a term of 29 years, including
4 years of grace, with interest at 6 percent per annum. $370,000 of
the credit would be used by the Government for the Aqaba studies.
PART I -    THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Jordan is dealt with in paragraphs 2-10
of the President's Report of the same date on a proposed development
credit to Jordan for the Hussein Thermal Power project (Report No. 95a-JO).
A Country Data sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP RELATIONS WITH JORDAN
3.        The proposed credit would be IDA's eighth operation in
Jordan, and the second for water supply in Amman, bringing the total
of IDA funds committed to US$ 40.3 million equivalent. For a review
of Bank Group lending in Jordan, reference is made to paragraphs 11-13
of the President's Report of the same date on the proposed Hussein Thermal
Power Project. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as
of March 31, 1.973, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
4°         Jordan has no sizable sources of surface water.   There are
only a few suitable dam sites for storage of surface water, one of these
being Wadi Zarqa where a dam is under construction. The most important
aquifer is the Amman-Wadi Sir system, which outcrops extensively in the
central part of Jordan; wells served by this aquifer are the main source
of Amman's water supply. Another important aquifer system, in northern
Jordan, has been identified recently and is under development; flowing
artesian water has also been discovered in limestone strata near Amman.



- 2 -
5.        Chronic water shortages have adversely affected living
conditions in the country's main urban centers and prevented the improve-
ment of sanitation. The present per capita consumption of water is very
low: about 35 liters per capita daily in the main towns and 12 liters
per capita in the smaller towns and refugee camps. During peak demand
in the summer months the municipalities often resort to rationing w-ter
and hauling water by truck.
6.        Only three cities -- Amman, Aqaba and Salt -- have sewerage
systems and sewage treatment facilities. Because of the small number
of premises connected to the system in Amman, it serves only a small
percentage of the city's population. Throughout the country, including
the main urban centers, waste disposal is unhygienic and sanitation
standards are unsatisfactory.
7.        Because of the limited sources of surface water, the country's
urban and industrial development depends on groundwater supplies. The
Government is taking steps to improve and expand these supplies and also
to meet the most urgent sewerage requirements. The feasibility of water
supply projects in other urban centers and in about 20 large villages
is under study by the Government. Consideration is also being given
to an integrated development of the country's scarce water resources.
The Ministry of Rural and Municipal Affairs, which gives the municipalities
technical advice on water supply and sewerage, has proposed new sewerage
systems for Zarqa, Irbid and Jerash and improvement of Salt's sewerage
system.
8.        The Natural Resources Authority (NRA) is the Government agency
responsible for constructing water supply schemes for all municipalities
except Amman. After the facilities are commissioned, NRA turns them
over to the respective municipalities, which are responsible for operating
them. NRA also provides bulk water suoplies for four towns and some 150
villages in the northern and central parts of the country, and operates
and maintains four small water supply systems in southern Jordan. The
other smaller towns have their own water supplies.
9.        The Government fully recognizes the importance of the sector.
In order to improve its organization the Government is considering setting
up a National Water and Sewerage Board (NWSB) and currently has under
review a preliminary draft of the enabling legislation. However, even
after creation of NWSB, the newly created Amman Municipal Area Water and
Sewerage Authority (AWSA), replacing the Amman Municipal Water Department,
will continue to be responsible for water supply, sewerage, and storm-
water drainage in Amman Municipality.

PART IV -   THE PROJECT
10.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in
the report entitled "Appraisal of the Amman Water Supply and Sewerage
Project - II" (71a-JO), dated May 4, 1973, which is being distributed
separately.  A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
Three maps showing existing and proposed water supply and sewerage
schemes are also attached.
A. Water Supply and Sewerage Component
11.       In 1961, the Association made a $1.5 million Credit to
Jordan to help finance a water supply project. This Amman project
included new boreholes, two pumping stations, two service reservoirs
and about 40 km of trunk mains and distribution network. Construction
of the project was completed in 1968, except for one pumping station,
which was resited and completed in 1972. One of the major objectives,
i.e. to develop the Amman Municipal Water Department into an efficient
organization, was not fully achieved, particularly as regards accounting
systems and financial performance. Yet it should be noted that the
first water supply operation has a number of achievements to its credit;
they include meeting the essential water needs of Amman after a sudden
increase of 25 percent in the city's population in 1967 and maintaining
water supply during the emergencies of the past five years. The Water
Department will now be replaced by AWSA. The proposed project was
identified by IDA in April 1971. The Municipality of Amman engaged as
consultants Vattenbyggnadsbyran (VBB) of Stockholm, who prepared a
master plan and feasibility studies. The project was appraised in
September/October 1972. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from
April 4-13, 1973. The Jordan delegation was headed by H.E. Ahmed Fawzi,
Manager Designate, Mr. Hisham Hashem, Legal Adviser, and Mr. Hisham
Zagha from the National Planning Council.
Present Situation of Amman
12.       Modern Aiunan dates back to 1878 when Circassian refugees
settled on the ancient site of Roman Philadelphia. When the city was
selected as the capital of the newly formed state of Transjordan in 1921,
it had a population of only 5,000, which increased rapidly to 10,000 in
1930 and 60,000 in 1945.  The political events of 1948 and 1967 are the
main factors in Amman's recent phenomenal growth to a present population
of over 500,000, or nearly 1/3 of the East Bank's total population.
Based on a growth rate of 5 percent per year, declining to 3 percent
toward the end of the century, the resident population of Amman is
projected at 850,000 in 1982, and at 1.7 million by 2002. The proposed
project has been designed accordingly.



- 4 -
13.       Amman obtains its water from boreholes varying in depth from
50 to 450 meters and from a few springs. The water is normally of good
chemical quality, but recent bacteriological analyses have indicated
possible contamination from the infiltration of sewage from cesspools,
etc. The distribution networks is divided into four pressure zones;
however, the physical separation of the zones is only partial. Several
emergency arrangements for pumping were made in 1970 to supply water to
the high-pressure zones and to areas outside the city. There are about
34,000 water service connections, all of them metered. The meters are
owned and maintained-by the consumers. Residents of the refugee areas
generally obtain their water from public standpipes, although some are
provided with individual meters.
14.       In the past 11 years water losses have generally exceeded 40
percent and rose to an estimated 64 percent in 1972. These high water
losses are attributable to a number of unresolved problems: leakages in
the water distribution network, illegal connections, inaccurate metering,
overflowring reservoirs, and inefficient bil-Ling and collection procedures.
But the basic cause has been poor operating management, which in turn is
due to the shortage of trained staff, inadequate supervision, and un-
reliable water supply.
15.       Due in part to the fast increase in Amman's population in recent
years caused by the rapid and unpredictable immigration to the city, and
in part to the high water losses, the existing water supply facilities
are not adequate to cope with present demand. Since 1968 Amman has been
experiencing such acute water shortages that water is supplied to the
various sections of the city on a rotating basis; furthermore, some of
the newly built-up areas are served only by inadequate temporary arrange-
ments. This situation tends to encourage illicit measures to ensure
individual supplies.
16.       A first-stage sewerage project, comprising construction of a
sewage treatment plant, main sanitary sewers and storm-water sewers, was
completed in 1969. Sewer laterals and house connections, covering the
central part and three main hills (Jabels) of the city, are under construc-
tion. Although the treatment plant and main sewer network were designed
to serve a population of about 300,000, only some 1,500 premises are
connected to the network, and cesspools are still the predominant method
of sewage disposal in Amman. Few health or other benefits have been
realized thus far from the large investment (more than JD 2.0 million)
in the sewerage system.  Additional investment of about JD 1.0 million is
needed so that more sewer laterals and house connections can be constructed
and greater use made of the existing facilities. Many of the system's
present problems stem from inadequate planning and the lack of an effective
organization to stimulate corrective action,



Project Description
17.       The proposed water supply and sewerage component of the
project is part of a master plan for Amman and would meet the
city's requirements until 1982. Its objectives are to (a) extend
piped water supply and sewerage services to all parts of the project
area; (b) reduce the very high percentage of water loss; (c)
develop AWSA as a viable entity responsible for Amman's water supply
and sewerage systems. The project includes the construction of
pumping stations, trunk mains, a reservoir, general system improvements,
and water distribution extensions and replacements. Unplanned
emergency works will be rationalized; they were undertaken in 1970
to overcome a serious water shortage resulting from the movement of
over 100,000 refugees into the city in mid-1967. The project also
provides for new sewer laterals and service connections to make better
use of the existing sewerage facilities. As part of the project,
hydrological equipment will be installed to collect storm-water data,
and AWSA staff will be given training in administration, operations,
maintenance and leak detection and repair.
18.       The problem of water loss needs to be solved as soon as
possible, and therefore, agreement has been reached that by January 1,
1974, AWSA will (a) employ a leak detection specialist to undertake
a leakage survey; (b) establish a leak detection and repair section;
(c) undertake a house-to-house survey to detect illegal connections
and to update records; and (d) submit to IDA proposals for reorganizing
the billing and collection system to establish proper internal control
and implement a mutually agreed system.
Project Cost and Financing
19.       Out of AWSA's total capital requirements of about $14.25 million,
the total estimated cost of the proposed water supply and sewerage project
is about $11.55 million, including a foreign exchange component of $7.38
million. In view of the country's and the city's difficult budgetary
situation, it is proposed that the Association finance about 75 percent
of total project costs, including a small portion (US$0.95 million) of
local currency costs.  The Government would relend US$tf31?-llion of
the proceeds of the credit to AWSA for repayment in 29 years, including     v P
a four year period of grace, at 6 percent per annum interest.   In ad-
dition, the Government would make a US$3.36 million loan to AWSA on the
same terms as the onlending of the IDA credit. The remainder of the total
capital requirements (US$2.56 million) would be provided by AWSA through
internal cash generation.

Beneficiary: Amman Municipal Area Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA)
20.      Recognizing the need to reorganize the water supply and sewerage
operations in Amman, the Government and the Municipality, in consultation
with IDA, engaged management consultants in 1971 to examine the problems
and propose solutions. The consultants recommended the establishment of
AWSA and prepared the draft legislation, an organizational structure and
staffing plan. Law No. 19 of 1973 establishing AWSA has been enacted.
21.      AWSA is an autonomous local authority and has acquired the assets
and liabilities of both the Water and Sewerage Departments of Amman Munici-
pality. Control of AWSA is vested in a seven-member Board of Directors,
including the Lord Mayor of Amman as chairman, as well as members from the
Amman Municipal Council, the National Planning Council, the Natural Resources
Authority, and the private sector. The Lord Mayor is responsible to the
Prime Minister for the activities of the Board. The Municipal staff previously
assigned to the water supply and sewerage department have been transferred
to AWSA.
22.      The UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA), under its
technical assistance program, has agreed to provide AWSA with four
advisors to assist management, and the Advisors to the General and Fina.-
cial Managers are already in Amman, During construction of the first
water supply project (Credit 18-JO) similar assistance was not used very
effectively, but we are confident that AWSA will make better use of it.
Moreover, the Government has agreed that management and accounting
consultants, acceptable to IDA, will be engaged if the ODA assistance is
terminated before a satisfactory management and accounting system has
been set up. A provision of US$31,000 for staff training in modern
methods of accounting and budgetary control has been included in the
project.
23.      The establishment of AWSA as an autonomous institution,
appointment of experienced staff including a competent General Man-
ager in consultation with IDA, and improvement of administrative pro-
cedures are expected to remedy many of the managerial shortcomings



-7-
of the old administration3 and should result in satisfactory imple-
mentation of the project and efficient operation and maintenance of
the expanded water supply and sewerage systems.
ph.       The financial performance of the former Water Department has not been
satisfactory. In the period 1967-71 operating costs including depreciation
increased by about 77 percent but revenues increased by only 38 percent, and
in 1972, despite an estimated increase of 33 percent in production, sales
did not rise by more than 21 percent. Consequently, the earnings of the
Water Department and its rate of return on total assets have been marginal
in recent years, in the range of 1.4-2.6 percent.
25.        The water rate of 65 fils/m3, in effect for 12 years, has not been
adequate to meet depreciation and operating costs and provide a reasonable
contribution toward expansion of the water facilities. In consultation
with IDA, the rate was increased as of January 1973 to 75 fils/m3. This
rate (US$0.90/1,000 gal), together with the minimum quarterly charge of
780 fils, bears very heavily on the poorer members of the community.
Agreement has therefore been reached that AWSA will complete a study of the
water tariff structure before June 30, 1974, to assess its suitability
under prevailing socio-economic conditions. The findings would be submitted
to IDA for comments, and mutually agreed recommendations would be implemented.
26.        Customers connected to the sewerage system pay a user charge on
water consumption of 30 fils/m3 (increased from 20 fils in October 1972),
a one-time fee of 25 percent of net rental value of premises, and a connec-
tion fee based on the type of building to be connected. In addition, a law
enacted in 1964 required payment of a sewerage tax at 3 percent of annual
rental value of all premises for five years (1965-1969). The law also
provided for the tax to continue for fifteen more years on premises connected
to the sewer system. In October 1972 an amendment to this law raised this
tax to 4 percent and made it applicable to all householders whether or not
their premises are connected. The sewerage tax is collected by the Ministry
of Finance, which transfers to the Municipality its share after retaining
a 10 percent collection charge.



-8-
27.       All investments in both sanitary sewerage and storm-drainage
have been financed by loans or by the city's general funds. Recurring
costs have been met from the Municipality's general revenues, which
include the sewerage tax and other collections for sanitary sewerage;
no separate fees are charged for storm-water drainage. At the end of
1971 the long-term debt of the Water Department amounted to JD 1.2 million.
In 1966-67 the Government made interest free loans of JD 2.5 million for
construction of sewers and storm-drainage works; these loans will be con-
verted into equity.
Procurement
28,       All equipment supply and civil works contracts, except minor
contracts for well drilling and scattered sewer laterals to complete the
ongoing program (amounting to about JD 100,000), would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's
guidelines.
29.       The equipment and materials to be used in the project are
not produced in Jordan, except for sewer pipes and some other items, for
which the usual margin of preference of 15 percent or custom duties, which-
ever is the lower, will be given. There are no government restrictions on
importing goods, and AWSA will be exempted from all custom duties and taxes. The
construction contracts would be combined as far as practicable but bids
will also be invited for components of the packages. This should enable
local contractors to compete, as well as encourage bids from foreign
contractors.
Disbursements
30.       These will be made as follows:  (i) Civil Works:  60 percent Of the
cost of construction contracts; (ii) Equipment and Materials: 100 percent of the
CIF or ex-factory cost of goods procured by ICB; (iii) Consulting services:
100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consulting services for
engineering, studies and training. Retroactive financing not exceeding
US$250,000 is proposed for consulting services incurred in connection with
preparing the Armian Water and Sewerage works.
Ecology
31.       The Amman Seil, the principal stream flowing through Amman, receives
most of the city's liquid wastes. During the dry summer months the stream is
grossly polluted and becomes a source of contamination to several water supply
wells on its banks. As almost every household in the congested sections of the
city has a cesspool or septic tank, the environment is degraded by overflowing
cesspools or seepage of sewage effluent into backyards and onto roads. The
ongoing sewerage scheme, financed by the Government, is designed to improve the
condition of the Amman Seil, enhance the quality of the environment, and remove
the danger to the city's water supplies. However, it has not yet had any impact
because of poor planning and the slow rate of making sewerage service connections.
With the completion of the proposed project, however, sanitary conditions in the
city and the quality of the sewerage effluent would be improved and associated
ecological and health benefits realized. Also, the danger of eventual contamina-
tion of the Amman-Wadi Sir aquifer would be eliminated.

B. Aqaba Development Studies
32.         The Aqaba development studies component would provide
consulting services:
(a) to review existing studies, surveys, plans, etc.
for basic infrastructure development for the town
of Aqaba and for the surrounding region, taking
into account the likely development of industry,
including a proposed free industrial and commercial
zone, transport and tolurism in the area; and to
propose recommendations for the development of roads,
water, sewerage, and electric power; and
(b) to elaborate on the existing Aqaba Tourism Development
Plan by (i) reintegrating into said plan some essential
works including recreational facilities, (ii) adding a
hotel training center, and (iii) undertaking new studies
to revise, up-date and complement the existing plan and
studies.
33.         The National Planning Council would be responsible for the
execution of the studies in close collaboration with the Ministries of
Interior, Tourism, and Industry. The studies would cost about $450,000
including a foreign exchange component of $370,000 which would be financed
by IDA. Disbursements would be made on the basis of 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost for consulting services.
C. Economic Justification
34.         Economic analysis shows the project to be well justified.   The
measurable benefits of the water supply component will come from the supply
of additional water, which will provide an economic rate of return of at
least 10.1 percent. An economic rate of return of 7.6 percent would be
achieved even if the benefits decreased by 25 percent. It was not possible
to calculate a meaningful economic rate of return for sewerage as the
major benefits in public health are difficult to quantify. The sewerage
component is the least-cost solution for providing adequate waste-disposal
facilities in Amman at discount rates of up to 23.7 percent.
35.        The investment plans for Aqaba are at present fragmented and
uncoordinated. By establishing a comprehensive plan, the studies wouid
ensure optimum use of the resources allocated for Aqaba, and protect
the unique ecology of the area during the forthcoming period of rapid
development.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association and AWSA, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.   The draft Development Credit Agreement
conforms to the normal pattern for credits for water supply and sewerage
projects.
37.        I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement
would comply with the ArticLes of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
38.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve "he proposed
Development Credit.
