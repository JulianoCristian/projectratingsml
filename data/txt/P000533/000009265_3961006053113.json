unemployment\n            by creating temporary jobs in the public works and\n            construction sector; and (d) to improve public procurement\n            and contract management practices. The project components\n            are: (a) an investment component aimed at protecting the\n            existing infrastructure from further decay and developing\n            additional urgently needed social infrastructure; (b) a\n            capacity building component providing training and technical\n            support for small-and medium-sized enterprises and the\n            beneficiaries (local governments and ministries); (c) a\n            component aimed at increasing community maintenance; (d) a\n            component of services aimed at project monitoring; and (e) a\n            procurement reform implementation component aimed at\n            improving the transparency and efficiency of the procurement\n            process by identifying the current bottlenecks and providing\n            consulting services for the revision of the procurement code."}, "docdt": "1994-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
