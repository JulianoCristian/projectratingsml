MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A PUBLIC WORKS AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendatio'i on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Chad for SDR 12.4 million, the equivalent of US$17.4 million, on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for public works and capacity building.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Chad has been affected by a succession of disasters, from war to
drought, that have seriously affected its basic infrastructures in terms of housing, sanitation, drainage,
community facilities, and utilities. The drop in the world price of cotton, its major crop, has also
aggravated the capacity of the Govemment of Chad (GOC) to undertake public investments in these areas.
All these conditions combined have rendered urban conditions in Chad precarious. GOC has very little
capacity to adequately plan, coordinate, and control urban growth, which is averaging 6% nationally, with
9% for N'Djamena. Basic drainage and sewage, water mains an~d standpipes are absent from many
neighborhoods. Community facilities and utilities are lacking. Stagnating waste water and uncollected
garbage are creating hazardous health conditions. GOC has become increasingly concerned by this
situation especially when considering that at the current growth rate, urban areas will have 35% of the
population by the year 2000. GOC is aware of the urgent needed for building basic infrastructure and
rehabilitating the capital stock.
3.    Project Background. To date, direct IDA involvement in the urban sector has been lInited. IDA
has been preparing a proposed municipal development and infrastucture project with the overall objective
of supporting GOC's implementation of its urban development strategy. More specifically, the project
would address the issues of local resource mobilization for infrastructure investment and maintenance. In
preparation for this project, GOC has launched a feasibility study of urban infrastructure investments for
N'Djamena, financed by the Fonds dAide et de Cooperation (FAC). While this study is being conducted,
GOC expressed the desire to embark on a program of small-scale public works which are urgently needed
in the poorest neighborhoods in N'Djamena. In response to GOC's request, the funding of the setting-up of
an independent executing agency, the Agence Tchadienne d'Execution de Travaux d'!ter& Public
(ATETIP), and the execution of four pilot projects was done through the reallocation of funds from two
related projects: the Economic and Financial Management Project (Cr. 1872-CD) and the Social Action
Development Project (Cr. 2156-CD).
4.    Project Objectives. The project objectives are: (a) to build local capacity (through private sector
development and public sector procurement reform); (b) to assist the Government in maintaning
infrastructure assets; (c) to participate in reducing current unemployment by creating temporary jobs in the
public works and construction sector; and (d) to improve public procurement and contract managment
practices. The development objectives are: (a) to demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive
construction practices and projects; (b) to alleviate poverty. While concentrating on the rehabilitation
and/or maintance of existing infrastructure it will have a positive impact on urban employment
opportunities and generate additional income to low slklled manpower in the urban area; (c) to test the
procedures that will enable the public sector to commission such projects to the private sector, and in
particular the ddlegation de maltrise douvrage (delegated contract management); and (d) to improve,
through the execution of the works financed by the project, the individual skills of the workers who will be
employed, and the corporate competitiveness of the finns that will a¢ry out works so as to develop their
capacity to respond to increased opporunities for sustained activity after project completion.



2
5.    Project Description. The five project components are: (a) an investment component (US$12.0
million, 65% of project costs) aimed at protecting the existing infrastructure from further decay and
developing additional urgently needed social infrastructure. The program of labor-intensive sub-projects
consists of two types of operations: (i) a public works program of public facility and infrastructure
rehabilitation and maintenance in urban areas (notably rehabilitation of drainage systems and urban
infrastructure such as schools, health centers, civic centers, and other public facilities); and (ii) a public
services program to restore degraded urban areas; (b) a capacity building component (US$2.98 million,
16% of project costs) providing training and technical support for small- and-medium sized enterprises and
the beneficiaries (local governments and ministries) including: (i) a package of training services related to
work organization, management, and technical skills training, to be offered on a voluntary basis to local
contractors who will be awarded contracts under component (a); and a training program for local
engineering firms and individual consultants on the preparation of feasibility studies, technical project
proposals and works supervision for component (a); and (ii) a training program for potential beneficiaries
of subprojects of component (a), to help them pre-evaluate the feasibility and soundness of such
subprojects; (c) a component aimed at increasing community participation (US$0.25 million, 1% of
project costs) in (i) subproject identification; and (ii) urban infrastructure maintenance; (d) a con.> anent of
services -.imed at project monitoring; (US$0.48 million, 3% of project costs) and (e) a procurement
reform fad implementation component (US$0.68 million, 4% of project costs) aimed at improving the
transparency and efficiency of the procurement process by identifying the current bottlenecks and providing
consulting services for the revision of the procurement code. The executing agency's incremental operating
and equipment costs (US$1.43 million, 8% of project costs), PFP refinancing (US$0.21 million, 1% of
project costs), and price contingencies (US$0.37 million, 2% of project costs) make up the balance of the
total project costs of US$18.39 million. The estimated costs and financing plan are given in Schedule A,
the procurement arrangements in Schedule B, page 1, and the disbursement arrangements in Schedule B,
page 2. Schedule C provides the project's preparation timeframe and staff involved.
6.    Project Implementation. The implementation of the project will be entrusted to the Agence
Tchadienne d'Execution de Travaux d'Interet Public (ATETIP) which will operate as a non-
governmental, non-profit organization. Its board will consist of a General Director drawn from the private
sector and representatives from existing non-governmental, non-profit organizations. ATETIP's Manual of
Procedures establishes: (a) the procedures whereby ATETIP receives and processes subproject execution
requests from the central and local governments; (b) the procedures to be used by ATETIP to classify
subprojects and construction firms; (c) the procurement procedures it must follow, including standard
bidding documents and a model contract; (d) the procedures to be used for subproject supervision by
consulting firms; (e) the accounting and disbursement procedures requiied for individual subprojects; (f)
the financial management procedures for ATETIP; (g) the nature and periodicity of reporting by ATETIP;
and (h) the procedures to secure external auditing of the Agency. The Government and ATETIP will sign
a Framework Agreement (Convention) which describes ATETIP's modus operandi and includes the
Manual of Procedures as an integral part.
7.    Project Sustainability. The project is likely to have a sustainable effect because: (a) it will help
strengthen small- and medium-sized construction firms, the labor force, and the local consulting industry,
thus enabling them to respond to the future demand for their services; (b) it will demonstrate the feasibility
of efficient public works execution and encourage the development of private contract managemnent
services, thus helping increase the efficiency of public sector expenditures; and (c) it will show the
possibility of using labor-intensive technologies in the context of public works projects, thus contributing to
a reduction in the level of unemployment. In addition, the project will aid in the re-establishment of the
credibility of local governments by demonstrating that it is possible to manage the provision of urban goods
and services and the execution of small-scale public works efficiently.

8.      Lessons Learnedfrom Previous IDA Involvement. IDA has a rich variety of lessons leamned
both from the execution of other AGETIP-type projects in the Sahel and from the implementation of past
and ongoing infrastructure projects in Chad. A number of lessons learned from the seven AGETIP-type
projects already under execution can be drawn: (a) contract unit prices quoted by contractors are 15%
lower than anticipated, as contractors take into account the fact that they will receive payments only ten
days on average after submitting their invoices; and (b) about 37% of the total amounts paid to contractors
are in turn paid out by them to workers in terms of salaries and wages. Innovations to the project made on
the basis of the lessons learned from the implementation of the Senegal Project include the following: (a)
the award of contracts includes a post-qualification bid to ascertain that the implementation capacity of the
contractor is not exceeded; (b) explanations are required for bids that are 15% lower than the reference
price; (c) a training component for contractors will be prepared at the inception of the project to ensure that
contractors have immediate access to training; and (d) the selection criteria of subprojects has been
expanded to include an environmental impact criterion.
9.    Lessons from the population and human resources sector. Although not in the infrastructure
sector, the Social Action Development Project (PADS, Cr. 2156-CD) is worth highlighting because two of
its components are linked to the proposed project. The one component involving infrastructure
rehabilitation has been plagued by difficulties in design, supervision and procurement. The other
component aimed at providing credit and technical assistance to small and micro-enterprises has boen a
success. It is with this mixed experience in mind, and after acknowledging the poor performance of the
classical urban infastructure management system in the PADS Project, that an AGETIP-style approach
was deemed appropriate by Government. The proposed project addresses the weaknesses in the
imfrastructure component of the PADS Project while building on the positive aspects of providing technical
assistance to small and micro-enterprises and encouraging community participation in project aintenance.
10.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. This project is consistent with the Chad country assistance
strategy which was presented to the Board on May 25, 1993 with the Fifth Education Project (Cr. 2501-
CD). Poverty alleviation is the underlying principle and guiding objective of IDA's assistance strategy in
Chad. The strategy supports the objectives of alleviating poverty by: (i) increasing the accessibility and
quality of basic social services, (ii) increasing incomes through productivity increases and improved
services to the agricultural sector where the majority of the population live and work, (iii) promoting
employment generation and entrepreneurship by encouraging the provision of services by the private sector,
(iv) supporting the reallocation of public expenditures towards development purposes, and (v) promoting a
coherent strategy for development of the energy sector. This project fulfills two of the five objectives of
our assistance program: (a) improving the welfare and the prospects for long-term growth by increasing
the accessibility and quality of basic urban and social services; and (b) promoting employment generation
and entrepreneurship by encouraging the provision of services by the private sector. This project wili
support GOC's need to build and maintain basic infrastructure while placing minimal demands on the
central government administration and finances. The proposed public works and capacity building project
would provide GOC with tangible results while increasing the capacity of both the public and private
sectors. The project will support the transition from their urgent-needs for maintenance and building basic
infrastructure to a more institutionally focused urban project. This project is considered part of the
program of targeted interventions for reducing poverty.
11.   Agreed Actions. The following events were conditions of negotiations: creation of ATETIP and
selection and appointment of the ATETIP's General Director, acceptable to IDA. The following
agreements were reached during negotiations: (a) agreement on the following regarding the procurment
study audit and reform: i) agreement on the terms of reference for the study; ii) the audit study will be



4
completed by December 31, 1994; iii) w ithin three months of the completion of the audit study, the
Government will present to IDA for its comments an Action Plan to adopt the changes reconunended by the
audit study, showing how they will be implemented; and iv) the Government will subsequently adopt the
agreed Action Plan, no later than December 31, 1995, and s .3sequently implement the agreed Action Plan
no later than December 31, 1996; (b) Government will i) cause the Agency to execute subprojects (other
than those financed by the IDA credit and other donors) with an aggregate cost of US$1 million equivalent
before June 30, 1998, including intermediary batches of sub-projects costing at least US$250,000 for every
period of 12 months starting July 1, 1994; ii) make available to the Agency US$250,000 for the first year
of subprojects; iii) make available to the Agency US$250,000 by July 1, 1995 for the second year of
subprojects; iv) make available to the Agency US$250,000 by July 1, 1996 for the third year of
subprojects; v) make available to the Agency US$250,000 by July 1, 1997 for the fourth year of
subprojects, (c) agreement that at all times during project implementation, the Statutes of Agreement of the
Agency and the Manual of Procedures will be acceptable in form and substance to IDA; (d) agreement that
at all times during project implementation, the General Director, the Technical Director and the Financial
Director of the Agency will be acceptable to IDA and the Agency will be operated in an efficient manner;
(e) selection of a consulting firm, acceptable to IDA, to assist the setting up of ATETIP's accounting
system, following terms of reference agreed upon during negotiations; (f) the Agency will submit to IDA
the sccond annual work program no later than April 30, 1995 for at least US$2.75 million, the third annual
work program no later than April 30, 1996 for at least US$2.75 million, and the fourth annual work
program no later than April 30, 1997 for at least US$2.75 million; (g) complete the second annual work
program no later than June 30, 1996, the third annual work program no later than June 30, 1997, and the
fourth work program no later than June 30, 1998; (h) the agreed action plans for the training program for
contractors, consultants, beneficiaries and community participation will be updated annually by June 30 to
reflect the needs identified during project implementation; and (i) ATETIP will submit periodically to IDA
proposals to update the roster of consultants and contractors.
12.   Environmental Aspects. This is a category B project. Many of the eligible subprojects will have a
net positive impact on the environment (building and/or repairing drainage and roads, sanitation, soil and
water conservation, garbage collection). To ensure that subprojects' impact on the environment has been
assessed ex ante, an evaluation criterion has been added in the Manual of Procedures stipulating that
proposed subprojects having a negative impact on the environment will be ineligible for execution.
13.   Program Objective Categories. The project's employment creation aspects (particularly its
emphasis on labor-intensive technologies) wvill connribute to poverty alleviation. This positive effect will be
amplified to the extent that construction firms subcontract part of their work to "firms" in the informal
sector, where weaker adherence to labor regulations results in more employment at lower-wage levels.
While not targeting them specifically, the project is likely to create employment among women and youth
organized into local groups.
14.   Project Benefits. The project will have several direct benefits: (a) high economic return on
rehabilitation operations; (b) employment creation; (c) subprojects concerned with garbage collection, and
drainage will have a positive impact on the environment; (d) long-term benefit of enhancing the efficiency
of the public sector (it could have a spill-over effect on other IDA projects - such as education and health -
- by increasing the capacity and efficiency of the construction sector); and (e) enhanced sustainability of
future urban municipal projects. Most importantly, the project will help reduce a significant backlog of
economic and social infrastructure and maintenance in Chad (principally N'Djanena, Moundou and Sahr).
It will generate incomes for many categories of the work force in the building and construction trades,
thereby creating a multiplier effect on the local economy. The smooth operation of the Agency would show



S
a workable alternative to traditional procurement procedures. This demonstration effect, coupled viith the
assistance to procurement reform, would contribute to improving the public procurement system in general.
15.   Risks. The first major risk is that the Agency may misuse its considerable independence. The risk
will be reduced by the selection of a qualified General Director, who will have to be at all times acceptable
to IDA. In addition, the proposed intensity of supervision will closely monitor the implementation of the
Manual of Procedures and frequent external audits will provide sufficient opportunity to deal with
inadequate performance on the part of the Agency or any Government interference. The second major risk
is that local contractors and consulting firms may lack the capacity required to implement the project on
time. This risk will be greatly reduced by implementing the project over four years to take into account the
absorptive capacity of the sector. In addition, technical assistance and training components included in the
project are expected to increase the capacity of local contractors and consulting firms. The third major risk
is that the volume of employment created by the project may fall short of expectations or be less than
significant when compared to the present level of urban unemploymnent. To reduce this rsk, a strong
emphasis on labor-intensive technologies will be maintained throughout project implementation.
16.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Disbursement Performance
Economic and Financial Management Project (Cr. 1872-CD!: The credit became effective on
September 23, 1988, almost eight months after signing. This project has been a problem project
for much of the last five years. Nonetheless, its performance has improved over the last year and
its curent rating has now been upgraded to a "2". While disbursements have lagged badly, partly
due to poor initial preparation and subsequent nation.' difficulties in 1991-1992, several major
components are now fully prepared and are ready to be implemented. A mission is currently
restructuring this project with the aim to support the technical assistance and capacity building
essential to the implementation of the Economic Recovery Credit recently approved by the Board.
Livestock Project (Cr. 1912-CD): The credit became effective on January 27, 1989 about seven
months after signing. As of March 1994, about $11.3 million had been disbursed out of a total
credit of $18.6 million. The project has been a problem project for two years and has now been
restructured. Disbursements have been slow since the number of project components was
reduced following the restructuring. The current mission's findings will assess which measures
will be taken to improve implementation performance, or whether to suspend or cancel the
operation if improvements are unlikely.
Social Development Action Project (Cr. 2156-CD): The credit became effective on April 17,
1991, almost ten months after signing. Although a disbursement lag is still being reflected, it has
decreased progressively over the last year and is dropping even more quickly at present since the
infrastructure construction component has entered into the action phase. Several contracts which
will draw heavily on disbursements are being finalized. During the last mission a project
programming exercise, which shows that all amounts will be used by the close of the project, was
completed.
Engineering Credit (Cr. 1840-CD): The credit became effective on March 15, 1991, i.e., three-
and-one-half months after signing. Its objectives are to assist the SEERAT in preparing project
specifications and cost estimates and to conduct the necessary studies for the appraisal of the
petroleum and power project (the "Sedigi project"). Tender documents and prequalification of
bidders were completed in March 1992, but due to a lack of progress on the macroeconomic front
in Chad, project activities and disbursements have ceased since that date, although disbursements
have not been formally suspended. Recently, discussions with Government have resumed
regarding the reactivation of this project for the Sedigi project preparation work with an update of
the bidding documents, the pricing studies and the environmental work. Resuming disbursements
is pending progress by the Chadians on economic management and public finance management, as
well as on three conditions: (i) increased private sector participation in SEERAT; (ii)
implementing measures to improve petroleum tax collection; and (iii) allocating petroleum fiscal
revenues to priority expenditures.
