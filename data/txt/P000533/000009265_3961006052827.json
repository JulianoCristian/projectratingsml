  infrastructure assets; (c) to participate in reducing\n            current unemployment by creating temporary jobs in the\n            public works and construction sector; and (d) to improve\n            public procurement and contract management practices. The\n            project components are: (a) an investment component aimed at\n            protecting the existing infrastructure from further decay\n            and developing additional urgently needed social\n            infrastructure; (b) a capacity building component providing\n            training and technical support for small-and medium-sized\n            enterprises and the beneficiaries (local governments and\n            ministries); (c) a component aimed at increasing community\n            maintenance; (d) a component of services aimed at project\n            monitoring; and (e) a procurement reform implementation\n            component aimed at improving the transparency and efficiency\n            of the procurement process by identifying the current\n            bottlenecks and providing consulting services for the\n            revision of the procurement code."}, "docdt": "1994-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
