Expected environmental impacts,\n            especially during the construction phase, will affect water\n            quality, aquatic life, fisheries, navigation and port\n            operations, urban land traffic, and recreation. Positive\n            effects of the project include a reduction in the risk of\n            oil spills and prevention of further coastal erosion by the\n            addition of dredged sand on beaches. Mitigation measures\n            include: creation of an automated database system concerning\n            sediment types and locations; guarding against the\n            introduction of alien species; protection of fish migration\n            routes and spawning areas; separate dredging of clean and\n            contaminated sediments; confined disposal of contaminated\n            sediments; offshore disposal of uncontaminated dredged\n            sediments; beach or foreshore replacement; planning of\n            navigation and road transport during construction work;\n            informing the public; and creation of a cleanup plan for\n            pollution caused by construction activities."}, "docdt": "1999-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
