Project is to strengthen the long term competitiveness of\n            this Baltic region port, and, to improve environmental\n            conditions, by preventing spills, improving waste reception\n            facilities, and monitoring environmental conditions. The two\n            main components are: 1) Investments in civil works, which\n            will include the rehabilitation of breakwaters at the port\n            entrance, through detailed investigations, and, build an\n            extension of both the northern, and southern breakwaters, to\n            limit wave energy from entering the port. In addition, the\n            channel entrance will be dredged, widened, and deepened,\n            allowing a realignment away from the oil terminal, in\n            accordance with international agreements. Specifically\n            designed monitoring fenders will be installed, combined with\n            steel mooring lines. Safe maneuvers will be ensured\n            following the installation of a wave/current monitoring\n            system. Studies will determine the requirements for marine\n            environment protection, and the financing of necessary\n            equipment, and training. 2) Technical assistance will be\n            provided, through studies to estimate the appropriate level\n            of land lease rates, to avoid cross subsidies with harbor\n            dues, and review lease management contracting, and\n            procurement procedures, and, will focus on privatization\n            practices for port services, and management. Training will\n            be provided for port pilots on skillful navigation practices."}, "docdt": "2000-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
