development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: if the Bank is going to finance the\n            construction of containment facilities for contaminated\n            materials produced by dredging, it needs to ensure a deep\n            knowledge of the country's laws and regulations vis a\n            vis the Bank's own rules and guidelines. If at all\n            possible, a binding agreement on the facility's\n            location, as well as treatment technology, should be pursued\n            prior to loan signing. The strategic linking of the\n            components identified and designed in support of the first\n            development objective were well conceived in their\n            complementarities; each component enhanced the other such\n            that the outcome was greater than the sum of its parts. The\n            design should be viewed as a model for similar operations.\n            The meticulous preparation work that was carried out at the\n            onset of the project and the strong technical, i.e.,\n            geo-technical and hydrological support by specialists and\n            engineering firms is a remarkable feature in this project,\n            and like the design, should be replicated where appropriate."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
