outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Szczecin-Swinoujscie Seaway and Port Modernization Project\n            for Poland are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Both ports have\n            increased their competitiveness by combination of major\n            rehabilitation of their marine facilities with\n            transformation, more radical than foreseen in the\n            Bank's forecasts, in the structure of their traffic.\n            Klaipeda responded effectively to unexpected loss of much of\n            its transit trade by converting many of its facilities to\n            better meet the needs of other traffics, national and\n            transit, and has become mainly a national port.\n            Szczecin-Swinoujscie was equally called upon to cope with\n            significantly larger than expected reduction in its\n            traditional traffics, and it achieved a very rapid growth of\n            new and more profitable container and ferry traffics despite\n            links with its hinterland much weaker than in the case of\n            Lithuania, due to their different histories in the last few\n            decades. A vital task of ports is to ascertain the changing\n            hinterland, or geographic market area, that they can expect\n            to serve, and to identify and help resolve policy or\n            infrastructure obstacles to the development of new trades.\n            It should now be normal to have an economist experienced in\n            trade and transport issues participate in a supervision\n            mission to a port borrower at least once every twelve or\n            eighteen months. Probably the most significant lesson with\n            regard specifically to ports that emerges from the\n            experience of these two projects is to underline the\n            importance of port efforts to lead identification of its\n            potential hinterland, stimulate private initiatives to help\n            bring the hinterland's trades to life, and work with\n            government ministries and services to overcome bureaucratic\n            and policy obstacles."}, "docdt": "2010-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
