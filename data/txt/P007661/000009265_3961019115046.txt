MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Mexico
Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (Loan 3357-ME)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Mexico Second Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loan (Loan 3357-ME) prepared by the Latin American and the Caribbean Regional
Office. Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
The adjustment operation complemented the earlier sector adjustment loan and was consistent
with both Government policy aiJ Bank support strategy. As part of a wider program of Bank support
for adjustment of the Mexican economy, the Loan aimed at supporting Government's objectives of
increasing the rate of growth of agriculture, raising the sector's productivity and efficiency, and
alleviating poverty for the most vulnerable rural popula ion groups through targeted food programs.
The policy reform proposals were, on the whole, successfully implemented. Completion of
the reform program was delayed by about 1.5 years by the negotiation of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA); the preparation of the National Program for the Modernization of
Agriculture (PROCAMPO), which provides income support to farmers; the introduction of "agreed
prices" for key grains that are essentially minimum prices for domestic producers; and the preparation
of food and nutrition action plans.
Although the reforms have yet to achieve their full impact, the project outcome is rated as
satisfactory. The project redefined the roles of Government and the private sector in Mexican
agriculture, contributing to substantial institutional development. In the light of Mexico's
commitments under NAFTA, the policy changes are deemed sustainable anr.l sustainability is rated as
likely.
The PCR is complete and informative. An audit is underway.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(Loan 3357-ME)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Agricultural Adjustment Loan in
Mexico (AGSAL II - Loan 3357-ME) in the amount of US$400 million. The loan was approved on
June 25, 1991, and declared effective on December 20 1991. The loan was fully disbursed and the
last disbursement was made on December 1, 1993. TI. loan was closed on December 31, 1993.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture and Natural Resources Operations Division
(LA2AG) of the Latin Ameri.a and the Caribbean Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
The preparation of the PCR was based on interv,iews of Bank staff and Government officials
involved in the preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the project, and the review, inter alia,
of the President's Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Implementation Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

MEXICO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(Loan 3357-ME)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Loan Objectives
1.    Tte Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (AGSAL II) was the second adjustment
operation for Mexican agriculture. Approved on June 25, 1991, AGSAL II is part of a program of
Bank support for the Government's objectives of increasing the rate of growth of agriculture, raising
productivity and improving the efficiency of the agricultural sector th-ough better-functioning output
and input maikets, and aileviating the poverty of the most vulnerable population groups through
targeted food programs. In particular, this loan supported (paras 1.33 to 1.37): (a) trade and policy
reforms that increased competition and reduced the government's role in the production, planning,
marketing, storage, and processing of agricultural products and inputs, and allowed more competition
from the private sector; (b) a revision in the allocation of Government expenditure in consumer
programs by eliminating generalized food subsidies and increasing spending for improved targeted
food assistance and nutrition programs; and (c) the institutional transition of the Ministry of
Agriculture (SARH) to a smaller but more effective role in agriculture, emphasizing policy
formulation and implementation and basic regulatory functions.
Implementation
2.    Implementation of the US$400 million loan was generally satisfactory. The first tranche of
US$200 million was fully disbursed on January 22, 1992. The second tranche of another US$200
was expected to be disbursed in August 1992, but was delayed until late 1993 by negotiations of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and preparation of the new income support
program (PROCAMPO) (see paras. 1.41 to 1.47). Other reasons for the delay were the
Government's imposition of agreed prices (precios de concertacion) for sorghum, rice, and soybeans
(see paras. 1.52-1.53) and delays in preparing action plans for its food and nutrition policy (see
para. 1.86).
Results
3.    The main historical problem of Mexican agriculture was the detrimental effect of policy
interventions on growth and income distribution. Price, trade, and regulatory policy instruments
hampered the efficient working of product and input markets and distorted the size and nature of
public investment. Reforms beginning in the mid-1980s, and later supported by both AGSAL I and
11, appropriately addressed these problems and bettered the policy framework for Mexican agriculture.
4.    AGSAL II achieved its principal objective of improving efficiency by replacing government
guided mechanisms with market ones. The project assisted reforms in prices, trade, public
investment, poverty alleviation, fiscal transfers, and the role of parastatals. The Government has



iv
realized fiscal savings and now has a more efficient public investment program in agriculture. The
economy bears fewer costs of non-viable parastatals. Though the costs of reforms were borne mostly
by consumers, the impact on the poor was softened through targeted food subsidies. The agricultural
economy has moved closer to a market-pricing system. Arbitrary and costly trade restrictions have
been abandoned. While the ultimate effects of the reforms will depend on the Government's long-
term commitment, a better environment for private-sector led growth and for appropriate and cost-
effective public interventions now exists.
Project Sustainability
5.     The President's Report identified three major risks to the sustainability of the reform program
(para. 1.99). The risks are related to: (i) macroeconomic climate - fiscal discipline, monetary
policy, and the exchange rate; (ii) resistance to changes in patterns of resource use from those who
benefit from the status quo, causing the reform to lose its momentum; and (iii) an over-reliance on
NAFTA to implement trade policy reform program in maize, wheat, and barley that would not
necessarily guarantee price liberalization.
6.     Macroeconomic stability (para. 1.99) was realized largely through the Economic Solidarity
Pact (PECE) and through the elimination of public sector deficits. Lower public sector debt was
made possible by the Brady Plan and the proceeds from the privatization of public enterprises. The
Government has recently commnitted to making the exchange rate regime more flexible, thereby
making the macroeconomic side of the project more sustainable. The rise in the real interest rates
associated with stabilization, however, has penalized some farming activities, thus cutting some
benefits of the reforms. The second risk was related to the resistance that the Government might face
from the beneficiaries of the status quo (para. 1.100). However, the introduction of PROCAMPO,
which will be implemented over the next 15 years, dramatically breaks the link between agricultural
production and income support, and its implementation today has been satisfactory. Finally,
PROCAMPO also addresses the concern that NAFTA alone might not have been sufficient to promote
price liberalization for maize, wheat, and barley, because it goes beyond the Government's
commitment under NAFTA (para. 1.101).
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.     The lessons learned from this operation in terms of broad issues are:
(a)    Linkage between stabilization and liberalization. Stabilization and budget restraint
continued to take priority over growth in the period of AGSAL II as it had under
AGSAL 1. The lesson is that a closer analysis of the Government's intentions
regarding the stabilization program in terms of public expenditure goals should have
taken place and that more explicit targets for productive investments should have been
set.
(b)    Sector strategy. Poverty alleviation measures, notably steps to improve nutrition
among the rural poor, were included in both AGSAL I and II, but other actions to
distribute benefits of reforms were not elucidated until after the loan had been signed.
The lesson learned is that dialogue between the Bank and the borrower about
structural adjustment operations should not be limited to policy reforms, but should be



v
expanded to include complementary actions that would ensure related sectors will
benefit from new incentives.
(c)    Poverty alleviation. AGSAL I and 11 were the first sectoral operations to take
explicit steps to reduce the cost of reforms to the poor. Not only did they attempt to
reduce the burden of adjustment on the poor by promoting targeted food subsidies,
thus making the package politically more acceptable, but they also set the basis for the
Government's National Food Security Program for 1990-94. A notable feature of the
desig'i was the restriction of additional subsidies to an existing institution-
CONASUPO - so as to be able to monitor their cost.
(d)    Price policy conditions. The price policy conditions were complied with nominally,
but did not have their full intended effect - of removing distorted incentives to
growers' production decisions - because they were not linked to other forms of
support for crop production. This was most true of wheat production which, for
political reasons, received direct marketing support from SARH beginning in 1990
although t'e conditions of AGSAL 11 limited the support from trade/price policy. The
lesson is that it would be necessary to include conditionality on budget allocations for
direct subsidies, beyond the price policy liberalization conditions, to avoid such non-
price support.
8.     Morn specific lessons of the operation are:
(a)    Design of the loan. AGSAL 11, within the process of general reform, had a more
comprehensive design than AGSAL I for ensuring that policy issues were managed
within a unified framework; this was a notable strength of the design.
(b)    Linkage to other Bank operations. The chief linkages of AGSAL II have been to
investment operations, including those to the Irrigation and Drainage Sector Loan and
the Agricultural Technology Loan, which were designed to promote a supply response
to the incentive policy changes. Although these were appropriate linkages, the
investment projects suffered from inadequate budgetary resources which worked
against AGSAL II's growth objective.
(c)    Pilot health and nutrition project.  The pilot health and nutrition project within
AGSAL 11 targeted low income families at risk of malnutrition, including pregnant
and lactating women as well as children under the age of five. While the basic design
of the evaluation was satisfactory, the follow-up on the analysis in the form of an
action plan was slow because of institutional failures within the Government. The
lesson is that similar evaluation efforts should be monitored by qualified official
agencies. A second lesson is that in similar operations more time should be given
before pilot activities are evaluated - the one year period for this component of the
project was inadequate.

a. World Bank and IMF Roles in Mexico's Adjustment Process
1.1   The Bank role in Mexico shifted during the mid-1980s as a result of recognition of the
severity of the country's economic problems and the Government's increasing commitment to deep
reform. The Bank first began to' work more closely with the Government on trade issues during 1984
and, by 1985, began to play a central role in the dialogue between the Government and international
commercial creditors, and then to assist in developing a program of structural reform.
1.2   The Bank agreed to address long-term issues through a series of sector adjustment loans,
which taken together, covered all major elements of a SAL program. Two Trade Policy Loans
(FY87 and FY88 for US$500 million each) were the first such operations. They were followed by
adjustment hybrid loans in the Fertilizer sector (FY88, US$265 million); Agricultural Sector I and II
(FY88 and FY91, US$300 million and US$400 million, respectively); Stec I Sector (FY88, US$400
million); Financial Sector (FY89, US$500 million); Industrial Sector (FY89, US$500 million); Public
Enterprise Reform (FY89, US$500 million); Road Transport and Teleconmnunications (FY90,
US$380 million); and the Interest Support Loan (FY90, US$1.26 billion). These operations formed a
policy package to build the framework for the increase in private investment necessary to spur
growth.
1.3   Since 1982, the IMF has supported Mexico with an extended arrangement for SDR 3.4
billion, a special emergency drawing for SDR 291 million following the 1985 earthquake, a stand-by
agreement for SDR 1.4 billion in 1986, a drawing of - DR 453 million in 1989 under the
compensatory facility, and a further extended arrangen nt of SDR '2.8 biflion. The latter financing
facility was completed successfully in May 1993.
1.4    During the program of restructuring, the Bank and the IMF were in close coordination to
ensure policy compatibility. The Bank and IMF also worked closely with the Government in the



2
negotiation of the 1989 debt reduction agreement with international commercial banks. This
agreement resulted in an immediate drop in nominal domestic interest rates, lengthening maturities for
public debt and larger private capital inflows.
b. The Macroeconomic Enviromnent and Government's Economic Restructuring and
Stabilization Programs
1.5    Prior to the debt crisis of 1982, Mexico enjoyed a period of sustained high economic growth
and price stability. Between 1940-80 the GDP grew at an annual rate of 6.2 percent. However,
behind high growth lay a deterioration in fundamentals. Conservative fiscal policies were able to
keep inflation in single digit levels until 1972; but when replaced by more expansionist ones, they led
to double-digit inflation and eventually to the collapse of the exchange rate in 1976. Expanded public
borrowing, high world interest rates and the sharp decline in the price of oil in 1982 led to the debt
crisis. Economic performance after the debt crisis was poor. For example, average GDP growth
during 1983-88 was 0.2 percent while the average inflation was 86.4 percent.
1.6   In the mid-1980s, Mexico began to reform its economic policies away from state intervention
and toward a market basis. The reform consisted of three major aspects: (i) fiscal adjustment; (ii)
trade liberalization; and (iii) deregulation and legal changes.
1.7    Fiscal adjustment has been remarkable, with the main changes coming from the expenditure
side. Non-interest expenditures, which had been at almost 35 percent of GDP in 1981, were by 1992
reduced to 20.5 percent. Capital expenditures were cut in half over the same period. While the cuts
brought about increased efficiency of Government operations by eliminating most of the dubious large
projects of the late 1970s, expenditures on maintenance and the social sectors were also reduced
sharply. Total interest payments had represented an important expenditure component, but were
reduced sharply by 1990-91 with the reduction of the debt burden. From 1982-1990 interest
payments ranged from 12 to 20 percent of GDP, while in December 1992 they were only 3.9 percent
of GDP. Following the renewed confidence brought about by the continuity and growing success of
structural reforms (which led to lower interest rates), plus as a consequence of the steadily falling
debt to GDP ratio (due to strong fiscal accounts), domestic interest payments fell to 5.5 percent of
GDP in 1991.
1.8    Tax Reforms. Although increased total government revenue contributed only 3 percentage
points of GDP to fiscal adjustment, the efficiency of the tax system has been substantially improved.
A major tax reform was initiated in 1987. The reform expanded the tax base, simplified the tax
system, reduced rates, and modernized tax administration. Personal and corporate tax rates have been
brought in line with international levels. The highest personal tax rate and the flat corporate tax rate
are now 35 percent, compared to 60.5 percent and 42 percent in 1986. The Value Added Tax (VAT)
had four rates, from zero percent to 20 percent, with a base rate of 25 percent, but in November
1991 a uniform rate of 10 percent was introduced for all sectors. In early 1990 the administration of
the VAT, which until then had been assigned to the states, was taken over by the federal authorities.
The excise tax on gasoline, as well as gasoline prices, were sharply increased in 1990-92.
1.9    Trade liberalization. In 1982, tariffs were high with a maximum of one hundred percent.
Furthermore, quantitative import restrictions were used as the main vehicle of protection. In addition
to the base tariffs, the Government used the option of applying surcharges of up to fifty percent of the
base to provide temporary protection to industries whose non-tariff barriers (NTBs) were eliminated.



3
After the reforms introduced in December, 1987; tariffs were reduced to five levels, the maximum
tariff was set at 20 percent, and official reference prices were aboli;,hed. Domestic production
covered by import licenses settled at about 20 percent in 1988 and the production-weighted tariff was
reduced to about 11 percent. An exception to the liberalization, as of 1989, was the retention of
import licenses on about 40 percent of the value of agricultural products though this later fell.
i 10   Deregulation and legal rFeforms. Although major steps towards deregulation and legal
reforms have been taken for some time, the most important steps towards private sector participation
in the economy were taken by the previous (Miguel de la Madrid, 1982-1988) and current (Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, 1989-present) administrations.' Deregulation has been extended to industry and
transportation. The national telephone system was privatized. A cumbersome transportation licensing
system has been streamlined and the sector has been opened to competition. In December 1992, a
law was passed that permits private ownership of electricity generating plants. A program to reform
the public enterprises that will remain in public hands i;; being implemented. Enterprises targeted for

c. Results and Remaining Problems
1.12   As a result of the fiscal mieasures, the overall fiscal balance went from a deficit of 15.6
percent of GDP in 1982 to a surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP in 1992. The recovery of growth,
however, was still modest. GDP was almost unchanged between 1982 and 1988, implying a decline
in per capita terms of 11 percent over that period. During the period 1989-91, growth in total GDP
recovered to 3.7 percent annually.
.13   Despite the successful implementation of economic reforms, economic growth has slowed
since mid-1991. In 1992, GDP grew only at an annual rate of i.8 percent. Estimated GDP growth
for 1993 was only 0.4 percenit according to the initial estimates released by INEGI (Instituto Nacional
de Estatistica, Geografia, y Informatica). According to the most recent esf.imates of INEGI, GDP
growth was only 0.3 percent in the second quarter, a negative 0.8 percent in the third quarter, and a
negative 0. 1 percent in the fourth quarter. Given that the average annual population growth is about
1.9 percent, no per capita real GDP growth is expected to be orserved in the near future. The trade
accounts have worsened markedly, with a current account deficit of $22.8 billion in 1992 (i.e., 6.9
percent cf GDP). On the positive side, however, inflation in 1993 dropped to single digits (8.1
percent, based on the December 1992 to December 1993 change in the consumer price index).
1.14   Poverty. Official estimates indicate that about 20% of the population is still below the
poverty line of $350/yeai. Income inequality is severe and may have gotten worse as a consequence
of the economic crisis of the 1980s. The Governmew is attacking poverty through public expenditure

programs targeted to the poor. PRONASOL (Programa Nacional de Solidaridad), which was initiated
in 1988, targets health, education, nutrition, housing, infrastructure and other projects to the poor in
disadvantaged areas.'
1.15   Productivity. Productivity growth in Mexico should have been fostered by the structural
reforms, notably trade liberalization and deregulation. Productivity has indeed picked up recently,
but remains low and has not offset the loss of competitiveness brought about by the real peso
appreciation. Gross labor productivity in manufacturing increased at an estimated 3.9 percent
cumulative annual rate over 1987-92. Similarly, total factor productivity (TFP) growth has responded
positively to reform with big asymmetries across sectors. Estimates for TFP growth in manufacturing
fall in the 3 to 5 percent range over 1985-90. However, trends of differential gross labor productivity
growth in manufacturing over longer periods do not produce grounds for strong optimism. Over the
1980-92 period, Mexico's labor productivity growth has been less than developed countries like the
U.S. and Japan, and far less than in some of Mexico's competitors in the U.S. market, e.g., Korea
and Taiwan.
1.16   Exchange Rate. The nominal exchange rate remains an important ingredient of the PECE
(Economic Solidarity Pact). Measured against U.S. wholesale prices, much of the increase in
competitiveness that occurred during the 1986-87 depreciation has been lost. In October 1992,
Mexico made the exchange rate more flexible by widening the existing band and raising the
preannounced rate of devaluation of the band ceiling. The widening of the band will: (i) enable the
market to determine in a more efficient manner the appropriate level of the exchange rate; (ii) reduce
the volatility of capital flows, thus facilitating monetary policy; and (iii) reduce the risk of abrupt
changes in the exchange rate regime. On the other hand, the fact that the rate is only partially
flexible (a maximum 4.6% annual devaluation of the upper limit of the band), while limiting some of
the above advantages, will reduce the fear that inflation might rise. The market reaction to the
October 1992 exchange rate reform was favorable; following the announcement, peso-denominated
interest rates declined and the exchange rate appreciated. Contractual wage revisions in the private
sector, a better indicator of medium-term devaluation and inflation expectations, declined sharply
from an average of 15.4 percent in the third quarter of 1992 to less than 10 percent in the last two
months of 1993.3
d. The Agricultural Sector
1.17   Mexican agriculture expanded at over 4 percent annually after World War II until the mid-
1960s, in excess of the annual population growth rate of about 3 percent. Output growth resulted
largely from the expansion of cultivated area: irrigated area increased by 4.5 percent annually from
1947 to 1965 and total harvested area grew at more than 6.3 percent annually. However, agricultural
2.     PROCAMPO, which is going to replace the current subsidy scheme, may have some income
redistribution effects as farmers who have produced a number of eligible crops in the past
three years will be receiving a N$350 per hectare for the ten years starting 1994 (see Table 4
in text for informnation on the transition period).
3.     This was, in part, due to a "guideline" ceiling on contractual wage revisions. The
combination of exchange rate, wage, monetary, and fiscal policy has probably played a more
important role.

GDP growth fell to around 3.0 percent between 1965 and 1980 and to less than 1.0 percent during
1980s. The slippage in growth resulted as limits were reached on suitable land for expansion, as the
rate of growth of migration fell, and from the cumulative adverse effects of agricultural policies
which had been in place for three decades.
1.18   The central theme of agricultural policy had long been to resolve the conflicting objectives of
low prices for consu-ners and high prices of producers. On the consumer side, the Government
provided untargeted food subsidies. On the producer side, there were major interventions in
production, credit, tcchnology, inputs, storage, processing, and transportation.
1.19   The main agricultural policies were:
(a)    The state guaranteed prices of 12 major crops (maize, beans, wheat, barley, rice,
sorghum, soybeans, safflower, cottonseed, copra, sunflower, and sesame). The
National Commission for Distribution of Basic Foods, CONASUPO (Compania
Nacional de Subsistencias Populares), maintained the guarantee prices by buying from
15 percent to 50 percent of the output in those crops. Guarantee prices were uniform
througho-ut Mexico and were adjusted infrequently during the year thus distorting
production decisions, making private storage unprofitable, and taxing producers
heavily at times of high inflation.
(b)    Prices for products without guarantees were also subject to Government intervention.
There were various import and export restrictions affecting internationally traded
goods. Parastatals were involved in the production, processing and marketing of
cotton, coffee, livestock feeds, tropical fruits, seeds, and cocoa.
(c)    In an effort to raise output while restricting producer prices, the Government
attempted to increase the cultivated area through direct investments in land clearing
and input subsidies to electricity, fertilizer, water, pesticides, credit, and machinery.
The Government also regulated the types of crops that could be grown by setting
production targets.
(d)    The consumer prices of key industrial inputs and basic foods were distorted by fixed
price regulations, trade controls, and direct subsidies to private and parastatal
processors. CONASUPO administered general food subsidies and targeted ones to the
poor. Consumer price controls covered more than half of agricultural production in
1987, though this level was slightly lower than earlier.
1.20   Output Prices. Before 1990, producer prices were guaranteed for maize, beans, rice, wheat,
barley, sorghum, soybean, cotton seed, safflower, sunflower, copra, and sesame throughout Mexico.
This penalized production close to consumption centers and subsidized production farther away. For
food crops, CONASUPO subsidized transportation, physical losses, and storage costs. Before 1987,
prices were adjusted infrequently during the year, hence distorting production decisions during
inflationary periods and making private storage unprofitable. Guarantee prices were eliminated for all
crops (except maize and beans) in 1990.

1.21   The ratio of domestic prices to world prices varied over time and by crop, depending on the
exchange rate, price objectives, and world prices. Because it became more difficult, for fiscal
reasons, to maintain high guarantee prices and low consumer prices, adjustment in the guarantee
prices have been modLrate and are lower than their peak in 1980-82, without necessarily implying
that the level of protection has been lower.
1.22   To present an idea of the degree to which output prices were distorted, Table 1 which prices
(expressed in constaiit 1992 US$/ton) and nominal protection coefficients, NPC, (i.e., ratio of
domestic to the import parity price) for maize, wheat, sorghum, barley, rice, soybeans, rice, and
cocoa for 1983-92.4 With the exception of cocoa, the average NPC increased when one compares
the 1983-87 period to the 1988-92 period. For most crops, the 1992 prices received by producers
were close to the 1983 prices implying that the increased NPCs were mainly the result of lower world
prices.
1.23   The objective of low food prices forced the Government either to depress producer prices or
to subsidize consumers while maintaining high farm prices. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the
Government did the latte-, i.e., it subsidized consumers and maintained producer prices generally
higher than their world counterparts. The economic crisis of 1982 eliminated consumer subsidies.
Government financial constraints resulted in a decline in untargeted food subsidies to less than US$90
million in 1987 (or 0.4 percent of GDP). The concomitant rise in controlled consumer prices affected
the poor more than other classes. The budgetary crises also cut the Government's ability to support
farmers and, in 1985/86, domestic producer prices dropped to historical lows relative to international
prices. For example, the real (1992 terms) price of maize received by producers dropped from N$
267 in 1985 to N$ 190 in 1986 in addition to the reduction in the NPC (Nominal Protection
Coefficient) from 1.83 to 1.70. Similar reduction took place in other major crops (see Table 1).5
1.24   Public Expenditures. On the expenditure side, there has been a shift in the structure of rural
public expenditures in the last few years. In 1992 the percentage of expenditures which went to
administration costs was twice as much as it was in 1985 and 1986, while in market interventions it
was almost half of its 1985-86 average Table 2). If one excludes 1990, there has been a gradual
decline in the overall rural public expenditures since 1985 (measured as a percentage of agricultural
GDP).
1.25   Agricultural policies had many negative effects on the sector. Economy-wide trade controls,
leading to an overvalued exchange rate, discriminated against agricultural exports. For example, the
REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate), measured as the ratio of Mexican to the US CPI (Consumer
Price Index) times the nominal exchange rate, reached a peak of 1.30 and 1.31 in 1986 and 1987
compared to an average of 0.85 before the mid-1970s, indicating a 35 percent lower return to
tradeables production than existed before the mid-1970s. As fiscal stabilization begun to take effect in
4.     An NPC greater than unity implies subsidy while an NPC less than unity implies tax.
Changes in NPC depend on domestic prices, world prices, and the exchange rate. Hence, an
increase in the NPC does not necessarily imply that producers receive higher domestic prices
as the increase may be due to lower world prices or to an overvalued exchange rate.

barley, rice, soybeans, coffee, and cocoa.

the late 1980s, the consequent rise in real interest rates negatively affected the agricultural activities
which were sensitive to interest rates (e.g., private storage, transportation).

1.26   Protection of the industrial sector harmed the domestic agricultural/non-agricultural terms of
trade. Restrictions on imports and price controls reduced efficiency in the sector. While subsidies
for credit, water, fertilizer, seed, and other inputs counterbalanced in part the lower prices for farm
products, they induced other allocative efficiency costs in addition to putting a fiscal burden on the
state. Subsidized parastatals in production, marketing, storage, and processing added to the fiscal
deficit. The results of these policies were to hamper private investment, to slow growth and to ensure
that rural areas remained poor relative to urban. Though intervention was intended to aid the rural
poor and to compensate for an inadequate marketing infrastructure, it actually benefitted more richer
farmers and suppressed development of private marketing, storage, processing and rural finance.
3. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
a. Project Rationale
1.27   Bank strategy in 1990-91 recognized both short-run uncertainty over oil prices and the need to
safeguard the Mexican economy from the effects of declines in the terms of trade. The
macroeconomic justification for continued balance of payment support in 1991, albeit at smaller levels
than previously planned, also reflected the short-run volatility in the oil market and the long-run



9
concern of insulating the economy from external shocks. Priorities in the Mexican adjustment
program provided a clear rationale for focusing this flow on the agricultural sector because of its
.emaining strong distortions and the effect of adjustment on the poor.
1.28   Continuation of agricultural price and ,rade policy reforms was key to further improving the
incentives for the increased growth. Elimination of trade barriers was vital to permit the transmission
of world prices. Dismantling of guarantee prices was needed to eliminate distortions in domestic
producer prices. Reforms in food consumption policy were fundamental to: (i) improving the
efficiency of government expenditure on anti-poverty programs; (ii) increasing the nutritional
standards of the poor; and (iii) shifting away from producer price and trade intervention as an
instrument of food consumption policy.
1.29   Other elements of Bank strategy for agricultuie and rural development included: (i) a
Decentralization and Regional Development project that supported rural infrastructure in the four
poorest states (FY91); (ii) an irrigation and drainage se, tor loan (IDSP, FY92) supporting
rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems, completioi )f unfinished projects, and initiation of a few
high-payoff additions to the irrig,ation system; and (iii) an agricultural technology operation to support
research and extension (FY92). Agricultural environmental issues have been dealt with in several
operations. For example, the agricultural technology operation was a major component in support of
soil conservation, research and extension, and the Irrigtion and Drainage Sector Project addressed
water use efficiency and salinity issues.
1.30   AGSAL I had already initiated a set of reforms in the agricultural sector. Its detailed policy
objectives were to: (i) remove global consumer subsidies and target remaining subsidies to the needy;
(ii) eliminate much of the public intervention in setting producer and consumer prices (except maize
and beans, by far the most important crops in Mexico); (iii) reduce the role of parastatals in
marketing, storage, and processing; (iv) liberalize agricultural trade; (v) reduce subsidies to
agricultural inputs; (vi) achieve a larger and more efficient public investment program in agriculture;
and (vii) decentralize and reduce the size of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources
(SARH).
1.31   In the area of food consumption and nutrition policy, AGSAL I supported the gradual shift
from general to targeted food subsidies and sponsored an evaluation of food and nutrition policies and
programs in Mexico. This evaluation led to selected but isolated reforms ' l food and nutrition
programs and policies. The Bank continued the dialogue more broadly during the preparation of
AGSAL II, aiming at the definition of a fully coherent food consumption and nutrition strategy which
addressed nutrition problems, especially in rural areas. In this context, th,, Government carried out a
pilot program to evaluate the feasibility and mechanisms of a health-based nutrition program that
would combine health services and nutrition educatioh With food entitlement. The health and nutrition
program required strengthening the basic health system, which the Bank supported through a Basic
Health Care Project (FY91).
1.32   Before AGSAL II Board presentation, the Government had already exceeded AGSAL I
conditions in price and trade reforms and in the reduction of agticultural parastatals. The strength of
the ongoing programs and the record of past actions provided the rationale for continued Bank
support of agricultural sector adjustment. AGSAL II was a natural follow-up of AGSAL 1, Trade
Policy Loan (TPL) I and TPL II, and the Industrial Sk :,or Policy Loan supporting trade liberalization,
elimination of regulations, and price liberalization and   Iso had strong tie:. to the Fertilizer Adjustment
Loan, and the Basic Health Care Project.

b. Project Objectives
1.33   The AGSAL II was part of a program of Bank support to the Government's continuing
objectives of increasing the rate of growth of agriculture and of reducing poverty. These objectives
were to be achieved through raising productivity and improving efficiency through better-functioning
output and input markets, and through food programs targeted to poor consumers.
1.34   The specific objectives of this operation, as stated in [para. 137 of] the President's Report
were to:
(a)    Implement trade and policy reforms that increase competition and reduce the
Government's role in the production, planning, marketing, storage, and processing of
agricultural products and inputs and by allowing more competition from the private
sector.
(b)    Revision in the allocation of government expenditure in consumer programs by
eliminating generalized food subsidies and increasing spending for improved targeted
assistance and nutrition programs.
(c)    The institutional transition of SARH to a smaller but more effective role in
agriculture, emphasizing policy formulation and implementation and basic regulatory
functions.
c. Project Description
1.35   The program included measures to reform the price and trade policy regime for agricultural
products and their industrial derivatives, abolish the system of mandatory production planning for
agricultural products, reduce and streamline market regulations and barriers to entry and competition,
and make food consumption and nutrition programs more cost effective and successful by increasing
coverage and improving targeting of the poorer population.
1.36   The loan's objectives [as stated in the policy matrix of President's report, also reported below
in Part III, Table 7] were to be achieved through the following steps:
(a)    (i) Liberalizing consumer and producer prices of agricultural commodities and their
industrial derivatives; (ii) reducing general food price subsidies; (iii) reducing
regulation; (iv) eliminating regulations on feedstuffs, seed, machinery and pesticide
markets; (v) designing and enforcing a regulatory system for pesticide, plant
protection and animal health based strictly on quality control, health, phytosanitary,
epidemiological and environmental protection grounds; and (vi) dismantling the
parastatal apparatus for market intervention as the price and trade policy was
rationalized.
(b)    (i) Improving effectiveness of nutrition and primary health programs by fully
exploiting complementarity; and (ii) eliminating consumer price controls as the main
food policy instrument.



11
(c)   (i) Improving the allocative efficiency of public expenditure in agriculture;
(ii) increasing investment in appropriate public road. (infrastructure, research, and
extension); and (iii) dismantling SARH's production targets.
d. Cofinancing
1.37   The Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) collaborated closely in the
preparation, implementation, and supervision of AGSAL II. The IDB cofinanced the program with a
loan of US$200 million with identical conditions as the Bank loan.
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
1.38  Implementation of the US$400 million loan was initially satisfactory. The loan was approved
on June 25, 1991, signed on June 26, 1991 and becamr. effective on December 20, 1991. The first
tranche of US$200 million was filly disbursed on Jani ry 22, 1992. The second tranche of another
US$200 was expected to be distursed in August 1992, lout was delayed by negotiation of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and prepar;tion of PROCAMPO. There was a long delay
in compliance with some second tranche conditions. This was first occasioned by the Government's
imposition of agreed prices (precios de concertacion) for sorghum, rice, and soybeans (see para.
1.52); by the preparation of PROCAMPO and NAFTA and, later, by the Government's delay in
preparing action plans for its food and nutrition policy (see para. 1.84).
1.39   The negotiation of NAFTA among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico is a major event in the
recent economic history of Mexico.6 Although NAFTA did not become effective until January 1,
1994, decisions taken by the Government in the last two years were contingent on the treaty's entry
into force and affected implementation of agricultural policy, including measures related to AGSAL
HI
1.40   On October 4, 1993, President Salinas announced a new domestic income support program.
The Tiew program, named PROCAMPO (Programa Nacional de Modernizacion del Campo), is market
oriented, does not to distort international trade, provides needed income support to subsistence
farmers, and is consistent with the NAFTA and the Uruguay Round AgreLMent. Therefore, it is
necessary to elaborate fitst on PROCAMPO and NAFTA even though the -vents took place at the end
of AGSAL 11 implementation.
A. NAFTA AND PROCAMPO
a. INAFTA
1.41   NAFTA eliminates most trade barriers among the three treaty countries. Upon effectiveness
of NAFTA, the U.S. and Canada immediately liberalized 79 and 84 percent of the tariff codes while
6.    Negotiations on NAFTA started in 1990, the S reement was signed by the governments of
Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. on November ., 1992; it was ratified by the U.S. congress in
November 1993.



12
Mexico liberalized 42 percent of the codes. The remainder of merchandize trade will be liberalized in
up to 5 years (e.g., car parts), 10 years (e.g., textiles), or 15 years (e.g., some agricultural products).
1.42   NAFTA will have major implications for the agricultural sector, as protection of basic grains,
in particular maize, will be phased out and crops such as fruits and vegetables will receive greater
access the U.S. markets. Table 3 gives a general classification of the pre-NAFTA QRs (quantitative
restrictions) and tariffs as well as the NAFTA terms for 12 crops. With the exception of maize,
beans, and barley, there is no quota under NAFTA. There is a ten-year gradual elimination of tariffs
for most crops, while for maize and beans the elimination period is 15 years. Negotiation of NAFTA
affected implementation of AGSAL 11 in several key conditions.
(a)    Food grains. Studies of NAFTA's expected effects showed that the United States
would gain from Mexican market liberalization in maize, wheat, sorghum, and barley.
Mexico sought to use its market power over imports of those commodities to its
advantage in the NAFTA negotiations by bargaining over the rate of liberalization of
those commodities.
(b)    Powdered milk. A second tranche condition was elimination of import permits on
powdered milk. Mexico is a leading importer of this commodity and wanted to use
its market power in the NAFTA negotiations. Accordingly, it delayed compliance
with the second tranche condition until NAFTA negotiations were completed and
NAFTA was ratified by the United States Congress (see para. 1.58).
(c)    Sugar. Mexico sought greater access to the (heavily protected) US sugar market.
The uncertainty over the price terms of that access affected development of a sugar
policy and delayed compliance with second tranche conditions (see para. 1.52) as US
sugar producers in trying to exclude Mexican sugar, introduced major uncertainty in
Mexican policy.
b. PROCAMPO
1.43   PROCAMPO will replace Mexico's current farm price schemes, which fix prices for certain
commodities and provide income delinked from output. Domestic prices will be aligned with world
prices. Direct income support payments will be made to eligible producers independently of what
they produce. Under PROCAMPO, Mexico's farm trade policies will be more liberal than those of
most agricultural exporters.
1.44   PROCAMPO will grant direct income support payments to farmers who produce maize.
soybeans, dry beans, sorghum, wheat, rice, cotton, barley, and safflower. Payment levels will be
fixed in real terms for ten years and will be phased out in years II through 15. All these products
benefit at present from government support programs. Farmers who did not plant those crops in the
three years before December 1992 will not be eligible for PROCAMPO payments. Payments will be
granted on a per hectare basis; the eligible area will be calculated as the average of the areas planted
with eligible crops in the previous three years to December 1992.

1.45   Full implementation of PROCAMPO will take place beginning on April 1, 1995. From
October 1, 1993 to April 1, 1995, a transition plan will make a list of eligible producers and prepare
the administration of the payments. During the transition, a payment per hectare will given for
maize, dry beans, wheat, soybeans, rice, cotton, and sorghum. The Autumn/Winter 1993-94 support
will be N$330 per hectare; the Spring/Summer support will be N$350 per hectare; in Autumn/Winter
1994-95 and thereafter full payments will be granted while producer prices will be aligned to world
prices. The per hectare support will be the same regardless of the type of crop that the producer
grew in the past. Table 4 gives the 1992 status as well as the Fall/Winter 1993/94 and

1993.1
1.46   PROCAMPO meets the NAFTA goal of domestic support measures that have minimal or no
distorting effects and are exempt from domestic support reduction commitments that may be
negotiated under GATT. PROCAMPO's non trade distorting direct payments to producers are
consistent with the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and the Blair House Agreement on
agriculture which was reached between the United States and the European Community in 1993, ani
in fact go beyond the NAFTA terms. Subsistence farmers, who consume most of their crop
production, have not benefitted from guarantee prices for crops that are marketed. Under
PROCAMPO, subsistence farmers will receive income support while at the same time they will
consume maize, wheat, and beans at lower prices than they used to. Therefore, PROCAMPO has a
positive income redistribution effect.



15
SARH staff were deeply involved in preparing PROCAMPO throughout the implementation of
AGSAL II. While PROCAMPO goes beyond the terms of AGSAL II in terms of trade liberalization,
it delayed resolution of issues affecting compliance with second tranche by concentrating the attention
of the most knowledgeable government staff on PROCAMPO (see para. 1.106 on Borrower's
performance).
B. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH COMPONENT
a. Output Price Policy
1.47   Much of the loan's conditionality was related to output price, . The preparation and
negotiation of the maize price terms was especially complex because of maize's importance in total
agricultural production-it is by far the most important single crop in terms of area, physical output,
and value of output-ana because of the Government's insistence that it would not risk lowering
producer prices of maize to world levels because of the effect on producer incomes and rural poverty.
A similar agreement was made for beans, which is the second most important crop in area harvested.
1.48   Given the Bank's and Mexico's objective to align producer prices with world prices
throughout the period of the operation, the loan was eventually negotiated with simple effectiveness
conditions ard with stringent second tranche conditions. Effectiveness conditions were:
(a)    Elimination of import permits for green coffee by September 30, 1991.
(b)    Issuance of a decree modifying cane payment arrangements.
(c)    Elimination of export tax for raw cotton, cotton fiber, and swine for breeding.
(d)    Elimination of export permit for wheat, sorghum, feedstuffs, soybean, barley, copra,
cartamo, cartamo oil, cottonseed, tobacco, and eggs.
(e)    Presentation of a study identifying processes, legislation, and regulations that give
SARH and other Government entities the power to establish, coordinate, and enforce
crop production targets.
1.49   The second tranche conditions regarding output prices (as described in the Guarantee
Agreement) were as follows.7
1.50   The Government agreed not to increase, in real dollar terms, the guarantee price for maize
above the level set for the 1990 Autumn/Winter crop cycle for 1990/91. The guarantee price of
maize (in real 1992 US dollar terms) at second tranche release was US$190 while the equivalent real
U.S. dollar value for the Autumn/Winter cycle of 1990/91 was US$231.8
7.    Table 4 of Part III reports the compliance with loan conditions.
8.    While this condition was met, the nominal protection to maize was high during the operation
and induced a significant supply response into that crop, notably in the most productive
irrigated areas of the north.



16
1.51   The Government agreed not to increase the nominal protection of wheat above the level
existing at May 1, 1991. The nominal protection of wheat did not exceed its May 1, 1991 level of
1.44 throughout implementation and was 1. 19 at loan closing. However, ASERCA9 provided
marketing support to wheat producers in the amount of N$250/mt for 1990 the agreed price
mechanism (precios de concertacion, para 1.52). Taking into account this marketing' support, the
1992 NPC rises to 1.88.10
1.52   Agreed prices. The Government and the Bank agreed at negotiations to exclude governrrent
intervention in commodity pricing. The Government subsequently implemented agreed prices with
growers and millers of sorghum (of Tamaulipas state only), barley, and rice in which specific
payments were per ton of output to support producer prices.
1.53   The Government would not increase, in real dollar terms, the domestic price of refined sugar
above the level existing on January 1, 1991. The consumer price of refined sugar was US$0.59/kg in
January 1991 and has since varied between a maximum of US$0.58 and a minimum of US$0.56.
This condition was met, but has been superseded by the NAFTA terms which will eventually allow
higher Mexican producer prices for sugar.
1.54   The Government agreed not to increase the nominal price of barley for the period June 1,
1991 to January 31, 1992 above the level of 680 pesos per ton; and to set the nominal price of barley
for the period February 1, 1992 to January 31, 1993 at a level not to exceed 714 pesos per ton. This
condition was met throughout implementation and the price of barley at loan closing was 685 pesos
per ton.
1.55   The Government agreed to make flexible the consumer prices of cookies, pasta, edible oils,
cigarettes, eggs, dairy products, and beef. These commodities have been completely liberalized, as
stated in a communication from SECOFI to the Bank of December 14, 1992. The Government
further agreed not to interfere in the prices of tobacco products. The tobacco parastatal, TABAMEX,
was liquidated by Presidential decree on October 9, 1990, thereby ending government interference in
tobacco prices.
b. Agricultural Trade Regime and Market Regulations
1.56   Prior to effectiveness, the Government had agreed to [para 56, President's Report]: (a) issue
a decree modifying cane payment arrangements; (b) eliminate export permits for wheat, sorghum,
feedstuffs, barley, soybean, copra, safflower, cotton seed, tobacco, eggs, coffee, rice, sesame,
sunflower, vegetable oil, beef, and live cattle; (c) eliminate export taxes for raw cotton, cotton fibre,
and swine for breeding; and (d) present to the Bank a study identifying processes, legislation and
regulations that give SARH and other government entities the power to establish, coordinate, and
9.     ASERCA (Apoyos y Servicios a la Comercializacion Agricola), created in 1991, is a
decentralized agency of SARH with the mandate to take the necessary measures to adopt
agricultural marketing to the new economic environment of liberalized prices.
10.    While this condition was successful in one sense it was not sufficiently broad to prevent the
Government from providing other support to wheat production that had the same effect as
raising the nominal rate of protection through a direct price support (see para. 1. 1 11(d)).



17
enforce crop production targets. Upon effectiveness, the Government had: (a) issued a decree that
modified the cane payment arrangements; (b) eliminated export permits for the products; and
(c) eliminated export taxes for the products. The crop production targets are mentioned in paras
1.66-1.68.
1.57   The second tranche conditions for the agricultural trade component were as follows.
1.58   Milk trade. The Government agreed to implement a system to eliminate CONASUPO's
monopoly on imports of powdered milk and to allocate import permits for powdered milk on a
transparent, competitive, and efficient basis. *rhe Government eventually met this condition by
issuing a directive to eliminate it for the 1995 supplies. The powdered milk import system, as stated
in a letter from SHCP of December 6, 1993 to the Bank (Oficio No. 393.11I.3-558) assigns import
quantities through competitive auction to the private sector and eliminates CONASUPO's import
monopoly. The long delay in complying with this condition was due to its implications for the
NAFTA negotiations." The Government eliminated export peimits for fluid milk (Diario Oficial of
July 15, 1992) and for powdered milk (Diario Oficio No. 13736 of October 22, 1993).
1.59   Sugar policy. The Gov -rnment agreed to app  ve a new sugar policy. The Government's
sugar policy now includes:'2 (ai a new Cane Decree aliowing flexible price determination between
cane, growers and( mills and individual price determination beginning in the 1994/95 harvest season;
(b) reforming the social security system of the cane sector to put it on a sounder and equitable basis;
(c) cteating a spot market in sugar to allow more timely price information to producers; (d) closing
unprofitable sugar mills; and (e) restructuring the debt of viable sugar mills. These changes were to
have occurred after the privatization of all government mills in 1989, but have not yet been fully
implemented.
1.60   The privatization of the sugar mills in 1989 and other reforms, eliminated much of the
government interference and established the basis for an independent and financially viable sugar
industry. However, substantial problems, however, with the sugar industry held up the
implementation of this sub-component. One problem was that of the non-viable mills which, despite
having been privatized, mainitained large Government commitments in the form of loan guarantees for
the money used to buy some of the mills. There was also substantial opposition from labor to closing
some of the unprofitable tiills. The Governnment, throughout the period of AGSAL II, was unwilling
to close such mills as long as there was the cliance of saving them with hildier sugarcane prices
resulting from better access to the US market under NAFTA. Therefore, (lhe AGSAL II condition to
approve a new sugar policy, while it was a major impr( vement over the policy before 1989, was
overtaken by NAFTA terms.
1.61   The Government passed the National Seed Law on July 15, 1991, thus removing all
restrictions on private sector competition with PRONASE, eliminating PRONASE's monopoly of
germplasm produced by INIFAP and also eliminating plant breeding restrictions by the private sector.
The initial effects of the revised Seed Law have been to generate increased revenue to the national
11.    Mexico was further committed, under the terms of its GATT membership, to import
substantial quantities of powdered milk. This affected the feasibility of eliminating
CONASUPO's monopoly by making it necessary to assume a minimum level of imports.

research system from sales of its materials to the private sector, to induce greater use of commercial
plant cultivars, and to expand private sector development of improved cultivars. This condition was
successfully linked to previous sector work and to the Agricultural Technology Project, which
provided resources to INIFAP for foundation sector production.'3
1.62   Beans. The Government was to prepare an action plan for a new trade and price policy based
upon a study of the edible beans market. The policy at the time of negotiations was a high guarantee
price, CONASUPO purchasing beans and an import permit procedure that effectively excluded beans
imports. A study showed that Mexican bean guarantee prices were well above both import parity
prices and representative domestic costs of production.'4 It concluded that while not all Mexican
bean producers would be competitive at world prices, and while imports would grow under free
trade, there was nevertheless a margin for some growers to be competitive at world prices.
1.63   The Government will implement a bean policy based on Procampo that goes beyond what it
was committed to do under AGSAL II and NAFTA. The new policy is a major advance toward
greater efficiency because it will reduce the producer price to import parity levels. The new policy
provides important benefits to poor consumers who rely on beans as a source of protein because the
consumer price of beans will fall significantly. While the policy harms marginal bean producers who
will not be competitive under free trade, the additional income transfers provided by Procampo will
compensate them to some degree.
1.64   The policy dialogue with the Government on beans was difficult for two reasons. First, there
was no clear official position on objectives for been producers. The first draft of the study was
rejected by the Government; the Government did little to build an internal consensus about what the
new policy should be, even when the final study was completed. Though the Government recognized
the untenable nature of the high guarantee price, it could do nothing specific about reducing support
to beans until the overall changes in PROCAMPO were completed. Second, the thin international
market in beans made it difficult to estimate clear costs and benefits of policy as could be done for
maize, wheat, rice, and coffee, for example, thereby permitting the Government to minimize the
economic cost of its bean policy.
1.65   Pesticides. The Government was to prepare an action plan based upon studies of pesticides
to: (i) diagnose current usage; (ii) assess the current legal and institutional framework; (iii) streamline
procedures to promote competition between producers and distributors; and (iv) establish guidelines to
reach minimum standards on health, environmental issues and quality control enforcement; and of the
regulation, organization, and procedures of the system of plant protection and animal health and the
elaboration of a proposal to modernize the system and streamline its procedures. An international
consulting firm completed the study of plant and animal health protection.'5 The rules and
regulations proposed in the action plan were based strictly on quality control, health, epidemiological,

phytosanitary, and environmental protection grounds. The Government's plans for its animal and
plant health inspection services, which will he implemented over time as they are closely related to
NAFTA, will develop a more efficient and decentralized service that will protect consumers' interests,
while avoiding the risks of corruption and excessive bureaucracy. Implementation of this condition
was severely hampered by lack of institutional coordination within SARH.
c. SARH's Production Targets
1.66   SARH's production targets were for nriany years a cornerstone of Mexican agricultural policy.
The targel:s were used to "guide" resource allocation at the farm level, especially toward maize,
wheat, rice, and beans. Subsidized credit, fertilizers, and farm machinery encouraged farmers to
produce the selected commodities as determined by the targets. Allocation and delivery of water for
those crops was agreed upon between producers and government authorities. Extension efforts of
SARH and BANRURAL (Banco Nacional de Credito Rural), and FIRA (Fideicomisos Instituidos en
Relacion con la Agricultura) concentrated oh the targe :rops, which were not always the ones with
the highest profitability. The Aw. ste inherent in this sy i.m was not clearly a constraint to production
as long as irrigated land and oth.r resources vwere exp~. ding rapidly. Yet as resource growth
declined, the constraints imposed by the system became more apparent. Therefore, elimination of the
targets was a true step toward greater allocative efficiency and move to a market economy.
1.67   During preparation, the Bank considered that it would be possible to eliminate the production
targets by a simple administrative action. The Government argued that this was not possible without
knowing the legal basis of the production targets. Accordingly, an effectiveness condition was
establislied to determine the legal basis of the targets. This was complied with on September 30,
1991.
1.68   As a condition of second tranche release, the Government was to eliminate the production
targets. A letter (Oficio Circulair No. 212.92-763) from the Directorate General for Agricultural and
Forestry Studies (DGESAF) of the SARH to the Rural Development Districts officially eliminating
production targets was sent on September 29, 1992, thus meeting the second tranche release
condition. Field visits to Rural Development Districts, as part of supervision of other projects,
showed, in some instances, that local extension officers were unaware of th.e specific policy change
though they did know of the general reduction of government involvement iii agricultural production
and marketing. The specific lesson here is to have mace the action plan ft,r eliminating the targets
more comprehensive.
d. Credit and Input Subsidies
1.69   Credit. Total input and credit subsidies in 1988 amounted to US$2. 1 billion, four times the
public investment budget in agriculture. Compressing these subsidies would allow higher public
agricultural investment and lower overall public expenditures. With respect to credit, the Government
had already taken major actions to restructure the rural financial subsector. Many of the reforms
affected the National Bank for Agricultural Credit, BANRURAL (Banco Nacional de Credito Rural,
S.N.C.). Its staff was cut by more than 50 percent, 60 percent of its branches were closed, and its
portfolio was cleaned up of nonperforming loans. The Government's furzher subsidies on interest
rates on loans through the development banks are generally aligned with market rates. The
Government now lends funds to the development bank:, at a rate close to market rates, rather than



20
simply making capital contributions to them. In 1990 it liquidated the National Crop and Livestock
Insurance Agency (ANAGSA).
1.70   Seed policy. The Mexican seed industry before 1989 was dominated by a parastatal,
PRONASE, that held a partial monopoly over seed commnercialization and received substantial public
subsidies and legal protection from competition. This reduced the quantity and quality of improved
cultivars available to Mexican farmers.'6 The objective of the loan with regard to seed production
was to make the industry more competitive and thereby to better the materials available in Mexico.
Second tranche conditions affecting seed use were to eliminate: (a) all restrictions on private sector
competition with PRONASE; (b) PRONASE's monopoly of germplasm produced by INIFAP; and (c)
restrictions or limitations on plant breeding by the private sector. The Government complied with
this condition in passing the revised National Seed Law on July 15, 1991 which eliminated the items
listed above.
1.71   Other Inputs. Since 1991 fertilizer prices have been increasing much faster thati the
timetable agreed under the Fertilizer Sector Adjustment Loan (Loan 2918-ME) and are nlow above
world levels. For example, in 1992 domestic fertilizer prices were 15 percent higher than their
international parity (Project Completion Report, Fertilizer Sector Adjustment Loan, November 16.
1993, p. 49). Low electricity tariffs charged to farmers for operating irrigation pumps was a major
subsidy for agricultural production. The Federal Electricity Commission, CFE (Comision Federal de
Electricidad) had estimated that in 1988 electricity for irrigation and for corn mills was sold at a ratio
of price to long-run-marginal-cost of 0.26 and 0.21 respectively. Between the beginning of 1989 and
the beginning of 1991, real electricity rates were increased by 72 percent. Other reforms in
irrigation-transferring irrigation districts to users associations; greater cost-recovery for capital,
operations, and maintenance; imposing stiffer economic and environmental criteria on public
investments; creating a better legal and institutional basis for water markets-were supported by the
Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project (IDSP), not in either of the sector adjustment loans, because of
their closer linkages to investments financed under the IDSP.
1.72   Upon effectiveness, input licenses for new agricultural machinery was already abolished while
tractor prices were freely determined by the market. Second tranche release conditions required that
the Government maintain a policy of allowing prices of pesticides to be freely determined by the
market. The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to allowing pesticide prices to be freely
determined by the market.
C. FOOD CONSUMPTION AND NUTRITION COMPONENT
1.73   Mexican food policy sought to keep producer prices high to stimulate domestic production and
to keep consumer prices low to protect real consumer income. As a consequence, food consumption
policy was not independent of price and trade policy and incurred large fiscal outlays that were not
cost effective in fighting malnutrition. According to nutrition surveys in 1988, malnutrition among
children under five years old ranged from a low of 13.9 to a high of 22.3 percent (deperding on the
way malnutrition is measured). Studies by PRONASOL (Programa Nacional de Solidaridad) indicate
that in 1988 approximately 41 million people lived under poverty conditions.
16.    See World Bank, Mexico - Agricultural Technology Sector Review, Report No. 9297-ME,
August 20, 1992.



21
1.74   Past consumer price policies did not effectively address food consumption and nutritional
object.ves. The rural poor received only minimal benefits from the programs despite the extensive
poverty and malnutrition in rural areas. Furthermore, targeted food consumption programs did not
take advantage of the proven complementarity among primary health services, nutrition, and nutrition
education. Programs were fragmented and used different targeting criteria.
1.75   There were fr,ur categories of targeted food and nutrition interventions in 1989, executed
through 13 programs administered by seven institutions, covering urban and rural populations, high-
risk groups, and consumer education. The most important were the Tortibono" program; the
LICONSA social supply of milk (Abasto Social de Leche), the alimentary assistance program, DIF
(Desarrollo Integral de la Familia), which covers several direct food transfer programs; and the
DICONSA rural retail food sale program."
1.76   The main defects of the programs identified during project preparation were:
(a)    Program participation in rural areas, where most of the poor live, was very low (less
than 2 percent of the population), except for the DICONSA rural retail program,
which co wered almost all the rural population. Most of the program's beneficiaries
were concentrated in urban centers, especially in Mexico City.
(b)    Although there are some state programs which provide high coverage, the coverage of
the target population was low even in urban areas. The Government has since
expanded to 2 million families the Tortivales program in the urban areas, covering
approximately 6 million people.
(c)    The tortibonos and LICONSA programs were (i) insufficiently targeted as families
above poverty line have been eligible and (ii) uncoordinated and based on different
eligibility criteria.
(d)    Nutritionally, the programs were not efficient because they did not combine the
provision of food with the provision of health services and nutrition education.
(e)    Milk and tortillas do not provide a nutritionally balanced or cost-effective diet.
1.77   The purpose of the food and nutrition component of AGSAL II was to make: (i) agricultural
policy fully independent of food consumption policy and (ii) poverty alleviation programs more cost
effective by increasing coverage in rural areas and improving targeting of the poorer population.
17.    Tortibonos are coupons issued to consumers allowing them to purchase tortillas (maize cakes)
at subsidized prices. In November 1990, the tortibonos program was replaced by the
tortivales program [see Annex 6, President's Report].
18.    LICONSA is the milk producing and distributing affiliate of CONASUPO while DICONSA is
the retail affiliate of CONASUPO. Since 1984 there had been a steady increase in targeted
food subsidies, mainly for maize tortillas and milk. As world milk prices have increased and
coverage of the programs has expanded in urban areas, the cost of these targeted subsidies
reached about 0.175 percent of GDP in 1990.



22
a. Pilot Nutrition and Health Project
1.78   Although during preparation and negotiations, there were some differences between the Bank
and the Government about the scope and location of the health and nutrition actions, it was finally
agreed that the Government would implement a pilot health and nutrition program in the poorest
states.
1.79   The pilot nutrition and health project followed the basic design of the nutrition and health
programs implemented by the Health Ministry. The main objectives of the pilot project were: (i) to
provide food assistance to around 45,000 rural families in the states of Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, San
Louis Potosi (the Ixtlera zone), and Mexico (the Otomi-Mazahua zone); and (ii) to test different
methods for operating a nutrition and health program. The program provided information on which
to base a national nutrition and health program. The localities were selected on the basis of their
extreme poverty, adverse climatic conditions, poor natural resource endowment, poor health
infrastructure at household level and high degree of malnutrition among children under five years.
For equity reasons, the pilot project was supposed to extend the benefits of poverty alleviation
programs to those localities not covered by existing programs.
1.80   The main purpose of the pilot project was to test means for an expanded nutrition and health
program. Its targetpopulation was the low-income families at risk of malnutrition; including
pregnant and lactating mothers or children under the age of five (estimated at 3.6 million families).
The pilot program sought to:
(a)    reduce maternal and child mortality, prevent and treat malnutrition, and promote a
better growth and development of the target population;
(b)    determine and test the most adequate institutional arrangements and staffing to
implement the nutrition and health program;
(c)    determine procedures for (i) selecting and identifying beneficiaries; (ii) providing
entitlement to food baskets; (iii) redeeming entitlement; and (iv) transporting and
storing food baskets;
(d)    test information, supervision, accounting, and auditing systems and performance of
the responsible units;
(e)    evaluate the effectiveness of the various nutrition and income-support interventions;
(f)    analyze the technical, administrative, and financial feasibility of the project; and
(g)    prepare a detailed estimate of the cost of an expanded program for participating
institutions.
1.81   Given the time needed to run the pilot program, implementation of this component of the loan
had two phases. First, the Government was to implement the program in the pilot areas and, at the
same time, contract for the evaluation.
1.82   A significant difficulty during implementation of this component was the disappearance of the
Ministry of Budget and Planning (SPP) in 1992 which had been the executing agency of the pilot



23
program. Although SHCP was the successor of SPP, there were lengthy disputes among SHCP,
SEDESOL, and the Ministry of Health about which would succeed SPP in implementation of the
nutrition and health component of the project. 'The failure to resolve this disagreement slowed the
evaluation of the pilot program and the preparation of the required action plans.
1.83   A condition of second tranche was a satisfactory evaluation of the pilot project. The
evaluation of the pil(t project (ITAM/CONAL/SOLIDARIDAD, "Evaluacion del proyecto piloto de
nutricion alimentacion y salud", January 30, 1993) was satisfactory. The study found that while
significant increases in nutritional levels for children under the age of five were achieved in Otomi-
Mazahua zone (state of Nuevo Leon), this was not the case in Ixtlera zone (state of Mexico). In
Otomi-Mazahua the increase in the percentage classed as having normal weight for age was from 54
percent (beforc the project) to 72 percent (after the project); in Ixtlera the corresponding increase was
from 62 percent (before the project) to 68 percent (after the project). In both zones the project
seemed to have improved the nutrition of girls more than the boys. The impact on the nutrition of
pregnant ncnd lactating women was very small. In terms of health impact, there was a marked
reduction in diarrheal diseases among children under the age of two in Otomi-Mazahua. There were
important positive effects on family planning and vaccination.
1.84   Although the specific results of the ITAM/CONAL/SOLIDARIDAD study had to be
interpreted cautiously as no extensive statistical analysis was carried out, they were of good quality
and consistent with the agreed terms of reference for the study. The evaluation showed, most
importantly, that operations like the pilot project could establish a successful precedent in poor rural
areas which had formerly been outside the Government's food and nutrition policy. Considering the
short length of time of the pilot test, the results concerning the nutritional status of the target groups
should be viewed as significantly positive.
1.85   A further condition of second tranche release was the preparation of action plans for food and
nutrition for 1993 and 1994 based on the evaluations of the pilot program and of the tortilla and milk
studies. The Government was very slow in following up on those evaluation. There were long delays
in completing the studies, between December, 1992, when drafts were finished, and November, 1993
when they were officially presented to the Bank, necessitated by minor comments made by concerned
Ministries. The preparation of the action plans were delayed, as a result, and the actions taken in
1993-94, while complying with the condition, have had less impact than they might have had in
meeting the objective of the component.
b. Food Consumption Policy
1.86   CONASUPO subsidized maize tortilla processors such that their prices were below both world
and domestic price equivalents, therefore granting urban consumers untargeted maize subsidies.
Producers of maize, about half of whom were principally net buyers of maize, received subsidies, but
paid essentially the producer price. Since 1988, the objective of policy was to reduce the untargeted
subsidies to urban consumers, and to replace them with targeted distribution of maize to poor
consumers. In the urban areas the Tortivales program provided one kg of tortillas per day, free of
charge, to 2.1 million poor families. In the rural areas the Government subsidized maize
consumption through DICONSA stores.
1.87   The Government recently proceeded to deregulate the maize-tortilla chain, to simplify the
complex structure of prices and subsidies stretching from the production of maize (see PROCAMPO,



24
para. 1.43) to the consumption of tortilla, and to reduce the budgetary cost of its maize policy. It
therefore raised consumer prices of maize and tortillas to nearly the costs of CONASUPO of
acquiring, handling and processing maize, thus raising consumer prices above their international
equivalent. Only in Mexico City is the price of tortillas slightly below the international equivalent;
elsewhere it is above. The new price policy therefore amounts to a regressive consumer tax which
falls mainly onto rural consumers and urban consumers outside Mexico City, and which benefits
producers.
1.88   Without maintaining the large and inefficient CONASUPO purchase and sales apparatus for
maize, the only way that the consumer tax could be eliminated was by reforming producer price
policy which is being done under PROCAMPO (paras 1.43 to 1.46). In the meantime it made little
sense to greatly increase or further target the existing maize subsidy program through the DICONSA
stores, but rather just maintain it in its present form as a temporary and imperfect palliative.
Therefore, in rural areas, DICONSA used its maize programs to alleviate the impact on rural
consumers of producer protection.
1.89   The tortilla evaluation study (Technomic Consultants International, "Evaluacion de la
Situacion Alimentaria en Mexico: Tortilla Solidaridad", September 1993) found that the program
reached a significant fraction of the nutritionally at-risk population at an acceptable fiscal cost. The
Government has recently taken measures, based on the results of the study, to improve the targeting
of the Tortivales program to the poor. Upon expansion of the nutrition and health program, the
maize and maize flour programs could eventually be phased out in those rural areas covered by
nutrition and health programs.
1.90   The powdered milk evaluation study (Technomic Consultants International, "Evaluacion de la
situacion Alimentaria en Mexico: Programa de Abasto Social de Leche en Polvo", October 25, 1993)
found malnutrition to be a serious problem, but noted no statistically significant effect of powdered
milk distribution. The fluid milk evaluation study (Technomic Consultants International, "Evaluacion
de la Situacion Alimentaria en Mexico: Programa de Abasto Social de Leche Fluida", October 22,
1993) found that the program had clearly positive effects on the protein consumption of children, of
poor families. The evaluation recommended measures to target the program more closely to the poor,
while complementing it with public nutrition education efforts. However, one has to take into
consideration the fact that the milk study had serious shortcomings.
D. MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK
1.91   With the exception of the exchange rate, macroeconomic policy was consistent with AGSAL
11. During implementation of AGSAL II, Mexico has reduced inflation, public debt, and the role of
the public sector in general. The overall price stability associated with the reforms, and the decisive
moves toward reducing public interference in the economy, have provided a consistent and supportive
macroeconomic framework. The agricultural sector has received significant benefits from the fall in
real domestic interest rates.
1.92   A major concern arising from the macroeconomic framework has been the real appreciation of
the peso. Because a large share of agricultural production is tradeable, this peso appreciation harmed
agriculture during the implementation of the Loan. The renewal of the PACTO in October 1992
included measures to allow for more flexibility in the exchange rate. The main measure was to widen



25
the band within which the peso moves. The measure to make the peso's adjustment more flexible is a
major improvement in the overall macroeconomic framework for agriculture as shown recently.
5. OVERALL EVALUATION OF THE LOAN
a. Impact of Reforms
1.93   The main problems of Mexican agriculture in the last two decades were government
intervention through price, trade, and regulatory restrictions and the decline in productive public
investment. In the mid-1980s the Government began a serious attempt to reform the entire economy.
The reforms were extended to the agricultural sector and began to end interventions that had
hampered sectoral growth. Against this background of strong government commitment to overall
economic and sectoral reform, an important benefit of AGSAL 11 (as well as AGSAL I) was to
support a productive sectoral policy dialogue between the Bank and the Govermnent which helped to
identify the main costs of public intervention.
1.94   It is too soon to make q, fntitative as:.'.tssments f the impact of reforms on long-term growth
and income distribution. The mi.in reason is that most f the reforms occurred at a time of fiscal and
monetary restriction when stabilization took priority over growth. The appreciation of the real
exchange rate adversely affected the growth of the agricultural sector. With the recent flexibilization
of the exchange rate such adverse effects on growth are expected to decline. There has been revival
of sectoral growth from 0.2 percent annually in 1977-82 to 2.0 percent in 1983-88, to 6.3 percent in
1989-92. The real value of agricultural exports was quite variable, growing at -1.5, 16.1, and -5.2
perceht respectively during the same periods.
1.95   Public investment in agriculture did not recover in the period of the operation. Real irrigation
investments, the most important category, fell from an annual average of N$6,495 million equivalent
in 1977-82 to an annual average of N$2,303 million equivalent in 1983-87 and to an annual average
N$1,l067 equivalent in 1989-92, with corresponding annual rates of growth of irrigated areas of 2.3,
1.7, and -0.3 percent. Public spending on agricultural research was 0.46 percent of agricultural GDP
in 1983-88 and 0.27 percent in 1989-92 (World Bank, Mexico - Agricultutal Sector Memo, Tables
2.1 and 4.1). Therefore, the two agricultural sector adjustment operations were not associated with
rising public investment in irrigation and research, which have been import- nt sources of past growth.
1.96   AGSAL I and AGSAL 11 were implemented in a period of falling  rofitability for
commodities-maize, wheat, beans, and sorghum-that cover much of the planted area. An
econometric study of the 1960-92 period revealed a structural decline in profitability of the
agricultural sector over the 1985-92 period when compared to the 1960-84 period. Such decline in
profitability may be attributed to the structural adjustment program. The result is expected as it takes
time for producers to switch to more profitable crops and to learn about the new market environment.
Because maize and beans are largely rainfed crops, the burden of adjustment and lower profits would
have been heavy oni poorer rainfed producers.
1.97   Other qualitative indication of the operation's benefits is possible. The Government has
gained fiscal savings from reduced subsidies, more efficient public investment, and reduced transfers
to parastatals. Producers of some commodities have gained from elimination of quantitative
restrictions on exports, and from lifting guarantee prices which, sometimes, taxed domestic output
with respect to world prices. Detailed policy analysis was done on commodity pricing, efficient



26
targeting of food and nutrition interventions and the role of Government in plant and animal health
regulations. Those analyses established standards for evaluating policies using world prices which
were used not only in AGSAL I and II but also in other operations. Though consumers bore most of
the cost of reforms, an expansion of targeted food subsidies softened the impact on the poorest.
b. Project Sustainability
1.98   The President's Report identified three major risks concerned to the sustainability of the
reform. The first risk concerned maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic climate-fiscal
discipline, monetary policy, and the exchange rate. Second, it was expected that changes in patterns
of resource use would be resisted from those who benefit from the status quo, causing the reform to
lose its momentum. Third, relying on NAFTA to implement trade policy reform in maize, wheat,
and barley would not necessarily guarantee trade and price liberalization.
1.99   Macroeconomic stability was realized largely through the PECE and through the elimination
of public sector deficits. Lower public sector debt was made possible by the Brady Plan and the
proceeds from the privatization of public enterprises. The Government has recently committed to
making the exchange rate regime more flexible, thereby making the macroeconomic side of the
project sustainable. The rise in the real interest rates associated with stabilization however, has
penalized some farming activities, thus cutting some benefits of the reforms.
1. 100 The second risk was related to the resistance that the Government might face from the
beneficiaries of the status quo. The commitment of the Government's change of the existing subsidy
scheme to the income support scheme, PROCAMPO, has given the message that the price mechanism
can no longer support inefficient production and that marginal cost should be the rule in determining
prices. The specific timetable of PROCAMPO for the next 15 years indicates that changes will be
sustainable as producers income, while lower in several instances, will be more certain. The
structure of PROCAMPO establishes a more solid ground for long-term reform as it specifies the
timing and incentives of the reform.
1. 101 Finally, with the ratification of NAFTA, the Government will follow the NAFTA timetable,
which although less strong than the PROCAMPO one as far as phasing out of subsidies is concerned,
makes the reforms more sustainable.
c. Bank's Performance
1. 102 The Bank started, soon after Mexico's economic crisis in 1982, to develop a policy dialogue
with the Government in order to support economic adjustment. This dialogue led to the change in the
Bank's work with much greater emphasis on policy-based lending while economic and sector work
were linked to structural adjustment. This resulted in sector adjustment loans for Trade Policy (FY87
and FY88 for US$500 million each); Fertilizer sector (Loan 2919-ME, FY88, US$265 million);
Agricultural Sector I and II (FY88 and FY91, US$300 million and US$400 million, respectively);
Steel Sector (FY88, US$400 million); Financial Sector (FY89, US$500 million); Industrial Sector
(FY89, US$500 million); Public Enterprise Reform (FY89, US$500 million); Road Transport and
Telecommunications (FY90, US$380 million); and the Interest Support (FY90, US$1.26 billion).



27
1. 103 The Government was already engaged in structural reforms in trade and industry but, given
the political sensitivity of the issues, reforms in the agricultural sector lagged. AGSAL I contributed
to that debate and established a framework in which to make agricultural policy more comprehensive,
covering prices and trade, inputs, irrigation, and food consumption. Sector work on land tenure
(World Bank, L.A2AG, Report No. 8310-ME, March 30. 1990) proposed broad options for
improving productivity in ejido areas. An intensive dialogue on the rural financial subsector, though
it did not lead to a project, assisted the Government in its efforts to make farm credit more readily
avaiiable to smallholders and to improve the financial condition of its credit institutions. The Bank's
role was to accelerate the debate within the Government about agricultural reforms. The Bank's
Policy Notes on Agriculture and Rural Development summarized the main issues affecting the sector's
performance up to the end of 1989 and gave specific recommendations on them.'9 Within the
Government, the main policy reforms were discussed around this document and it strengthened the
reformist groups. Given the complexity of the issues involved, this has to be considered a successful
performance.
1. 104 The preparation of AGSAL II was a natural continuation of AGSAL I and was closely
coordinated with the Trade Policy Loans and the Fertilizer Sector Adjustment Loan. While there
were no cross-conditionalitiei,, ie operations reinforcel each other. Both AGSAL and TPL
operations supported the reducti 'n of non-tariff barrie:; but AGSAL I and II specified the goods to
be liberalized as well as ihe spei:ific timetable to be fo.. )wed.
1. 105 Another important element of Bank'; performance in this operation was the economic and
sector work which was under way during AGSAL II, some of which is still being continued. The
Policy Notes on Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Febrdary 1, 1990) identified the prohlems
of the agricultural sector (e.g., slow agricultural growth, little poverty alleviation, low levels of
private investment, and inefficient resource allocation within agriculture) and gave specific
recommendations. The Agricultural and Technology Sector Review (August 20, 1992) concentrated
main-ly on the research programs, barriers to technology generation and technology transfer. The
Agricultural Sector Memorandum (currently under way) examines the economic incentives issues,
water markets, research and extension, and the land market, and it also gives specific policy
recommendation on the related problems. It also discusses problems associated with soil conservation
techniques as well as particular problems specifically found in the tropics.
1. 106 The legal agreements were satisfactory.
d. Borrower's Performnance
1.107  The coimmitmeni of the Government to the general idea of reform, and to some of the specific
actions supported under lie loan, was strong and sustained throughout implementation. In elaborating
PROCAMPO, Cie Gove nrnent went beyond what was agreed in the loan. The long process of
preparation and implementation helped create a commitment to reform based on an intellectual
conviction of the benefits rather than on the pressure of macro-economic circumstances (i.e., balance
of payments difficulties).
19.    World Bank, "Mexico: Policy Notes on Agriculture and Rural Development," Report 8144-
ME, LA2AG, February 1, 1990.



28
1. 108 In the growth and productivity component, the Government moved away from some
quantitative restrictions, and held the line on additional protection, but did not reduce overall
protection in wheat or sorghum because it raised the direct payments made under the agreed pricing
scheme (see para. 1.52). The decision to give higher direct payments resulted, in part, from the
squeeze on profits caused by the appreciation of the real exchange rate.
1. 109 The coordination of the health and nutrition component was poor after the disappearance of
SPP in 1992. This was reflected in slow preparation of the action plans for the food and nutrition
component (see para. 1.84). The objectives and mechanism of the food and nutrition conmponent
were apparently poorly understood and managed by the agricultural and finance ministries.
e. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
I 110 Mexico has extensively reformed its agricultural policy since 1987 with support initially from
AGSAL I and later from AGSAL II. Despite the disappearance of many major distortions under
AGSAL I, reform had to be deepened to exploit the full growth potential of Mexican agriculture.
Under AGSAL 11 the reforms were further promoted in order to raise agricultural growth and
productivity, through the improved functioning of output and input markets, while alleviating the
poverty of the most vulnerable population groups through targeted food and nutrition programs.
I . Il  The lessons from this operation are first described in terms of broader issues and then in
terms of the specific objectives of the operation. The broader issues are:
(a)    Linkage between stabilization and liberalization. Stabilization and budget restraint
continued to take priority over growth in the period of AGSAL II as it had under
AGSAL I (para. 1.24). The lesson is that a closer analysis of the Government's
intentions regarding the stabilization program in terms of public expenditure goals for
agriculture should have taken place and that more explicit targets should have been
set.
(b)    Sector strategy. Poverty alleviation measures, notably steps to improve nutrition
among the rural poor, were included in both AGSAL I and 11, but other actions to
distribute benefits of reforms were not elucidated until after the loan had been signed.
The lesson learned is that dialogue between the Bank and the borrower about
structural adjustment operations should not be limited to policy reforms, but should be
expanded to include complementarity actions that would ensure related sectors will
benefit from new incentives.
(c)    Poverty alleviation. AGSAL I and 11 were the first sector adjustment operations in
Mexico to take explicit steps to reduce the cost of the reforms to the poor. Not only
did they attempt to reduce the burden of adjustment on the poor by promoting targeted
food subsidies, thus making the package politically more acceptable, but also set the
basis for the Government's National Food Security Program for 1990-94. The most
appropriate feature of the design was the restriction of additional subsidies to an
existing institution - CONASUPO - so as to be able to mohitor their cost.

but did not have their intended effect-of removing distorted incentives to growers'

production decisions - because they were not linked to other forms of support to
crop production. This was most true of wheat production which, for political reasons,
received direct marketing support from SARH beginning in 1990 while the conditions
of AGSAL II limited the support from trade/price polizy. The lesson is that it would
be necessary to include conditionality on budget allocations, beyond the price policy
conditions, to avoid this non-price support.
1. 1 12 More specific lessons of the operation are:
(a)    Design of the loan. AGSAL 11, within the process of general reform, had a more
comprehensive design than AGSAL I, thus ensuring that policy issues were managed
within a unified framework; this was a notable strength of the design.
(b)    Linkage to other Bank Operations. The chief linkages of AGSAL II were to
AGSAL I (which was its natural continuation); to the IDSP and the Agricultural
Technology Project, which were designed to promote a supply response to the
incentive policy changes; to the two fertilizer adjustment sector loans which attempted
to liberal ze the fertilizer sector. These were appropriate linkages and, had they been
supported with an adequate share of agricultural budget by SARH, should have helped
AGSAL II's growth objective.
(c)    Pilot health and nutrition project.  The pilot health and nutrition project within
AGSAL II targeted low income families at risk of malnutrition including pregnant and
lactating women as well as children under the age of five. While the basic design of
the evaluation was satisfactory, the follow-up on the analysis in the form of an action
plan was slow because of institutional failures within the Government. The lesson is
that similar evaluation efforts should be monitored by qualified official agencies. A
second lesson is that in similar operations, more time should be given before the
pilot's achievements are evaluated - the one year period for this component of the
project proved to be inadequate.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(Loan 3357-ME)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE'
1. INTRODUCTION
2.1    Two fast-disbursing loans (disbursed in two trapches) were negotiated in May 1991 with the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank for US$400 million and US$200 million,
respectively, to finance the second agricultural sector adjustment loan (AGSAL 11), intended to
support different structural adjustment measures introduced by the Mexican Government in the sector.
2.2    Several conditions had to be complied with before these operations could be submitted to the
Banks' Boards of Executive Directors, which pertained to:
(a)    Trade policy (elimination of import and export permits for farm machinery and
equipment, pesticides, and different agricultural products).
(b)    Price policy (free determination of or greater flexibility in the prices of tractors,
pesticides, and different agricultural products, and methods for calculating and
reducing the levels of protection on maize, sugar, and wheat).
(c)    Terms of reference for studies on import permits for milk, trade policy for beans, use
of pesticides, animal and plant health, and production targets for the Ministry of
Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH).
(d)    Food policy (terms of reference for the evaluation and monitoring of social programs
for the provision of milk and tortillas, and implementation of a pilot nutrition and'
health project (PNAyS).
(e)    Presentation of policy letters regarding nutrition and agricultural modernization.
2.3    These commitments were complied with on schedule, and the loans were signed on June 26.
1991, and declared effective in December of the same year (when a plan of action was agreed uponI
based on the study of SARH's projection targets), making it possible to disburse the first tranche for
US$200 million and US$100 million, respectively.
1.    With the exception of Section 2 which was submitted in English, Part 11 is a direct translat.ion
from the original Spanish. Because Part I was revised after receipt of Part II, some of the
paragraph references made in this Part 11 to the earlier Part I may no longer correspond
exactly (e.g. reference of para. 77 corresponds to para. 1.76).



31
2.4    A number of commitments were established in order to gain access to the second tranche of
the loon. including:
(a)    Trade policy (elimination of import monopolies and export permits for fresh and
powdcred milk).
(b)    Price policy (free determination of or greater flexibility in the prices of different farm
products and pesticides, and a reduction in nominal protection for wheat, barley,
maize, and refined sugar).
(c)    Implementation of action plans based on the results of the studies on the market for
beans, pesticides, animal and plant health, and SARH's production targets.
(d)    Food policy (evaluation of social programs for the provision of milk, tortillas, and the
PNAyS, and the presentation of plans of action to implement food and nutrition
programs in Mexico).
(e)    Maintenance of the policies presented to the Boards of Executive Directors and
submission to Congress of a draft agricultural budget for 1992, in line with
macroeconomic policy.
2.5    Loan 3357-ME AGSAL 11 was fully disbursed on January 19, 1994, after the different
undertakings had been fulfilled.
2.6    The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) acted as guarantor for the operation, and
Nacional Financiera S.N.C. (NAFIN) was the borrower, in its capacity as the financial agent of the
Federal Government. The executing agencies for this loan were the Ministry of Agriculture and
Water Resources (SARH), the Ministry of Trade and Industrial Development (SECOFI), and the
Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL), whose comments are given below.
2. SARH
A. BACKGROUND
2.7    Since the beginning of the present administration, a thorough revision of economic policies
has taken place with the main purpose of reducing Government participation in the nation's economy
and limiting public expenditures to social investments. As a result, a drastic reduction of the budget
deficit has been achieved and a greater participation in social productive activities has been registered.
2.8    As part of these revisions, Mexican agriculture started a process of deep structural changes
aimed primarily to increase the welfare of the rural population, promote higher output growth, and
improve the agricultural trade balance. The main goal is the modernization of agriculture which in
turn will increase and improve production, reduce imports, and allow greater participation in
international markets.
2.9    Agriculture is a very important activity in the Mexican economy. It accounts for 9 percent of
GDP and employs over 25 percent of the labor force. For these reasons, agriculture deserves priority
attention from the Covernment, especially if one considers the fact that its performance has social and
political implications in the country's stability.



32
2.10   The highly protective policy regime that prevailed in agriculture up to the beginning of the
nineties had to be reviewed, and in most cases phased-out right away, to adjust to new conditions
prevailing in Mexico and abroad. First, the need to keep public finances in equilibrium, while
simultaneously increasing social expenditure (e.g. health, nutrition, education, and housing for the
urban and rural poor), conditioned all sectoring policies including agricultural ones. Secondly, to
recover the path of sustainable growth over the long term, it was necessary to continue the process of
trade liberalization and economic and commercial integration which started in 1986 with the accession
of Mexico to GATT. Third, the role of the state in promoting rural development had to be adjusted
not only because of the new macroeconomic conditions already mentioned but also to allow the surge
of entrepreneurship in the private and social sectors.
2.11   The last model of development was hindered as a consequence of strong public involvement in
production, storage, and distribution of key agricultural inputs and goods. Moreover, despite the
large fiscal transfers granted to agriculture, output and employment remained stagnant during the
eighties. Therefore, the rationale to change the institutional environment was a political demand of
the rural society.
a. The New Legal Framework
2.12   The reforms to article 27 of the Mexican Constitution and the Agrarian Law, constitute a new
legal framework with respect to land tenure and property rights. This new framework is both simple
and clear, and eliminates obstacles and restrictions to private investment in agricultural, livestock, and
forestry activities. The new norms will instill dynamism to the sector, increqse factor mobility, and
provide certainty and security for the private sector to participate in highly rewarding projects with a
long-term development perspective.
b. Trade Policy
2.13   After Mexico joined the GATT, "official" import prices were abolished. Tariffs were
reduced from over 100 percent in 1985 to a current of 20 percent. Until 1986, all agricultural
products were subject to import licenses. In 1992, only a few products remain subjects to import
licenses: maize, beans, milk powder, barley, poultry, animal fats, grapes, and a few other products
such as: potatoes, eggs carnauba, whose relative importance in trade is insignificant. Imports as
significant as bovine meat, pork and port products, animal offals, soybeans, sorghum, rice, vegetable
oils, apples, and absolutely all processed foods and beverages face only tariff protection well below
Mexico's tariff bindings with the GATT. In conclusion, strong steps to liberalize agricultural trade
were taken after Mexico's accession to GATT, and in the context of NAFTA the process will be
concluded.
2.14   The agricultural chapter of the NAFTA is not limited to setting time-frames for the removal
of trade barriers. It includes provisions in the following areas: (a) Market access; (1) Domestic
support; (c) Export subsidies; (d) Sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Disciplines in these areas are
crucially important for the success of the NAFTA in promoting trade.
c. The New Role of the State
2.15   According to the rope of the State within the development strategy pursued until last decade,
it had to interfere directly in all activities related to the agricultural production. In the current
economic environment, the role of the State has changed; a focal point of the new policy is No State



33
Intervention in areas in which conditions for private participation are adequate. The present
administration has diminished Government intervention in several sectors by encouraging the
participation of the private sector and by removing obstacles and rmarket distortions that prevent
Mlexican agriculture from developing to its full potential. State-owned enterprises have withdrawn
from production and distribution of agricultural products; most have been privatized, restructured, or
liquidated. This is the case of INMECAFE, ANAGSA, TABAMEX, AZUCAR, PRONASE,
BANRURAL, CONASUPO, among others.
2.16   As part of this action, state involvement in activities such as coffee production and marketing,
handling and distribution of tobacco, seed industry have been discontinued by Government agencies
and brought back to the private sector. It is important to mention [he role of PRONASE, that held a
partial monopoly over seed commercialization and received subsidies and legal protection against
comlpetition. A New National Seed Law eliminated the state monopoly and allowed private sector
competition.
2.17   Within the new agricultural policy, the role of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Water
Resources (SARH) has also been reviewed, being now mainly promotional and less regulatory. The
main objective of SARH functicns is to create the nec..*;sary conditions to allow a healthy
deveiopment of agricultural pro, luction within a marke: oriented framework.
2.18   The redefinition of the tole of the st ite is also  allowed by rationalization in subsidies.
Reorganization or privatization in the sector favors the :,urge of private infrastructure in the areas of
marketing, transport, and storage. Savings generated by reducing subsidies are channeled towards
priority programs such as hydroagricultural ihfrastructure development, technical assistance,
agricultural research, sanity and phytosanity campaigns, dams, etc.
2. 19   Another line of action was the redefinition of the role of the public sector in the supply of
farm inputs. The regulations that existed and the direct participation of the State in production
inhibited the private supply of inputs. The public sector was directly involved in the distribution of
seeds and fertilizers, financing and marketing.
2.20   Public intervention in the farm, that was a very important instrument of development, did not
accomplished properly the objective of promoting production and justice anymore. Subsidies, hidden
as loans, distorted the productive structure and reached only few producers. The case of
BANRURAL is illustrative: in the last decades BANRURAL was more a s .bsidies scheme than a
development bank.
d. Guarantee Prices
2.21   Previously, all nmajor agricultural crops had a guarantee price operated through CONASUPO;
by 1992, only n aize and beans have guarantee prices. Soybeans, wheat, sorghum and rice receive
marketing assistance (in some cases limited to disadvantaged regions). This assistance is provided
through ASERCA, and Is based on a system that allows buyers to acquire the harvest of the national
producer at a price equivalent to the cost of the imported good.
2.22   Several problems are associated with guarantee prices. Buying at a higher uniform price than
the sales prices completely crowds out the participation of the social and private sectors in trading.
Moreover, guarantee prices distorted the prdduction decisions inducing an important increase in the
harvested land of protected products in areas where other activities would be more profitable. A clear



34
example of this situation is the growth of the harvested area of maize in the North and North-West (it
increased from 451,000 hectares in 1989 to 907,000 hectares in 1992). Maize and beans are the most
heavily subsidized crops. The current imbalances in the relative protection of different crops have led
to distortions in the structure of production,leading to an artificially high production of maize and
beans, and a low production of substitutes. These distortions will be removed upon implementation
of PROCAMPO.
2.23   Under a guarantee price scheme, the total subsidy is not only the difference between the
guarantee price and the sale price (or international price), it is necessary to add marketing costs. The
existence of a uniform price in time and space hides transportation and storage costs.
e. PROCAMPO
2.24   PROCAMPO is a new support program for Mexican farmers who are currently devoted to the
production of certain grains and oilseeds. The traditional support scheme to the agricultural sector,
which PROCAMPO will replace, operated basically through high guarantee prices. This scheme led
to an efficient allocation of resources in the rural sector, shifting resources towards those crops with
the highest degree of relative protection. The poorest of all peasants, which devote their production
to self-consumption, did not benefit from a scheme of support based on market price since they do not
have any marketable production.
2.25   PROCAMPO does not support the production of specific commodities, but the farmers'
income. The program grants payments to producers based on land ownership; it is completely
decoupled from prices, production levels or any other requirement of performance, therefore, the
effect will be neutral on production and trade. PROCAMPO supports proportionally more low
income producers, and supports proportionally less high income producers.
B. SECOND AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
2.26   The second agricultural sector adjustment loan supported the modernization process. In this
context the elimination of trade barriers (export and import permits) was necessary to eliminate
distortions in producers decisions and also to reduce government's role and increase participation of
the private sector.
2.27   The AGSAL II was signed in June 1991. The first tranche of US$200 million was disbursed
in January 1992. The second tranche of US$200 million was expected to be disbursed in August
1992. However, there was a delay caused by the use of agreed prices (precios de concertaci6n) for
sorghum, rice and soybeans, created by article 27 modifications, and NAFTA negotiations. Both
measures were briefly described above.
2.28   Because of Tamaulipas sorghum commercialization problems in the Autumn-Winter 91/92
agricultural cycle, the government of Mexico gave support to sorghum traders. The support was
given only to Tamaulipas sorghum because this state has a lack of storehouses and a deficient
transportation system; these problems are worst after the sorghum crop. The government helped in
the dialogue between producers and traders, and ASERCA was present in the signature of 250
contracts between Tamaulipas producers and consumers. In these negotiations the average price was
285 new pesos/ton. in production area, and ASERCA gave support to the buyers equal to the
difference between the concertation price and the indifference price. The imported sorghum price in
consumption area minus financial cost, storehouse cost and transportation is the indifference price.



35
2.29   It is important to mention that in the other states the sorghum price is determined by the
market, with a price between 420 and 500 new pesos/ton. These prices reflect a premium for being
close to consumption areas. Finally the 15 percent seasonal tariff for sorghum imports protects
Spring/Summer crops, not the ones of the Autumn/Winter cycle like Tamaulipas production.
2.30   The government of Mexico gave support to the rice producers in Spring/Summer 1991 cycle
in an amount of 60 new pesos/ton. This support was independent of the free market price. When the
crop is rice, it's price is lower than the one registered in the international market. However, at the
third month the financial cropping costs increase the price above the international one. The 60 new
pesos/ton. is required by the industrial consumers for being indifferent between buying rice in Mexico
or import it.
2.31   In Spring/Summer 1991 the soybean crop market's price was 810 new pesos/ton. However,
there were subsidized imports from U.S.A. that affected the commercialization of Mexican soybean.
United States support its soybean exports through the Coap and Soap programs. The government of
Mexico gave 70 new pesos/ton to the soybean producers and a support of 10 or 20 new pesos/ton to
the soybean industrial buyers.
2.32   It is important to menti( n that the current gov, iiment interventions in concertation process
differs from the old ones In th x old concertation proc ss, the government had an active role in price
determination, currently it has passive role kind consuni.:rs and producers determine the price. Only
in these 3 cases the government has a more active role, with a commercialization support.
2.33   In this modernization process, where the market determines the price and provides clear
signals, several actions were taken in accordance with AGSAL II conditions:
(a)    Elimination of export tax for raw cotton, cotton fiber, and swine for breeding.
(b)    Elimination of export permit for wheat, sorghum, feedstuffs, soybean, barley, cartamo
oil, cotton seed, tobacco, and eggs.
(c)    Eliminatiorn of SARH production targets.
(d)    The wheat nominal level of protection was lower than the .ne registered on May 1st
1991 (see Figure 1).
(e)    The real maize guarantee pric:e in dollars is lower than the one in the Autumn/Winter
1990-91 cycle (see Figure 2).
(f)    The real price of sugar (for consumption) in dollars is lower than the one registered
on January 1st 1991 (see Figure 3).
(g)    The nominal price of barley was not increased for the period June 1, 1991 to January
31, 1992 above the level of 680 new pesos/ton and was set for the period February 1,
1992 to January 31, 1993 at a level which did not exceed 714 new pesos/ton. The
barley price close at 685 new pesos/ton.

2.34   A study and action plan was prepared in the areas of plant, animal health, and pesticides.
The rules and regulations in this action plan were based strictly on quality control, health,
epidemiological, phytosanitary and environmental protection grounds.
2.35   The Government designed a new sugar policy, which includes: a new Cane Decree, a reform
in the social security system of cane sector, the creation of a sugar spot market (FORMA), closing of
unprofitable mills an i debt restructuring of mills.
2.36   The Government of Mexico went beyond what was committed regarding beans. An import
quota of 50,000 tons for the U.S. and of 1,500 tons for Canada was agreed under NAFTA. This
quota is tariff free and will grow at 3 percent annually for the U.S. and 5 percent for Canada.
3. SEDESOL
A. TORTILLA AND MILK PROGRAMS
2.37   One of the commitments was to perform evaluations of the social programs for the provision
of tortillas ard milk. Using the established methodology, income anc spending surveys were
conducted of households in probability samples of program beneficiaries and control groups living
under similar socioeconomic conditions. In the case of the social program to supply milk, follow-up
nutri.ion sur-eys were also conducted of the youngest weaned child under six in each household, and
the child's measurements were taken to determine nutritional condition. The surveys were designed
and conducted by INEGI, and the Salvador Zubiran National Nutrition Institute participated in
counseling for the persons surveyed. The Banks prepared the terms of reference for the studies,
approved the design of the questionnaires and the size of the proposed sample, and closely monitored
the procedures for selecting the company hired to act as external consultant.
2.38   The results were analyzed by Technomic Consultants International and presented in the
documents "Evaluaci6n de la Situaci6n Alimentaria en Mexico: Tortil!a-Solidaridad", "Evaluaci6n de
la Situaci6n Alimentaria en Mexico: Abasto Social de Leche Fluida", and "Evaluaci6n de la Situaci6n
Alimentaria en Mexico: Abasto Social de Leche en Polvo" (tortilla program, fluid milk program, and
powdered milk program).
2.39   The evaluation criterion for the tortilla program was its efficiency in transferring income to
the target population, which was defined as families earning less than two minimum wages. The
study found that about 30 percent of the families in the sample earned more than that amount. From
the nutritional viewpoint, the program had a positive effect on calorie intake in households that earned
less than two minimum wages. With regard to the errors of inclusion, it should be noted that
CONASUPO improved its list of beneficiaries through household visits during the program.
2.40   For the milk program, the criteria of nourishment and nutritional impact were used. In the
fluid milk program, it was found that 15.8 percent of the families in the sample earned more than two
minimum wages. The program had a positive effect on nutrient intake by vulnerable children under
six in families that earned less than two minimum wages.
2.41   The family-income inclusion error in the powdered milk program was just 8.7 percent of the
households in the probability sample. Although this study found that the subsidy was better directed
to the target population, no significant differences were found in nutrient intake levels or in



38
malnutrition levels between the probability sample and the control group. The results for both groups
indicated that calory and protein levels were insufficient, and that infant malnutrition was serious.
B. PILOT NUTRITION, FOOD, AND HEALTH PROJECT
2.42   As agreed with the IBRD and the IDB, the pilot nutrition, food, and health project (PNAyS)
had the following main objectives: (a) to raise the nutrition and health levels of a vulnerable group
composed of children under the age of five, pregnant women, and lactating women; and (b) to
evaluate the impact of the project on the members of those groups, and to determine its operational
and financial feasibility.
2.43   The PNAyS operated for 10 months (September 1991 to June 1992) in 605 communities that
are extremely poor in the large Otomi-Mazahua Indian zone in the State of Mexico, and the large
Ixtla zone in the states of Nuevo Le6n, San Luis Potosi, and Tamaulipas. It covered a population of
just over 200,000, and provided food aid for 33,000 families. The total number of people in the
vulnerable group were 50,900 children under five, 5,700 pregnant women, and 7,700 lactating
women.
2.44   The project involved five lines of action: (a) nutritional monitoring; (b) food and nutritional
guidance; (c) food production by families for their own consumption; (d) conmmunity participation;
and (e) food assistance.
2.45   The project evaluation indicated that the results were generally positive, and in some aspects
they exceeded expectations. The main impact was on the nutrition and health of children under five,
whose rates of malnutrition and diarrheal and acute respiratory infections abated considerably,
particularly in the Otomi-Mazahua zone, where these Indian groups account for a large part of the
population. 'The high levels of community participation in improving community sanitation conditions
had a favorable impact on human health, by changing sewage and garbage disposal habits. The
impact of the project on the cost structure of beneficiary households was only marginal, even though
food aid accounted for about 10 percent of one minimum monthly wage. However, the program was
an excellent stimulus for commnunity participation in health activities.
2.46   Each of the institutions that participated in the project was found to have sufficient
administrative capacity to operate at adequate levels, although in the initial stage some problems
stemming from insufficient internal coordination within the institution directly involved in the
operation had to be solved. Solutions were also found for certain problems that had apparently not
been foreseen in the design.
2.47   While the PNAyS was largely based on the MASSPA model (health care services for an open
population) used by the Ministry of Health in some of its programs, the distinctiveness of this project
lay in the special stress it placed on nutritional aspects and health actions in the home, supported by
basic sanitation in the community.
2.48   It should also be mentioned that the original plan of the PNAyS was overly ambitious with
regard to its multiple objectives, particularly in view of the short execution period. It was not
possible, for example, to verify its impact on infant mortality or on the height-age variable for
children. However, it did enrich the basic criteria for identifying target populations and the provision
of food aid, inter alia.



39
2.49   In short, all the stages in the development of the PNAyS, from the design to the evaluation,
provided valuable experience that was fully tapped in the programming of future actions to improve
the nutrition and health of rural communities living in abject poverty. It should be underlined that the
support provided by the consultants and staff of the Banks helped to achieve these good results and
provided timely feedback.
4. SECOFI
A. COMMENTS ON THE MILK PROGRAM
2.50   Specific corrments on the milk program have as follows:
2.51   With regard to paragraph 74 of this PCR, it would have been desirable to evaluate the surveys
on nutrition that were used to support the World Bank's recommendations, so that we could have all
been in agreement regarding the diagnosis from the outset.
2.52   With regard to paragraph 77 (a), while there is recognition that the milk program was directed
more to urban than rural zones, there is no recognition that one of the problems in rural areas is the
lack of participation by the population in food programs. This implies that a problem of identification
exists, in which the lack of effectiveness of the program does not necessarily stem from the supply
side, as the Bank tries to establish.
2.53   Paragraph 77 (b) says that coverage of the program was very low in urban areas, which is
inexact; generalizations of this kind are not valid because there are state programs that provide very
high coverage.
2.54   Paragraph 77 (c) mentions that the LICONSA program is not sufficiently targeted, as families
above the poverty line are eligible. However, we feel that a study should have been conducted to
obtain a better poverty line rather than accepting the one currently being used as an absolute truth.
This social program and the tortibono program are based on different eligibility criteria, and it is not
clear why they should have to be the same.
2.55   Section (d) mentions that the milk program is not efficient in nutritional terms because the
food provision services did not coordinate with the health sector. However, this is a working
hypothesis that requires empirical confirmation by comparing it with other intervention methods,
which was not done.
2.56   Section (e) states that the milk program does not have an adequate social cost-benefit ratio,
but we do not find any evidence in support of that point.
2.57   With regard to paragraph 91, we feel that the milk study has serious shortcomings that the
World Bank has failed to consider in its report. LICONSA informed the Bank of those shortcomings
timely.

B. COMMENTS ON THE TORTILLA SUBSIDY PROGRAM
a. Background
2.58   The immediate precursor of the tortilla subsidy program was the tortibonos program in effect
from April 1986 to October 1991. The tortibonos program formed part of the support that the federal
government channeled to the maize tortilla chain, intended to strengthen the consumer stage.
2.59   The tortibonos program consisted of the sale of vouchers for one and two kilograms of
tortillas at below market prices. The vouchers, known as tortibonos, were accepted by affiliated
tortilla shops and were subsequently cashed by them for an amount equal to the market price. The
subsidy, which was equal to the difference between the market price and the tortibono price, was paid
by CONASUPO.
2.60   Tortibonos were distributed for sale to the general public by CONASUPO's retail food sale
system (DICONSA), and by certain social and labor organizations who sold them to their members.
2.61   Despite the channels set up for the distribution of tortibonos, the scheme had no instruments
to monitor and follow up on the beneficiary population that would permit it to be classified as a
targeted subsidy program.
b. Tortilla Subsidy Program
2.62   The first list of families eligible for the tortilla subsidy program, which provided them with
one kilogram of tortillas a day, free of charge through affiliated establishments, was issued in
November 1991.
2.63   When the tortilla subsidy program was set up, mechanisms were established to change the
earlier scheme that involved a general subsidy to a targeted one, and to increase efficiency and
transparency in the use of fiscal resources. Specifically:
2.64   A national list of beneficiaries selected though non-discretionary mechanisms was established
and computerized.
2.65   Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined, taking into account information on income,
spending, housing conditions, and family possessions. The poverty line was defined as families with
incomes of two minimum wages or less, calculated for each family using indirect methods.
2.66   A planning system was established based on a mapping frame that identified marginal urban
areas, target population, and population served. A geographic information system based on digitized
maps has been in use since 1993.
2.67   A personal identification system was instituted, based on cards with bar codes for the
beneficiaries and optical readers in the affiliated tortilla shops. In 1994, a new technology began to
be introduced based on "intelligent" or "memory" cards.
2.68   An independent specialized agency was set up to pay the subsidy, under the administration of
a national credit institution (Banco Nacional de Comercio Interior) which worked on 'he basis ot a
fully automated system.



41
c. Program Operating System
2.69   Program operation is based on the inclusion of families through household socioeconomic
surveys, and subsequent data capture and evaluation using computer systems. Families that meet the
eligibility criteria are given a personalized plastic card containing a unique bar code that identifies
them as beneficiaries of the program.
2.70   Optical readers have been installed in the affiliated tortilla shops to read the bar codes. When
the beneficiaries present their cards, provided they have not expired. an employee of the establishment
gives them one kilogram of tortillas free of charge.
2.71   Subsequently, an employee from each shop takes the optical reader to an exchange center
where the bar code information stored in it is downloaded through a computer linkup, and the shop is
paid for the transactions at the official price per kilogram of tortillas.
2.72   As of December 1993, the tortilla subsidy program was operating in 202 Mexican cities, had
2.1 million beneficiary families, and 12,975 affiliated i:ortilla shops.
2.73   The program administra ion intends to continuAly monitor and update the list of beneficiaries,
using a mechanism that verifies i random sample, who e results will be used to make statistical
inferences on the reliabiliLy and accuracy of the list. 1 ie random verification will be carried out each
quarter in each of the 202 participating cities.
d. Comments on the Shortcomings in the Tortilla Subsidy Program Mentioned in Part I of the
PCR (paragraph 77)
2.74   The tortilla subsidy program only covers urban areas. It was designed in this way to
complement the subsidized corn flour distribution program carried out in rural areas through
DICONSA. In urban areas, the idea was to accommodate the habits of city dwellers who prefer
ready-made tortillas.
2.75   As of December 1993, the program covered 2.1 million families, which represented 60
percent of the target families, who number 3.5 million according to estimates based on CONASUPO's
mapping study.
2.76   The list of beneficiaries of the tortilla subsidy program underwent s structural change when it
was updated in 1992 and 1993. The updating involved verification of the s:ocioeconomic situation of
70 percent of the families registered in the list. Forty percent of those verified failed to meet the
eligibility criteria and they were removed from the list and replaced with new beneficiaries.
2.77   A consisient rnetlhodology for the inclusion and exclusion of beneficiary families has been
used in the tortilla and milk subsidy progranis since September 1993. At that time, the two
institutions established a joint program to verify the whole list of milk subsidy beneficiaries, and to
subsequently consolidate in CONASUPO the administration of a single list of beneficiaries of both
social programs. This project will be concluded in October 1994 in the cities participating in the
tortilla subsidy program, except for the metropolitan area of the Federal District.
2.78   The tortilla subsidy program is designed to transfer income (in kind) to poor families in
Mexico's urban area through the provision of a staple food. Under the policies governing the



42
program, the amount of the transfer is the relevant element, and not the nutritional content or
contribution to the diet of the beneficiaries. The possible integration of the tortilla subsidy program
into a program for nutritional support and the provision of educational and health services would be
desirable and advisable from the institution's standpoint.
e. Main Lessons Learned from the Tortilla Subsidy Program
2.79   The introduction of a targeted subsidy program to replace the earlier program of general
transfers has led to better control over fiscal resources by eliminating the market distortions caused by
the general approach.
2.80   Permanent updating of the list of the beneficiaries of the tortilla subsidy program and its
coverage have laid the groundwork for the possible liberalization of prices on the final tortilla market
without placing the most economically vulnerable families at risk.
2.81   The consolidation of methodologies, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the merger of the
lists of beneficiaries of the tortilla and milk programs will allow for expansion programs that are
congruous with institutional criteria, economies of scale in the management of the two programs, and
consistency in the policy of targeted subsidies administered by the CONASUPO system.
2.82   The use of leading-edge technologies in the planning (digitized mapping) and execution of the
tortilla subsidy program (intelligent cards and bar codes), and of computer systems for managing lists
and information have led to greater administrative and operational efficiency. Their use in
CONASUPO's social programs has been highly relevant in attaining the desired objectives.
2.83   Comments on Social Programs. Some comments on the social programs are as follows:
(a)    There are errors in the meaning of the abbreviations: DICONSA, LICONSA,
PROCAMPO.
(b)    Paragraph 45 states that PROCAMPO will be fully implemented in October 1994; the
correct date is April 1995.
(c)    Paragraph 59 states that the monopoly has already been eliminated; the correct
information is that a directive has been issued to eliminate it for 1995 supplies.
(d)    Paragraph 87 states that DICONSA subsidizes maize production; it subsidizes
consumption.
(e)    As a minimum, the tenses used in paragraph 88 are incorrect. At present, maize for
tortilla production is sold everywhere in the country at below the price of its imported
equivalent delivered to the consumption zone. With PROCAMPO, the price of
tortillas would rise on that account alone.
(f)    Paragraph 101 states that PROCAMPO has a legal basis, which it still does not have.
(g)    Part 1, Table 3 (page 13) presents crops and their tariffs. However, since their
classification within the tariff heading has not been included, it is difficult to
determine which product is being referred to.



43
(h)    One cause for confusion is oats. Tariffs on one type were completely eliminated on
January 1, 1994 (heading 10.04.00.01). The other type of oats is classified under
heading 09.10.20.01 and its tariff will be reduced over a ten-year period.
(i)    According to the table wheat flour will be subject to long-term liberalization.
However, the annexes to NAFTA state that tariffs will be reduced over the specific
period of ten years.
(j)    No comment is made on the timetable for changing the tariff on saffron. The annexes
to NAFTA state that the tariff was completely removed on January 1, 1994.
(k)    Advance import permits are another important aspect. None of the cases in the table
requires them. In particular, the permit requirement was eliminated for the United
States and Canada for maize (grain), beans, wheat, and barley, and remains a
requirement only for third countries. No permits are required for the other items.
This information was confirmed by SECOFI's Directorate of Import and Export
Permits.
(l)    Otherwise the te. t of Part I of the docu- ient gives an acceptable view of the current
status of the trad liberalization prograt! and agricultural policy as it pertains to the
agreed and guaranteed prices of staple Lc ops.
2.84   Conuneiits on Part III of the PCR. The information on SECOFI presented in Part III is
correct and is a fair description of its actions to free prices and promote greater efficiency and
competitiveness in Mexico.
2.85   Conunents on the World Bank's Petformance. It is generally thought that the Bank
mission arrived in Mexico with a preconceived idea of what food programs should be like, and did
not make an in-depth study of how the existing programs were operating. The project would have
produced better results had it taken the approach of solving the problems in existing programs to
obtain better coordination, rather than seeking drastic changes for which the organizations are ill
prepared.
5. SHCP
2.86   Conunents on paragraph 110 of the PCR. The paragraph is not iccurate when it states that
the "objectives and mechanism of the nutrition and food component were poorly understood and
managed by the agricultural and finance ministries". Neither of those two ministries was directly
responsible for this compornent at any time.
