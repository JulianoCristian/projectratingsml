alleviation of the most vulnerable population groups\n            through food programs.  This loan will support:  (a) trade\n            and policy reforms that increase competition and reduce the\n            government's role in the production, planning,\n            marketing, storage and processing of agricultural products\n            and inputs, and encourage private sector competition; (b)\n            revision of government expenditure allocation in consumer\n            programs by eliminating generalized food subsidies and\n            increasing spending for improved food assistance and\n            nutrition program targeting; and (c) the institutional\n            transition of the Ministry of Agriculture and Hydraulic\n            Resources to a smaller but more effective agriculture role,\n            emphasizing policy formulation, implementation and basic\n            regulatory functions.  The program includes measures to\n            reform agricultural product price and  trade policy regime,\n            abolish the system of mandatory production planning for\n            agricultural products, reduce and streamline market\n            regulations and barriers to entry and competition, and make\n            food consumption and nutrition programs more cost effective\n            and successful by increasing coverage and improving\n            targeting of the poorer population."}, "docdt": "1991-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
