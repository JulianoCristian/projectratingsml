The project, together with other\n            donor-financed projects in the sector, will:  (i) initiate\n            the process of upgrading water supply facilities; (ii)\n            establish appropriate procedures and methods for ensuring\n            proper system operation and maintenance (O&M) and\n            promote the involvement of the private sector in water\n            operations; (iii) enhance sector technical, financial and\n            managerial skills through training; and (iv) rationalize\n            sector organization and strengthen sector finances by\n            instituting tariff reforms and improving cost recovery. The\n            project consists of the following key concepts:  (a)\n            facilities rehabilitation, comprising some 45 major and 100\n            minor upgrading schemes nationwide, and improvements to New\n            Amsterdam distribution systems; (b) O&M improvements,\n            supporting a systemwide preventive maintenance program,\n            standardization of electro-mechanical equipment and\n            contracting out of certain support activities to the private\n            sector on a pilot basis; (c) human resources development,\n            enhancing manpower skills in the water sector; (d)\n            institutional strengthening of Guyana Water Authority\n            (GUYWA), improving the capabilites of GUYWA in management,\n            financial and technical areas; (e) project management and\n            evaluation, emphasizing the establishment of a Project\n            Management Unit; and (f) future projects preparation."}, "docdt": "1993-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
