The lessons learned\n            indicate that The success of the project depended in great\n            part on the ability of the executing agency, Guyana Water\n            Authority (GUYWA), to be able to implement the designated\n            investment program, including meeting the conditionalities\n            specified. The lack of donor coordination in the water\n            sector was actually impeding progress. There were\n            uncoordinated standards, overlapping investments, and a lack\n            of coherent strategy. This Project came close to being\n            cancelled during its life and has never enjoyed unimpeded\n            progress. The political, security, and financial environment\n            has been very difficult. However, the project did,\n            ultimately, achieve significant improvements in the\n            institutional structure of the sector and mobilize much\n            needed investments in a rational way. This is attributable,\n            in part, to the flexibility of most donors in the sector who\n            were committed to adjusting the Projects (as feasible) to\n            achieve the greatest good in the sector."}, "docdt": "2004-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
