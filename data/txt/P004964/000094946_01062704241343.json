The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            adjudged as satisfactory although Bank performance during\n            project preparation was marginally satisfactory and the\n            Government's performance lacked in due diligence to\n            ensure the timely implementation of the\n            project--particularly when the project suffered from lack of\n            counterpart financing, implementation agencies made their\n            best efforts in achieving the project's development\n            objectives and quantitative targets. Lessons learned\n            included the following: Well-designed institutional analysis\n            should be carried out to assess human and institutional\n            capacity, confirm the interest of the beneficiaries, and\n            identify the optimal arrangement. The original\n            implementation period was unrealistic, causing the project\n            to require three extensions. In the project design which is\n            focused on establishing a certain system of service\n            provision, particularly projects on cadastre systems, a\n            \"building-block\" or incremental approach may be\n            applied. It is important to judge feasibility and relevancy\n            when working with multiple agencies concurrently and to\n            reflect them in the project design. Opportunities for policy\n            dialogue could have been encouraged more during project\n            implementation, particularly to increase awareness of\n            policymakers of the importance of cadastre/title\n            registration linked to economic and housing policy reform."}, "docdt": "2001-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
