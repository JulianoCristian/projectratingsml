MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A CADASTRE PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for US$33 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would help to finance a Cadastre
project that aims to strengthen Algeria's capacity to implement its national
land registration (cadastre) system, to increase land registration over four
years -- 3 million ha of rural land and 36000 ha of urban land would be mapped
and 1 million parcels titled --, and to develop an adequate data base for
designing a sound land-taxation policy. The loan would have a term of 17
years, including a five-year grace period, at the standard variable interest
rate.
2.          Backgrogud.  Optimal land-use management in Algeria is critical
because of the country's rapidly growing population, heavy dependence on food
imports, and scarcity of usable land, for which competition between
agricultural and urban uses is intense. Current efforts to introduce sound
land-management and land-taxation policies take place in the context of
Algeria's move, over the past five years, away from a centrally planned and
toward a market based economy. Their effectiveness is largely conditioned by
the development of a reliable cadastral mapping and land registration system.
3.          Land-use management policy in Algeria has varied dramatically,
most strikingly in the past five years, in rural as well as in urban areas.
After independence in 1962, the rural land of French settlers was
collectivized into socialist state farms averaging 1,000 ha in size.
Collectivization intensified in 1971, when the size of private property was
limited and excess land incorporated in the state farms. In 1987, the
Government decided to introduce market forces into the economy and increase
the role of the private sector. It broke up the state farms and distributed
land usufruct rights and assets to voluntary cooperatives and to individual
farmers. In 1988, there were 22,000 private cooperative farms, averaging 80
ha and consisting of 6-7 members, and 5,100 individual farms, averaging 6 ha.
By 1992, the number of individual farms had more than tripled, to 15,900;
private collectives increased more slowly, to 25,400, and their average
membership declined to 5.5.
4.          Municipal control of the use of urban land has been relaxed to
give more space to market forces. In 1974, the Urban Land Reservation Law
entrusted the municipalities with providing suitable land for urbanization.
Within the Urbanization Perimeter, state land was transferred to the
municipalities and private undeveloped land could be sold only to them. In
turn, they had the responsibility to provide land for public infrastructure
and housing construction, as well as for private individual housing
construction. Implementation of this law has resulted in ineffici -nt use of
urban land and encroachment on agricultural land. By the end of 1989, among
564,000 plots that had been allocated to households for family house



-2-
construction, 170,000 were owned by households that did not plan to build in
the near future. Simultaneously, 300,000 illegal housing constructions had
been tallied in the agricultural land surrounding the main cities. In 1990,
the Government issued the Land Policy Law, which provides for deregulated land
transactions. Municipalities have thus lost their monopoly on urban
transactions, and prices are freely determined by the market. Zoning maps are
to be prepared under municipality supervision and municipalities can monitor
the evolution of the urban land market by exercising their authority to
preempt land.
5.          The trend toward land privatization was matched by other
Government actions: in 1989, the Government established =ost public
enterprises as autonomous state-owned entities and, in 1990, it initiated a
reform of the financial system to remove obstacles to private sector
development.
6.          The benefits of privatizing both rural and urban land rights have
been constrained, however, by insecurity of land tenure. The General Cadastre
Law, passed in 1975, forms the basis for a practical land registration system,
but -- most likely because of overambition and complexity -- implementation of
the General Cadastre has been sparse: 95 percent of rural land and 99 percent
of urban land are still unregistered. The lack of a fully operational
cadastre prevents the land market from operating properly; hampers private
investment in agriculture, housing, and industry; precludes mortgage
financing; and prevents formulation and implementation of sound land-taxation
policy. In 1989, the Government, in recognition of these limitations,
established the National Cadastre Agency (ANC) as an autonomous public agency
(EPA) and, in February 1992, entrusted it with carrying out the General
Cadastre Establishment Program (GCEP) within the next 15 years.
Simultaneously, ANC's financial management was decentralized. ANC still needs
institutional strengthening to enable it to function smoothly.
7.          Rationale for Bank Involyement.  The proposed project is a key
part of the economic reform process that the Bank supports in Algeria, with
emphasis on private sector development. Planned operations in several sectors
have strong connections with land registration. The proposed project would
also ease future Bank work in the development of financial lending
intermediation, and in water and environmental management. Experience with
land registration projects in other countries (Tunisia, Thailand, Brazil, Cote
d'Ivoire, and Indonesia) gives the Bank a comparative advantage to assist
Algeria in developing and implementing a functional cadastre.
8.          Project Objectives.  By supporting the implementation of the
cadastre, the project would help the Government to establish the proper legal
and institutional framework to ensure a functional land market; to foster
private investment in agriculture, housing, and industry; and to lay the
foundation for a sound land-taxation policy. Project objectives are to: (a)
strengthen the institutions charged with implementing the cadastre; (b)
support an increase in annual land registration over four years; and (c)
develop cadastre-based land information systems (LIS) for taxation and other
land-related uses.



-3-
9.          Project DescriRtion.  The project would include three components:
(a) a four-year cadastral mapping program for 3 million ha of rural land and
36,000 ha of urban land, during which mapping techniques would be tested, and
computerized land registration and map production would be introduced; (b)
institutional strengthening of ANC; and (c) provision of project-related
technical assistance, training, and studies. Projects elements include aerial
photography; computer, mapping, and field survey equipment; vehicles,
furniture, small equipment, and materials; technical assistance, training, and
studies; and civil works.
10.         Project Imnlementation.  ANC would execute the project, except for
aerial photography, for which the National Mapping Institute (INC) will be
responsible, and specific parts of the technical assistance component, for
which the General Directorate of Lands (DGDN) and the Ministries of Justice
and Agriculture would be responsible. The Director of ANC would be the GCEP
and Project Director, under the supervision of the ANC Bc-rd chaired by the
Director General of DGDN. A GCEP implementation team would be appointed in
ANC. It would include the program manager, the project accountant, and the
training manager.
11.         Cost and Financing.  The proposed project, costing about US$96.0
million equivalent, to be implemented in 4 years, would be financed as
follows: (a) the proposed IBRD loan of US$33 million; and (b) Government
financing of US$63.0 million equivalent. The proposed Bank loan would cover
about 95 percent of the project's estimated foreign costs, equivalent to about
46 percent of total project cost net of taxes. The Government would finance
the remaining foreign costs as well as 100 percent of local costs including
US$23.6 million of taxes and duties   A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the stacus of Bank Group operations in Algeria are given
in Schedules C and D respectively. The staff appraisal report No. 10346-AL,
dated Nay 21, 1992 is being distributed separately.
12.         Principal Actions Agreed Upon
(a) Loan effectiveness conditions are as follows:
(i) governmental approval of a four-year ANC performance plan
for the implementation of the GCEP; (ii) governmental
approval of the first annual budget for the implementation of
the GCEP; (iii) recruitment of consultants to carry out the
organization and management study and the training program
study; and (iv) recruitment of 12 administrative accountants
by ANC.



-4-
(b) In addition, principal loan covenants are as follows:
(i) the government will submit satisfactory annual GCEP
implementation budgets to the Bank; (ii) ANC will submit
annual project progress reports to the Bank with full updates
of monitoring indicators; and (iii) by November 30, 1992,
Government will submit to the Bank a time-bound action plan
indicating how it proposes to meet its audit requirements
under the project.
13.         Benefits.  The main benefits of the proposed project are a strong
contribution to private sector development through greater individual security
of land tenure, and a new and accurate cadastral map of Algeria's densely
populated usable land. The current lack of these, as well as s properly
functioning land market, make project benefits impossible to quantify at this
time, but implementation of the project is expected to provide a basis for
quantitative valuation in the future. Preliminary information suggests that,
on average, titled rural land is worth 60 percent more than undocumented land.
14.         kro2ect Sustainability.  Although the Government would bear
Initial costs for cadastre setup, ANC operations would be increasingly
financed by fees paid by cadastre users. This evolution would be monitored
through the four-year ANC performance plan that was reviewed during
negotiations. Approval of the plan would be a condition of effectiveness. In
addition, strengthening the institutions concerned will contribute to
sustaining the cadastre establishment and maintenance proce3s.
15.         Rlsks.  The project's main risk is that the institutional
strengthening component may not be carried out at a sufficiently rapid pace co
enable ANC to use efficiently its increasing technical capacity to implement
the GCEP. This risk is minimized by making the cadastre as simple as
possible, setting it within a strong institutional framework, and defining
performance indicators and targets which will be monitored through the above-
mentioned performance plan.
16.         Lessons from Previous Bank Ivmolvement.  Land registration
projects have been prepared by the Bank in Tunisia, Thailand, Brazil, C6te
d'Ivoire, and Indonesia. Experience gained in Tunisia shows that sharing
responsibilities among several institutions can adversely affect cadastre
implementation. The preparation of the proposed project has addressed this
issue by concentrating the cadastre setup within ANC. Experience gained in
Thailand and Brazil shows that the institution in charge of the cadastre needs
a strong management and organization. The second component of the proposed
project includes technical assistance and training in this field, and hiring
consultants to carry out an ANC organization and management study would be a
condition of effectiveness. Experience gained in Cote d'Ivoire and Indonesia
shows that simple procedures, even if they do not completely assure land
rights, are more practical than perfected complex ones. Project preparation
has addressed this issue; the Government simplified cadastre procedures in
April 1992 and procedural fine tuning is included in the first component.



*5-
17.         The main lessons learned from the implementation of Bank projects
in Algeria are: (a) to avoid overly complex project design; (b) to ensure the
full commitment of the Government at each stage of project preparation; (c) to
ensure timely availability of technical assistance, where such assistance is
required; and (d) to take special measures to ensure satisfactory project
accounting and auditing. The proposed project has taken this experience into
account through an intensive and detailed dialogue with the Government during
project preparation and appraisal. The employment of consultants for the
management study is a condition of loan effectiveness. Accounting and
auditing have been addressed under the project by stipulating the recruitment
of 12 administrative accountants as a condition of loan effectiveness and by
including a covenant in the loan agreement requiring the Government to prepare
an action plan for ensuring that all audit requirements under the project will
be fully met.
18.         Environmental Imgact.  While the overall environmental impact of
the project is expected to be positive, measures have been provided to avoid
possiblt envirormental risk such as inappropriate titling and use of wetlands
and protected areas. To this effect, t;e project would include the design of
a Land Information System (LIS) which would provide the institutions concerned
(Ministry of Housing, Ministry of Agriculture, National Agency for Environment
Protection and Irrigation and Drainage Management Agency) with relevant land-
related data. This LIS would be managed by ANC under the supervision of an
LIS user group that would include, inter alia, the above-mentioned agencies.
The project is classified under Category B.
19.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
