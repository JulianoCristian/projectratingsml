Project\n            objectives are to:  (a) strengthen the institutions that\n            implement the cadastre; (b) support an increase of annual\n            land registration over four years; and (c) develop\n            cadastre-based information systems for taxation and other\n            land-related uses.  The project includes three components:\n            (a) a four-year cadastral mapping program for 3 million ha\n            of rural land and 36,000 ha of urban land, during which\n            mapping techniques will be tested, and computerized land\n            registration and map production will be introduced; (b)\n            strengthening of the National Cadastre Agency; and (c)\n            provision of project-related technical assistance, training,\n            and studies."}, "docdt": "1992-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
