The most important impact\n            of current practices is ozone layer depletion caused by MB.\n            For phosphine, no evidence of impact, except the trouble\n            when collecting phosphine tablets that are not completely\n            decomposed since it is easy to generate flames and\n            potentially explosions. Moreover, phosphine may corrode\n            copper and electronic equipments and cause pest resistance.\n            High efficacy to control pests for durable commodities. Need\n            longer exposure period and may cause resistance of insects\n            if not properly done. Both MB and chemicals used for\n            structure treatment may cause negative impact to\n            environment. Mitigation measures include: 1) development of\n            pest control standards for storage facilities; 2)\n            development and implementation of accreditation program for\n            storage facilities; 3) local and oversea training of\n            Department of Agriculture (DOA) officers that are not the\n            trainers of authorized training centers; 4) development of\n            training modules; 5) modification of fumigation enclosure;\n            and 6) training of MB users and training updates."}, "docdt": "2010-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
