F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)

The overall objective of the Project was to assist the Recipient in carrying out its Country
Program so as to phase-out the use of ozone depleting substance (ODS) within its territory
through, inter alia: (a) the introduction of appropriate technology measures; (b) the institutional
strengthening of responsible governmental entities; and (c) the implementation of specific cost-
effective priority investments to reduce consumption of ozone depleting substances.

This project was an integral part of international activities which have been undertaken since
1987 to reverse the damage to the Ozone layer. It is anticipated that this process will take sixty to
seventy years to complete. However, there is reason to assume that the global development
objective will be met, even though it is in the very distant future.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications

The revised GEO of the Project was to assist the Recipient in carrying out its Country Program so
as to phase-out ODS consumption within its territory.

The reason for revision of the GEO was the project implementation modality shifted from sub-
project-by-sub-project to sector plan.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Montreal Protocol
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (MP) was adopted in 1987 in
response to growing global recognition that concerted international action was required to protect
the earth’s ozone layer, a stratospheric level filter that shields the earth and protects human and
ecosystem health from the sun’s dangerous ultraviolet radiation.

The Royal Thai Government (RTG) acceded to the Montreal Protocol on July 7, 1989 and has
since ratified the Protocol’s four subsequent amendments. Thailand was classified as a country
operating under Article 5(1) of the MP and became eligible for technical and financial assistance
from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MLF). Thailand
neither produced nor exported any of the ozone depleting substances (ODS) controlled under the
MP. Total demand for all controlled chemicals was met through imports. Due to Thailand’s fast
economic growth, its ODS consumption increased by 23% p.a. between 1986 and 1990. In 1991,
Thailand consumed 15,600 tons of ODS, equivalent to an Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) of
10,040 tons.

The MP established time-bound targets to reduce the production and consumption of various
ODS including: (i) chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in refrigeration, aerosol, solvents, and foam
applications; (ii) halons used in fire protection; (iii) carbon tetrachloride (CTC) used as a cleaning
agent; (iv) methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane or TCA) used as an industrial solvent; and
(v) methyl bromide used in fumigation. The reduction and phase-out targets of ODS
consumption1 addressed under this project are summarized in Table 1.

In order to receive financial assistance from the MLF, the Department of Industrial Works (DIW),
the country’s focal point on MP, prepared a Country Program (CP) with Bank assistance.
Approved by the Multilateral Fund Executive Committee (ExCom) in November 1993, the CP
outlined policies and actions to enable Thailand to maintain compliance with the MP phase-out
targets, provided that sufficient funds to support incremental costs and the technologies required
to achieve a sustainable transition to alternatives were made available.

Rationale for World Bank Support to Thailand’s ODS Phase-out Objectives

The World Bank is one of the three implementing agencies2 that were initially requested by the
Parties to the MP to serve as an implementing agency to channel financial and technical support
from the Multilateral Fund (MLF) of the MP to Parties operating under Article 5, paragraph 1, of
the MP.

One of the key strategic components of the Country Programme was conversion of ODS
technology to ozone-friendly technology in the relevant sectors. A number of investment sub-
projects were approved by the ExCom to Thailand to be implemented through agencies such as
the Bank.

The Bank’s focus on economic development, while ensuring environmental sustainability, placed
it in a good position to support ODS phase-out, where sustained and sustainable industrial
expansion would need to include environmental considerations. The Project was consistent with
Thailand Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 13458-TH dated August 9, 1994), in
particular, the fourth pillar on “Improvement in environmental and natural resource
management”. The CAS specifically mentioned that an ODS phase-out project was under
preparation to support this pillar.

Moreover, the project was in line with the 7th National Economic and Social Development Plan
(NESDP) 1992-1996. The NESDP aimed to address the global climate change impacts attributed
to increasing deforestation and CFC consumption used in the industrial sectors. Therefore, this
project was designed to assist Thailand to support the implementation of the 7th NESDP.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project objective as stated in the Memorandum and Recommendation of the Director (MOD)
was “to support the Government program to phase out ODS by (a) establishing an efficient
mechanism for executing ODS phase out projects through local institutions, and (b) implementing
an initial group of cost effective priority subprojects.” The indicators identified by the MOD were
the number of completed sub-projects (45-55) and expected ODS consumption reduction of
3,000-4,000 ODP tons.

The overall objective of the Project (as expressed in Schedule 2 of the 1994 Grant Agreement)
was to assist the Recipient in carrying out its Country Program so as to phase-out the use of ozone
depleting substance (ODS) within its territory through, inter alia: (a) the introduction of
appropriate technology measures; (b) the institutional strengthening of responsible governmental
entities; and (c) the implementation of specific cost-effective priority investments to reduce
consumption of ozone depleting substances.

For the purpose of the ICR, the GEO of the Grant Agreement (GA) will be used to assess the
achievement of the Project.




2
  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank were
the first three agencies requested by the Parties to the MP to serve as implementing agencies of the MLF. United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) was included as another implementing agency at the Fourth Meeting of the Parties in 1992.




                                                                2
1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

The revised GEO of the Project was to assist the Recipient in carrying out its Country Program so
as to phase-out ODS consumption within its territory.

The GEO was revised as part of the 2002 project restructuring to reflect a shift in the project
implementation modality from sub-project-by-sub-project to a sector plan. (National CFC Phase
out project - NCFCP)

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The beneficiaries of the Project, as originally conceived, were local enterprises introducing ODS-
friendly technologies. The Department of Industrial Works (DIW) and the Project’s financial
agent, Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT), were in charge of implementing the
Project. DIW and IFCT would benefit from capacity building related to large-scale project
management. National ODS-using enterprises would receive financing to cover incremental costs
of conversion from ODS to ODS-friendly technologies. The bulk of eligible enterprises included
manufacturers of foam, household and commercial refrigeration equipment, and mixed
technology circuit card assemblies used in electronics applications.
Following the inclusion of the multi-year National CFC Phase-out Plan (NCFCP) in 2002 and
National Methyl Bromide Phase-out Plan (NMBPP) in 2005:
    i.     Additional small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in the aerosol, foam, and solvent
           (garment and textile, and manufacturing) sectors benefitted from training and subsidies
           provided for technological conversion;
    ii.    Owners of storage facilities and commercial fumigators benefitted from training,
           subsidies for modification of existing facilities, and received fumigation and pest
           management equipment;
    iii.   The Department of Land Transport (DLT), Department of Skill Development (DSD),
           Office of Agricultural Research and Development (OARD), Customs Department, Office
           of Vocational Education Commission (OVEC) and other local training institutes
           benefitted from training of trainers and received training equipment;
    iv.    Other national government agencies including Thailand Textile Institute (THTI), Allergy
           and Immunology Society of Thailand, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and various
           government units, benefitted from institutional strengthening and inter-institutional
           coordination, which allowed them to contribute to the sustainable phase-out of ODS in
           Thailand;
    v.     Capacity-building for the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the focal point of NMBPP,
           and the Government Savings Bank (GSB), the Project’s second financial agent, was
           financed by the Project; and
    vi.    Institutional strengthening benefitted the DIW’s National Ozone Unit to fulfill
           Thailand’s obligations under the Montreal Protocol to collect, monitor and report data on
           ODS import and export.

Finally, as beneficiary enterprises produced primarily consumer goods, consumers benefitted
from higher quality products.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)




                                                  3
The original Project had only one part (as expressed in Schedule 2 of the GA) which was the
provision of sub-grant agreements for carrying out the implementation of sub-projects. As
deduced from the GEO, the subprojects would include activities to introduce appropriate
technology measures; carry out institutional strengthening of responsible governmental entities;
and implement specific cost-effective priority investments to reduce consumption of ODS. Annex
I of the MOD provided list of sub-projects with 12 already pre-appraised, two under preparation,
and another 12 that had been identified. An additional 40 sub-projects were added to the Project
during the period 1994-2001. These sub-projects will be referred to as “pre-NCFCP” sub-
projects.

1.6 Revised Components

During the project preparation, the number of identified sub-projects was below the expected
number of sub-projects to be financed under the GA (45-55 sub-projects). Therefore, the original
GA was designed as an umbrella grant agreement, under which any additional sub-projects
approved by the ExCom after signing of the GA could be financed from the GA. The adoption of
an umbrella approach was conceived to facilitate the processing and management of multiple sub-
projects under a single GA. The original ceiling of the GA was US$40 million.

The GA was amended to accommodate implementation of the NCFCP and the Institutional
Strengthening (IS) project in 2002, and the NMBPP in 2005. The grant ceiling was increased
from US$40 million to US$45 million. While the original Project focused only on the provision
of sub-grant agreements to support large manufacturing enterprises to convert from ODS to ODS-
friendly technologies, the NCFCP and NMBPP had a significantly larger scope as both employed
a comprehensive approach to phase out the remaining use of ODSs within a specific target date.
NCFCP was the first national plan approved by the ExCom for which funding spanned multiple
years. Funds were released in tranches upon independent verification of the country’s
achievement of the agreed targets.
    o   National CFC Phase-out Plan (NCFCP). The ExCom approved the NCFCP in
        December 2001 with a funding envelope of US$14.7 million for phasing out the
        remaining consumption of CFCs, carbon tetrachloride and TCA (1,1,1-trichloroethane)
        by January 1, 2010. The remaining consumption of these ODSs were used by hundreds or
        even thousands of small and medium-size enterprises and service shops. Because each
        enterprise or service shop is entitled to a much smaller assistance from the MLF as its
        consumption of ODS was very small, costs of processing small sub-grants incurred by
        financial agents outpaced the fee income provided by the Project. Hence, a new
        implementation approach was needed to reduce transaction costs. In 2010, Article 5
        Parties including Thailand were, for the first time, subject to a control measure of the MP.
        Therefore, timely completion of phase-out activities was required in order to contribute to
        Thailand’s effort to meet the obligations of the MP. To ensure timely completion of
        activities, policy and regulatory incentives became increasingly important. The Project,
        therefore, introduced a combination of policy and regulatory measures, public awareness
        and training, and capacity building and technical assistance, as an integral part of the
        NCFCP.
    o   National Methyl Bromide Phase-out Plan (NMBPP). The ExCom approved a funding
        envelope of US$2.9 million for supporting the implementation of NMBPP in December
        2004. The NMBPP contained a number of investments, technical assistance, and capacity
        building activities designed to eliminate the consumption of Methyl Bromide (MB) by
        2013, two years ahead of its required phase-out date under the Protocol.



                                                 4
    o   Institutional Strengthening (IS) Project. Thailand had received funding from the MLF
        to support the operation of the National Ozone Unit (NOU) to implement the MP under
        MLF program called the “Institutional Strengthening Project” since 1992. The NOU was
        established in 1992 within DIW. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
        was the implementing agency (IA) of the IS at that time until the approval of the ExCom
        at its 35th Meeting; then the IS project was transferred from UNDP to the Bank upon the
        request of DIW.

A list of activities under NCFCP and NMBPP and brief descriptions are provided in Annex 2.

To accommodate the implementation of NCFCP and NMBPP activities, two additional
components were added to the project as expressed in Schedule 2 of the amended GA of 2002
and 2005 respectively. Therefore, the three components included:

Part A: Sub-grants: The implementation of NCFCP and NMBPP involved a wide range of
enterprises, with different implementation capacities, and sub-project implementation took these
different capacities into account. Part A of the project was amended to accommodate the
implementation of NCFCP and NMBPP. Micro enterprises that did not have the capacity to
implement the sub-project themselves were bundled into a group of sub-projects assisted by a
group coordinator (GC). The GC is a private firm, who was selected by DIW and DOA in
accordance with the World Bank’s Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultant to
coordinate with these micro enterprises during the sub-project implementation.

Part B: Strengthening of the Program Management Unit (PMU) of the Sector Plans: This
component was added for NCFCP in the 2002 amendment and NMBPP in the 2005 amendment
to strengthen the implementation capacity of the PMU in DIW and DOA through the provision of
equipment, consultants’ services and training. This allowed the PMUs to prepare, plan,
implement, monitor and enforce regulations. This component also covered capacity building of
selected government agencies involved in the implementation of NCFCP and NMBPP.

Part C: Institutional Strengthening: The component was added in the 2002 amendment to
strengthen capacity of the NOU to fulfill the obligations of Thailand including monitoring of
ODS consumption and submission of its ODS consumption to the Ozone Secretariat as per
Article 7 of the MP.

                                                       activities under the NCFCP in order to
                                                       ensure sustainability of ODS phase-out.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis. One of the goals outlined in the MOD was to establish an
efficient mechanism for executing ODS phase-out projects through local institutions. To do this,
the project looked into lessons learned from the Bank’s first experiences with MP operations in
other countries wherein serious delays occurred when investment projects were implemented
through a government department or ministry. Therefore, a dedicated financial agent, IFCT, was
given responsibility to implement the investment component in order to avoid the problem of
weak government project management capacity. DIW retained overall responsibility for
supervising implementation and ensuring that ODS projects were consistent with the CP. This
worked well as it provided a system of checks and balances.

Very rigorous technical analysis of the proposed sub-projects was conducted for CFC activities
(and for methyl bromide in 2004). Financial analysis was also required for each sub-project and
the analysis was done on a basis of incremental costs of converting away from each type of ODS
in a particular industrial sector as agreed by the ExCom. The analysis and choice of technology
were reviewed by Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG), Bank’s independent experts, prior
to submission of the subprojects to the ExCom for approval. Economic analysis was not
conducted because the project involved a global public good and it was not possible to
quantitatively capture health benefits from improved ozone layer conditions.

Assessment of the Project Design. The design at appraisal was simple, involving a clear
objective and one project component. Although at the time of appraisal in 1994 there was no
mandate for a results framework or even a logframe, the results to be achieved by the project
were well defined with no scope for manipulation by project proponents. The achievement was
measured at the enterprise level. According to the original design, each beneficiary enterprise
would sign sub-grant agreement with the financial intermediary individually. The adoption of an
umbrella approach was conceived to facilitate the processing and management of multiple sub-


                                                 6
projects under a single GA. Project implementation arrangements took into account the analysis
of institutional capacity and a comprehensive survey on ODS use under the Country Programme.
Initially, the project design fit very well because it intended to phase out ODS from large
enterprises, which was a low hanging fruit. However, the design of the sub-grant agreement at
the initial design did not specify the closing date of the sub-grant agreement. As a result, there
was no obligation for beneficiary enterprises to complete the sub-project by a specific date, which
then caused delay of some sub-projects.

However, by the late 1990s when large enterprises had already phased out ODS usage, the same
modality did not work with smaller enterprises, and the project design was changed by employing
a national/sectoral phase-out approach. Beside investment activity, technical assistance and
capacity building were added to the project to support the phaseout effort at the national level.
The achievement was measured at the national level. Lessons learned from the initial design
were taken into account in the new design by adopting first-come-first-serve basis and the
regulatory measures, which provided strong incentives for beneficiary enterprises to complete
their sub-project by specific date. The project also used the Government Savings Bank (GSB)
which specialized in dealing with small projects to be the financial intermediary of Part A of
NCFCP and NMBPP according to a request from DIW.

Adequacy of Government Commitment. Thailand’s commitment to the project was
demonstrated by ratification of the MP and acceptance of the ODS control schedule therein.

Assessment of Risks. This project pre-dated the risk matrix now included in Project Appraisal
Documents (PAD), but reviews of annual work programs (AWPs) and annual verification reports
provided a mechanism to identify and mitigate issues as they arose. The MOD identified
institutional weakness of implementing agencies as one of the risks that could slow down project
execution. This was addressed under the IS Project approved by ExCom in March 1993 and
implemented by UNDP. There were technical and commercial risks related to the introduction of
technologies which were new to Thailand at the time. These risks were minimized by providing
TA to participating enterprises and by the use of technologies which had been internationally
tested and commercialized.

Quality at Entry: Overall quality of design is considered satisfactory with several aspects highly
satisfactory. The Project benefits from strong international consensus on the need to control and
phase-out the use of ozone depleting chemicals. The consensus was built on a solid base of
scientific analysis. The subprojects benefitted from extensive technical analysis and
independently review by OORG. The use of transparently defined cost-effectiveness criteria and
results-based disbursement are highly satisfactory aspects. In 2010, the Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) of the Bank undertook an assessment of this project as part of Quality Assessment of
Lending Portfolio (QALP2). The QAG rated overall quality of design as “Satisfactory” with
strategic relevance and approach and realism of project design and risks rated highly satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

In total, Project implementation took almost twenty years (August 1994-December 2013) and
resulted in the successful completion of 52 pre-NCFCP sub-projects and two national ODS
phase-out plans. This section summarizes the key factors in implementing the four groups of
activities: pre-NCFCP sub-projects, NCFCP, NMBPP, and IS of the NOU.

A. Pre-NCFCP sub-projects



                                                7
Implementation: There were 56 pre-NCFCP sub-projects approved under the GA. Fifty-two
sub-projects were fully implemented, while the remaining four were cancelled because the
enterprises decided to terminate their sub-projects. Three of the total 52 sub-projects were
approved as either terminal umbrella or demonstration sub-projects, which aimed to gather a
group of remaining enterprises in the commercial refrigeration and halon sectors to convert to
alternative technology. The Project, therefore, covered financing of conversion at 350 enterprises
from 52 completed sub-projects.

Keys for implementation success: Accomplishments of pre-NCFCP sub-projects were attributed
to the simple implementation procedures and strong cooperation among relevant agencies (DIW,
IFCT, beneficiaries and the Bank). Implementation success can also be attributed to innovations
between DIW, IFCT and the Bank as follows:
    a) Introduction of the Voucher System: Two sub-projects assisted about 50 service shops in
       the mobile air-conditioning (MAC) servicing sector and 231 small and medium size
       enterprises (SME) in the commercial refrigeration. An innovative approach known as the
       “voucher scheme” was introduced by the Bank to handle large numbers of enterprises in
       a sub-project since it was not practical to have a sub-grant agreement with each
       enterprise. The voucher system allowed beneficiary enterprises to purchase the required
       equipment from any suppliers accredited or prequalified by DIW. The voucher scheme
       was subsequently used as the model for implementing sub-projects involving a large
       number of SMEs in NCFCP, NMBPP and in other countries.
    b) Regulation to support ODS phase-out: The pre-NCFCP sub-projects enabled the RTG to
       enact regulations to ban the use of CFCs after the completion of sub-projects in the
       sector:
            o   Thailand was the first developing country that promulgated regulations to
                prohibit the use of CFCs in the manufacture of domestic refrigerators and to
                prohibit import of CFC-based domestic refrigerators in 1997, which was only one
                year after the completed phase-out in developed countries.
            o   Moreover, the regulations included a ban on the use of CFCs in the
                manufacturers of commercial refrigerators and prohibited the import of CFC-
                based commercial refrigerators in 2004.
        These regulations played a vital role in sustaining the phase-out of CFCs in the
        manufacturing and servicing sector.

Factors affecting implementation. Main issues and factors affecting implementation of pre-
NCFCP sub-projects were implementation delay due to different reasons. First, the financial
intermediary was unfamiliar with the World Bank guidelines in term of enterprise procurement.
Second, eligibility criteria of the ExCom were not cleared at the beginning. The MP anchor team
had to come up with manual/instruction on how to determine funding eligibility in accordance
with the ExCom criteria. Moreover, the East Asia economic crisis between 1997 and 1999
caused a tightening of credits which made it considerably more difficult for enterprises to secure
funds to purchase equipment before claims for reimbursement could be made to IFCT. Given
that sub-grant agreement did not indicate closing date of the sub-grant agreement, some
enterprises decided to delay the procurement of equipment until economic situations improved.

The project also encountered specific situations., For commercial refrigerator terminal umbrella
sub-project, it was difficult to obtain supporting documentation from SMEs to confirm their ODS
consumption as most of them did not have systematic filing. It took a year for these enterprises to



                                                8
acquire supporting documents to prove their eligibility for funding. The lack of experience in
procurement using ICB under commercial refrigerator terminal umbrella project also resulted in
delays. This sub-project involved procurement of foam injection machines for 24 commercial
refrigeration manufacturers. The GC for this sub-project took almost one year to prepare bidding
documents and execute three rounds of ICB before the procurement process was completed. For
halon management program and halon recovery, recycling and banking sub-project, there was a
significant delay in deciding to change the design from physical halon banking to electronic
banking. After sub-project approval in 2000, it took time for DIW to decide that a study on halon
inventory was needed to determine whether Thailand would need the physical halon banking or
electronic halon banking. The study was completed in 2004 and, based on the study, DIW finally
decided to implement the electronic halon banking rather than the approved physical halon
banking as the quantity of halons installed in the country could not justify the large investment
associated with establishment of a physical halon bank. Therefore, DIW revised and submitted
the sub-project proposal to the ExCom in 2005 to obtain the ExCom approval on the revised
implementation modality. The implementation of revised modality was completed in 2010.
These delays led to several extensions of the project closing date.

In addition to implementation delays, the subproject approach in the initial design was capable of
phasing-out a defined amount of ODS consumption. Its limitation was that in tandem, other ODS-
using companies could increase their ODS consumption given the lack of a more structured
sectoral and national approach for phasing out ODS in a sustainable manner. As a result, overall
ODS consumption at the national level prior to 2000 remained un-controlled. The sub-project
modality at the initial stage did not allow for, nor ensure, sustained aggregate reductions of ODS
that was necessary to achieve the Protocol’s phase-out targets in a timely manner.              The
restructuring of the project in 2002 addressed the above remained un-controlled ODS by adopting
the national approach.


B. National CFC Phase Out Project (NCFCP)

Implementation: After the 2002 amendment, the Project Management Unit of DIW (DIW-PMU)
was established. Its responsibilities were to implement sub-grants (part A) and to conduct
capacity building (Part B) under the NCFCP until January 2007 when these responsibilities were
transferred to the NOU. At the end of the project, about 263 enterprises in the manufacturing
sector were supported by the project. Servicing technicians from approximately 5,784 Mobile Air
Conditioning (MAC) and refrigeration servicing workshops, which exceeded the original target of
4,050 servicing workshops, were trained and certified.

Keys for implementation success: In addition to strong cooperation among the relevant
agencies, accomplishments of NCFCP implementation can be attributed to the following:
    a) The Project was consistent with the evolving operational mechanism of the MLF,
       wherein funding approval was shifted from a project-by-project approach to a
       performance-based national phase-out approach aligned with the MP’s control measures
       for CFCs and other ODSs. Importantly, responsibility for sub-project level management,
       include determination of ODS phase-out, technical merit and cost-effectiveness, shifted
       to the national implementing agencies to facilitate the government to set up funding
       criteria to all remaining enterprises and establish regulatory measure to phase out ODS in
       each sector.
    b) High Capacity of the DIW-PMU. The set-up of the PMU as an independent unit with
       competent professionals and reporting directly to Director General enabled the PMU to


                                                9
       respond more effectively and efficiently, reduced procedural delays and accelerated
       implementation.
   c) Transparent and seamless implementation procedures: Implementation procedures of
      individual and group sub-projects in the Operation Policy Guidelines (OPG) were
      transparent and in accordance with Bank guidelines. With regard to group sub-projects
      for which the voucher scheme was used, the implementation procedure was seamless.
      The use of GC reduced the burden of DIW and the financial intermediary in coordinating
      with the beneficiaries, that were very small enterprises and scattering across Thailand.
      Moreover, DIW-PMU distributed lists of beneficiaries and contact information to all
      accredited suppliers after vouchers were issued. This allowed equal opportunity for all
      accredited suppliers to access the enterprises and follow commercial practices.
   d) Flexibility: NCFCP was multi-year agreement project with long implementation time
      span. During this time span, industry situations could change from the situation
      prevailing at the time the project was originally designed. Flexibility to add/remove
      activities to suit the change in situation was critical. The RTG was given the flexibility
      of adding or removing activities without seeking the ExCom approval as long as the
      proposed activity contributed toward achievement of the NCFCP and consistent with the
      ExCom funding guidelines.
   e) Voucher scheme: The voucher scheme was proven as an effective and transparent tool to
      facilitate procurement of equipment for thousands of beneficiaries scattering across the
      country. The voucher scheme allowed equal opportunity for accredited suppliers to sell
      equipment to the beneficiaries based on commercial practices. Following the launch of
      the voucher scheme, the price of equipment declined 30%, which supported project
      efficiency and sustainability because servicing workshops were able to acquire equipment
      at more affordable prices.

Factors affecting implementation:
   a) Disbanding of the DIW-PMU. The MTR recommended changing the institutional
      structure of DIW-PMU from being an independent unit reporting directly to the Director
      General of DIW to integrating the PMU into the existing NOU, by citing the lack of
      effective communications, lack of knowledge transfer, and the need for integrated
      program management and sustaining the implementation capacity in the NOU. This
      change was also in line with the NCFCP plan to transfer the tasks remaining after 2006 to
      the NOU. DIW decided to integrate the PMU into the NOU in 2007. The QAG
      assessment agreed that the shift from a PMU to the NOU offered greater prospects for
      long-term sustainability. However, the disbanding of the PMU affected the overall
      implementation of the NCFCP as the experienced PMU staff left, and the new staff –
      while well educated – were young and relatively inexperienced and faced a steep
      learning curve in implementing the remaining tasks.
   b) Distribution of R&R machines: Difficulties in distributing recovery and recycling (R&R)
      machines to MAC servicing workshops were attributed to two factors. The first factor
      was contaminated refrigerant in the servicing sector during 2005-2008. During this
      period, several alternatives to CFC-12 (in addition to HFC-134a) and sub-standard blends
      were introduced in the domestic market. When charging different types of refrigerants
      or sub-standard blends into the MAC system, the MAC system would become
      contaminated. The contaminated refrigerants undermined the promotion of R&R
      machines because they damaged cleaned refrigerant in the cylinder, which would become
      unusable. The second factor affecting the R&R subsidy program was high counterpart
      funding requirement for acquisition of the equipment. The project provided subsidy of


                                              10
        about 55% of the equipment cost, while the rest would be borne by MAC servicing
        workshop. Risks of collecting contaminated and unusable refrigerants and the large
        amount of out-of-pocket contribution made investment in R&R machine financially
        unattractive.

C. National Methyl Bromide Phase Out Project (NMBPP)

Implementation: The Project Management Unit of the Department of Agriculture (DOA-PMU)
handled implementation of sub-grants (part A) and Strengthening of the PMU of the Sector Plans
(Part B) under the NMBPP until December 2013. By the closing date, the project had supported
about 115 enterprises to employ the code of good practice for phosphine fumigation and
integrated pest management (IPM) through investment sub-projects. DOA-PMU implemented
the NMBPP components and achieved methyl bromide reduction as planned.

Keys for implementation success: In addition to transparent and seamless implementation
procedures, flexibility, use of the voucher scheme described under the NCFCP, accomplishments
of the NMBPP were also attributed to the following:
    a) Strong cooperation among concerned parties: There was strong cooperation among
       DOA-PMU, GSB and the beneficiaries during sub-project preparation and implementation.
       Moreover, the Bank played a vital role in advising DOA-PMU and GSB to overcome the
       issues faced during implementation. For instance, the Bank suggested DOA-PMU to provide
       faced gas mask for insecticide as part of the equipment to be provided to small enterprises.
    b) Modification of implementation modality: DOA-PMU modified the original project
       proposal to reclassify beneficiaries based on updated information regarding methyl
       bromide use patterns. This allowed the RTG to provide appropriate assistance to suit all
       beneficiaries’ actual needs.
    c) Training provided to beneficiaries: Training for the beneficiary enterprises on the code of
       good practice for fumigation and fumigation equipment has strengthened their in-house
       fumigation teams to fumigate more effectively and safely. As a result, unnecessary re-
       fumigation was eliminated and efficiency increased.            Involvement of the right
       stakeholders and this win-win approach secured strong buy-in from stakeholders and
       resulted in successful implementation.

Factors affecting implementation: There were no serious operational issues that affected the
achievement of the objective of NMBPP. However, there were implementation difficulties and
delays, which affected the beneficiaries enrolling in the project and which delayed completion of
some sub-projects. These factors are summarized below:
    a) Enterprise participation in NMBPP: Some enterprises were not able to provide
       documentation to demonstrate their eligibility due to inadequate record-keeping. Moreover,
       the limited amount of grant funds was not attractive enough for many of them to participate in
       the NMBPP considering the amount of supporting documentations required. Unlike the
       industrial sector, in which ODSs were used in the main business processes, fumigation was a
       tiny part of their business, and the enterprises did not realize the importance of following
       good practices for fumigation.
    b) Revision of implementation modality: To reflect the actual needs for phasing out methyl
       bromide, DOA-PMU proposed to change implementation modality for providing assistance
       to beneficiary enterprises in mid 2008. However, the proposed change could not be done prior



                                                11
        to ExCom’s approval. To secure ExCom’s approval on the new implementation modality
        resulted in delays in implementation of some sub-projects until April 2009.
    c) Need for Pest Management Plan (PMP): After the ExCom approved the revised
       implementation modality, project implementation could not proceed until a Pest Management
       Plan (PMP) acceptable to the Bank was prepared given that the NMBPP involved the use of
       fumigants and pesticides. The DOA-prepared a PMP which was approved by the Bank in
       November 2010.
    d) Flooding crisis in 2011: In the last quarter of 2011, severe flooding in the north and central
       part of Thailand brought project implementation under the NMBPP to a halt as most of
       the beneficiaries were in the affected areas.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. This project predated the Bank’s results framework or even log frame requirements.
However, the project was subjected to the MP’s sophisticated system of baselines, targets and
M&E. In addition, disbursements were performance-based, with clear M&E standards,
definitions, responsibilities, a timetable and independent annual verification. If targets were not
met, there was no additional disbursement from the MLF.

Implementation. M&E was carried out as follows:
    o   Progress reporting: Progress reports were prepared by DIW and DOA and submitted to
        the MLF Secretariat through the Bank. Sub-projects with significant implementation
        delays were specifically required by the MLF secretariat to be reported in a separate
        template.
    o   Annual work programs (AWP) and biennial work programs (BWP): Implementation
        of the NCFCP and NMBPP was monitored and recorded through AWPs and BWPs,
        respectively, which were submitted to the ExCom along with consumption verification
        reports. The AWPs and BWPs outlined the accomplishments and outcomes of activities
        undertaken in the previous year and the planned actions for the next year. AWPs and
        BWPs provided mechanisms for DIW and DOA to review and adjust their strategies and
        work plans during the implementation on a regular basis. Some activities that had
        thought to be needed at the preparation stage were removed from the project as they were
        no longer relevant due to changing circumstances. The resources freed up from removal
        of outdated activities were made available to support key activities that had not been
        anticipated during the preparation. These enabled executing agencies to utilize the
        resources provided by the MLF in the most cost effective manner. For example,
        provision of refrigerant leak identifiers for private inspection stations was removed
        because many of them had invested in the equipment on their own. The resources freed
        up from this activity were used to provide training equipment and train-the-trainer
        activities of all vocational schools in Thailand. This led to a change in their curriculum
        which is a sustainable approach as all new technicians will be aware of the ozone layer
        protection issue.
    o   Consumption verification report: Consumption of ODSs to be phased out under the
        NCFCP was audited and verification reports were prepared by an independent auditor on
        an annual basis. The verification reports were used to confirm Thailand’s compliance
        with the reduction targets as agreed with the ExCom. In addition, verification reports also
        included potential weaknesses identified within the period audited and recommendations
        to improve the existing system to ensure compliance with the GA.


                                                12
Utilization. The Bank, through its supervision missions and all reports submitted by the
Borrower, monitored and evaluated implementation progress to identify any potential issues that
could undermine achievement of the GEO. Based on these experiences, the Bank provided
recommendations and advice to address these issues or make adjustments as necessary.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards

Under the Bank’s safeguards policy which was in place in 1994, the Project was rated as a
Category “C”. Hence, no specific safeguard actions were applied to the original project
components.

Nevertheless, Bank environmental specialists formed part of the core supervision team. The
Bank monitored the Project’s environmental aspects and ensured that relevant health and safety
issues were addressed during the design and implementation of each sub-project. The Bank also
ensured that all discarded ODS equipment was properly destroyed. The destruction of baseline
ODS equipment was certified by DIW under the witness of the financial intermediary.

With the addition of NMBPP to phase out methyl bromide, the Bank prepared an Integrated
Safeguard Datasheet in 2010 and reclassified the Project safeguard rating as category “B”. As
methyl bromide and its alternative are pesticides and were used for managing pests that could
affect agriculture or public health, Bank OP 4.09 on Pest Management was triggered as was Bank
OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment (EA). A Pest Management Plan (PMP) was prepared
by the Recipient to use as an EA instrument in ensuring that the phase-out of MB consumption
would be accomplished in a sustainable manner. The PMP was disclosed in country and at the
Infoshop on November 24, 2010. During the 2013 Mid-Term Review mission of NMBPP, the
Bank reviewed the objectives and targets set in the PMP and ascertained that project activities
were complying satisfactorily with the provisions of OP 4.09 and BP 4.01 Annex C. Pesticides
(fumigants) used in the project as an alternative to methyl bromide complied with both the
national pesticide legislation and selection criteria in OP 4.09 and their use was fully justified
under an IPM approach. The measures taken to reduce risks to the environment and human
health were adequate and consistent with the education, skills and equipment of users. All
fumigant applications were performed by fumigators who were duly trained and certified by
DOA, taking all the necessary precautions in compliance with national legislation. Overall,
compliance with safeguards policies was satisfactory.

2.4.2 Fiduciary

The 1994 GA designed that all procurement would follow Bank procurement guidelines
according to the thresholds for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and other procurement
methods. Procurement would be carried out by IFCT to avoid the weak procurement capacity in
the government agencies. After amendment of the Grant Agreement (GA) to accommodate
implementation of NCFCP and NMBPP, procurement for Part B and Part C of the project was
assigned to DIW and DOA. There was no risk assessment or risk mapping with mitigation
measures, and there was no requirement for a procurement plan. However, the project allowed
direct procurement through a voucher system and pre-selection of suppliers. These procedures
are considered efficient and economical to meet sub-project requirements. Overall compliance
with procurement policy was satisfactory.



                                               13
Financial management (FM) arrangements at entry were simple and a full FM assessment was not
required. The Bank formulated standard arrangements for reporting, external auditing,
disbursement including special account and statements of expenditures. These arrangements
appeared to be appropriate at that time.

During implementation, post procurement and expenditure reviews were carried out on a regular
basis by the Bank’s procurement and FM specialists. External audits were conducted on an
annual basis throughout the Project period and the audit opinions were unqualified (clean) as the
management letters did not reveal any major accountability or internal control issues. The audited
financial reports were submitted on time for DOA-PMU. The Bank assisted DIW, DOA, IFCT,
Thai Military Bank (TMB), and GSB in training new staff unfamiliar with Bank requirements.
Issues raised by the expenditure and post reviews were clarified and efficiently resolved.

DIW and DOA regularly attended the Financial Agent Workshops (FA) organized by the Bank’s
Environment Department and Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) meeting, which was
organized annually in Washington DC. Regional workshops were also organized biennially by
the Bank to review procedural and project issues, to update staff on ExCom decisions, and to
exchange lessons learned among participating countries. The outcomes of the workshops were
useful for DIW, DOA and financial intermediaries in the planning, implementation and
monitoring of the project in accordance with updated policy/decision and to ensure fiduciary
compliance of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Manufacturing sector: A follow-on project is not required to tackle the ODS addressed by the
Project as CFCs, TCA and carbon tetrachloride have been completely phased out. All conversion
sub-projects successfully adopted alternative technology as approved by the ExCom. Baseline
equipment has been rendered unusable and certified by DIW. Given (i) the destruction of baseline
equipment, (ii) the ban against importing CFCs, TCA, and carbon tetrachloride, and (iii) the ban
on the use of CFCs and TCA in manufacturing since 2005, it is unlikely that the beneficiary
enterprises would revert to CFCs.

Servicing sector: A next phase project is not required here either. Although the servicing sector
is allowed to use CFCs beyond 2010, their high price and limited availability had forced owners
of CFC-based equipment to retrofit or retire their existing equipment. Given the life time of CFC-
based equipment is around 10-15 years, it is anticipated that most of the CFC-based equipment
should have been retired already.

Country level: The regulatory frameworks to control the import and use of ODSs in Thailand are
still being enforced. Moreover, the project built institutional capacity of DIW and strengthened
cooperation among key stakeholders through the IS component. Work initiated under the Project
did lay the groundwork for the RTG to address the phase-out of hydro chlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs). Preparation for work in this new sector began within the context of this Project.
Experiences and lessons gained during more than 19 years of implementation of this project will
be applied to the implementation of the Stage I HCFC Phase-out Project (approved April 7, 2014)
between 2014 and 2018. This is the first in a series of projects whose overarching objective is to
contribute to Thailand’s efforts to reduce its HCFC consumption in accordance with the Montreal

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High Relevance

The project addressed an issue of high global importance and helped Thailand meet its
obligations under the Montreal Protocol to phase out consumption of ODS. The Project was one
of the first global public goods operations addressing environmental issues, and in some respects
it established a valuable precedent with continuing relevance. The project retained its relevance
throughout its life. It was specifically mentioned in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of
August 1994, June 1998, and January 2003. The project is also mentioned in the Interim Strategy
Note (FY10-12) and is linked to “Cluster III – Infrastructure and Climate Change” under the
Second Prong “Improving Competitiveness and Inclusive and Sustainable Development”.
Furthermore, approval of the follow-on project, the HCFC Phase-out Project (Stage I), on April 7,
2014, demonstrates the continued high relevance of HCFC phase-out for Thailand.

The Project design was considered state of the art in 1994. The original approach worked well
early in the project when large enterprises were the main beneficiaries. Subsequently the model of
project-by-project financing became inefficient and entailed high transaction costs. As a result,
the Bank modified the design towards an evolving program model using a national/sectoral
approach. This model provided flexibility for Thailand to add new chemicals to be phased out,
allowing the project to remain highly relevant throughout its long history.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

The achievement of the project fully complied with the revised GEO in 2002. The project
successfully assisted Thailand in phasing out its ODS consumption from 7,524 ODP tons in 1994
to zero by 2010, allowing Thailand to fulfill its MP obligations through three successive stages as
elaborated below. This was particularly important from a global perspective as Thailand
represented one of the ten largest consumers of ODS at the time of Project launch. As shown in
section 3.3, the cost effectiveness of the project was lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold
established by the ExCom.

Stage 1: Pre-NCFCP. The project aimed to assist 44-55 sub-projects to phaseout ODS. The
ExCom approved 56 sub-projects by 2001, but four of them were terminated by the beneficiary
enterprises, thus reducing the number of subprojects implemented to 52 sub-projects. The pre-
NCFCP sub-projects directly eliminated consumption of about 2,378 ODP tons of ODSs, or 79%
of the goal of eliminating at least 3,000 tons. Sectoral breakdown is shown below:

The above activities enabled RTG to enact supporting regulations to ban the use of CFC in the
manufacturing of domestic refrigerators in 1997 after the completion of the subprojects. The pre-
NCFCP subprojects were cost-effective in reducing consumption of ODS. The originally
estimated cost for reaching a 3,000 ton reduction was US$23.77 million, compared to the final
cost of $19.29 million. More information on cost efficiency is available in Section 3.3.

Stage 2: NCFCP. The introduction of the NCFCP in 2001 allowed RTG to accelerate the
phaseout of the remaining consumption of ODS ahead of the Montreal Protocol schedule. The
agreement between the ExCom and RTG required the country to meet annual performance targets
in exchange for the release of US$14.7 million pre-approved in principle by ExCom through nine
tranches of funds. The performance targets achieved complied with consumption as agreed with
the ExCom on an annual basis (see more detail in Figure 1 of Annex 2). Thailand also met its
additional performance targets agreed with the ExCom as follows: (i) ODS import control policy
operational by 2002, (ii) import quotas for CFCs (2002-2010) announced, criteria and procedures
for financial support for investment projects by 2003 established, (iii) MAC inspection program
announced, and (iv) the use of CFCs in the manufacturing sector by 2005 banned, and MAC
inspection requirement operational by 2005. The combination of investment activities for
conversion sub-projects, technical assistance, capacity building, implementation of quota system
and regulatory measures assisted Thailand to phase out consumption of ODS. In total, about
3,066 ODP tons of CFCs, 34 ODP tons of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and 7.52 ODP tons carbon
tetrachloride were phased out as planned, Thailand was able to completely phase out consumption
of these chemicals by 2010.

Stage 3: NMBPP. The ExCom approved US$2.9 million in December 2004 to eliminate the
consumption of methyl bromide by 2013, two years ahead of its required phase-out date under the
MP. One hundred and fifteen enterprises successfully adopted phosphine and integrated pest
management (IPM) to replace methyl bromide. The licensing system and management
information system was put in place to control import and use of methyl bromide. A laboratory
insect resistance control unit was established by the project to monitor tendency of insect
resistance to phosphine. This will assist the sustainable phaseout of methyl bromide. Eight
training centers were established and equipped with training equipment to provide training to
concerned stakeholders under the project. DOA established accreditation scheme to provide
incentive to obtaining psytosanitary certification to accredited enterprises without fumigation.

The project contributed to not only the reduction of methyl bromide for non-quarantine and pre-
shipment (non-QPS) application – consumption controlled under the MP-but also the reduction of
methyl bromide use for QPS applications, which is still exempted under the MP. As of December
2013, consumption of methyl bromide for non-QPS application was zero. From 2002, about
241.8 ODP tonnes of methyl bromide for non-QPS application were phased out from the
implementation of NMBPP through the combination of investment sub-projects to phaseout
methyl bromide consumption and sustain the use of phosphine, strengthening import and use of


                                                16
methyl bromide, incentive to avoid the use of fumigants, capacity building and public awareness.
Despite the rising trend of methyl bromide use for QPS application during 2005-2007, NMBPP
were able to reverse the trend of methyl bromide use for QPS application in the long term. Given
that the project strengthened capacity of private sector to employ alternative approach and the
government to control import and use of methyl bromide, a number of shipments were fumigated
with phosphine technology although methyl bromide was still allowed (QPS). Therefore, the use
of methyl bromide for QPS applications gradually declined from 335 ODP tonnes in 2007 to
192.1 ODP tonnes in 2012. The annual trend of methyl bromide used for QPS and non-QPS
application is shown in figure 2 of Annex 2.

Institutional Strengthening. The IS component strengthened the capacity of the NOU to
monitor consumption of all ODSs to meet the MP reduction schedule through the licensing and
quota system. As a result, Article 7 data and Country Programme Implementation Progress were
timely reported to the Ozone Secretariat and the MLF Secretariat on an annual basis as requested.
Reporting of Article 7 data is one of the most important obligations of the MP.

Reduction of ODS. Table 2 compares the reduction schedule according to the MP, the
maximum allowable consumption for Thailand from the implementation of NCFCP and NMBPP
as agreed with the ExCom (ahead of the MP schedule) and actual consumption. Table 2
highlights the impact of the Project’s contributions to the sustainable, accelerated phase-out of
Thailand’s ODS consumption.

3.3 Efficiency

Consistent with the project approval regime exercised by the ExCom, efficiency is assessed based
on the cost effectiveness (CE) of phase-out achieved. CE is defined as the amount of MLF grant
per unit weight of ODS phased-out in ODP kg. The cost effectiveness of the Project’s pre-
NCFCP sub-projects compared to CE thresholds established by the MLF for the various sectors
was similarly favorable, as outlined in Table 3 below.

Table 3 compares CE sub-project threshold established by the ExCom, approved by the ExCom
for the project and achieved from the project. The unit cost of phasing out ODS achieved
compares very favorably with the actual approved cost and the CE thresholds established by the
ExCom across all sectors of the project. The only exception was the solvent sector though it is
important to note that six out of 10 solvent sub-projects were approved prior to the establishment
of the CE thresholds in 1995. The average actual CE of project was US$6.45 per ODP kg, while
the average approved CE of the project was US$7.70 per ODP kg. In other words, the Project
achieved better CE than required by the MLF.

For the pre-NCFCP sub-projects, the actual achieved unit cost of phasing out ODS of 52 sub-
projects across all sectors was US$8.19 per ODP kg, which compares favorably to other ODS
projects within the Bank’s East Asia and the Pacific portfolio namely Phase 1 of the Philippines
(US$12.29 per ODP kg) and Malaysia (US$10.11 per ODP kg) ODS Phaseout Project.

For NCFCP, the actual achieved unit cost of phasing out CFCs, TCA and carbon tetrachloride
across all sectors was US$4.21 per ODP kg, which compares favorably with the CE of Phase 2 of
the Philippines (US$4.28 per ODP kg) and Indonesia (US$4.41 per ODP kg) NCFCP.

For NMBPP, Thailand was able to accelerate the phaseout of methyl bromide consumption two
years ahead of the Montreal Protocol phaseout target.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating for the project is satisfactory as evidenced by the following:

    a) High relevance of project’s objectives, design and implementation at start-up and
       remained so throughout its entire life;
    b) The Project helped ensure Thailand’s compliance with the MP’s ODS compliance regime
       as evidenced by the country’s data reporting under Article 7 of the MP;
    c) The project supported Thailand to promulgate regulations to prohibit the use of CFCs in
       the manufacture of domestic refrigerators and prohibit the import of CFC-based domestic
       refrigerators in 1997, which was only one year after the completed phase-out of CFCs in
       developed countries. Regulatory measures to prevent the back conversion to CFCs was
       recognized by the ExCom as an effective tool to supplement the investment activities;
    d) Thailand’s NCFCP was one of the first to adopt a national phase-out management plan
       modality under the MLF and this formed the basis upon which the MLF is now
       supporting the phase-out of consumption of HCFCs in Article 5 Parties; and
    e) Actual cost of phase-out in US$ per kg for pre-NCFCP, NCFCP and NMBPP was lower
       than the respective level approved by the ExCom (per Table 3 above).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not applicable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Project has strengthened the capacity of DIW, DOA, concerned government agencies and
financial intermediaries to develop, implement and monitor the turn-key strategies, which
integrated regulatory, technical assistance, and investment measures. The Project has
strengthened cooperation among concerned agencies to enforce ODS-related regulations. Finally,
the RTG was able to apply concepts and approaches for delivering technical and financial
assistance to thousands of beneficiaries scattering across the country. This institutional
strengthening can be applied to not only future MP related activities, but also other activities of a
similar nature.

 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
The phase-out of ODS achieved under the Project contributed to significant indirect global
environmental benefits as ODSs are greenhouse gases with global warming potential (GWP)
thousands times stronger than carbon dioxide (CO2). The CO2 equivalent impact of the phase-out
achieved under the Project is calculated to be 36 million tons, equivalent to taking 7 million cars
off the road permanently. Moreover, the Project provided indirect global benefits by reducing the
negative health effects associated with the depletion of ODS including skin cancers, immune
system deficiencies, eye cataracts in human beings and animals, as well as damage to agriculture
crops and marine organisms.

Thailand was one of the first two countries that agreed with the Bank’s proposal to adopt the
national phase-out approach. At that time, there were neither guidelines nor policies to provide
assistance for the national phase-out approach. Given that NCFCP was a turnkey project for
which the grant fund was approved to the country upon fulfilling obligations as agreed with the
ExCom, other developing countries subsequently followed the national phase-out approach to


                                                 20
phase-out remaining consumption of ODS. Innovation by the Bank in adopting the national
phase-out approach influenced subsequent operations of the MLF including the recent policy on
financial assistance for HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP).


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

There was no beneficiary survey carried out for the NCFCP. The beneficiary satisfaction survey
was undertaken in early 2013 as part of the mid-term review (MTR) for the NMBPP. Most of the
beneficiaries were satisfied with the sub-project design and implementation. Moreover, their
satisfaction with operation of the Management Information System (MIS) was high (please see
more detail in Annex 5).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible

The risk to development outcomes is rated negligible for the following reasons:
   a) With the global production phase-out of CFCs, halons, CTC, and TCA, the global supply
        of these substances was eliminated.
   b) Each of the sub-projects implemented resulted in the conversion away from ODS to
        alternative substances permanently, and the dismantling of old ODS-using equipment
        was verified.
   c) DIW and the Customs Department enforced the ban on imports of CFCs, halons, CTC,
        and TCA.
   d) RTG enacted regulations to ban the use of CFCs and TCA in all manufacturing sectors
        starting from September 2005.
   e) In the service sector, there will continue to be demand for servicing the remaining CFC-
        based equipment. However, the high price and limited availability of CFCs would force
        owners to retrofit or retire their existing equipment early. CFC demand will remain for a
        few years and could be met through stockpiles and the use of recovery and recycling
        machines.
   f) Although after the successful phaseout of CFC, halons, TCA, carbon tetrachloride and
        methyl bromide, RTG is still committed to comply with the remaining obligations under
        the MP, namely HCFCs. Under the MLF, Thailand received financial assistance from the
        MLF to implement HCFC Phaseout Management Plan Stage I through the Bank. HCFC
        phase-out project was approved by the Bank on April 7, 2014.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Project was prepared in conformity with operation of the MLF at the formative stage, when
implementation was based on the merit of each individual sub-project.



                                               21
As the project was approved at RVP level, only MOD was prepared as opposed to a project
appraisal document. The task team had to innovate in developing a project to support the MP and
produced a good result. They received sound peer review advice and management support. Bank
management also created an expert cadre which was helpful in supporting the design and
implementation of the MP operations. The skill mix of the team was appropriate; time and
resources were also appropriate, especially considering that the project became the model for
other MP operation. In addition, the amount of about US$178,000 was spent during project
preparation. This level of project preparation budget was very reasonable.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(Including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision efforts: The QAG panel considered Bank supervision provided highly satisfactory
attention to development effectiveness given excellent skill mix, continuity3 and technical support
from the Montreal Protocol unit in the former Environment anchor since 1994. The task team
focused consistently on the phase-out of the ODS chemicals, aided by simple but well-defined
M&E indicators which gave a clear picture of progress and issues. The umbrella grant agreement
employed by the Project provided flexibility for the Bank to add new activities and chemicals
when they are needed by the MP. In the past fifteen years, four TTLs and the fiduciary team of
this project were based in the Bangkok office. This has facilitated consultations and problem-
solving in a timely manner.

Over the 19-year implementation period, the Bank provided DIW and all other Project
counterparts with ODS policy and technical advice through regular supervision missions as well
as site-specific technical visits. Supervision missions were undertaken on average twice a year.
Site visits, which provided a first-hand understanding of on-ground implementation experiences,
were conducted as required and reported upon in annexes to the Project’s Aide Memoires.

The supervision missions were used to follow implementation progress, discuss problems
encountered, and to develop actions to resolve pending issues. Throughout implementation, the
Bank team worked closely with DIW, DOA, IFCT, TMB and GSB in delivering outputs such as
submission of the AWP, biennial work programs (BWP), verification reporting and compliance
with the performance indicators agreed with the ExCom. The Bank team also monitored
compliance with the Bank’s fiduciary requirements, reviewed procurement and disbursement
procedures and audit reports. The mission aide memoires were detailed and covered much ground
on procurement management, including recommendations on actions required to improve the
pace of implementation. However, mission aide memoires and ISRs were regularly completed,
providing a consistently satisfactory view of the implementation status of the Projects’ individual
sub-projects, NCFCP and NMBPP.

The mid-term review (MTR) of the pre-NCFCP and NCFCP was conducted in September 2006.
However, due to the strong opinion of the MTR author that may negatively impact the client
relation, the MTR report was not endorsed by the Bank management. For NMBPP, the MTR that
was planned in 2011 was postponed due to the devastating 2011 flood event. However, a MTR


3
  There were five TTLs over the 19 year period of implementation. There was one team member who worked for this project since
1996, who ensured smooth transitions from one task team leader to the next.




                                                              22
was conducted in early 2013 for the sustainability of methyl bromide. As the use for QPS
applications are exempted under the Montreal Protocol, the MTR for NMBPP suggested
recommendations for Thailand to strengthen necessary measures to improve the control of methyl
bromide for QPS applications after 2013.

The supervision effort by the Bank contributed to the following:
   a) RTG was able to comply with the MP obligations and also more aggressive reduction
       schedules as agreed with the ExCom under the NCFCP and NMBPP.
   b) Pending implementation issues could be settled in a timely manner due to timely and
       adequate supervision and coordination with DIW and other stakeholders except for a one
       year gap during late 2009-2010.
   c) The Bank provided support to DIW and DOA to formulate policy frameworks and
       implementation plans. The Bank negotiated with the MLF secretariat and ExCom to
       facilitate the approval of AWPs resulting in the timely release of funding tranches from
       the ExCom to Thailand which were critical to the timely implementation of NCFCP and
       NMBPP.
   d) Strong working relations between RTG and the Bank led to very effective cooperation in
       the implementation of the project. Given the strong working relations between RTG and
       the Bank and the Bank’s comparative advantage in supporting large-scale, complex
       projects, the capacity of its ODS technical and policy team, and the opportunity to link
       environmental efforts more closely with development objectives, the Bank became the
       sole implementing agency for ODS phase-out in Thailand starting 2001.

Notwithstanding the efforts above, there were some shortcomings in the Bank’s supervision,
some of which might have contributed to implementation delays in the NCFCP and NMBPP.
Firstly, the investment activities under NMBPP were delayed 18 months while the PMP was
being prepared by DOA and approved by the Bank. Implementation of the NMBPP could have
advanced faster if the Bank had informed DOA of the PMP requirement immediately after
ExCom approval. Generally, the Bank’s safeguards work could have been more rigorous, with
more emphasis on worker health and safety, and tighter reporting on safeguards supervision.
Secondly, the Bank should have revisited FM implementation aspects when new FM
requirements used in 2005 and two of the implementing agencies were also fiduciary agents to
channel grant funds to beneficiaries. Thirdly, there was a lack of communication from the Bank
during late 2009-2010. This affected project implementation as some activities were not able to
proceed without the Bank’s prior review and no-objection. This shortcoming was resolved with
the appointment of a new Task Team Leader in Bangkok. Given these shortcomings, the quality
of supervision is rated as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory because the performance in ensuring
quality at entry is rated as satisfactory and the quality of supervision is rated as satisfactory. In
line with ICR guidelines, this rating is considered applicable to the overall Bank performance in
the development and implementation of the project.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory


                                                 23
The government performance is rated as satisfactory because the Government demonstrated its
full commitments toward the project.
    o   RTG fulfilled its commitments to achieve the GEO of phasing out consumption of ODSs.
        The government was able to accelerate the phase-out of CFC, halon, TCA, CTC and
        methyl bromide consumption faster than prescribed under MP obligations;
    o   Through DIW, RTG effectively controlled the import and export of ODS through a
        licensing and quota system, which provided incentives for the phase-out of ODS and also
        for sustaining the phase-out;
    o   DIW also enacted regulations to ban the use of CFCs in the manufacturing of domestic
        refrigerators in 1997 and commercial refrigeration appliances in 2004, and later with the
        ban on the use of CFCs and TCA in all manufacturing processes to support the
        sustainable phase-out of ODS in 2005;
    o   Thailand was the first developing country that promulgated regulations to prohibit the
        use of CFCs in the manufacture of domestic refrigerators and prohibit the import of CFC-
        based domestic refrigerators in 1997, which was only one year after the completed phase-
        out of CFCs in developed countries; and
    o   Thailand was one of the first two countries that decided to implement the
        national/sectoral phase-out approach to phase out the remaining consumption of ODS in
        small and medium size enterprises. The national/sectoral approach was later employed as
        a norm for the operation of the Multilateral Fund.

DIW, DOA and other government agencies cooperated and established practical and
comprehensive implementation policies to implement the MP and phase-out ODS so that most
activities could be implemented and accomplished as planned. The Ministry of Commerce
enacted regulations to prohibit the import of CFC based refrigeration appliances. The Food and
Drug Administration issued an announcement to withdraw registration of CFC-MDI which
effectively resulted in the ban on imports of CFC metered dose inhalers. The Cabinet also
approved an amendment of the Ministerial Decree of the Transportation Act to include an
inspection of refrigerant in the MAC systems as part of the annual vehicle inspection.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Performance of DIW as the leading implementing agency for the Project was mixed. It was
highly satisfactory during the initial stages of implementation from 1994-2006 but then dropped
to moderately satisfactory afterwards due to the implementation delay. The implementation of the
remaining tasks after 2007 faced considerable implementation delays. Frequent changes of the
Division Chief position who oversaw the NOU exacerbated the situation as the new chief
typically arrived with little knowledge of ODS issues which created a constant learning curve and
caused implementation delays. While rotation of staff is normal, having five chiefs within 18
months was excessive. DOA’s performance in implementing NMBPP is considered satisfactory.
There were start-up delays but implementation was on schedule afterwards.

The DIW-PMU and DOA-PMU maintained adequate records and documentation as required. The
financial management system of the project was found moderately satisfactory for DIW-PMU
and satisfactory for DOA-PMU. External audits were conducted annually by independent auditors



                                               24
and the audit opinions were unqualified (clean). The management letters did not reveal any major
accountability or internal control issues. Audit reports were submitted timely for DOA-PMU.
Overall performance of procurement implementation was moderately satisfactory. There were
excessive delays in procuring refrigerant identifiers for DLT and DSD which might have
undermined DIW’s working relationship with the two long time partners. In spite of delays,
refrigerant identifiers were later delivered to both agencies as agreed. The performances of IFCT,
TMB and GSB as financial agents for the investment components are rated satisfactory. The sub-
project appraisal reports and the Project Completion Reports (PCRs) were prepared in conformity
with OPG requirements and the ExCom format respectively. Documentation and filing system
were systematically maintained.

The performances of DIW varied over the life of the Project and also varied across the
implementing agencies: DIW, DOA, IFCT, TMB and GSB. The implementing agencies were
able to successfully implement activities in the most complicate servicing sector to deal with
thousand of servicing workshops using their limited resources. However, there were some
shortcomings in the procurement or other operational issues, but solutions were found and
implemented. This section is therefore rated as satisfactory.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall borrower performance is rated as satisfactory as the performance of both the
Government and implementing agencies are rated as satisfactory as mentioned previously

6. Lessons Learned

Lessons learned from project preparation and implementations are as follows:

Effectiveness of integrated approaches: Technical and financial assistance from the MLF alone
would not have been enough to achieve the project’s objectives. Commitment from the
government and related stakeholders to the phase-out obligations was critical to ensure
compliance with all obligations in a smooth and sustainable manner. Integration of regulatory
frameworks, capacity building and technical and financial assistance should be considered as the
optimal approach.

Effectiveness of PMU: PMU was established to be responsible for the operation of the multi-
year project namely NCFCP and NMBPP. Due to a number of activities to be carried out under
the multi-year project, PMU should be staffed with competent and skilled personnel to ensure
effective implementation and delivery of the multi-year project in the future such as HCFC
Phaseout Project. This was demonstrated by outstanding performance of DIW-PMU during the
early stages of implementation and by DOA-PMU.

Transition plan: The disbanding of the DIW-PMU in January 2007, while in line with the
NCFCP plan and budget, led to severe disruptions as the NOU did not have the capacity and
experience to implement the remaining tasks. In hindsight, the Bank could have required DIW to
have an adequate transitional plan in place before disbanding the PMU and transferring its
functions to the understaffed NOU. This would have also ensured the stability of the NOU




                                               25
division chief given there were five changes within 18 months before agreeing to the institutional
structure change.

Complication of phasing out ODS in servicing sector: Implementation in the service sectors
was more complicated than in the manufacturing sector. Beneficiaries were small service
workshops, who normally did not want to expose themselves to government oversight and did not
have systematic record-keeping and filing. To deal more successfully with small enterprises,
incentive should be provided to these workshops to urge them to participate in the program. It is
important to establish simple eligibility criteria (as long as they are not against the relevant
guidelines and rules) in providing incentive to these servicing workshops.

Monitoring and evaluation. Although the project predated even the old logframe, a tight, well-
focused Project Development Objective (PDO) and clear baselines, annual verification and
accountability to MP greatly facilitated the monitoring of project progress toward achieving its
objectives. However, the Bank should have updated the Results Framework continuously in the
ISR for both Bank management and client.

Advantages of allowing successful, well-focused operations to continue. This operation lasted
almost 19 years from start to finish, but it demonstrates that older projects can be successful by
rolling through different aspects of ODS phase-out sequentially. Not having to prepare a new
PAD each time a new ODS was introduced for phase-out meant that the team was not distracted
by administrative tasks. However, the Bank’s reporting mechanisms (ISR reporting framework)
is not well designed to accommodate projects such as this.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Project was a useful program for Thailand to meet obligations under the Montreal Protocol.
It enabled all concerned parties and the public to realize the importance of ODS phase-out and the
negative environmental impact from the use of ODSs.

The NCFCP provided technical and financial assistance to ODS-consuming enterprises to convert
to alternative technologies effectively, strengthened the relationship between the government and
private sectors and facilitated the preparation and implementation of HCFC Phase-out
Management Plan (HPMP). During the implementation of the Project, there was the lack of
sufficient coordination and miscommunication between DIW and Bank during some periods,
which delayed the project implementation. The difference in culture might influence the working
culture for which the common understanding between two parties became essential. However, at
the final period of project implementation, there was regular communications and regular
supervision between DIW and the Bank, which resulted in more effective implementation. The
Bank played a vital role in providing support to DIW to overcome implementation challenges of
the remaining activities of the project. This collaborative and partnership approach resulted in
smooth implementation. The Bank staffs were found very competent in the subject, able to work
with DIW staffs, and were willing to assist DIW to timely implement the activities. One of the
implementation issues faced by DIW was the rotation of government officials. Given that the
project duration was long, there were the rotations of the key officers of both the Bank and DIW,
which affected the continuity of project implementation and the strategy to implement the project.




                                               26
The NMBPP obviously enhanced business capacity of the participating enterprises in complying
with national and international standards/regulations for fumigations and safety. The enterprise’s
perception on effective and safe fumigation improved after participating in the NMBPP.

A2.1      Pre-NCFCP Sub-projects

The MLF ExCom approved 56 sub-projects for Thailand in solvents, refrigeration, air-
conditioning, foams and recycling. Each sub-project included technical assistance to support
participating enterprises with technology transfer, design, training and implementation. Fifty-two
sub-projects were fully implemented, while the remaining four sub-projects were cancelled.

Of the 52 sub-projects implemented a total of 2,377.68 ODP tons of CFCs, methyl chloroform
and halons were phased-out as follows:
    −     Twenty two sub-projects were approved by the ExCom, but twenty sub-projects were
          implemented in the foam manufacturing sector resulting in the phase-out of 434.85 ODP
          tonnes.
    −     Twenty one sub-projects were approved by the ExCom, but twenty sub-projects were
          implemented in the refrigeration manufacturing sector resulting in the phase-out of
          1,129.41 ODP tonnes.
    −     Eleven sub-projects approved by the ExCom for the solvent sector, ten sub-projects were
          successfully implemented resulting in the phase-out of 96.02 ODP tonnes.
    −     Two sub-projects in the halon sector – Terminal halon-1211 and halon-1301 phase-out
          project for fire equipment manufacturers and suppliers converting to ABC powder, CO2,
          HFC-227ea and inert gases and Halon management programme, halon recovery,

While the ExCom approved these sub-projects individually, the 20 sub-projects under the
refrigeration sector covered the majority of the enterprises in the domestic and commercial
refrigerator subsectors. These sub-projects enabled RTG to enact supporting regulations to ban
the use of CFCs after the completion of the sub-projects. These regulations included:
     − Notification of Ministry of Industry issued in 1997. It prohibited the use of CFCs in the
         manufacturing of household refrigerators;
     − Notification of Ministry of Commerce issued in 1997. It prohibited the import of
         household refrigerators containing CFCs;


                                                37
    −    Notification of Ministry of Industry issued in 2004. It prohibited the use of CFCs in the
         manufacturing of commercial refrigerator.



A2.2     National CFC Phase-out Plan (NCFCP)

NCFCP Implementation
The introduction of the NCFCP into the Project in 2001 allowed RTG to tackle the phase-out of
the remaining CFC consumption in a manner consistent with the control schedule of the MP. The
agreement between the MLF ExCom and RTG required that the country meet annual
performance targets in exchange for the release of subsequent tranches of funds which had been
pre-approved ‘in principle’ by the ExCom. Achievement of these annual performance targets also
necessarily supported achievement of the GEO.

A2.2.1 Manufacturing Sector

The NCFCP identified remaining use of ODS by small and medium-size enterprises in the
aerosol, foam, garment and textile, and solvent sector. Table A2.2 lists the activities and briefly
describes each one.

Mandatory Requirement for MAC        The Department of Land Transport (DLT), which required that all vehicles
Inspection                           over seven years undergo annual engine inspections, would expand its
                                     inspection requirement to MACs. The Project would support the training of
                                     inspectors from about 680 private and government-owned inspection stations
                                     and provide each station with a refrigerant identifier which could identify CFC-

                                 and assist NOU to develop policy and regulations
Customs Training Program         Training materials developed and train-the-trainer program to be provided to
                                 the Customs training school of the Customs Department. Two refrigerant
                                 identifiers would also be given to each of the 29 major port/entry points across
                                 the country and the training institute of the Customs Department.

Aerosol-NCFCP: According to the NCFCP, three aerosol manufacturing enterprises were
eligible for financial assistance. One enterprise signed a sub-grant agreement with the GSB, but
the sub-project was subsequently cancelled as the enterprise decided to stop manufacturing the
products to be financed under NCFCP. The other two enterprises decided not to participate in the
NCFCP because they had already converted to alternative technology on their own.

Foam-NCFCP: About 100 foam manufacturing enterprises that had never received any financial
assistance from the MLF were identified during the preparation of NCFCP. These enterprises
were involved in rigid polyurethane, flexible polyurethane and integral skin foam applications.
To implement activities in the foam sector, DIW-PMU invited all polyol suppliers and system
houses to submit list of their interested in benefiting from the NCFCP. Finally, 53 foam
enterprises expressed their interest in the NCFCP. The difference between the figure in the
NCFCP (X) and actual implementation (Y) was because:
    −    Some enterprises listed in the NCFCP were duplicates because different names were
         submitted to DIW during the preparation of NCFCP; and
    −    Due to the high price of CFC-11, some enterprises could not afford the higher production
         cost and decided to convert to alternative technology on their own and did not want
         reimbursement from the NCFCP.

DIW-PMU also established the funding criteria for eligible foam enterprises, which were used as
the basis to determine eligible costs for each foam enterprise. Two implementation modalities
were implemented: individual sub-project and group sub-project:

    a) Individual sub-projects: Funding was provided for acquisition of foam injection machines
       for conversion, technology transfer and training to the enterprises, and expenditures for
       testing and trials. Technical assistance was provided by the polyol suppliers/system
       houses. Thirty-eight foam enterprises were identified under individual sub-projects, of
       which 30 enterprises received financing from the Project, while two were cancelled at
       project appraisal. The remaining six enterprises were deemed ineligible for financing.
    b) Group sub-projects: Beneficiaries were enterprises who had low CFC consumption in
       their process (maximum consumption of CFCs was one MT per year). The group sub-
       project was implemented through the voucher scheme, which was valued at US$6,000.
       One set of equipment comprising a stirrer and blade, mixing container, ventilation
       equipment and a chemical container shelf was provided to beneficiaries. There were 16
       foam enterprises identified under the group sub-project, of which 14 received financing
       from the Project, while one enterprise cancelled participating of the project during
       implementation and one enterprise was not approved by DIW-PMU.


                                                   39
Garment and Textile-NCFCP: This component aimed to phase out the use of 1,1,1-
trichloroethane in the existing garment and textile factories. The project was implemented as a
group sub-project through the voucher scheme with assistance from the Thailand Textile Institute
(THTI). The level of subsidy for acquisition of ventilation systems was 26,900 Baht. The
NCFCP was able to assist 214 garment and textile factories in acquiring ventilation systems and
training them on the standard exposure limits for 1,1,2 trichloroethylene.

Moreover, THTI worked closely with the Department of Labour Protection and Welfare, National
Institute for the Improvement of Working Conditions and Environment, Ministry of Labour, and
Department of Public Health, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, and
Department of Industrial Works, Ministry of Industry, and Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol
University to develop and finalize exposure limits for 1,1,2 trichloroethylene.

Solvent-NCFCP: The NCFCP proposed to assist four enterprises consuming CFC-113, three
enterprises consuming 1,1,1,-trichloroethane and one enterprise consuming carbon tetrachloride
to convert to alternative technology. DIW-PMU assisted five enterprises (one for CFC-113, three
for 1,1,1-trichloroethane and one for carbon tetrachloride) under the NCFCP. Implementation
was handled directly by DIW-PMU as an individual sub-project.

A2.2.2 Servicing Sector

Implementation of the investment component in the servicing sector started with the Mobile Air
Conditioning (MAC) servicing sector in 2003. After activities were completed in the MAC
servicing sector, DIW-PMU implemented activities in the refrigeration servicing sector, which
was completed in 2010.

MAC Servicing Sector: Implementation of activities for the MAC servicing sectors started with a
train-the-trainer workshop to train 30 trainers in 2003. Under this component, 46 training centers
of the Department of Skill Development (DSD) located across Thailand were designated as
authorized training centers (ATCs). Two training workshops were organized to train these ATCs.
Training equipment comprising 62 sets of basic servicing equipment (vacuum pumps, pressure
gauges, leak detectors and electronic charging equipment) and 29 units of recovery/recycling
machines were procured for the ATCs. The cost of organizing train-the-trainer workshop and
procurement of equipment to ATCs (US$202,059) was funded from the NCFCP.

Certification of servicing technicians by these ATCs was implemented during February 2004-
May 2008 in five phases. About 100 training workshops were organized under this component.
About 5,750 technicians from 4,050 MAC service shops were trained, which exceeded the
original target of 2,750 MAC service shops. The cost (US$117,143) of organizing training
workshops for certification of servicing technicians was funded from the NCFCP with approval
of the ExCom.

Basic service tools and Recovery and Recycling (R&R) machines were distributed to MAC
servicing workshops through a voucher scheme (group sub-project) which was in line with the
ExCom’s approval. DIW-PMU appointed three consulting firms as the group coordinator (GC)
to assist DIW in distributing servicing equipment for the MAC servicing sector in March 2005.

There were two types of vouchers: (1) vouchers for basic service tools; and (2) vouchers for R&R
machines. Basic service tools comprised vacuum pumps, pressure gauges, leak detectors and
electronic charging equipment. Although about 4,050 MAC servicing workshops were certified,


                                               40
vouchers were issued to 3,751 beneficiaries, or 136.4% of the NCFCP target. Some 3,533
vouchers or approximately 94.2% of total vouchers issued were exercised and disbursed from the
project. The non-use of 218 vouchers was attributed to the fact that some servicing workshops
either did not want to avail themselves of the vouchers as they had already had equipment, or the
GC could not find servicing workshops during the site visit. With these reasons, there was no
action taken by the servicing workshop to exercise the vouchers until the expiration date passed.

For the R&R machines, only MAC servicing workshops that proved that they consumed CFC-12
or more than 80 kg per month, could access financial subsidies. The actual number of voucher
for R&R machines was only 179 when compared to the original plan of 635 in the NCFCP
(28.2% of the target). Of that sum, 166 vouchers or approximately 92.7% of total vouchers
issued were exercised and disbursed from the project. The main reason for not exercising this
voucher was the high counterpart funding requirement of this machine and uncertainty whether
investment could be recovered due to widespread contamination of refrigerants in the MAC
sector. Due to the fixed level of funding approved by the ExCom for R&R machine, the project
was able to provide financial subsidy of 55% of the equipment cost, while the rest of 45% would
be borne by MAC servicing workshop. Risks of collecting contaminated and unusable
refrigerants made investment in R&R machine financially unattractive.

Refrigeration Servicing Sector: Due to successful project implementation in the MAC servicing
sector, the same approach was used for the refrigeration servicing sector, which started in 2006.

Forty-five training centers were authorized as ATCs under the refrigeration servicing sector. One
workshop for training the trainers was organized in July 2006. Training equipment comprising
58 sets of basic service tools (vacuum pumps, pressure gauges, leak detectors and electronic
charging equipment) were procured and provided to these ATCs. The cost of organizing train-
the-trainer workshop and procurement of equipment to ATCs (US$76,873) was funded from the
NCFCP.

Certification of servicing technicians by these ATCs was implemented during December 2008-
February 2009 in two phases. About 45 training workshops were organized under this
component. Some 3,110 technicians from 1,734 refrigeration servicing workshops were trained,
which exceeded the original targets (1,350 MAC servicing workshops). The cost (US$ 48,795)
of organizing training workshops for certification of servicing technicians was funded from the
NCFCP with approval of the ExCom.

Under the refrigeration servicing sector, only basic service tools were distributed to certified
servicing workshops through the voucher scheme (group sub-project), which was in line with the
ExCom approval. DIW-PMU appointed two consulting firms as GCs to assist DIW in
distributing servicing equipment for the refrigeration servicing sector. Although about 1,734
refrigeration servicing workshops were certified, vouchers were issued to 1,714 beneficiaries,
which was 126.9% of the NCFCP target of 1,350. Some 1,643 vouchers or approximately 95.8%
of the total issued were exercised and disbursed from the project. The difference (71) was
attributed to the fact that some servicing workshops either did not want to use the voucher as they
already had equipment or the GCs could not find the servicing workshops during the site visit.
Given these reasons, there was no action taken by the servicing workshop to exercise the
vouchers until the expiration date passed.

Having said the above, the RTG met most of its targets especially the certification of servicing
technician and provision of basic service tools for both the MAC and refrigeration servicing
sectors. The numbers of certified servicing workshops and technicians and number of basic


                                                41
service tools were much higher than the original target. On the contrary, the target of provision
of R&R machines was not met and only 28.2% of vouchers were used. .

Strengthening Training Capacity of Office of Vocational Education Commission (OVEC):
Office of Vocational Education Commission has more than 300 technical colleges that have a
division dedicating for air-conditioning and refrigeration training and have on-going cooperation
programs with DLT to inspect car conditions and also with EGAT to provide cleaning services to
household air-conditioners. To sustain the phaseout of CFCs in servicing sector, DIW
collaborated with Bureau of Cooperation of OVEC in April 2009 to explore the cooperation to
extend the training on good practice for servicing to be conducted by OVEC. OVEC confirmed
that this activity is in line with their curriculum and expressed their interest to partner with DIW
in further activities to strengthen capacity of service technicians and to ensure sustainable phase-
out of CFCs.

This activity was not in the original plan of the NCFCP. DIW and the World Bank, with approval
of the ExCom, agreed to allocate savings from other activities under the NCFCP to strengthen
training capacity of the 90 vocational colleges. This sub-project would enable vocational colleges
under OVEC to properly instruct their student to follow the code of good practice for servicing
equipment using alternative refrigerant. After completion of the sub-project, technical students
who would become servicing technicians in the future would be trained to use equipment and
familiarize with proper servicing practice in order to ensure good performance and condition of
equipment (avoid frequency of repair) and to eliminate venting of refrigerant to the atmosphere
by recovery, recycling and reuse of refrigerant.

To strengthen training institutes of OVEC by providing training to their students, the project
provided training and training equipment for OVEC. Two training workshops were organized to
provide training to trainers from OVEC across Thailand. Ninety sets of servicing equipment
(vacuum pumps, pressure gauges, leak detectors, electronic charging equipment, R&R machines
and refrigerant identifiers) were provided to 90 training institutes of OVEC through the voucher
scheme.

As can be seen from Figure 1 below, the implementation of pre-NCFCP and NCFCP enabled
RTG to control consumption of CFC in accordance with the Montreal Protocol schedule and the
maximum allowable consumption as agreed with the ExCom as part of NCFCP.

Type 1: Owners of storage facilities with in-house fumigation of methyl bromide or have
consumption of phosphine more than 50,000 tablets/year: The NMBPP supported 13 of the 23
identified type 1 beneficiary enterprises to properly adopt phosphine fumigation and integrated
pest management (IPM) technology to meet the disinfestations of insect pest. These enterprises
were large owners of storage facilities for agriculture products such as mill rice, maize, feed mill,
tapioca and flour. Given that the beneficiary enterprises would acquire different types of
equipment, the implementation of these sub-projects was individual sub-projects (one beneficiary
enterprise per one sub-project). The implementation period for Type 1 sub-projects was from
July 2009 (submission of first sub-project proposal) – December 2013 (sub-project completion).

Depending on the baseline of the beneficiary enterprise, financial support for the project was used
for (i) modification of existing silos to ensure gas tightness and sufficient recirculation of
phosphine in the silo, (ii) acquisition of fumigation equipment for safe and effective phosphine
fumigation (i.e. electronic phosphine monitoring devices, monitoring pumps and consumable
detector tubes, explosion-proof portable ventilators, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA),
face gas masks and replacement canisters for phosphine, fumigation sheets, etc.) and (iii) IPM
equipment (light traps, industrial vacuum cleaners, fogging machines, etc.).

Type 2: Owners of storage facilities that did not have in-house fumigation or have
consumption of phosphine less than 50,000 tablets/year: The NMBPP supported 83 type 2
beneficiary enterprises to strengthen their pest management capacity in their warehouses. Basic
fumigation equipment (monitoring pumps and consumable detector tubes - high and low range
and face gas masks with replacement canisters for phosphine) and IPM equipment (industrial
vacuum cleaners, light traps and insecticide knapsack sprayers) were provided to the beneficiary
enterprises. Given that these beneficiary enterprises would receive the same equipment, the
implementation was undertaken under a group sub-project using the voucher scheme. The
enterprises in these sub-projects ranged from large to small owners of storage facilities for
agriculture products and scattered across Thailand. The implementation period for Type 2 sub-
projects was from July 2009 (submission of sub-project proposal) - December 2013 (sub-project
completion).

The beneficiary enterprises that did not have in-house fumigation would receive only vouchers
for IPM equipment, while those that had in-house phosphine fumigation would receive two
vouchers for basic fumigation equipment and integrated pest management (IPM) equipment. At
the end of the sub-project, 83 vouchers for basic fumigation equipment and 81 vouchers for IPM
equipment were provided to beneficiary enterprises.

Type 3: Fumigation servicing companies: Commercial fumigation servicing companies played a
vital role in the phase-out of methyl bromide consumption in Thailand. A number of owners of


                                                       44
storage facilities outsourced disinfection needs of their warehouses to commercial fumigation
servicing companies; therefore, the share of methyl bromide consumption used by commercial
fumigation servicing companies was significant. Some 19 out of the 41 identified commercial
fumigators participated in Type 3 sub-projects. The remaining commercial fumigation servicing
companies were not eligible for the MLF fund because they were not eligible for MLF funds
(either because they were owned by developed countries or established after the cut-off date in
December 2004). The implementation period for Type 3sub-projects was July 2008 (submission
of first sub-project proposal) – February 2010 (sub-project completion).

Participating enterprise would receive a set of electronic phosphine monitoring devices and face
gas masks with canisters for phosphine through the voucher scheme.

Establishment of Management Information System (MIS): The NMBPP supported DOA to
develop and implement the MIS system, which had been in operation since August 2009 after the
MIS training in June 2009. The MIS linked DOA’s Pesticide Regulatory Sub-division with Plant
Quarantine Stations around the country, as well as with registered methyl bromide importers. The
MIS was a decentralized system that allowed related users to enter information into the database
from various points (multiple information-entry points). With security system, related users of the
MIS would have different accessibility to the MIS to ensure that confidential information would
not be accessed by unauthorized parties.

When a phytosanitary certificate was issued, the officer would enter the related information on
fumigation (i.e. name of exporters, type and amount of product, amount of methyl bromide used,
date of fumigation, country of destination etc.) into the MIS database. The Plant Quarantine
Stations would then access to the database and enter information to confirm that the commodity
had been treated and exported from Thailand. Importers of methyl bromide were required to
enter information regarding methyl bromide used for QPS and non-QPS applications of each
import license into the MIS database (i.e. type and amount of product, amount of methyl bromide
used, date of fumigation, country of destination, name of exporters/enterprises etc).

Insect Resistance Control Laboratory: The NMBPP supported DOA to establish the insect
resistance control laboratory to study phosphine resistance strains. The laboratory was under the
supervision of the Entomology Group of the Post-Harvest and Products Processing Research and
Development Office, DOA. Three staff members from the Post-Harvest and Products Processing
Research and Development Office in charge of the operation of insect resistance control were
trained by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries in Australia in 2007.
The study on phosphine resistance revealed that maize weevils (Sitophilus zeamais) were not
signaling resistance to phosphine (survey in 2010) but the red rust flour beetle (Tribolium
cataneum) lesser grain borer (Rhizopertha dominica) and saw tooth grain beetle (Oryzaephilus
surinamensis) showed resistant to phosphine in every part of the country.

Establishment of authorized training centers (ATC): PMU-DOA in close collaboration with
concerned agencies organized a three-day train-the-trainer workshop to provide training to
representatives from the regional offices of the Office of Agricultural Research and Development
(OARD) and the Plant Quarantine Stations, which were authorized by DOA as ATCs for training
of methyl bromide users.

To enable these ATCs to provide training to the enterprises, training equipment comprising
electronic phosphine monitoring devices, aspirating pumps and detector tubes, explosion-proof
portable ventilators, industrial fans, self-contained breathing apparatuses, face gas masks,
personal protection devices (vests; jump suits; hard hats; gloves; safety goggle), phosphine


                                                45
generators, grain probes, fumigation sheets and sand snakes, fumigation accessories (measuring
tapes, clamps, sampling tubes), vacuum cleaners, light traps, rodent traps, and projectors were
acquired to the ATCs from project support. Training equipment was used to demonstrate the
practical training on good practice for fumigation and IPM techniques during the training to the
enterprises.

Accreditation Scheme on Manufacturing Process for Issuance of Phytosanitary Certificate for
Processed Commodities: DOA-PMU in close consultation with Phytosanitary Certificate
Issuance Offices, Office of Agricultural Regulation took a proactive step to reduce the use of
fumigants (including methyl bromide) in processed commodities. In March 2008, DOA issued
DOA’s Notification “Accreditation Scheme on Manufacturing Process for Issuance of
Phytosanitary Certification for Processed Commodities”. The notification aimed to eliminate the
use of fumigants (including methyl bromide) in processed commodities comprised of: (i) flour,
starch and their by-products such as rice paper, tapioca pearl; (ii) dehydrated fruits; (iii)
foodstuffs, and food ingredients; and (iv) manufactured agricultural commodities such as natural
rubber, wood base and engineered wood base products. Frozen fruits and vegetables are also
included in this Notification as they were free from pests.

Training on fumigants by agricultural inspectors: To strengthen the enforcement of the
regulations on fumigant and pesticide trade, the NMBPP provided supported to the Agricultural
Inspection Sub-division of the Office of Agricultural Regulation to add training on fumigants in
their training curriculum for dealers of pesticides, fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals.
Moreover, the Agricultural Inspection Sub-division undertook the monitoring activity to
supervise agricultural input dealers for compliance with the laws and regulations on pesticides,
fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals.

As can be seen from figure 2, the implementation of NMBPP enabled RTG to control
consumption of methyl bromide in accordance with the Montreal Protocol schedule and the
maximum allowable consumption as agreed with the ExCom as part of NMBPP.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Global-level analyses conducted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) [‘The
Montreal Protocol and the Green Economy] credits the MP with having created enabling
conditions that simulated a transition to a Green Economy, resulting in improved human well-
being and social equity, as well as reduced environmental risks. Specifically, technological
advances and design innovations promoted under the MP have reduced costs, produced cleaner
and more reliable products and created better working environments. The report asserts that the
transfer of knowledge and technology in support of ozone protection has helped many developing
countries better compete in international markets. From a social perspective, the transition to non-
ODS technologies, products and services has resulted on balance, in a shift in jobs, supported by
higher levels of training, versus jobs lost. And in terms of human health, the MP is estimated to
have generated significant benefits, namely reductions in cancers and cataracts, that have been
valued at more than 11 times the direct investment costs of phasing-out ODS. It is therefore,
expected that the project impacts will be positive and that the cumulative impacts of the reduced
use of ODS in tandem with the increased use of chemicals with lower climate impact will be
positive for both Thai and global societies.

An economic analysis that captures the overall Project’s impact on Thailand’s economy would
need to include, in addition to the foam, refrigeration and air-conditioning, aerosols and solvent
sectors, other productive sectors, consumers and the government. In absence of direct data on the
impacts that ozone depletion and climate change have on the health of the Thai population and
other socio-economic aspects of Thai life, it is not possible to carry out a project-level
quantitative analysis of these aspects.

As this Project was designed to help Thailand meet its mandatory international obligations to
phase-out ODS, no specific estimate was made of the Project’s likely economic rate of return
(ERR), net present value (NPV) or financial rate of return (FRR). The Project’s underlying
principle was to compensate firms for cost driven by international agreement that was “external”
to their daily business operations. The Montreal Protocol requires enterprises to pay for the
estimated financial benefits of technology upgrading or expansion of production capacity, as
distinct from the external costs associated with ODS phase-out. However, the Project was never
meant to generate a positive rate of return.

The financial appraisal conducted by the financial intermediary assisted the project to use the
grant funds in an effective manner through ensuring use of competitive procurement and
controlling cost at the sub-project level. Therefore, the actual disbursement of the project was
lower than the approved amount by the ExCom.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The beneficiary satisfaction survey was undertaken in early 2013 as part of the mid-term review
(MTR) for the NMBPP. The beneficiary satisfaction survey included three groups of beneficiaries
involved in the NMBPP comprising: (i) four beneficiaries who were owners of storage facilities
that implemented individual sub-project (called type 1 sub-project 4 ), (ii) six commercial
fumigation servicing companies under fumigation servicing company group sub-project (called
type 3 sub-project 5 ); and (iii) two importers and four government officials from two plant
quarantine stations, Export Quarantine Service Sub-division and Pesticide Regulatory Sub-
division of DOA, who were involved in the operation of the MIS. Type 2 sub-project6 was not
included under this survey due to the implementation of this sub-project was at the initial stage of
implementation. The selection criteria to select the beneficiaries for satisfaction survey included
(i) type of agriculture products and (ii) size of the enterprise.

The main objective of the survey was to identify specific issues on technical, financial and project
implementation support provided to beneficiaries and through sub-grant agreements and
operation of MIS. Its focus was three-fold: 1) to identify the aspects for which the beneficiaries
accorded importance during implementation, 2) to determine beneficiaries’ perception of project
performance/satisfaction, and 3) to determine areas where implementation could have been
improved.

The results of the satisfaction survey with beneficiaries through sub-projects showed that, on
average, beneficiaries placed the importance to most aspects of project implementation
comprising of knowledge regarding details of the project, preparation of supporting documents to
participate in the NMBPP, technical assistance, training, financial issues and procedures, follow-
up during sub-project implementation, updates on news regarding technology, project
implementation timeframe, and outcomes/results upon sub-project completion.

The results of the satisfaction survey on MIS operations showed that, on average, the importers
and government officials appreciated the project’s awareness training and news updates regarding
technology, compliance with the licensing system, and procedures for operating the MIS.

For Type 1 beneficiaries, their satisfaction was high in most of the evaluated aspects (rating 4-5
on a five-point scale), except on financial issues and procedures, which affected time spent on
project implementation. The beneficiaries commented that there were delays in disbursements to
beneficiaries when compared to the original plan due to procedures and time spent on processing
supporting documents to meet requirements. The overall satisfactory for Type 1 beneficiaries
was 82%. For Type 3 beneficiaries, their satisfaction was high in all of the evaluated aspects
(rating 4-5 of five-point scale) because of the seamless design of project implementation through



4
  Type 1 sub-project: Sub-projects of owners of storage facilities with in-house fumigation of methyl bromide or have consumption of
phosphine more than 50,000 tablets/year. The enterprise would implement the sub-project individually. There were 13 type 1 sub-
projects under NMBPP.

5
  Type 3 sub-project: A group sub-project for ccommercial fumigation servicing companies who are outsourced to perform
disinfection needs in the warehouses or shipments. The sub-project was group sub-project using voucher scheme to acquire
equipment. There were 19 commercial fumigation servicing companies in this sub-project.

6
  Type 2 sub-project: Sub-project of owners of storage facilities that do not have in-house fumigation or have consumption of
phosphine less than 50,000 tablets/year.



                                                                53
the voucher scheme and direct disbursements to equipment suppliers. The overall satisfactory for
Type 3 beneficiaries was 94%.

The overall satisfaction with operation of the MIS was 96% because the importers and concerned
government officials thought the MIS facilitated importers’ reporting requirements and the MIS
helped DOA officers monitor the import and use of methyl bromide through the computerized
database rather than using the previous paper-based system.

There was no beneficiary survey carried out for the NCFCPP.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.         Description
1.1.       Background
The Royal Thai Government (RTG) acceded to the Montreal Protocol (MP) on July 7, 1989 and
ratified all subsequent amendments. Thailand was classified as a country operating under Article
5(1) of the MP and was eligible for technical and financial assistance from the Multilateral Fund
for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MLF) to support ODS phase-out activities
within its territory. Thailand was not the producer of any of the substances controlled under the
MP. Total demands for all controlled chemicals were met through imports.

The RTG prepared a Country Programme (CP) outlining the country’s strategy to phase-out ODS
consumption. One of the key strategic components of the CP was conversion of ODS technology
to ozone-friendly technology in the relevant sectors.

2.         Project Objectives, Components and Institutional Framework
2.1.       Objectives
The overall objective of the Project was to assist the Royal Thai Government in carrying out its
Country Program as to phase out the use of ODS within its territory through inter alia: (a) the
introduction of appropriate technology measures, (b) the institutional strengthening of responsible
government entities and (c) the implementation of specific cost-effective priority investments to
reduce consumption of ODS.

2.2.       Components and sub-components
The ODS phase-out activities in Thailand are classified into the following categories;
       o   Sub-projects approved prior to the National CFCs Phase-out Plan (Pre-NCFCP);
       o   National CFCs Phase-out Project (NCFCP);
       o   National Methyl Bromide Phase-out Plan (NMBPP);
       o   Institutional Strengthening Project (IS Project).

2.2.1.     Pre-NCFCP
Pre-NCFCP sub-projects were approved by the Executive Committee (ExCom) from 1992 to
2001 and prior to the approval of NCFCP in December 2001. Thailand received approval of total
101 pre-NCFCP sub-projects for the total amount of US$ 35.5 million. Of which, 56 sub-projects
were implemented through the Bank (US$24.3 million), while other 45 sub-projects were
implemented through UNDP and UNIDO. ODSs phased out from the implementation of Pre-
NCFCP sub-project were CFCs, halons, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.

To implement the Pre-NCFCP sub-projects, the RTG entered into the Ozone Projects Trust Fund
Grant Agreement (OTF-21926TH) with the World Bank on August 8, 1994 for US$40 million.
The Grant Agreement was originally structured as an umbrella program, under which any
additional sub-projects approved by the ExCom could be financed.

2.2.2.     NCFCP




                                                56
Thailand National CFCs Phase-out Plan (NCFCP) was jointly prepared by DIW and the Bank to
assist Thailand to completely phase-out the remaining consumption7 of CFCs, carbon
tetrachloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) by January 1, 2010. The NCFCP was approved by
the ExCom at its 35th Meeting in December 2001 for the total funding level of US$14.7 million.

NCFCP comprised a combination of ODS phase-out sub-projects and capacity building activities
to be implemented over a period of nine years during 2002-2010. In addition, the NCFCP also
included policy and regulatory measures to ensure the sustainable phase out of ODSs resulted
from sub-projects and capacity building activities.

2.2.3.      NMBPP
Thailand National Methyl Bromide Phase-out Plan (NMBPP) was jointly prepared by the
Department of Agriculture (DOA) and the Bank to assist Thailand to meet phase-out obligations
of methyl bromide under the MP. The NMBPP was approved by the ExCom at its 44th Meeting
in December 2004.

The funding level of US$2.9 million from the Multilateral Fund (MLF) was approved to the
Royal Thai Government (RTG) to cover part of the phase-out costs over a period of nine years
during 2005-2013, with a total of 241.8 ODP tonnes of methyl bromide to be phased out.

2.2.4.      IS Project
As part of the effort to assist Thailand to phase out ODS consumption in the country, DIW
through its National Ozone Unit (NOU) has implemented institutional strengthening activities
under the program called “Institutional Strengthening Project (IS Project)” to strengthen capacity
of the NOU in meeting obligations under the Montreal Protocol. At the 35th meeting of the
ExCom in 2001, the ExCom approved DIW’s request to transfer IS Project from UNDP to the
Bank effectively since 1 January 2002.

Like capacity building activities of the NCFCP, the IS project comprised of capacity building
activities, which were executed through provision of equipment, consultants’ services, training
and workshop of NOU and other agencies including public awareness activities, and incremental
operating cost incurred from implementation of IS activities.

2.3.        Institutional Framework

2.3.1.      National
Given that the use of ODS stems from industry, the RTG appointed the Ministry of Industry
(MOI) as the responsible agency for the implementation of the Protocol and its amendments. The
DIW was, in turn, designated by the MOI to enforce the Hazardous Substances Act, the
framework law that controls the import, export and use of ODS.




7
    3,066 ODP tons of CFCs, 7.52 ODP tons of CTC, and 34 ODP tones of TCA




                                                            57
After the approval of the NCFCP, DIW set up the Program Management Unit (DIW-PMU) to
prepare, plan, implement and monitor implementation of NCFCP and to assist DIW to enforce
regulations.

With respect to methyl bromide, its main use was in the fumigation of agricultural products,
hence the DOA was assigned by the RTG to be the national coordinating agency of the NMBPP.
The PMU (DOA-PMU) was also established to prepare, plan, implement and monitor
implementation of NMBPP.

The Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) was assigned as the financial intermediary
of the Project. The Government Savings Bank (GSB) was later assigned as the second financial
intermediary to assist in the implementation of NCFCP and NMBPP which involved significant
number of SMEs.

2.3.2.   International
The World Bank was the implementing agency for the Thailand ODS Phase-out Project. The
Bank helped Thailand to develop sub-project proposals, NCFCP and NMBPP. The Bank had the
responsibilities to provide policy and technical advices, monitor and verifying the progress, and
other aspects needed during the implementation of the Project including channeling of financial
resources from the MLF.

3.       Design, Implementation and Impact
3.1.     Assessment of Design
The Grant Agreement was originally structured as an umbrella program, under which any
additional sub-projects approved by the ExCom could be financed. The design of the GA was
flexible and was amended to accommodate implementation of the NCFCP, NMBPP and the
Institutional Strengthening (IS) project.

In terms of the design of the NCFCP and NMBPP, the establishment of the PMUs as an
independent unit within DIW and DOA had allowed the NCFCP and NMBPP to be implemented
effectively.

3.2.     Main results achieved

3.2.1.   Pre-NCFCP
There were 56 Pre-NCFCP sub-projects approved under the Grant Agreement. Of which, 52 sub-
projects were fully implemented, while the remaining four sub-projects were cancelled by the
enterprises. The 52 completed sub-projects were able to directly eliminate about 2,940.6 ODP
tones of CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, halon 1201 and halon 1301 from
Thailand annual consumption.

3.2.2.   NCFCP
Without the NCFCP, it was likely that Thailand would not be able to meet phase-out obligations
of CFCs during 2007-2010. Both investment and institutional development activities under the
NCFCP assisted Thailand to sustainably reduce consumption of ODS from 2003 onwards. About
3,066 ODP tones of CFCs, 34 ODP tons of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and 7.52 ODP tons carbon
tetrachloride was phased out during this period.



                                               58
3.2.3.   NMBPP
The NMBPP assisted the RTG to phase out remaining consumption of methyl bromide for non-
QPS applications by December 31, 2013 as agreed with the ExCom. It is important to highlight
that the NMBPP also contributed to the reduction of methyl bromide use for QPS applications,
which is still exempted under the MP. While methyl bromide use for QPS application was rising
from 2005 to 2007, the NMBPP was able to reverse the trend and reduce of methyl bromide use
for QPS application. This was caused by (i) the investment activities and training provided to the
beneficiary enterprises, which encouraged the enterprises to introduce the use of phosphine and
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technology to reduce the reliance on methyl bromide for
export of agricultural product and (ii) the capacity strengthening of DOA in controlling the use of
methyl bromide.

3.2.4.   Regulations to support ODS phase-out
The non-NCFCP sub-projects, NCFCP and NMBPP enabled the RTG to enact the regulation to
ban the use of CFCs and other ODS after the completion of sub-projects in the sector.
         •      Thailand was the first developing country that promulgated the regulation to
                prohibit the use of CFCs in the manufacture of domestic refrigerator and prohibit
                the import of CFC-based domestic refrigerator in 1997, which was only one year
                after the completed phaseout in developed countries.
         •      Moreover, the regulations included the ban on the use of CFCs in the manufacture
                of commercial refrigerator and the ban on the use of CFC-based commercial
                refrigerator in 2003.
         •      Ban the use of CFCs in the manufacturing sector: In December 2004, the Cabinet
                approved the legal framework proposed by the Ministry of Industry to ban the use
                of CFCs and 1,1,1-TCA in the manufacturing sector. The Ministerial Notification
                of the Factory Act B.E 2535 to ban the use of CFCs and 1,1,1-TCA in the
                manufacturing sector was signed by the Ministry of Industry in July 2005 and
                publicized in the Royal Gazette in September 2005. To date, this Ministerial
                Notification has been effective and enforced by DIW. This announcement
                constituted a regulatory commitment under the NCFCP program.
         •      Mandatory MAC Inspection Requirement: In March 2004, the Cabinet approved
                an amendment of the Ministerial Decree of the Transportation Act B.E. 2522 and
                of the Vehicle Act B.E. 2522 to include an inspection of refrigerant in MAC
                systems as part of the annual vehicle inspection to be enforced by the DLT. The
                Ministry of Transportation signed amendment of the Transportation Act B.E. 2522
                and of the Vehicle Act B.E. 2522 and became effective since January 2005.
         •      Ban the Import of CFC-MDI: In December 2005, FDA announced lifting off
                registration of CFC-MDI containing Salbutamol, Futicasone and Sodium
                Gromoglycate in a total of 13 products from December 31, 2005. With this
                regulation, these CFC-MDIs were not able to be imported after December 31,
                2005 but still could be sold in the market until their stocks are exhausted.
         These regulations played a vital role in sustaining the phaseout of CFCs and other ODS
         in the manufacturing and servicing sector.

4.       Assessment of the Performance
4.1.     Key issues that facilitated implementation




                                                59
       a) Independent Structure of DIW-PMU: The structure of DIW-PMU during 2003-2006 was
          designed and agreed during the 2002 grant amendment to facilitate the implementation of
          NCFCP. Given that DIW-PMU reported directly to the Director General of DIW, the
          approval process was shortened and the action could be immediately undertaken to solve
          the issue that might have during the implementation.
       b) Transparent implementation procedure: Implementation procedures of individual and
          group sub-projects in the OPG were transparent and developed according to the Bank
          guidelines. This created trust and strengthen cooperation between the government and the
          private sectors.
       c) Flexibility: The RTG was given the flexibility of adding or removing beneficiaries as
          long as the proposed activity contributed toward achievement of the NCFCP and NMBPP
          and was consistent with the ExCom funding guidelines to ensure compliance with the
          accelerated phase-out schedule. Without flexibility, the RTG would be in difficult
          situation to effectively utilize funding to address the actual need to phase-out ODS
          consumption.
       d) Voucher scheme: A voucher scheme was proven as an effective and transparent tool to
          facilitate procurement of equipment for thousands of beneficiaries scattered across the
          country. The voucher scheme allowed equal opportunity for accredited suppliers to sell
          equipment to the beneficiaries based on commercial practice. Following the launch of
          the voucher scheme, the price of equipment was reduced by 30%, which supported
          project sustainability because enterprises were able to acquire equipment at more
          affordable prices.
       e) Strong cooperation among concerned parties: There had been strong cooperation among
          DOA-PMU, GSB and the beneficiaries during sub-project preparation and
          implementation. Moreover, the Bank played a vital role in advising DOA-PMU and GSB
          to overcome the issues facing during the implementation of the project.
       f) Training provided to beneficiaries: Training on code of good practice for fumigation and
          fumigation equipment, which were provided to the enterprise had strengthened capacity
          of the enterprise’s in-house fumigation team to fumigate more effectively and safely.
          The effective fumigation could kill insects at all stages and could prevent reinfestation of
          insect pests in the commodities. As a result, the enterprise could give priority to use
          phosphine fumigation rather than methyl bromide fumigation. The adoption of IPM had
          encouraged the enterprise to improve its stock management by using “first-in-first-out”
          approach. This approach would help to minimize the number of raw material inventory
          that would be kept in the warehouse until re-fumigation must be undertaken. As a result,
          unnecessary re-fumigation could be eliminated from this practice. It is important to note
          that the NMBPP provided training to not only the enterprises implementing the
          investment sub-project, but also those did not participate in the sub-project.

4.2.       Key issues that hindered implementation

       a) Enterprise’s reluctance to disclose information: Some sub-projects took considerable time to
          prepare and submit appraisal reports to the World Bank because they were reluctant to
          disclose financial information for appraisal. IFCT had to explain to the enterprises
          implications of delaying submission of appraisal reports and the potential for cancellation by
          the ExCom.
       b) Financial crisis: For sub-projects with large counterpart funding, the East Asia Economic
          Crisis between 1997 and 1999 caused considerable difficulties for enterprises to acquire
          other funding sources to advance the payments for the equipment purchased before
          claims for reimbursement were made to IFCT. The beneficiaries had to obtain term loans



                                                   60
     through local banks or scale down their counterpart funding which resulted in further
     delays.
c)   Design and development of voucher scheme and implementation modality: As voucher
     scheme was an innovative approach for the Pre-NCFCP sub-project. Significant time has to
     be spent to design and finalize the implementation of MAC Recycling Demonstration Sub-
     project through voucher scheme. For Commercial Refrigeration Terminal Umbrella Sub-
     project, significant time had to be spent to develop the implementation modality and the
     action plan to deliver technical and financial assistance to 231 enterprises located across
     the country.
d)   Identification/confirmation of participation: DIW and IFCT had to identify beneficiaries
     under the Recycling Demonstration Sub-project. Similarly, significant time was spent to
     confirm eligibility of beneficiaries under the Commercial Refrigeration Terminal Umbrella
     Sub-project. Given that most of these manufacturers of commercial refrigerator were
     small enterprises, who did not have systematic filing, it was difficult to obtain supporting
     document to confirm their consumption and eligibility and delayed the project
     implementation.
e)   Procurement of foam injection machine: Commercial Refrigeration Terminal Umbrella
     Sub-project had two parts; refrigeration and foam insulation. While assistance for
     refrigeration part was undertaken through voucher scheme for all beneficiaries, the
     assistance for foam insulation depended on enterprise’s baseline consumption. Of which,
     approximately 24 enterprises that had large baseline consumption would receive high
     pressure foam injection machine. To acquire the foam injection machine, the Bank
     advised Kulthorn Engineering Co., Ltd. to use international competitive bidding as the
     procurement method. Due to the lack of experience with the Bank’s ICB, significant
     time was spent to finalize the bidding document. Moreover, three rounds of ICB were
     conducted because of the failure in the first two rounds of ICB.
f)   Changing implementation modality of the sub-project: There was significant change in the
     project implementation modality of Halon Management Programme, Halon Recovery,
     Recycling and Banking Sub-project. After sub-project approval in 2000, significant time
     was spent to decide and conduct the study whether Thailand would need the physical
     halon banking or electronic halon banking. After the final decision to implement the
     electronic halon banking, DIW prepared the revised sub-project proposal to the ExCom in
     2005 to revise the implementation modality, which was completed in 2010.
g)   Delays from stakeholders: Depending on the sub-project, the implementation of investment
     activities suffered from the delays from beneficiary enterprises, DIW, IFCT and the Bank.
h)   Changing institutional structure of DIW-PMU in early 2007. The change of institutional
     structure of DIW-PMU in early 2007 affected the overall implementation of the NCFCP.
     The existing staffs of DIW-PMU during 2003-2006 no longer worked for DIW-PMU.
     There were difficulties for the new staffs of DIW-PMU to immediately continue the tasks
     previously handled by the previous DIW-PMU.
i)   Hesitation to participate in the NCFCP: This affected the implementation of MAC
     servicing sector at the beginning of the program. Given that all of servicing workshops
     were very small enterprises, who did not want to expose themselves to the government, a
     number of MAC servicing workshops felt reluctant to attend the training and participate
     in the financial subsidy program. A series of public awareness by DIW and direct
     approach by DSD were carried out to explain the program, which resulted in higher
     responsiveness from MAC servicing workshops. This issue was not encountered at the
     later phrases of MAC servicing sector when servicing workshops felt confident to
     participate in the project.
j)   Distribution of R&R machines: The difficulty in distributing R&R machines to MAC
     servicing workshops were attributed to two factors. The first factor was contaminated


                                             61
          refrigerant in the servicing sector during 2005-2008. During this period, several
          alternatives to CFC-12 (in addition to HFC-134a) and sub-standard blends were
          introduced in the domestic market. When charging different type of refrigerant or sub-
          standard blends into the MAC system, the MAC system would become contaminated.
          The contaminated refrigerant undermined the promotion of R&R machines because it
          voided cleaned refrigerant in the cylinder, which would become unusable. The second
          factor affecting the R&R subsidy program was high counterpart funding for acquisition
          of the equipment.
       k) Termination of one financial intermediary: In 2010, one financial intermediary informed
          DIW and the Bank that it would like to terminate the agreement as the financial
          intermediary of the project. DIW and the Bank had to work closely with the said
          financial intermediary and the GC to accelerate the implementation of on-going activities.

4.3.       Assessment of the World Bank supervision
The Bank conducted periodic supervision missions to follow-up implementation progress,
problems encountered and actions to be taken to resolve the pending issues. Throughout the life
of the project, the Bank task team members worked closely with DIW, TMB Bank and GSB to
ensure proper timely and effective implementation of the project. In addition, discussions with
other stakeholders and on-site visits to beneficiaries were also undertaken during supervision
missions to understand practical issues during implementation of the project.

Both DIW and DOA indicated there was shortcoming of the Bank support for one year during
2009-2010. There was a lack of communication from the Bank, which delayed the project
implementation in both NCFCP and NMBPP. After assigning the new Task Team Leader, the
Bank resumed to provide periodically supervision and satisfactory support to DIW and DOA in
implementing the remaining activities of the Project. Given the long duration of the Project and
the normal rotations of staff in both DIW and the Bank, there were also some gaps in
coordination and resulted in miscommunication between DIW and Bank, which caused some
delay in the project implementation.

However, at the final period of project implementation, there was regular communications and
periodically supervision between DIW and the Bank, which resulted in more effective
implementation. The Bank played a vital role in providing support to DIW in solving the
problem to implement the remaining activities of the project, which significantly resulted in
smooth implementation. The Bank staffs were found very competent in the subject, able to work
with DIW staffs, and were willing to assist DIW to timely implement the activities.

4.4.       Key experiences and lessons learned

4.4.1.     General

       a) Effectiveness of integrated approaches: Technical and financial assistances from the
          MLF alone could not contribute to the achievement. Commitments from the government
          and related stakeholders toward the phase-out obligations were critical for the country to
          ensure compliance with all obligations in a smooth and sustainable manner. Integration
          of regulation frameworks, capacity buildings and technical and financial assistances
          could be considered as the optimal approach.
       b) Effective communications between public and private sectors: There were problems at
          the beginning period in reaching out to the private sectors under both NCFCP and



                                                  62
       NMBPP. Servicing workshops did not want to participate in the NCFCP as they did not
       want to expose themselves to the government. PMU-DOA also had difficulties in
       identifying beneficiaries as fumigation work is small part of their business and it was
       difficult to convince the management to realize the importance of effective and safe
       fumigations. The government needs to develop and implement effective communication
       strategy to convince the public sector to participate.
    c) Follow commercial practice: A voucher scheme was proven as an effective and
       transparent tool to facilitate procurement of equipment for thousands of beneficiaries
       scattered across the country. Under the voucher scheme, the beneficiaries had to select
       equipment supplier on their own. Decision on supplier selection depended on not only
       equipment specification and supplier performance, but also price of equipment which was
       linked to the level of counterpart funding. The voucher scheme allowed equal
       opportunity for accredited suppliers to compete and sell equipment to the beneficiaries
       based on commercial practice.
    d) Group Coordinator: The use of group coordinator to deal with large number of
       beneficiaries helped to facilitate the sub-project implementation while allowing the
       government to focus on overall picture and enforcement activity. For example, the main
       compressor supplier acted as GC in the terminal umbrella project for commercial
       refrigeration while polyol suppliers/system houses were utilized under the NCFCP to
       reach out to the small foam enterprises.

4.4.2.   NCFCP-specific

    a) Weakness of sub-project approach: Initially, the approach was to take individual
       enterprises - however this resulted in slowing implementation as approved process was
       long drawn-out. In 2002, the approach towards NCFCP which focused on thematic
       phase-out – expedited the program.
    b) Complication in working with small and medium-size enterprises: Implementations in
       servicing sector were more complicated than the manufacturing sector. Beneficiaries
       were small servicing workshops, who normally did not want to expose themselves to the
       government and did not have systematic filing. To deal with small enterprises, eligibility
       criteria should be minimized (as long as they are not against relevant guidelines / rules) to
       encourage these servicing workshops to participate in the program.
    c) Longer implementation than expectation: The longer implementation than expectation
       could undermine the cooperation among concerned parties. For instance, the long
       coordination with the DLT since 2003 for the same program without sufficient follow-up
       on the action plan undermined the mandatory MAC inspection program.

4.4.3.   NMBPP

    a) Changing and unexpected circumstances: Although PMU-DOA was fully established
       since 2006, the activity to provide technical and financial assistance to beneficiaries
       could not proceed because PMU-DOA had difficulties in allocating grant fund to
       beneficiaries according to the original implementation modality of NMBPP vs. update
       situation. This barrier necessitated PMU-DOA to re-determine eligibility and funding
       criteria and submit it for the approval of the ExCom, which was approved in April 2009.
       This implies that the sub-project could be commenced starting from April 2009 when the
       new eligibility and funding criteria are confirmed. The delay in project implementation
       was also caused by unexpected circumstances. There was need to prepare PMP resulted
       in project implementation delay because the appraisal report could not be approved.



                                                63
        Moreover, another unexpected circumstance was the change of the head in GSB unit,
        which temporarily ceased project implementation for about 4 months in early 2011.
     b) Appropriate implementation modalities for different nature of sub-project:
        Implementation modality should take into account different nature of enterprises under
        the NMBPP. Individual approach was best suited to the large owner of storage facilities
        with in-house fumigation needing tailor-made interventions from the NMBPP. Owners
        of storage facility that do not have in-house fumigation and commercial fumigation
        servicing companies could be addressed as the group sub-project.
     c) Need for clear responsibilities, instructions on procedures and processing time: Some
        sub-project implementation was delayed due to time spent to resend supporting document
        to meet the requirements. The contact person of enterprise had difficulties to clarify the
        management level on the need for resending the supporting document. Moreover, there
        were cases that the disbursement to enterprises could not be made within agreed
        timeframe. The delay in making payment to the beneficiaries put pressure to contact
        person in justifying their management level regarding the reason of not getting the
        payment as planned. Therefore, the need for clear responsibilities, instruction on
        procedures and processing time was essential to avoid difficulties at the government,
        financial agent and enterprise sides and could improve image of the project. All parties
        involved must be able to meet the timeline as agreed with the others. The close
        communication and unique understanding among all concerned parties was critical for
        the timely and smooth project implementation.

5.       Conclusions
The ODS phase-out Project implemented through the Bank was a useful program for Thailand to
meet obligations under the Montreal Protocol. Moreover, it enabled all concerned parties and the
public to realize the importance of phasing out ODS and the negative environmental impact from
the use of ODSs. In term of the industry, the Project provided technical and financial assistance
to ODS-consuming enterprises to convert to alternative technologies effectively.

The Project had also strengthened the relationship between the government and private sectors.
The NCFCP led to good cooperation in the foam sector where the polyol suppliers provided
technical support to their foam customers. This facilitated the preparation and implementation of
HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP), for which polyol suppliers/system houses fully
supported the government in reaching out to their customers.

After participating in the NMBPP, the enterprise’s perception on effective and safe fumigation
was better. The outcomes of the participation were in line with the enterprise’s expectation and it
could enhance their business capacity in complying with national and international
standards/regulations for fumigations and safety. The enterprises periodically contacted the
government to get information on update technology and to seek suggestions on any issues that
they had.
