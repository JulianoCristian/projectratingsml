     eompletely phase out its Methyl Bromide (MB) eonsumption in non-quarantine and n~n-pre
     shipment applicahons in accordance with the phase-out schedule mandated by the Montreal
     Protocol. A total! consumption of 241.8 ODP lonnes of MB (403 MT) for non-quarantine and
     pre-shipment apphcations in 2002, as reported in 2003 lo the Ozone Secretariat, will be phased-
