                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objective of this Montreal Protocol project is the phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) by (a) provision of sub-grant to the enterprises
                         and other beneficiaries in the execution of ODS phase-out activities, (b) strengthening capacity of the program management unit of a sector plan, and (c) strengthening
                         capacity of the Department of Industrial Works (DIW) to perform the role of the National Ozone Unit and coordinate the implementation of the ODS-phaseout programs.
                         This project is an integral part of an international activities which have been undertaken since 1987 to reverse the damage to the Ozone layer. It is anticipated that this
                         process will take sixty to seventy years to complete. However, there is reason to assume that the global development objective will be met, even though it is in the very
                         distant future.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Royal Thai Government (RTG) maintains its capability to fully meet its obligations under the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 1,1,1-
                         trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride and halon (for non-exemption use). Imports of the four Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) which have achieved zero tonnes target since
                         January 1, 2010, remained at zero metric tonnes (as of August 2012). The implementation of Thailand National Methyl Bromide Phaseout plan (NMBPP), which began in October

                         Pre-Shipment application below maximum allowable consumption as agreed with the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund – reaching 28.4 metric tonnes which is below the
