The Bank and borrower performance were\n            satisfactory. The risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible. Significant changes included extension of\n            closing dates and a change in the project implementation\n            modality of Halon Management Programme, Halon Recovery,\n            Recycling and Banking Sub-project.  Several lessons were\n            learned. Commitment from the government and related\n            stakeholders to the phase-out obligations was critical to\n            ensure compliance with all obligations in a smooth and\n            sustainable manner. A project management unit (PMU) was\n            established to be responsible for the operation of the\n            multi-year project. Due to a number of activities to be\n            carried out under the multi-year project, PMU should be\n            staffed with competent and skilled personnel to ensure\n            effective implementation and delivery of the multi-year\n            project in the future. The disbanding of the Department of\n            Industrial Works (DIW) led to severe disruptions because the\n            National Ozone Unit (NOU) did not have the capacity and\n            experience to implement the remaining tasks. In hindsight,\n            the Bank could have required the DIW to have an adequate\n            transitional plan in place before disbanding the PMU and\n            transferring its functions to the understaffed NOU.\n            Implementation in the service sectors was more complicated\n            than in the manufacturing sector. To deal more successfully\n            with small enterprises, incentives should be provided to\n            these workshops to urge them to participate in the program.\n            The Bank should have updated the Results Framework\n            continuously in the implementation and status reports for\n            both Bank management and client. This operation lasted\n            almost 19 years from start to finish, but it demonstrates\n            that older projects can be successful by rolling through\n            different aspects of Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)\n            phase-out sequentially. Not having to prepare a new PAD each\n            time a new ODS was introduced for phase-out meant that the\n            team was not distracted by administrative tasks."}, "docdt": "2014-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
