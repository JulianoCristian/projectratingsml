      Dear Khun Naris:

              Re: Montreal Protocol Ozone Depleting Substances Phase out Multi-Component
                    Project Ozone Projects Trust Fund (OTF-21926-TH)
                   Amendment Letter


              We refer to the Ozone Projects Trust Fund Grant Agreement Montreal Protocol Ozone
      Depleting Substances Phase out Multi-Component Project between the Kingdom of Thailand
      (the Recipient) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank)
      acting as Trustee for the Ozone Projects Trust Fund dated August 8, 1994, as restated through the
      Restated Ozone Projects Trust Fund Grant Agreement dated August 22, 2005 and as amended to
      date (the Grant Agreement).

            We also refer to the Recipient's letter dated August 17, 2010, requesting the Bank to
     extend the final disbursement date in the Grant Agreement. We are pleased to inform you that
     the Bank concurs with your request.

            Accordingly, Section 3(d) of Schedule 1 to the Grant Agreement is amended to read as
     follows:

            "(d)    after December 31, 2013, under any Project activities unless such activities are
     aimed at the phase out of methyl bromide."

            Except as specifically amended by this letter of amendment, all terms and conditions of
     the Grant Agreement otherwise remain in full force and effect.

            It is the Bank's policy to make publicly available the Grant Agreement and any
     information related thereto, including this amendment. By confirming below, the Recipient
     consents to disclosure of this amendment letter after it has become effective.
