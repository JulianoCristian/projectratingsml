                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objective of this Montreal Protocol project is the phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) by (a) provision of sub-grant to the enterprises
                         and other beneficiaries in the execution of ODS phase-out activities, (b) strengthening capacity of the program management unit of a sector plan, and (c) strengthening
                         capacity of the Department of Industrial Works (DIW) to perform the role of the National Ozone Unit and coordinate the implementation of the ODS-phaseout programs.
                         This project is an integral part of an international activities which have been undertaken since 1987 to reverse the damage to the Ozone layer. It is anticipated that this
                         process will take sixty to seventy years to complete. However, there is reason to assume that the global development objective will be met, even though it is in the very
                         distant future.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Royal Thai Government (RTG) maintains its capability to fully meet its obligations under the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 1,1,1-
                         trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride and halon (for non-exemption use). Imports of the four Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) which have been achieved zero tonnes since
                         January 1, 2010, remained at zero metric tonnes in 2011. However, the implementation of the institutional development components under the National CFC phase out project

                         (NCFCP) is behind schedule. The implementation of Thailand National Methyl Bromide Phaseout project (NMBPP), which began in October 2005, has made slight progress for the
                         last two Sub-project conversion components. The delay of the implementation of both NCFCP and NMBPP caused by the severe flooding in Thailand (from August to December
                         2011). Four out of eighteen of Type 1-Sub-project- Owner of storage facilities with in-house fumigation capabilities have signed sub-grant agreements and started conversion. The
                         implementation of Sub-project-Type 2 - Owner of storage facilities without in-house fumigation capabilities has also started. Type of equipment to be provided to the beneficiaries,
                         distribution scheme and level of subsidy have been finalized and equipment supplier has been selected. Thailand has been able to control consumption of methyl bromide for non-
                         QPS application below maximum allowable consumption as agreed with the Executive Committee of the Multi lateral Fund - 54.9 Metric Ton has been satisfactorily achieved and is
                         well below its maximum allowable level (61.1 metric ton).
