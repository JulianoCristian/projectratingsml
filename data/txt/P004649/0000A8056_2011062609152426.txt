                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objective of this Montreal Protocol project is the phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) by (a) provision of sub-grant to the
                         enterprises and other beneficiaries in the execution of ODS phase-out activities, (b) strengthening capacity of the program management unit of a sector plan,
                         and (c) strengthening capacity of the Department of Industrial Works (DIW) to perform the role of the National Ozone Unit and coordinate the implementation of
                         the ODS-phaseout programs. This project is an integral part of an international activities which have been undertaken since 1987 to reverse the damage to the
                         Ozone layer. It is anticipated that this process will take sixty to seventy years to complete. However, there is reason to assume that the global development
                         objective will be met, even though it is in the very distant future.

                         completed of which assisted the Royal Thai Government (RTG) to fully meet its obligations under the Montreal Protocol to phase-out the use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 1,1,1-
                         trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride and halon (for non-exemption use). Imports of the four Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) have been achieved zero tonnes since January 1,
                         2010 as planned. The implementation of institution development components including capacity building component for Department of Industrial Works and concerned agencies
                         under the NCFCPP is continuing according to the Annual Work Plan approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund (ExCom) for the sustainable phase-out of the
                         ODS. The implementation of Thailand National Methyl Bromide Phaseout project, which began in October 2005, is behind schedule for both the conversion sub-project, and
                         institutional development components and training-of-trainers program due to technical reasons. However, these issues have been resolved and the conversion for fumigation
                         servicing companies have been completed. Import of Methyl Bromide for non-quarantine pre-shipment ( 100.42 tons) has been satisfactorily achieved and is well below its maximum
                         allowable level (122 tons) as agreed with the ExCom.
