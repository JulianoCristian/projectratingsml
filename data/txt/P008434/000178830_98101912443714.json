introduce intensified forest management in\n            north-western and western Greece, which account for about 55\n            percent of national forest resources. Components include:\n            (a) construction of about 3,500 km and improvement of about\n            2,000 km of forest truck and tractor roads, and provision of\n            equipment for road and machine maintenance; (b) provision of\n            logging equipment and fire protection equipment and works,\n            and transport and housing facilities for about 3,000\n            forestry workers and staff; (c) establishment of about\n            16,000 ha of industrial plantations, three seedling\n            nurseries, and pilot range management on about 20,000 ha;\n            (d) construction or improvement of connection roads, water\n            supply, drainage and sanitation systems, community centers\n            and other infrastructure works for about 37 selected forest\n            villages; (e) programs for training in mechanized logging\n            methods, industrial plantation research and range management\n            techniques including the provision of equipment, facilities,\n            about 9 man-years of consultant services and 14 man-years of\n            training abroad; (f) a forest and forest industries\n            development strategy study and a regional development study."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
