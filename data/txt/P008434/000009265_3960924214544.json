The project experienced delays in\n            gaining effectiveness due to issues with parliamentary\n            ratification and a change in Government in 1980. The project\n            has provided the potential for long-term improved\n            productivity from Greece's forest lands while\n            simultaneously ensuring protection for the environmental and\n            amenity use aspects of these natural resources.\n            Sustainability is likely, as it is understood that proposals\n            on these subjects are to be included in the next five-year\n            development plan to commence in 1989. The Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily in the submission of progress and annual\n            reports. The main problems affecting project performance\n            have nearly all been due to issues of bureaucratic\n            procedure. The Bank provided continuity of supervision\n            personnel and responded positively and effectively to\n            mid-term circumstances. Bank/Government relations were good\n            and exhibited a spirit of cooperation, although ultimately\n            reconciliation on the Sector Strategy Study was never\n            achieved. The four principle lessons learned are: (i) more\n            consideration should have been shown to Greek sensitivities\n            when designing the approach to be followed for the Sector\n            Strategy Study; (ii) a more detailed and clearly defined\n            component for ensuring effective socio-economic evaluation\n            should have been included; (iii) more realistic assumptions\n            should have been made regarding the speed in procurement of\n            goods and services in view of the experiences of past\n            Bank-funded projects in the agriculture sector; and (iv) the\n            advantages of developing human capital in parallel with\n            efforts to increase production from the forestry sector have\n            been clearly demonstrated through the village development program."}, "docdt": "1988-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
