2.   Current project background

Original project: The original Loan in the amount of Euros 19.4 million (about US$25.0
million equivalent) was approved on March 14, 2006. It became effective on March 8,
2007, and the closing date is December 31, 2011. The project has two main objectives: (i)
increased access of the population living in low-income settlements to basic services; and
(ii) sustained access of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to civil work and
construction contracts with the public sector. The project includes five components: (i)
community-based infrastructure in low-income settlements, (ii) capacity building,
targeted to officials from the municipalities covered by the project, as well as various
ministries, and the beneficiary communities including technical assistance, and limited
contribution to equipment and operating costs; (iii) development of local SMEs in the
construction industry; (iv) support to the reform of public infrastructure management, and
(v) support to HIV/AIDS prevention programs in the six cities targeted by the project.
The project experienced a slow start-up due to: (i) a late fulfillment of effectiveness
conditions, (ii) the temporary suspension of disbursements to Gabon due to delays
encountered by the Government of Gabon in settling outstanding special accounts of
previous Bank projects, and (iii) a slow set-up of the Project Coordinating Unit.
Furthermore, the project was restructured on May 19, 2009 in order to focus on project
activities critical to achieve the project development objective (PDO) by increasing their
allocations to compensate for cost escalation; and (ii) to reduce the scope of activities
related to Part C of the project (Development of local SMEs in the construction industry).
The restructuring involved (i) streamlining a number of project activities; (ii) reallocating
among project components; and (iii) simplifying some of the output indicators for added
practicality and easier monitoring.

3. Project implementation progress

Despite delays incurred during the last two years, the mid-term review carried out in July
2010, confirmed the good status of the project. Implementation performance is now
satisfactory and the project is likely to achieve its objectives. Results of the project's
activities performed most of appraisal targets; both in terms of physical infrastructure,
access to services and capacity building. As of March 11 2011, disbursements amount to
63 percent of the loan; commitments stand at 80 percent; and most infrastructure works
are expected to be completed by early fiscal year 2011. The government failure to
comply with full payment of counterpart funds for the years 2009 and 2010 has been at
the origin of suspension of infrastructure works for most of the first half of 2010.
Currently, the situation has improved. A full payment of CY09 was made to the project
between July 8, 2010 and December 30, 2010, and the amount due for CY10 would be
paid together with the CY 2011 allocation.

Key results include an additional 34,700 people who now benefit from improved sanitary
conditions, compared to a baseline of 500 in 2007. With respect to improved and
sustained access of SMEs to civil work and construction contracts with the public sector,
more than 100 SMEs have been contracted through the project. Finally, all neighborhood
development plans for the six targeted municipalities have been completed.

Beneficiary satisfaction with the Project is very high, as evidenced in the mission's field
visits and during the stakeholder's consultation workshop organized during the mid-term
review mission. The event evidenced a strong demand for additional sub-projects aiming
to improve access to basic services to by population living in low-income settlements and
the need to move away from the classic project approach to a broader sector framework
focusing on the governance and capacity of cities and towns to deliver services on a
sustainable basis.

4. Reasons for the proposed reallocation

The proposed reallocation is necessary due to poor progress on component C of the
project (Development of local SMEs in the construction industry). The ministries of
Education and Health did not proceed as agreed with the transfer to CN-TIPPEE of
budgeted public resources allocated to the investment program in their respective sectors
and to be implemented through SMEs for FY09 and FY10. Therefore, the agreed
scheduled activities for this component could not resume due to lack of resources. The
situation is largely due to the political uncertainties and relative immobility that followed
the change in public administration over the last year. As the project will be closing on
December 31, 2011, the two parties have agreed to proceed with a reallocation of funds.
An amount of Euros 1,252,000 will be transferred from component 3(a) to components 1,
2, 3(b) and 5. The bulk of this transfer will be to component 1. This will provide the
project the opportunity to complete the works programmed under component 1, and
offset the unexpected high increase in construction costs. In addition, we noted that the
government's proposed allocation amount of Euros 98,000 for category 5 (Part E) is not
sufficient to cover the actual disbursed amount of Euros 111,901. This has been adjusted
to Euros 119,000 (including a supplement of Euros 7,000). The allocation under category
6 (Refunding of PPF) has also been adjusted to Euros 429,000 to reflect the actual
disbursed amount under this category. Therefore the team proposes to (i) reduce category
6 to Euros 429,000, (ii) increase category 5 to Euros 119,000, and (iii) allocate the
difference to increase category 1 to Euros 17,220,500.

The proposed reallocation will have no impact on the project development objectives and
on the project indicators.
