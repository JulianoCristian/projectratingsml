The purpose of the\n            restructuring is to: (i) focus on the project activities\n            that are critical to achieve the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO) by increasing their allocations to\n            compensate for cost escalation; and (ii) reduce the scope of\n            activities related to part of the project. The restructuring\n            will involve: (a) streamlining a number of project\n            activities; (b) reallocating among project components; and\n            (c) simplifying some of the output indicators for added\n            practicality and easier monitoring. As a result of the\n            restructuring, it is expected that the PDO will be achieved\n            and the implementation and monitoring of the project will\n            improve. The restructuring is based on the following\n            rationale: strengthen the focus of the project on the\n            component targeting community-based infrastructure upgrading\n            in low-income settlements, which are critical to achieve the\n            PDO; and reduce the number and complexity of output\n            indicators for easier monitoring."}, "docdt": "2011-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
