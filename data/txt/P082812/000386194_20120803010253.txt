﻿F. Results Framework Analysis
PDO (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project has two main objectives: (i) increased access of the population living in low-income settlements to
basic services; and (ii) sustained access of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to civil work and
construction contracts with the public sector.
Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised as it remained relevant throughout the project implementation. However, during the
project restructuring of May 2009, the wording of the PDO stated in the Loan Agreement (LA) was revised to
further align it to the presentation of the PDO in the PAD, namely: "increased access of the population living in low-
income settlements to basic services, and sustained access of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to civil
work and construction contracts with the public sector".

85 percent achievement. The difference between target and achieved values was due to
adjustment in project sites as the GoG implemented works in some of the sites originally
(incl.%       planned during appraisal. Therefore, the LIDP adjusted project location boundaries but in some
achievement)    areas population density was lower than that of the original project sites. Despite this
difference, the LIDP brought dramatic improvement in the number of people provided with
access to all season roads.

critical to achieve the PDO (i.e. increasing access to
basic services in low-income neighborhoods and
sustained access of SMEs to public works) by increasing
allocations to Component 1 (community-based
infrastructure up-grading by small infrastructure works

restructuring involved (i) streamlining a number of
project activities, in particular Component 3; (ii)
reallocating funding among project components; and
(iii) simplifying some of the output indicators.
Reallocation of funds from Component 3 to Component
1 due to the lack of materialization of counterpart
funding, following the changes and uncertainties in
public administration in 2009 and 2010.

﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at appraisal
1.     At appraisal, Gabon was a highly urbanized country characterized by the prevalence of low-
income settlements. With a Gross National Income per capita per year estimated at US$ 4,130 (2004
figure), Gabon was among Africa's few middle-income countries. In 2005, more than 75 percent of the
1.5 million Gabonese population was living in urban areas, with over 63 percent living in Libreville
(600,000 inhabitants) and Port-Gentil (115,000 inhabitants), and the remaining living in smaller cities
such as Franceville (55,000 inhabitants), Oyem (30,000 inhabitants), Lambar6n6 (25,000 inhabitants), and
Mouila (22,000 inhabitants). Despite its extraordinary biodiversity as well as rich deposits of magnesium
and iron ore1, in 2005 about 33 percent of Gabon's population was living below the poverty line.
2.     A large part of urban dwellers lived in flood-prone low-income settlements with precarious
access to basic infrastructure services. With only 40 percent of the urban population living within 500
meters of access to an all-season road, mobility to and within poor neighborhoods resulted in difficult and
irregular basic services delivery. Most of the districts could not be accessed by firefighters, ambulances,
or garbage collection trucks. Only 40 to 50 percent of all garbage produced in Libreville was collected
and delivered to the city landfill site. Households' connection to the water network varied between 35 and
70 percent. The lack of drainage system, compounded with location of settlements in flood prone areas,
increased the incidence of water born diseases and malaria.
3.     Municipal infrastructure development remained underfunded making more daunting the
challenges of providing needed local infrastructure and services to the growing urban population. Over
two decades, budget allocated to infrastructure represented less than 5 percent per year of public
investments, as investment priority was given to regional infrastructure development such as a national
roads network. In addition, most of municipal resources were tied to salaries and operational expenses.
For instance, in the case of Libreville and Port-Gentil, salaries accounted for about 80 percent of the
municipal budget and the remaining 20 percent went to operating expenses such as solid waste collection,
cleaning of side-drains and storm drainage systems, and routine maintenance of urban roads.
4.     The local private sector played a limited role in the development of local infrastructure. The local
private sector had a limited share in the public construction industry hindering its ability to play a
significant role in the development of municipal infrastructure. Small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) either intervened as sub-contractors for bigger foreign companies2 or operated in the informal
sector. Public procurement and contract management practices made the development of SMEs more
difficult, as many of them were not familiar with procurement and management procedures. Limited
access to credit made it harder for SMEs to operate.
5.     A number of initiatives were undertaken by the Government to boost urban development and
infrastructure investments, in particular a Pilot Community Infrastructure Works and Capacity Building
Project (PROTOTIPPEE). Initiatives included the completion of a National Urban Strategy in 2000
followed by the Declaration of Urban Policy in 2001. These documents stressed the importance of urban
investments as a mechanism to improve the living conditions in low-income settlements. Launched in
January 2001, the World Bank co-financed the PROTOTIPPEE pilot3 aimed at improving living
Gabon is the fifth largest oil producer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second exporter of manganese.
2 Local construction and service delivery industry in infrastructure were dominated by foreign firms using capital-intensive
technologies which were often inappropriate to infrastructure upgrading schemes in low-income areas and could be
disproportionate relative to the size of investments needed in most municipalities.

﻿conditions in selected poor urban neighborhoods and building local capacity (i.e. SMEs and communities)
to undertake a larger public works program. The pilot project contributed to the definition of appropriate
approaches for community-based upgrading of low-income settlements, improved access to services, and
encouraged the development of local SMEs by awarding infrastructure works contracts after open
competitive bidding and without noticeable cost overruns. It also strengthened the ability of
municipalities to coordinate these types of works. The PROTOTIPPEE was successfully implemented by
a technical unit within the Adjustment and Planning Program for the Urban and Transport Sectors
(PAPSUT), which demonstrated its capability to manage operations related to community-based
upgrading of low-income urban settlements.
6.     Based on the successful experience of PROTOTIPPEE, the Labor Intensive Small-Scale Public
Infrastructure Works (TIPPEE) program was adopted in 2005 at the national level aiming at scaling up
the small labor-based infrastructure works approach to promote employment and strengthen local private
sector capacity. The TIPPEE program was entrusted to a newly created TIPPEE National Commission,
which integrated the technical unit within PAPSUT.
7.      World Bank response. Between 1995 and 2004, the Bank supported the Government of Gabon
(GoG) in different domains, such as public sector reform, preparation of the GoG's poverty reduction and
growth strategy papers, preparation of the urban strategy, and co-financing the PROTOTIPPEE. In 2005,
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Gabon identified the strengthening of public resources
management and improvement of the investment climate as key to fostering sustainable, private sector-led
growth, boosting good governance, and reducing poverty. Based on the experience of the TIPPEE
Program, in 2006 the Bank prepared the Local Infrastructure Development Project (LIDP) to increase
access to basic services in low-income settlements by implementing (i) community-led micro-projects and
(ii) small infrastructure works to be contracted out with SMEs using TIPPEE methods. These methods
include: open competitive bidding, delegated contract management, rapid payment of invoices, and
external technical control. The preparation of the LIDP also responded to the CAS objectives of
supporting capacity building and investment programs, consolidating GoG's efforts to move to a private
services-oriented economy. In addition, the LIDP intended to further the decentralization process by
strengthening municipalities' capacity to manage urban infrastructure and promote community
engagement on local infrastructure development.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and key indicators
8.     The Project Development Objectives were (i) increased access of the population living in low-
income settlements to basic services; and (ii) sustained access of SMEs to civil works and construction
contracts with the public sector. The municipalities targeted by the project4 were Libreville, Port-Gentil,
Oyem, Franceville, Mouila and Lambar6n6 (provincial capitals), which, as of 2005, comprised more than
80 percent of the national population. The PDOs would be achieved by:
Implementing small infrastructure works indentified as priorities in targeted low-income
settlements' investment programs (carried out by SMEs using TIPPEE methods). The specific
objectives of these infrastructure works, mainly rehabilitation of roads and drainage, were to: (i)
improve mobility between the neighborhoods and existing transit systems; and (ii) by increasing
4 Several criteria was used for the selection of municipalities and neighborhoods:
(i)    Municipalities included needed to have more than 20,000 inhabitants according to the 1993 Census (as the 2003
Census was not available at appraisal).
(ii)   Municipalities included needed to have a municipal technical unit to carry out the project. At project appraisal,
Libreville, Port-Gentil, and Franceville had MTUs in place and Lambarn6, Oyem and, Mouila needed to establish one.
(iii)  Neighborhoods within the municipalities were selected based on degree of isolation (i.e. difficulty of access to
roads); low access to basic services, including water supply, drainage, electricity, health facilities, schools, and sports and
recreation facilities; high population density; and, LIDP's priorities.

﻿mobility, facilitate access to basic services such as urban police, solid waste collection,
firefighters, ambulances, and school buses.
*   Implementing micro-projects in targeted low-income settlements (carried out in collaboration
with the local communities). These micro-projects focused on the rehabilitation or construction of
small local facilities to facilitate pedestrian traffic (footpaths, cycle tracks, culverts, small
bridges); drinking fountains and public toilets; and rehabilitation or construction of collective
small facilities (playgrounds, small markets platforms, parking areas).
*   Supporting the preparation and management of neighborhood development plans aiming at
sustaining access to basic services within the beneficiary communities.
*   Implementing public works included in the Public Investment Program (PIP) of the ministries of
Health and Education (carried out by SMEs using TIPPEE methods).
*   Strengthening the GoG's administrative capacities in procurement and contract management
(construction and public works), in particular by supporting the TIPPEE program.
9.     Key outcome indicators selected for measuring and monitoring progress towards achieving the
PDOs are presented in Table 1.

SMEs                          contracted through TIPPEE methods) [1]
[1] According to project design SMEs would increase its access to sustained public works by implementing small
scale infrastructure works in low-income neighborhoods under Component 1 and public works included in the
Public Investment Program (PIP) of the ministries of Health and Education under Component 3. The referred
works would be procured using TIPPEE methods.
1.3 Revised PDO and key indicators
10.    Neither the PDO nor the PDO indicators were revised as they remained relevant throughout the
project implementation. However, during the project restructuring of May 2009, the wording of the PDO
stated in the Loan Agreement (LA) was revised to further align it with the presentation of the PDO in the
PAD, namely: "increased access of the population living in low-income settlements to basic services, and
sustained access of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to civil work and construction contracts
with the public sector". In addition, during the May 2009 restructuring, some of the output indicators'
were simplified (see Section 1.7 below).
5Due to measuring difficulties, the indicator "reduced number of floods in targeted areas" was replaced by the "additional
length of rainwater drainage" and the indicator "number of dumps sites" suppressed because of the absence of direct
relation with project activities.

﻿1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.    The impacts of the project were intended to primarily benefit the population living in targeted
low-income neighborhoods within Libreville, Port-Gentil, Oyem, Franceville, Mouila and Lambar6nL
The benefits would be felt largely in terms of higher mobility due to the rehabilitation of roads and
drainage, which would, in turn, improve physical living conditions and access to basic services. In
addition, the population would benefit from employment opportunities emerging from the use of labor-
intensive construction techniques for the execution of infrastructure works by SMEs and communities.
12.    The project intended to benefit SMEs by increasing the amount of SME-contracted works using
TIPPEE methods and targeted capacity building activities. The project comprised small infrastructure
works in low-income communities and public works included in the ministries of Health and Education
PIPs, which would be contracted with SMEs.
13.    Municipalities would benefit from strengthening their municipal technical units. As the entities
responsible for delivering most of these services, municipalities would benefit from increased capacity to
mobilize local resources, to identify, prioritize, and undertake sustainable investments relevant to the
needs of their populations, and to maintain these assets through the development of a systematic approach
to financing, and operations and maintenance arrangements.
14.    Communities in charge of implementing micro-project under the LIDP would also benefit from
project activities. Community associations responsible for micro-project implementation and maintenance
would benefit from capacity building activities related to structuring of district committees,
communication strategies, and infrastructure operations and maintenance.
15.    On a broader scale, the population would benefit from the LIDP. Infrastructure works would
lower production costs due to decreasing vehicle maintenance and transport costs resulting from road
improvements; increased productivity and efficiency arising from reduced flooding and avoided flood
damages to economic property from the rehabilitation of drainage networks; and an enhanced investment
climate due to improved service delivery. In addition, the HIV/AIDS prevention program would benefit
the population at large.
1.5 Original components
16.    The project included five major components related to the increased access to services and
sustainable development of SMEs, as follows:
*   Component 1. Community-based infrastructures upgrading in low income settlements
*   Component 2. Capacity building
*   Component 3. Support to the development of local SMEs in the construction industry
*   Component 4. Support to the reform of public infrastructure management
*   Component 5. Support to HIV/AIDS prevention programs
1.6 Revised components
17.    The project components were not revised. However, during the May 2009 and March 2011
restructurings, some activities were cancelled and corresponding funding reallocated (See Section 1.7
below and Table 2).

﻿1.7 Other significant changes 6
18.    May 2009 Restructuring'. As of May 2009 the implementation of infrastructure works were
behind schedule due to initial delays in project effectiveness. These delays originated in the late
fulfillment of effectiveness conditions and the temporary suspension of disbursements to Gabon resulting
from delays encountered by the Government of Gabon in settling outstanding special accounts of
previous Bank projects. Thus as of May 2009, only 20 percent of the loan had been disbursed. The
increase in construction costs between appraisal and May 2009, due to high inflation and the scarcity of
materials in some project sites, also affected project implementation. In addition, some activities, such as
the training and capacity strengthening of local private sector entrepreneurs, were absorbed by other
programs (see Table 2). These reasons led to the first project restructuring on May 2009 aiming at
focusing the project on Component 1 (Community-based infrastructure upgrading in low-income
settlements). This was at the core of the PDO as it contributed to increased access to basic services in
low-income settlements and improved and sustained access of small-scale enterprises (SMEs) to civil
works and construction contracts with the public sector. Hence, some activities were cancelled or reduced
in scope' (Table 2) and funding reallocated among remaining sub-components. In particular, the support
provided for the implementation of public works included in the PIP (Component 3, sub-component (i))
was reduced to only cover the ministries of Health and Education. In addition, the output indicators were
* *9
revised for easier monitoring.
19.    March 2011 Restructuring0. Political uncertainties and change in public administration followed
the death of President Omar Bongo Ondimba in June 2009. As a result, the transfer of budgeted public
resources to TIPPEE, for implementation of PIPs works in the ministries of Health and Education for
2009, 2010 and 2011, did not materialize (Component 3, sub-component (i)). Therefore, works included
under Component 3 could not carry forward given the lack of counterpart funding. Hence, during this
second restructuring, funds were reallocated towards Component 11" (see Table 2). This reallocation of
funds from Component 3 to Component 1 offered the opportunity to complete the works programmed
under Component 1 and offset the unexpected high increase in construction costs. On counterpart
funding, the loan agreement anticipated 60 percent counterpart funding for Component 3 and 20 percent
for the other components. Therefore, the reallocation of funds from Component 3 to Component 1 led to a
reduction in the required counterpart funding.
Under this section, only the first two restructurings are discussed (i.e. those that took place in May 2009 and March 2011,
respectively). The third restructuring was an Amendment of Article III, Section 3.02 (c) of the Loan Agreement for the
LIDP, to reflect the reduction of the required counterpart funding following the second restructuring in the payment of
deposits to be done by the GoG.

This restructuring did not raise the environmental category of the project nor trigger new safeguard policies.

﻿2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project preparation, design, and quality at entry
20.    Project preparation. A qualified team with the required skills was in charge of project
preparation, and an adequate monitoring system and related tools were established. Safeguards issues
were properly covered. However, the financial and economic analyses conducted at appraisal only
identified potential direct and indirect benefits related to the rehabilitation of urban roads. Therefore, the
ex-post economic and financial analysis conducted as part of this ICR is not comparable with the one
conducted at appraisal as the former quantifies the present value (PV) and economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) of benefits and costs associated with the rehabilitation of roads and drainage in targeted
neighborhoods (see Section 3.3 and Annex 3).
21.    Project design. To achieve its objectives, the LIDP directly financed infrastructure investments,
while the design also included well-targeted activities aimed at strengthening beneficiary municipalities'
use of improved urban management tools for programming, implementing and monitoring their
investment programs, and improving municipal management and maintenance capacity. This would lay
the groundwork for continued improvements in access to infrastructure.
22.    Based on the lessons learned from the PROTOTIPPEE pilot and the TIPPEE program, the project
design responded to the needs of targeted communities by identifying infrastructure works key to
increasing access to basic services. Also, the design built upon the existing institutional capacity of the
GoG (through the TIPPEE program) and recognized the importance of furthering the capacity of
municipalities, communities, and SMEs to identify and implement infrastructure works and micro-
projects. In particular,
*  Component 1 (Community-based infrastructures upgrading) responded to the gradual approach
initiated by the PROTOTIPPEE pilot and continued by the TIPPEE national program to engage
SMEs in small scale infrastructure works and promote community participation in the design and
implementation of micro-projects. This component included three sub-components: (i)
implementation of small infrastructure works by contracting SMEs using TIPPEE methods; (ii)
capacity strengthening of the six targeted municipalities, beneficiary communities, the Ministry
of Cities and the Ministry of Local Governments; and (iii) preparation and implementation of
neighborhood development plans, in which infrastructure works to be implemented would be
identified, and responsibilities for implementation, management, and maintenance would be
defined. Hence, this component was at the core of the PDOs as, through SMEs' implementation
of infrastructure works (i) increased access to basic urban services would be achieved; and (ii)
SMEs' role in the construction industry would be strengthened.
*  Component 2 (Capacity building) aimed at scaling up capacity building activities that were
central to the success of the PROTOTIPPEE pilot and the TIPPEE program, such as on-the-job
training of local government staff to actively involve them in project design and implementation;
community training in the selection of infrastructure works, mobilization of community
contributions, and works' procedures. In particular, the design included activities to reinforce the
municipal technical units.
*  Component 3 (Support to the development of local SMEs in the construction industry) was
designed to: (i) support implementation of public works included in the PIPs of the Health and
Education ministries using the TIPPEE methods; (ii) train and build capacity of local SMEs; and
(iii) carry out a study on improving SMEs' access to suitable financing. Public works included
under this component were different from the infrastructure upgrading works of municipalities
included under Component 1 (also to be contracted with SMEs). Therefore, this component
7


﻿would further contribute to the sustainable development of SMEs (i.e. in addition to the activities
with this purpose already included in Component 1).
*  Component 4 (Support to the reform of public infrastructure management) aimed at strengthening
the GoG's administrative capacities in procurement and contract management (construction and
public works), in particular by supporting the TIPPEE program - which was created one year
before project preparation.
* Component 5 (Support to HIV/AIDS prevention programs) aimed at supporting the fight against
the spread of HIV/AIDS in the cities targeted by the project.
23.    A Specific Investment Loan (SIL) was the selected lending instrument to support the creation,
rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure. The SIL instrument was considered suitable to scale up
the scope of the pilot PROTOTIPPEE and the TIPPEE program as it helped ensure the technical,
financial, economic, environmental and institutional viability of investments. By contrast, a Sector
Investment Maintenance Loan that would have financed larger investments in urban infrastructure, land
management, and municipal development was not adopted. It was unlikely that significant changes
would have been introduced during the project's life, since the project objective consisted of scaling-up
the scope of the pilot PROTOTIPPEE project so that its design was modeled on, but also gained from,
results and lessons learned during its implementation. Neither was a Social Fund-type adopted because
these largely rely on external sources for the design and implemention of community-based infrastructure
projects, whereas in the case of Gabon, these projects are financed by the central government and
municipalities.
24.    Risks and their mitigation. Overall the project's major risks were identified at project preparation
(Table 3) but some planned measures to mitigate the risks were insufficient, as demonstrated during
project implementation (see Section 2.2).

25.    Adequacy of participatory process. Adequate consultations with stakeholders took place during
consultations carried out during the CAS preparation process. Stakeholders were extremely favorable to
scaling up the PROTOTIPPEE and expanding the upgrade activities for low-income settlements. The
project was prepared in collaboration with the communities and non-governmental organizations
identified in the pilot project, in particular women's groups and youths organized along common
economic/employment interests.
2.2 Implementation
26.    Implementation agency. The project was implemented by the PS of the TIPPEE Program, which
was designed to promote the development of local SMEs by facilitating their access to small public
infrastructure projects. The TIPPEE program is headed by the TIPPEE National Commission comprised
of a ministerial committee, a steering committee, the PS, and an audit department. Daily management of
both the TIPPEE program and the LIDP were handled by the PS12. The increased support provided to the
TIPPEE program (Component 4) during the first project restructuring in May 2009 (Table 2) was key to
increase the capacity of the PS and its ability to manage the rising amount of public works to be
contracted with SMEs.
27.    Mid-term review (MTR). Despite delays incurred during the first two years, the July 2010 MTR
corroborated the satisfactory implementation of the LIDP: (i) appraisal targets were being achieved; (ii)
disbursements amounted to 50 percent of the loan and commitments to 80 percent; and (iii) most
infrastructure works were expected to be completed by project closing. As confirmed at project closing,
the MTR recognized the good implementation performance and that the project was likely to achieve its
objectives. However as the GoG had failed to fulfill counterpart funding for the implementation of works
included in the PIPs of ministries of Education and Health, a second restructuring was proposed during
the MTR - which took place in March 2011.
28.    Factors that contributed to successful implementation. The implementation of the LIDP was
successful due to multiple factors, among them:
12 The PS was responsible for the overall implementation of the project, including all civil works, general studies and
capacity building activities. It was also be responsible for procurement, contract management and overall financial and
administrative management. In this capacity, it prepared quarterly implementation reports to be addressed to the Bank. The
Audit Department of the TIPPEE Program was responsible for contracting out annual technical and financial independent
audits.

﻿* Building on lesson learned from the PROTOTIPPEE pilot. The project continued with the work
initiated by the PROTOTIPPE pilot, which proved to be a successful option for delivering basic
infrastructure services to low-income communities and promoting participation of the SMEs in
public works.
* Flexibility of project design. The project design allowed for changes during implementation -as
demonstrated by the project restructurings- without having to change the PDOs, which remain
relevant through project implementation. Indeed, the project activities were focused on increasing
access to basic services by implementing infrastructure works by SMEs. Therefore, the
cancellation of the public works included in the ministries' PIPs did not affect the core of the
PDO as resources were reallocated to the implementation of infrastructure works in low-income
communities. This, in turn, translated in increased access to basic services and increased amount
of works contracted out with SMEs. In this way, the project was able to achieve its development
objectives and faced the challenges imposed by costs escalation, delays in project effectiveness
and lack of materialization of counterpart funding. In addition, project design gave room for the
cancelation of some activities that were absorbed by other projects (see Table 2), without
compromising achievement of the PDOs.
*  Funding reallocation. Reallocation of funds between components was key to achieving the
PDOs. The two consecutive project restructurings allowed for the completion of works
programmed under Component 1, offsetting cost overruns, and resolving issues related to
payment of the required counterpart funding.
*  Strengthening of the PS. Despite initial delays in setting up the PS, the Project Implementation
Unit was strengthened by recruiting key staff: a Director for the Development and Partnership
Unit, a Procurement Assistant, and six Project Leaders.
*  Engagement of communities in infrastructure works identification. The permanent presence of
consultants in charge of community engagement was instrumental in ensuring continuous
dialogue and interaction with targeted communities, which, in turn, contributed towards a strong
project reception by the project's beneficiaries. In addition, these activities largely contributed to
the successful implementation of social and environmental mitigation measures (including
compensation and structuring of community associations).
29.    Factors that gave rise to problems in implementation. Project implementation encountered
challenges regarding slow start up, political uncertainties, counterpart funding delays, cost increases, and
constraints affecting works' implementation, which were adequately handled during implementation as
demonstrated by the achievement of the project objectives.
*  Slow project start up. The project became effective one year after the Bank Board of Directors'
approval because of the GoG's late fulfillment of effectiveness conditions. In addition, a number
of external circumstances contributed to the slowdown of project implementation in its first two
years. These included scarce supply of materials in some municipalities and the temporary
suspension of disbursements to Gabon (from March 2007 to February 2008) due to delay
encountered by the GoG in settling outstanding special accounts for previous Bank projects.
Afterward, the project was able to accelerate implementation of works and capacity building
activities so as to achieve and (in some cases) surpass targets defined at appraisal (see Section F
of the Data Sheet) and delivered a significant amount of outputs that benefit people living in low-
income areas (see Annex 2).
*  Political uncertainties. Frequent changes in public administration resulted in change of
interlocutors at the ministry levels and lack of appropriation of the TIPPEE program by new
officials. These factors contributed to the slowdown in project implementation, in particular
Component 3. The ministries of Health and Education, responsible for inscription of public works
10


﻿to be implemented under the TIPPEE methods in their PIPs, were uncertain about budget
allocations; despite being budgeted, the funds allocated to public works in the Health and
Education sector were not committed during the two first years, and it was removed from the
finances law for the third year of the LIDP. For the same reason the TIPPEE operating budget for
2010 and 2011 was not included in the budget of the Ministry in charge of TIPPEE's supervision.
*   Counterpart funding delays. The government delays in compliance with full payment of
counterpart funding for 2009 and 2010 led to the initial reduction and later cancellation of
funding for the implementation of works included in the line ministries' PIPs (Component 3).
However, this challenge was handled adequately during the first and second project
restructurings, in which more emphasis was placed on the implementation of small infrastructure
works and micro-projects at the municipal level, so that the PDO was not put at risk.
*   Costs increases. Unit costs of infrastructure works increased about 50 percent during project
implementation, as compared to unit costs estimates at 2003, due mainly to high inflation (33
percent in the first two years). In particular, the costs of cement, fuel, and steel bars increased by
20 to 50 percent between 2008 and 2010. Furthermore, to reach some remote cities such as Port-
Gentil and Oyem sand and aggregate had to be transported more than 200 kilometers. However,
costs overruns faced in Component I were offset during the first and second project restructurings
due to the reallocation of funds from Component 3 to Component 1. Reallocation of funds
between components resulted in total increase of Components 1 and 4 by 19 and 28 percent,
respectively, while Components 3 and 5 decreased by 90 and 80 percent, respectively.
*   Constraints affecting implementation of works. Initial constraints resulted in implementation
delays at the beginning of the LIDP, including: (i) weak capacity of SMEs; (ii) quality of
technical studies were not appropriate for upgrading works in urban settlements; and (iii) weak
supervision of works. These constraints were successfully addressed by the PS and Bank team
through a number of corrective measures leading to the acceleration of project implementation,
including: (i) introduction of stricter criteria for SME pre-qualification; (ii) enhancement of
capacity building plans for selected SMEs; and (iii) hands-on support to enhance quality control
and management.
30.    Risks. The risk to PDOs - the lack of priority of the TIPPEE Program in Government policy -
was estimated as modest at project appraisal (see Table 3). In the first two years of the project, the GoG
failed to appoint the required staff for the PS of the TIPPEE program. In addition, the GoG failed to fulfill
the counterpart funding required for the implementation of infrastructure works included in the line
ministries' PIPs, leading to the partial cancellation of related activities included under Component 3
during the project restructuring of May 2009 (see Section 1.7). Yet, adequate mitigation measures put in
place during the first restructuring (i.e. increasing the support to the TIPPEE Program and placing more
emphasis on the execution of infrastructure works at the municipal level), compounded with strong
leadership of the PS (once it was properly staffed) and close supervision by the Bank team led to the
achievement of the LIDP PDOs in the original timeframe.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation design, implementation and utilization
31.    M&E Design. Regular Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) was an integrated part of the project
and under the responsibility of the PS. The PS designed a plan for M&E and a guide to data collection,
accompanied by monitoring cards which were designed and implemented by the PS, building upon tools
developed under the pilot project. To ensure close monitoring of investments made by the LIDP, the plan
included the establishment of local committees for M&E using the tools of data collection included in the
guide for data collection.
11


﻿32.    A baseline survey was conducted in the targeted settlements prior to project effectiveness to
determine the conditions of access to various basic services (distance to the main road, distance to public
transportation, distance to nearest water supply, sanitary conditions, access to electricity, among others)
and assess the technical capacity of municipalities and local SMEs.
33.    M&E Implementation. The project monitoring was conducted using quarterly progress reports
based on the results framework included in the PAD and Loan Agreement. A comprehensive assessment
of LIDP achievements was carried out at the project MTR. The intermediate outcome indicators were
simplified during project implementation to reflect project changes, in particular, reallocation of funds.
The M&E department created within the PS gathered data and calculated figures for indicators. A
satisfaction survey and final impact assessment were carried out after project closing.
2.4 Safeguard and fiduciary compliance
34.    Environmental and social safeguards. The project was rated Category B as no adverse long-term
environmental or social impacts were anticipated. As the LIDP triggered the Environmental Assessment
(OP4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12) safeguards, an Environment and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were prepared by the GoG in
compliance with Bank requirements. The ESMF and RPF were disclosed in the World Bank InfoShop on
February 22, 2005.
35.    Safeguard compliance experienced difficulties during 2009. Indeed, overall safeguard compliance
was rated moderately unsatisfactory in 2009 (ISR # 9, March 2009) due to: (i) PS's failure to recruit an
environmental and social specialist to provide coordination and training in these fields; (ii) in Port-Gentil,
some works were initiated before full completion of the impact study and a detailed evaluation of the
compensations to be paid for minor disturbances such as replacement of fences, even though
compensations were paid; (iii) in Lambaren6 the municipality failed to mobilizing necessary financial
resources to proceed with compensation for illegal occupancy resulting in the discontinuation of several
road works; and (iv) in a few cases, the proposed mitigation measures did not fit site conditions and could
not be implemented. During the MTR it was recommended that the PS: (i) recruit a part-time consultant
to provide regular coordination, monitor progress, and train municipal staff; and (iii) ensure that
operations strictly follow Bank procedures, including submission of all impact studies for Bank review
prior to launching of works.
36.    Safeguard compliance significantly improved after the adoption of recommendations made during
the MTR and Bank implementation support missions. In March 2010, safeguard compliance was
upgraded from moderately unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory (ISRs #12 and # 13, March and July
2010, respectively) as the action plan agreed upon between the Bank and the client in November 2009 and
February 2010 was been implemented: (i) environmental and social monitoring indicators were integrated
into the M&E system; (ii) training modules were prepared to improve safeguard compliance and training
was about to be launched; and (iii) appropriate publication of documents and filing of complaints was also
underway. In addition, two safeguards specialist were hired to (i) identify potential social and
environmental impacts of micro-projects and to recommend mitigation measures, and (ii) ensure
measures were effectively implemented and aligned with the ESMF. As most recommendations were
adopted, safeguard compliance was again upgraded to satisfactory in the second part of 2011 (ISRs #14
and # 15, August and December 2011, respectively).
37.    Procurement performance was mostly rated moderately satisfactory during implementation.
Nearly 612 contracts (works, supplies, services) were procured using competitive bidding procedures
during the implementation of the LIDP. Substantial progress was made with respect to pre- and post-
procurement procedures, record keeping, and quality of bidding documentation and evaluation reports. In
particular, the LIDP helped promote a gradual transfer of procurement responsibilities from the PS to
12


﻿municipalities. Also, the project was the first procurement experience for most SMEs13 that contracted as
part of the LIDP. The main shortcomings were associated with delays in the completion of works and
weak application of sanctions where contractual delays were excessive (ISRs #14 and # 15, August and
December 2011, respectively). However, the introduction of stricter criteria for SME pre-qualification
and enhancement of capacity building plans for selected SMEs strongly contributed to mitigating risk of
contractual delays.
38.    Financial management was mostly rated moderately satisfactory during implementation. Main
financial requirements were met in budget planning and expenditure tracking, accounting, reporting,
auditing, and disbursement. In addition, recommendations made during supervision missions were mostly
taken into consideration. Monitoring reports were produced on a regular basis.
2.5 Post-completion operation and next phase
39.    Recognizing the pressing need for economic diversification, the recently-approved Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) (May 2012) focuses its new strategy on improving the investment climate and
developing skills, and providing assistance to SMEs, including fostering links with larger investors or
industries. Building on analytical and advisory activities related to export diversification and
competitiveness, employment, and growth, the CPS proposes to focus on four specific areas: (i)
establishing an investment climate favorable to private investment (ii) fostering industry-specific
competitiveness; and (iii) enhancing competitiveness through in-firm technical learning; and (iv)
supporting institutional reform and project implementation.
40.    The LIDP was the only project of its scale that was dedicated to improving the living conditions
of the urban poor. The objective of promoting and developing SMEs in the construction and civil works
industry remains highly relevant and needs to be reflected in a follow-up activity. Based on the success of
the LIDP and growing demand for additional sub-projects expressed by the population living in low-
income neighborhoods, the Bank is analyzing options for a follow-up operation in the context of the
recently approved CPS (May 2012). In addition, the GoG is analyzing its ability to carry out a second
phase of investments with its own resources.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of objectives, design, and implementation
41.    The PDOs remained highly relevant from project implementation through to project closing as
demonstrated by the conditions of low-income settlements in urban centers in Gabon (i.e. need to increase
access to basic services and to expand and support access of SMEs to public works). A beneficiary survey
carried out in April 2011 showed a continuing growing demand for additional sub-projects by the
population living in low-income settlements to improve access to basic services, in particular services
related to urban mobility and sanitation. In addition, during project implementation there was a need for
capacity building of beneficiary cities, ministries, and the local private sector with focus on:
*  Resource mobilization to face the huge cost of neighborhood infrastructure development and
maintenance;
*  Municipal and financial management, including priority maintenance programs;
*  Improvement of urban planning practices;
1 All the contracts related to small infrastructures works in Component I were awarded to SMEs.
13


﻿*   Urban environmental management (to be carried out through a partnership with the African
Development Bank);
*   Support to HIV/AIDS programs;
*   Strategic drainage plans and anti-erosion infrastructure; and
*   Studies and cross-cutting activities (e.g., elaboration of neighborhood development plans) and other
training activities for cities, central government, and local SMEs.
42.    Project design and implementation remained highly relevant during project implementation
through to project closing as it reflected proper diagnosis of development priorities and was relevant to
the existing challenges in the urban sector. Focusing on small infrastructure works and micro-projects
implemented by SMEs, the project design remained highly relevant for addressing infrastructure needs in
low-income neighborhoods in Gabon while at the same time promoting the development of SMEs. In this
way, the LIDP contributed to achieving country and Bank objectives of increasing access to basic services
and promoting the local private sector. In addition, the Bank's implementation support remained relevant
in view of the changing circumstances such as cost increases and absence of expected counterpart
funding. Finally, the implementation arrangements contributed to furthering the decentralization process
in Gabon, including building municipal and community capacity in the construction and management of
basic infrastructure services.
3.2 Achievement of PDO
43.    The achievement of the PDO is rated as moderately satisfactory as evidenced by the achievement
of the key outcome indicators (Table 4). However, there were moderate shortcomings related to the
sustainability of access of SMEs to public sector civil works and construction contracts. Further detail on
the achievement of each of the elements of the PDO is provided below and in Annex 2.

Section F of the Data Sheet for further details.
44.    Increased access to basic services. The LIDP significantly improved the living conditions of
urban dwellers: 62,907 additional people benefited from year-round access to transport and vehicle
services, as about 10.2 kilometers of urban roads were rehabilitated; and 93,465 additional people
benefited from improved sanitary conditions due to the extension of the drainage network by about 13.7
kilometers. In addition, 223 micro-projects were implemented by communities in targeted neighborhoods,
including the construction or rehabilitation of: 90 metal truss bridges and pedestrian crossings / gateways
in marshlands; 20 bus stations and shelters; 7 new classrooms; 63 collective sanitary blocs and toilettes; 6
community multipurpose halls; and 30 public water tap stands. The establishment of a social project
14


﻿management unit in each targeted neighborhood worked to involve communities in identifying and
implementing micro-projects and was instrumental in changing the perception of neighborhood residents
about national and local governments, helped forge new social relations within neighborhoods, and
developed a concept of public interest. Finally, target communities benefited from HIV/AIDS and malaria
prevention campaigns: 78,200 dwellers participated in HIV/AIDS sensitization campaigns and 452 people
were trained in HIV/AIDS and malaria related issues; and 240,000 condoms and 200 mosquito nets were
distributed. According to the beneficiary survey conducted in April 2011, 87 percent of those surveyed
believe the LIDP improved their welfare. In addition, the neighborhood development plans prepared by
the six targeted municipalities under the LIDP helped them identify and prioritize investments, and to
measure efforts needed to realize infrastructure development and maintenance.
45.    Sustained access of SMEs to civil works and construction contracts with the public sector.
Despite the cancellation of infrastructure works in the Health and Education ministries' PIPs (under
Component 3) intended for contracting with SMEs, access to civil works by SMEs increased during the
LIDP. About 612 contracts14 were signed with SMEs for about CFAF 15.8 billion (US$32.2 million) at
project closing. As part of the LIDP, approximately 150 construction industry SMEs had at least one
contract via the project during the project's life; over 360 SMEs benefited from capacity building
programs related to procurement, technical, and contract management issues, including hands-on targeted
support to individual SMEs on making and laying paving stone. Other factors that contribute to SMEs'
sustained access to public sector civil works and construction contracts are:
*  Support provided by the LIDP to municipalities to build their managerial and planning skills for
municipal investments, which contributes to the sustainability of SME access to the construction
industry. The LIDP supported the establishment and strengthening of six municipal technical
units dedicated to infrastructure operations and maintenance and the preparation of eight
neighborhood development plans. The municipalities fully appropriated the TIPPEE methods and
already used documents developed by the project (bidding document, request for proposal, etc.).
*  Continuation of the National TIPPEE Program based on labor-intensive works and employment
creation will offer SMEs the opportunity to bid on contracts related to infrastructure upgrade
operations in low-income settlements and the construction of small infrastructure works identified
under the Public Investment Program (PIP) and implemented along the TIPPEE methods. The
capacity of the TIPPEE program will be reinforced by installing a terrestrial fiber optic cable
from Libreville to Franceville supported by the Agence Frangaise de D6veloppement (AFD), the
GoG and the Bank. This network will connect Libreville, Port-Gentil, and Franceville to address
most of the current pent-up demand for better connectivity.
*  Strengthening the PS and TIPPEE programs, which developed good project management
practices, familiarity with donors' procedures, and participatory approaches that helped to
organize communities for greater efficiency in micro-project implementation and improving
image of local and public authorities. The additional support - for streamlining PIP preparation
and implementation of procurement and contract management methods - contributes to making
the public sector demand for civil works more sustainable and accessible to local SMEs.
46.    However, much more needs to be done to enhance the capacity of SMEs to participate in public
bidding and execution of works. In particular, for those SMEs contracting with the GoG for the first time,
they need to further familiarize themselves with TIPPEE methods, elaboration of business plans, and
implementation of public works. The implementation of some activities originally included in the LIDP,
such as improving the financial environment for local businesses, support for the management of public
procurement, and improving the regulatory framework and professional ethics, would have contributed to
boosting the sustainability of this outcome. These activities became part of a larger GOG program or were
14 Works, goods, consultants
15


﻿absorbed by other programs but discussions have been held with GOG regarding policy and processes to
ensure sustainability of this outcome. Looking forward, in order to guarantee the sustainability of this
outcome, the GoG, other development partners, and the private sector need to continue contracting out
works with SMEs in the construction industry. In addition, further capacity building activities will
reinforce the sustainability of the results obtained by the LIDP in this area.
3.3 Efficiency
47.    The ex-post assessment of the project's economic efficiency reveals that the EIRR was
substantially higher than the opportunity cost of capital for both the rehabilitation of urban roads and for
drainage, and thus the project achieved important efficiency gains. These estimates are based on
conservative assumptions and do not take into consideration numerous benefits for which estimation was
not possible due to data constraints (see Annex 3). The ex-post economic and financial analysis conducted
as part of this ICR is not comparable with the one conducted at appraisal, as the former quantifies the
present value (PV) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of benefits and costs associated with the
rehabilitation of roads and drainage in targeted neighborhoods.
48.     Costs. Total project investment in the rehabilitation of about 10.2 kilometers of urban roads and
13.7 kilometers of drainage amounts to about US$21.7 million. On average, the rehabilitation of one
meter of urban roads and drainage was US$2,526. The associated cost of maintenance of these
investments over the 15-year period is about US$1.6 million. Therefore, the total cost of the project is
assumed to be about US$22.9 million.
49.    Benefits. Benefits considered for the analysis are: (i) declining cost of passengers' fare; (ii)
declining vehicle operation costs; (iii) improving health and reducing health expenses; (iv) reduction of
working days lost to flooding; and (v) reduction of property lost to flooding.
50.    Cost-benefit analysis. The ex-post analysis concludes that the EIRR of the investments made on
urban roads and drainage rehabilitation is 28 percent, based on rather conservative assumptions. This
EIRR exceeds an assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent, cost that is expected for this kind of
project and therefore the project's urban roads and drainage investments can be considered sound. The PV
of the benefit stream over the project's time horizon (15 years) is about US$23 million, assuming
opportunity cost of capital equal to 12 percent.
51.    Besides direct economic benefits, there are many other potential benefits that are not factored into
the cost benefit analysis described here. This is either because estimating such benefits is difficult because
of the unavailability of the data or because it is impossible to quantify the value of these benefits. Some of
these potential benefits include economic development, improvements in health and welfare of
beneficiary populations, improvements in public safety, sustained economic activity, improved system
reliability, among others. Therefore, the estimated benefits of the project described in this analysis can be
considered conservative, and it can reasonably assumed that the actual economic benefits will be much
larger.
3.4 Justification of overall outcome rating
52.    The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory for several reasons: (i) the project
objectives, design and implementation arrangements remain highly relevant; (ii) it achieved its stated
development objectives of improving access to basic services for the population living in low-income
settlements in urban centers; and, provided the basis for sustained access of SMEs to civil works and
construction contracts with the public sector; and (iii) there were important efficiency gains derived from
investments made under the project components. However, there were moderate shortcomings related to
the sustainability of access of SMEs to civil works and construction contracts with the public sector.
16


﻿53.    The overall outcome rating is aligned with the PDO progress rating included in the two latest
ISRs - moderately satisfactory - (#14 March 2011 and #15 December 2011). The PDO and
implementation progress ratings ranged from unsatisfactory to satisfactory during the project's life (see
Section G of the Data Sheet), reflecting shortcomings during project implementation.
3.5 Overarching themes, other outcomes and impacts
54.    Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development. Micro-projects were designed towards
gender-based and social development: community facilities, such as stand-posts and washhouses built
within municipalities, helped to lighten the workload for women while other community infrastructure,
such as bus shelters, playing fields, and community multipurpose hall contributed to social development.
In addition, the use of labor-intensive construction techniques fostered job creation and generated income
for urban dwellers, which contributed to poverty alleviation.
55.    Institutional Cihawg, and .So 1igda itig The project intended to strengthen the institutional
capacity of various actors involved in the LIDP, particularly municipalities and community associations.
As a result, a set of management tools was developed to help municipalities and community associations
improve infrastructure management. The establishment and strengthening of municipal technical units
contributed to better consideration of residents' needs and increasing accountability of local government
officials in the implementation of neighborhood development plans.
3.6. Summary of findings of stakeholder workshop and beneficiary survey
56.    A stakeholder workshop was held during the MTR (July 2010) with significant participation by
municipal mayors and community leaders. The participants expressed overall satisfaction with the LIDP
and the implementing agency. The workshop recommended continuing training technical staff in the use
of the management tools and providing strong support to decentralized structures for resource
mobilization and financial management.
57.    The beneficiary assessment survey carried out in April 2011 demonstrated high satisfaction
among project beneficiaries with LIDP's activities and results. LIDP's activities were seen as a quality of
life improvement that opened up opportunities for improved livelihoods. About 87 percent of all surveyed
beneficiaries considered that services delivered through built infrastructures were indispensable. The
impacts of having permanent access to transport as well as easy and safe circulation within districts were
highly appreciated as they provide for easier access to schools and health centers, attract new business in
the districts and contribute to develop commercial activity, and increase land and property values. In
addition, service providers had a positive opinion of the LIDP: about 60 percent were satisfied with
contract management, and the frequency and volume of activities, and found the capacity strengthening
program to be relevant.
58.    The beneficiary assessment also revealed the large demand for projects like the LIDP. The top
priorities for the beneficiaries related to the following aspects: difficulty for households to connect to the
water supply network; insecurity in neighborhoods as population remained confronted by a lack of
physical safety and theft; and insalubrities of numerous neighborhoods in the project areas due to the lack
of appropriate infrastructures and the absence of maintenance.
4. Assessment of risk to development outcome
59.    Rating. After project closing, the question is whether the development outcome will be
maintained over time in view of the risks to the development outcome and how these have been mitigated
by actions taken during project implementation. The risks may come primarily from two factors: (i)
failure of maintenance of infrastructure and micro-projects due to insufficient budgetary provisions and/or
17


﻿lack of ownership; and (ii) insufficient experience of some of the SMEs that contracted out works under
the LIDP for the first time. The risk to the development outcome is rated moderate, as adequate measures
to mitigate these risks were put in place during project implementation, but uncertainty remains as to
whether these SMEs will continue to do contracted work with the GoG, other development partners, and
the private sector. More details are provided in Table 5.

﻿5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower performance
5.1 Bank performance
60.    Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry. The Bank's performance in the identification,
preparation, and appraisal of the project is rated satisfactory. The Bank facilitated a participatory process
in the emerging urban sector, bringing knowledge and tools that could be adapted to the Gabonese context
and used productively, including leveraging Bank safeguards policies in the dialogue to improve
resettlement processes. The Bank identified, facilitated the preparation of, and appraised the operation,
and found that an operation such it was most likely to achieve the PDO and was consistent with the
Bank's fiduciary role. In addition, the project was consistent with the GoG's development priorities and
was designed based on the lessons learns from the PROTOTIPPEE pilot and the TIPPEE program.
Safeguards issues were taken into consideration. However, there were some minor shortcomings in
identification, preparation, or appraisal, such as the absence of estimation of the project economic benefits
and the failure to identify appropriate mitigation measures for some of the project's risks.
61.    Bank performance during supervision (quality of supervision). The Bank performance during
supervision is rated satisfactory. The source of initial delays on project effectiveness and implementation
were mainly external to the project (see Section 2.2). However, close and regular supervision (average of
two missions per year) by the Bank team helped speed-up implementation to guarantee achievement of
the PDOs. Fiduciary and safeguards supervision missions were conducted at regular intervals to review
compliance with safeguards and ensure that recommendations were properly implemented. Also, the
Bank granted no objection in a timely fashion and facilitating and the smooth execution of work. The
Bank team demonstrated its ability to respond to changing circumstances by restructuring the project
(Section 1.7) and reallocating funds from Component 3 to Component 1. Thus, the Bank managed to
respond adequately to delays in implementation of Component 3 and turned around implementation of the
project that initially faced delays and a challenging political environment. As a result of the Bank team's
proactive approach and a strengthened Project Implementation Unit, by 2009 the project accelerated core
activities so that by project closing (December 2011) targets were achieved and, in some cases, exceeded
62.    Justification of rating for overall Bank performance. The Bank team continuously supported the
client through preparation and implementation and facilitated a focus on results. There was continuity in
team leadership and members, the second Task Team Leader was based in the field and carried out
intermediary technical missions, and field-based fiduciary and safeguards specialists actively contributed
to discussions on overall results. In view of the Bank's performance at entry (satisfactory) and during
supervision (satisfactory), the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) rates the overall performance of
the Bank as satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower performance
63.    Government performance. The GoG performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Despite
initial delays, the Government demonstrated commitment to the project through the appointment of PS
deputy PS (March 9, 2009) to support the PS director. GoG commitment was also demonstrated by hiring
additional key staff to strengthen the TIPPEE capacity to adequately manage the project and address the
volume of tasks required. TIPPEE operating costs were covered by the GoG. However, its performance
was less than satisfactory due to the delays in compliance with required counterpart funding for
implementation of line ministry PIPs due to reasons external to the project, such as political uncertainties
in the first years of the project and lack of inclusion of counterpart funding in the annual budget. For the
same reasons, funding for the Ministerial Committee and the Steering Committee was irregular, limiting
periodic revision of the program, including the appropriation of the momentum generated by the TIPPEE
in the implementation of PDIL.
19


﻿64.    Implementing agency performance. The performance of the PS is rated satisfactory. Despite
problems encountered at the beginning of the project and challenges faced during implementation, the PS
of the TIPPEE program successfully managed to implement the LIDP and demonstrated that it was
possible to deliver tangible and visible results, effectively responding to community needs. The PS
demonstrated flexibility and leadership, and succeeded in adjusting the project to the challenging
environment. As a result, the project was closed on time and its development objectives fully achieved.
The PS has retained qualified, efficient, and skilled staff. In addition, the PS hired part-time specialists to
provide hands-on targeted support to SMEs in order to mitigate the absence of a specialist to guide SMEs
through the process of initiation and implementation of works. Technical, financial and progress reports
were provided on time and good programming was developed early in project implementation. In
addition, the PS has made a significant effort in capacity building of personnel assigned to or associated
with procurement; nearly 612 contracts (works, supplies, services) were awarded through the use of
competitive bidding procedures in connection with the execution of PDIL according to the rules of
procurement. The PS was active in involving beneficiaries (community and municipality) in the definition
and implementation of project activities.
65.    Justification of rating for overall borrower performance. In view of the Government's and
implementation agencies' performance, the ICR rates the overall performance of the Borrower as
moderately satisfactory.
6. Lessons learned
66.    Flexibility of project design and implementation was instrumental in enabling the project to
adapt to changing political conditions during implementation. Flexibility of the project design
allowed for changes during implementation without having to change the PDOs, as demonstrated by the
restructurings of May 2009 and March 2011.
67.    The neighborhood development plans can serve as an efficient tool to facilitate
improvements in service delivery and municipal and urban management, and to accompany
decentralization. The LDIP confirmed findings from other urban development projects in the Africa
Region that this approach and its tools (priority investment program, priority maintenance program, and
municipal support program) can be used to effectively link infrastructure development, maintenance, and
capacity building. The neighborhood development plans are flexible and adaptable to the Gabon context.
It has proved highly effective in focusing activities on results in a context marked by both low access to
basic services and rapidly evolving decentralization.
68.    Demand-driven selection through participatory arrangements for upgrading communities'
infrastructure is most suited to address the sustainability of services in low-income settlements. A
demand-based approach to the selection and financing of community infrastructure needs is appropriate to
ensure transparency in resource allocation and strengthened social cohesion, while at the same time
improving the prospects for sustainable operation of financed facilities. In addition, strong ownership at
all levels and the demand-based approach used by the project to select activities to be financed, including
the use of TIPPEE's streamlined and transparent procurement procedures and faster payment methods of
contractors have proved to be very efficient in delivering quick results on the ground.
69.    Community engagement and sensitization during project implementation proved to be a
successful approach. This approach could be adopted by municipalities as an essential measure to
accompany all future actions defined in their neighborhood management plans comprising maintenance
operations. Engagement and sensitization of communities will allow municipalities to ensure regular
dialogue with populations regarding their role and responsibilities, as well as their contribution to the
improvement of their living conditions and sustainability of community equipment and built
infrastructure. Furthermore, such action will be instrumental in changing the perception of neighborhood
20


﻿residents about national and local governments, help forge new social relations within neighborhoods, and
develop a concept of public interest.
70.    Since the project involved a number of stakeholders, strong ownership at all levels, accompanied
by continuous dialogue among all parties involved, was required to successfully address issues raised and
implement adequate measures.

﻿Annex 3. Economic and financial analysis
1.     This analysis evaluates the economic impact of road and drainage infrastructure investments
made under Component 1: Community-based infrastructures upgrading in low-income settlements.
Specifically, the analysis considers the economic efficiency of (i) investments in the rehabilitation of
about 10.2 kilometers of urban roads, and (ii) investments in the rehabilitation of about 13.7 kilometers of
drainage. The ex-post economic and financial analysis conducted as part of this ICR is not comparable
with the one conducted at appraisal, as the former quantifies the Present Value (PV) and Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of benefits and costs associated with the rehabilitation of roads and
drainage in targeted neighborhoods.
2.     EIRR approach. The ex-post assessment of the project's economic efficiency uses the EIRR
approach, which estimates project economic efficiency by comparing the PV of project costs and benefit
streams with and without the project.
3.     Cost-Benefit analysis. The economic feasibility analysis of the project compares estimated
economic benefits of the project with its economic costs. As the project costs are given, the primary
analytical challenge of this analysis is to most accurately estimate the expected benefits that occurred or
are likely to occur as a result of project implementation.
4.     Benefits considered for the analysis. The main benefits derived from the project are related to the
rehabilitation and expansion of urban roads and drainage, which resulted in about 63,907 additional
people in target areas with access to all-season roads within a 500-meter range (at project closing), as
compared to 1,000 in 2006; and 93,965 people in target areas with improved sanitation conditions (at
project closing), as compared to 500 in 2006. The direct economic benefits considered in this analysis are
as follows:
*   Urban roads rehabilitation: Savings from declining cost of passenger fares and vehicle operation
costs.
*  Drainage rehabilitation: Savings from improving health and reducing health expenses; reduction
of working days and property lost to flooding.
5.     Other benefits. Besides direct economic benefits, there are many other potential benefits that are
not factored into the cost-benefit analysis described here. This is either because estimating such benefits is
difficult because of the unavailability of the data or because it is impossible to quantify the value of these
benefits. Some of these potential benefits include economic development, improvements in health and
welfare of beneficiary populations, improvements in public safety, sustained economic activity, improved
system reliability, among others. Therefore, the estimated benefits of the project described in this analysis
can be considered conservative, and it can reasonably assume that the actual economic benefits will be
much larger.
6.     Assumptions. Some key assumptions have significant effects on the results of the analysis, which
were made conservatively to avoid overestimating project benefits. One such assumption is the time
horizon of the project (i.e. the number of years of benefit streams that should be factored into the
calculations). Since the project implementation costs are given, the longer the assumed time horizon of
the project, the larger the magnitude of incremental benefits will be, and the higher the resulting internal
rate of return. To remain conservative, the project horizon is limited to 15 years, even though the roads
and drainage rehabilitated as a result of the project investments are likely to last significantly longer. This
approach, in turn, limits the assumed benefits of the project for the purposes of cost-benefit analysis, even
though the potential benefits of project investments are also likely to last significantly longer. Also, a 12
percent opportunity cost of capital has been assumed. Specific assumptions associated with investments
in roads and drainage are presented below.

﻿Investments
7.     Total project investment in the rehabilitation of about 10.2 kilometers of urban roads and 13.7
kilometers of drainage amounts to about US$21.7 million. On average, the rehabilitation of one meter of
urban roads and drainage was US$2,526 (Table 11). Assuming that maintaining a paved road for 15 years
costs about $60,000 per kilometer, the associated maintenance cost is about US$0.6 million over the 15-
year period. Similarly, based on the same unitary cost of maintaining a kilometer of drainage, the
associated cost is about US$0.6 million over the same period. Therefore, the total cost of the project is
assumed to be about US$22.9 million.

Benefits
8.     Urban roads rehabilitation and expansion. The project financed the rehabilitation or construction
of about 10.2 kilometers of urban roads in underserved neighborhoods. The selection of roads was made
on the basis of: (i) their strategic importance in terms of access to the target areas (often the only existing
roads); (ii) their lack of practicability in all seasons, particularly during the rainy season; (iii) their
proximity to densely-populated areas; and (iv) the importance of the traffic (in terms of passengers and
goods) that were likely to result from the activities undertaken by the project.
9.     PV of stream of benefits. The PV of the benefits associated with the rehabilitation of urban roads
is estimated at about US$8.8 million. The benefits included in this analysis are related to savings from
declining cost of passenger fares and vehicle operation costs, as follows:
10.    Declining cost of passenger fares. Improving mobility in targeted neighborhoods resulted in
lower transportation costs for users living in the targeted neighborhoods from about US$4 (CFAF 2,000)
to about US$2 (CFAF 1,000) before and after the road rehabilitation was done. The improved mobility is
also reflected in a decline in the price of a taxi ride. Assuming an annual increase in the number of
passenger of about 3 percent, the estimated PV of savings on passenger fares over 15 year period is
estimated at about US$4.2 million.
11.    Declining vehicle operation costs. Investments on the rehabilitation of urban roads contribute to
higher mobility of people and goods. On average, the frequency of vehicles increased more than ninefold,
from about 42 vehicles per day in 2006 to 387 in 2011 (Table 12). Similarly, road rehabilitation has
allowed for all types of vehicles to transit on these paved roads, including 2X4 and 4X4s vehicles, and
trucks. On average, about 2,850 passengers per day were transported in the Cocotiers, Balise, Tsouka, and
Nkomayat neighborhoods, averaging 712 passengers per neighborhood (Table 12). Higher mobility
translates into declining cost of vehicle maintenance. Assuming an annual increase in the traffic flows of
about 5 percent and an annual vehicle operating cost of US$5 per 4-wheel vehicle, the estimated PV of
savings on declining vehicle operating costs over 15 year period is estimated at about $4.6 million.

12.    Other economic benefits. The following economic benefits are not included in this analysis due to
data constraints but are certainly associated with the rehabilitation of urban roads in targeted
neighborhoods:
*  Improving access to major roads. During times of heavy traffic, the newly paved and/or
rehabilitated roads serve as an alternative to high congestion roads, in particular in Cocotiers. The
paved roads in some areas of project intervention provide access to major roads. Thus, during the
hours of high traffic, these roads are relief roads for motorists. In particular, in the Cocotiers
district drivers use the KinguW1 and Belle Vue sections (rehabilitated under the project) to avoid
congestion of the ramp and Rio PK5 road;
*   Savings in travel time;
*  Increasing property value as properties became more accessible;
*  Reduced road rehabilitation costs of repairing roads, structures, and property arising from
improved roads; and
*  Improved public safety.
13.    Drainage rehabilitation and expansion. The project financed the rehabilitation or construction of
about 14 kilometerss of urban drainage in underserved neighborhoods (see Table 11).
14.    PV of stream of benefits. The estimated PV associated with the benefits listed above over 15 year
period is estimated at about US$14.2 million over the project's time horizon. The rehabilitation of
drainage networks in targeted neighborhoods led to a decline in the frequency of flooding by half. Most of
the neighborhoods benefiting from the project were located along riverbeds or near marshes. The
reduction of the probability of flooding is associated with reductions in health expenses, fewer lost
working days, and reductions in lost property, as follows:
15.    Improving health and reducing health expenses. Malaria and diarrheal diseases are endemic in
these underserved settlements. Stagnant water offers ideal conditions for malaria-carrying mosquitoes to
lay eggs. The project contributed to reducing the number of illnesses and deaths originated by malaria and
diarrheal diseases, and reducing by half household expenses related to water-borne diseases, to about
US$10 (CFAF 5,000) per year.
16.    Reduction of working days lost to flooding. The project contributed to a reduction of working
days lost to flooding from about 10 days to 5 days. The value of the saving has been calculated using the
US$3, which is the daily minimum wage.
31


﻿17.    Reduction of property lost to flooding. In the rainy season, a large part of housing, which is built
near riverbeds or marshes, is flooded. At project appraisal, property losses due to flooding amounted to 50
percent of the cost of housing per year (building repairs, cleaning and disinfection, replacement of
equipment, among other costs).
18.    Other economic benefits. The following economic benefits are not included in this analysis due to
data constraints but are certainly associated to the rehabilitation of urban drainage in targeted
neighborhoods
* Reduction of life lost to flooding One of the most important benefits from the rehabilitation and
expansion of the drainage network lies in the reduction of life lost to flooding. In the rainy
season, a significant area of the targeted districts is flooded. The cost in terms of human life is
great. It is estimated that, at project appraisal, an average of three to five people die from flooding
each rainy season in the Avea District alone.
*  Reduction of frequency and cost of rehabilitation of urban roads. Floods caused by water
drainage also cause the deterioration of existing roads. Considering Gabon's heavy rainfall, the
rehabilitation and expansion of the drainage network maximizes the lifespan of existing
infrastructure. According to information collected from public works departments, heavy rainfall
reduces the life span of a road by half when gutters are not included in the road.
Cost-benefit analysis
19.    The ex-post analysis concludes that the EIRR of the urban roads rehabilitation and drainage is 28
percent, based on rather conservative assumptions. This estimate excludes many socioeconomic
dimensions of the project benefits that are difficult to quantify in monetary terms because of their nature
or for which there is not data available. This EIRR exceeds an assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12
percent, cost that is expected for this kind of project and therefore the project's urban roads investments
can be considered sound. The PV of the benefit stream over the project's time horizon (15 years) is about
US$23 million, assuming opportunity cost of capital equal to 12 percent.

﻿Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR
1.     The LIDP development objective is to improve the access of populations in low-income
neighborhoods to sustainable basic services and promote sustainable access of SMEs to civil and
construction works contracts with the public sector. It was implemented by the TIPPEE National
Commission based on the pilot project co-financed by the World Bank and the Gabonese Government
from 2001 to 2004 (PROTOTIPPEE). The LIDP project was implemented in six municipalities:
Libreville, Port-Gentil, Lambar6n6, Mouila, Oyem and Franceville, in particular in eight neighborhoods
of these cities.
2.     The PDOs were implemented through the LIDP and consisted of five components: (i) improving
physical accessibility of some underprivileged urban areas to basic urban services; (ii) capacity
strengthening of  project  beneficiaries (municipalities, line ministries, and communities); (iii)
improvement of the sustainably of construction industry SMEs; (iv) administrative and technical capacity
strengthening related to procurement and management of small contracts of public works; and (v) support
to HIV/AIDS programs.
3.     More specifically, the LIDP objectives were aligned with the purpose of deepening
decentralization in Gabon and, in turn, strengthening municipal and community skills in the construction
and management of infrastructure works. Communities will also be called upon to play a larger role,
particularly in commune-based management of local infrastructure to improve their living conditions.
4.     The project implementation was strongly influenced by several external factors such as: (i) Bank
sanction of the GoG from March 2007 to February 2008; (ii) increase in the cost of works that led to
modification of unit prices (+ 65 % versus those of 2003); (iii) difficulty in supplying materials in certain
project beneficiary cities; and (iv) weak capacities of SMEs in the construction industry.
5.     Despite delays accumulated during the first years of project implementation, the production pace
adopted by the TIPPEE team during the last year of the project enabled the team to make up for initial
project delays.
6.     In addition, in 2009 and 2011, the project was restructured and took account of institutional
changes and difficulties in realizing certain activities. The restructuring allowed reallocation of financial
resources in favor of Component 1, "Community-based infrastructure upgrading in under-integrated
neighborhoods", in order to implement the road works and micro-projects.
7.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) was achieved because 63,907 people and 93,965
people were able to benefit, respectively, from improved access to year-round transport and service
vehicles and from improved sanitary conditions. During a satisfaction survey of the project beneficiaries,
87 percent of the people surveyed deemed that the LIDP project improved their welfare. About 150 SMEs
in the public construction industry were awarded at least one contract. More than 100 SMEs benefited
from a capacity strengthening program.
8.     The project realized 9,973 meters of roads, of which 3,053 meters were earthen and 6,920 meters
were paved, as well as 13,699 meters of storm side-drains and 223 micro-projects in the eight targeted
neighborhoods. Continuous social engineering work led in each of the targeted districts aimed to associate
communities with identification and execution of micro-projects concerning them. This work of social
engagement strongly contributed to changing the population's perception vis-A-vis the State and the
municipality. It enabled building new social relationships within the same district, becoming aware of the
notion of public or common interest in a society that has nevertheless become individualized, and creating
links other than those based on political vote catching with the authorities.

﻿9.     Six municipal technical units have been created and/or strengthened. But only two municipalities
(Libreville and Port-Gentil) of the six have registered technical units in the organizational chart of the
municipal services and endowed it with equipment and permanent staff.
10.    Nevertheless, support provided to municipalities by the LIDP enabled them to strengthen their
capacities for management and follow-up of municipal investments, as well as for procurement for small
public sector construction works adapted to the capacities of local SMEs.
11.    It was planned that sector ministries (Education and Health) would integrate some TIPPEE
projects into their Priority Investment Programs (PIPs), which could then be executed by SMEs in the
BTP sector. But for a variety of reasons (frequent change of interlocutor, lack of funding appropriation,
etc.), no projects were implemented using TIPPEE methodology.
12.    The PS fulfilled its obligations, particularly in the start up and the implementation of the National
Commission activities.
13.    Control of project costs was a constant concern among the TIPPEE and the Government of
Gabon because of external factors weighing on the execution of the works, such as increased material
costs or exceptionally bad weather. The challenge for the LIDP was to keep a high level of service while
trying to keep the costs of works in an acceptable range. Therefore, the levels of development were
revised without modifying the level of service.
14.    Overall, the LIDP enabled greater neighborhood integration and cohesion through the execution
of community micro-projects and paving of roads. For neighborhood residents and municipal authorities,
there is a new awareness that providing safe local transport does not require a high level of service and
development, and may present another mode of living and moving about in towns and neighborhoods.
15.    The approach advocated by TIPPEE and implemented through the LIDP project proved
particularly relevant for Governmental support for the poorest populations. The project provided an
avenue for people to take an active part in improving their living conditions, creating new forms of
solidarity through nearness and countering old stereotypes of urban reliance upon the State.
16.    At project close, there is a question of sustainability of acquired institutional capacity and
expertise in infrastructure maintenance and management, as well as in terms of technical capacities of the
LIDP implementation team, SMEs, and local authorities.
17.    The TIPPEE has acquired expertise in implementing urban planning projects which can be
entrusted to small or very small enterprises in the public works sector. The risk lies in is the potential loss
of acquired skills or the loss of social capital obtained in the mobilization of communities and
municipalities. It is thus important that continuity be assured by World Bank financing within the
framework of a new project.
