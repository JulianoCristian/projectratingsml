"versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7373;P411", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Local Infrastructure\n            Development Project (LDIP) for Gabon were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: flexibility of project design and\n            implementation was instrumental in enabling the project to\n            adapt to changing political conditions during\n            implementation. Flexibility of the project design allowed\n            for changes during implementation without having to change\n            the Project Development Objectives (PDOs), as demonstrated\n            by the restructurings of May 2009 and March 2011. The\n            neighborhood development plans can serve as an efficient\n            tool to facilitate improvements in service delivery and\n            municipal and urban management, and to accompany\n            decentralization. The LIDP confirmed findings from other\n            urban development projects in the Africa Region that this\n            approach and its tools (priority investment program,\n            priority maintenance program, and municipal support program)\n            can be used to effectively link infrastructure development,\n            maintenance, and capacity building. Demand-driven selection\n            through participatory arrangements for upgrading\n            communities' infrastructure is most suited to address\n            the sustainability of services in low-income settlements. A\n            demand-based approach to the selection and financing of\n            community infrastructure needs is appropriate to ensure\n            transparency in resource allocation and strengthened social\n            cohesion, while at the same time improving the prospects for\n            sustainable operation of financed facilities. Community\n            engagement and sensitization during project implementation\n            proved to be a successful approach. This approach could be\n            adopted by municipalities as an essential measure to\n            accompany all future actions defined in their neighborhood\n            management plans comprising maintenance operations. Since\n            the project involved a number of stakeholders, strong\n            ownership at all levels, accompanied by continuous dialogue\n            among all parties involved, was required to successfully\n            address issues raised and implement adequate measures."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
