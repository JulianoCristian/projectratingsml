objectives of the\n            MultiSectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (MSPP) is to\n            support the efforts of the government of Madagascar to\n            promote the multi-sectoral response to the HIV/AIDS crisis\n            and contain the spread of HIV/AIDS in the country. The\n            project has four components. The first finances the\n            devleopment of sector strategies and operational plans for\n            eight key sectors: education; health; information, culture\n            and communication; labor; population; rural development; and\n            security. The component finances workshops, focus group\n            discussions, pilot projects, and provdes an unallocated\n            amount to finance scaling up activities in the sector action\n            plans. The second component creates a mechanism--a Fund--to\n            provide financial incentives to correct market\n            inefficiencies in the demand for, and provision, of\n            prevention activities. Specifically, the Fund finances peer\n            group discussions, counseling, social marketing of condoms\n            and STI kits, operational costs, and strengthening the\n            capacity of implementing entities. The third component\n            monitors project progress, evaluates the impact of project\n            activities, and supports thes studies undertaken in\n            component 1. The fourth component finances the project\n            implementation unit's (UGP) personnel, equipment,\n            operational costs, and periodic technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2001-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
