Madagascar were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Collecting and analyzing good\n            data on the characteristics of the epidemic and on the\n            behaviors of the general population and specific groups is\n            well-worth the cost. The various studies and surveys partly\n            or fully financed by the project had a great impact on\n            strategy discussions later in implementation and in\n            particular on the design of the repeater project. In\n            particular, investment in second-generation surveillance\n            surveys of high-risk groups, starting in 2003, provided\n            badly needed data to reduce uncertainty and shape the\n            response. Achieving a multisectoral response is very\n            challenging and requires attention to the interests,\n            capacities, and incentives of the relevant stakeholders. A\n            focused approach, as adopted by the repeater project, and\n            allowing greater control of resources by sector ministries\n            and other actors, is called for. Similarly, encouraging\n            coordination at the local level, particularly with health\n            and education services, requires consideration of interests\n            and incentives. Generally, an effective balance between a\n            decentralized bottom-up approach and a more centralized\n            top-down strategy is difficult to achieve. The former is\n            necessary to ensure community participation, relevance, and\n            ownership of interventions, while the latter is required for\n            technical quality and coherence with the necessary strategy\n            to address the particular epidemiological situation."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
