Project objectives are: (a) to assist\n            CNB to move prudently toward term transformation; (b) to\n            upgrade CNB's term lending capability at the branch\n            level; and (c) to encourage CNB to diversify its sources of\n            foreign currency. The proposed loan would be used to help\n            cover the foreign exchange requirements of subprojects to be\n            financed by CNB over the next two years."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
