creation, and\n            sustaining growth in industrial exports via linkage between\n            small and large firms.

The proposed loan would be used to help\n            cover the foreign exchange requirements of subprojects to be\n            financed by CNB over the next two years."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
