Main Policy Areas       The objective of the DPL is to support policy changes to (i)
                        improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, and (ii) enhance
                        the efficiency and equity of health spending, in a fiscally
                        sustainable environment. In particular, the proposed reform
                        agenda supported by this DPL includes the following:
                           i.     To improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, the
                                  DPL would support policies that (a) strengthen the
                                  mechanisms to allocate funds and select beneficiaries in
                                  the main social assistance program; (b) introduce
                                  incentives for investing in human capital by providing an
                                  additional benefit linked to school enrollment and
                                  attendance for families with school age children; (c)
                                  initiate the process to create a unified registry of
                                  beneficiaries of social assistance programs; and (d)
                                  change the indexation formula of the disability benefits
                                  program, to control the share of resources allocated to
                                  this program, which is growing disproportionately;
                          ii.     To enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending,
                                  the DPL would support policies to (a) introduce more
                                  predictable fiscal rules to finance health; (b) improve the
                                  methods for contracting with providers and the capacity
                                   to monitor their performance; and (c) grant health
                                   insurance coverage to social assistance beneficiaries.
                           The DPL would also enhance transparency and accountability by
                           supporting policies to improve the administration of social
                           assistance programs and promoting the use of systematic
                           formulas to allocate resources in selected social programs and
                           services.

Key Outcome Indicators          Authorizing environment established for a more

                                Savings realized in disability benefit spending of at least 5
                       percent of its budget (by 2012)

Program Development        The objective of the DPL is to support policy changes to (i)
Objective(s) and           improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, and (ii) enhance
Contribution to CAS        efficiency and equity of health spending, in a fiscally sustainable
                           environment.
                           This operation supports the second pillar of the 2011-2014 CPS:
                           "Broadening and sustaining Albania's social gains by improving
                           access to better quality education and health services, and
                           increasing the effectiveness of its social protection systems", and
                           contributes to the implementation of the "Governance Filter".

Risks and Risk             Macroeconomic: The fragility of Albania's external environment
Mitigation                 remains a risk, which could worsen the macroeconomic situation
                           and possibly lead to an elevated public debt level beyond the
                           legal limit of 60 percent of GDP. The Government is aware of
                           the risks associated with the post-crisis economic prospects in its
                           main trading partners and stands ready to adopt corrective
                           measures to maintain a low fiscal deficit and achieve a sustainable
                           medium term macroeconomic framework.
                           Mitigation: : The Government has outlined a set of fiscal
                           consolidation measures described in the Letter of Development
                           Policy that would be implemented in case the current growth and
                           revenue projections do not materialize. The Bank has intensified
                           ­ and will continue ­ its dialogue on macroeconomic policy,
                           given the absence of a disbursing IMF program.


                           Technical: low capacity in some sectors may hinder the impact of
                           the proposed policy changes.

                                                2
               Mitigation: the current health and social protection investment
               projects and a proposed social assistance project will provide
               implementation support to the policies supported by the DPL.
               The World Bank is also providing technical assistance to lay the
               ground for the implementation of the reforms.


               Social: while most of the policy changes would have a positive
               impact on the poor and vulnerable, some reforms may result in
               losses for specific groups with vested interests.
               Mitigation: the design of the operation accounts for this risk by
               phasing the impact of the reforms. The Government has
               discussed the reform program with these groups in order to
               create broad support.


               Political: The relationship between the opposition and the
               coalition Government remains tense.
               Mitigating Factors: the context of the EU accession agenda with its
               strong political criteria and broad-based support in Albania
               should provide incentives for resolution of political issues. In
               addition the measures included in the DPL have a wide support
               base irrespective of political affiliation.

        PROPOSED SOCIAL SECTOR REFORM DPL LOAN/CREDIT/GRANT
                              TO ALBANIA


                                   II.     INTRODUCTION

1.      The objective of the proposed Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan (DPL) is
to support policy changes to (i) improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, and (ii)
enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending, in a fiscally sustainable
environment. In particular, the proposed reform agenda supported by this DPL includes the
following:
   i.   To improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, the DPL would support policies that
        (a) strengthen the mechanisms to allocate funds and select beneficiaries in the main social
        assistance program; (b) introduce incentives for investing in human capital by providing
        an additional benefit linked to school enrollment and attendance for families with school
        age children; (c) initiate the process to create a unified registry of beneficiaries of social
        assistance programs; and (d) change the indexation formula of the disability benefits
        program, to control the share of resources allocated to this program, which is growing
        disproportionately;
  ii.   To enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending, the DPL would support policies
        to (a) introduce more predictable fiscal rules to finance health; (b) improve the methods
        for contracting with providers and the capacity to monitor their performance; and (c)
        grant health insurance coverage to social assistance beneficiaries.

The DPL would also enhance transparency and accountability by supporting policies to improve
the administration of social assistance programs and promoting the use of systematic formulas to
allocate resources in selected social programs and services.
2.      The proposed operation supports the agenda of the Government that took office in
September 2009, which continues to be focused on growth, poverty reduction and strengthened
safety nets, and governance reforms, as described in its National Strategy for Development and
Integration 2007-2013. The Government has requested World Bank support to improve the
capacity of social assistance programs to better reach the poor and those without access to basic
social services; given the constrained fiscal environment, any short-term gains in access will have
to be accommodated within the current spending envelope, which is still low relative to
comparable international standards. The DPL is therefore supporting the Government to
address this dual challenge. In the short term, the DPL would contribute to maintaining a
sustainable macroeconomic framework, and in parallel it would support structural measures to
improve the functioning of selected social programs and services.
3.     The reforms sought require both policy changes and enhanced implementation capacity,
and therefore a variety of Bank instruments is needed to support this effort. This DPL supports
the adoption of broad policy changes in social programs through revised legislation or other
Government decisions. Once this enabling environment is created, a proposed investment loan
in FY12 would support the actual implementation of the reforms to social assistance programs.
Ongoing investment projects, in both health and social protection, are also supporting the
implementation of the policy changes included in the DPL, while a proposed growth DPL in
FY12 would support the adoption of additional measures to improve the medium term
expenditure framework. Therefore, this DPL is part of a package that combines policy and

                                                  4
institutional reforms with support for enhanced implementation capacity through
investment lending.



                                III.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN ALBANIA
4.      Albania had a very successful record of sustained high growth for the ten years before the
2009 global economic downturn. Annual growth averaged over 6 percent ­ among the highest in
Europe -- with the unemployment rate declining steadily. Industry and construction, which grew
at rates of around 14-15 percent, were key drivers of these trends. Inflation was largely under
control and a flexible exchange rate system proved to be an effective shock absorber.
5.      Albania was one of the few countries in Europe that maintained positive growth rates in
2009, despite the global crisis. This was due to a combination of limited financial exposure to
international markets and an expansionary fiscal policy initiated before the crisis which consisted
of elevated public investments (mainly roads) and a series of salary and pension increases. The
impact of the crisis did however result in lower remittances and a drop in exports, which
eventually led to moderation of growth rates and of fiscal revenues. The industrial sector was hit
the hardest by the crisis; both extracting and processing industries recorded double digit declines
in sales from the start of 2009. The acceleration of public investment during the first three
quarters of 2009 helped the construction sector offset the impact of sharp decline in real estate
demand, while services resisted the crisis better, maintaining positive but declining growth rates
in 2009.
6.      During 2010 the economy showed clear signs of recovery although the uncertain external
economic environment suggests there are still risks ahead. The recovery is seen mainly in service
sector growth that resumed quickly after the short period of slowdown in the second half of
2009, signaling a resumption of domestic demand. Industry has also been recovering as a result
of strong growth in the extracting industry in response to the increase in commodity prices.
However, the remaining sectors, including construction and processing industries, are still
recording negative growth rates.
7.      There was a gradual improvement in the fiscal deficit from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2002
to 3.2 percent in 2006, but this trend has reversed since 2007. The gradual fiscal consolidation
during the first half of the decade resulted from a combination of improved revenue
administration and reduced interest payments, and contributed to a sustained decline in public
debt from 62 to 53 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2007. But an acceleration of public
investments led to a reversal in trends of both the fiscal deficit and public debt. As the global
economic crisis unfolded, the government pursued an expansionary fiscal policy to mitigate the
negative effects of the crisis. As a result, the fiscal deficit jumped to over 7% of GDP in 2009 and
public debt approached 60% of GDP. By mid-2010, as the economic recovery was taking place
and the fiscal room available was exhausted, the Government returned to a consolidation path,
cutting expenditures by 9.5%. This adjustment, although somewhat delayed, was a step in the
right direction for preserving fiscal discipline and avoiding further increases in public debt. The
challenge now is to keep this discipline without creating major distortions in key public services
while pursuing a medium term budget framework that ensures a declining debt path.

8.      High and rising current account deficits since 2007 reflected mainly higher public
investment and electricity imports. The current account deficit (CAD) rose from 5.9 percent of
GDP in 2006, to 15 percent in 2009. This increase was due to higher public investment (largely in
roads) and electricity imports (partly because of dry weather resulting in lower domestic electricity
production in 2007 and 2008), and the impact of higher food and commodity prices. Since 2008,
the slowdown in remittances also contributed to this deterioration. Most of the increase in the
CAD has been financed by a rise in FDI (largely privatization revenues) and two syndicated loans
to finance the Rreshen-Kalimash road project. The current account deficit dropped during 2010
as a result of increasing exports, particularly minerals and electricity. The declining trend of the
CAD is expected to continue in the coming years based on the moderate consumption and
investment trends.
9.     After a period of vigorous growth, bank credit has stabilized at 37 percent of GDP, up
from 10 percent in 2005. The banking sector withstood the crisis reasonably well. A sharp drop
in deposits in 2008 recovered to pre­crisis levels by early 2010. Credit activity has settled to more

                                                                  6
moderate growth rates (of around 7% y-o-y) compared to the elevated pre-crisis rates (35% in
2008). Non-performing loans (NPLs), while exceeding 10 percent of the loan portfolio, are not at
alarming levels. The jump in NPLs was anticipated as credit growth slowed down considerably
and borrowers experienced stress when the crisis unfolded. While this is of concern and led the
Central Bank to strengthen its supervision, both the level of provisions (6 percent of total loan
portfolio) and capital adequacy ratio (16 percent of total assets) remain at a comfortable level
sufficient to absorb further negative shocks to the system. Greek sovereign debt concerns so far
have not affected the Albanian banking sector despite the significant share of Greek banks in
Albania (approximately 25 percent). Nevertheless, the lines of credit from Greek banks that were
interrupted just before the crisis may not be resumed quickly, worsening the credit outlook in
Albania for some time.
10.     The three-year PRGF/EFF arrangement that Albania had with the IMF expired in
January 2009. The government did not sign a new program, preferring to manage the
macroeconomic framework without explicit support from the Fund. An Article IV IMF staff
report of July 2010 concluded that Albania weathered the global financial crisis well, but internal
and external imbalances had reached a point that would require offsetting measures in order to
preserve macroeconomic stability in the future. A Fund mission visiting Albania in October
recognized the positive post-crisis macroeconomic outlook for Albania, while reiterating the need
to bring public debt down from the current level.
                               Recent Budgetary System Improvements in Albania
 The implementation of the Integrated Planning System (IPS) since 2006 has helped improve public resource
 management and budget formulation. The IPS provides a mechanism for aligning the National Strategy for
 Development and Integration (NDSI) with other sectoral strategies and it feeds into the medium term budget
 program (MTBP). Budgets incorporate a program structure drawing on policy goals and objectives derived from the
 strategies. They typically identify outputs and activities to be delivered within the medium-term framework and
 define the costs associated with those outputs and activities. Currently medium term (three-year) budgets are set
 based on the ceilings and fiscal policy settings decided each year at the beginning of the budget process in accordance
 with the Organic Budget Law (OBL) enacted in June 2008. Public investment spending is supposed to be included in
 the IPS and medium term budget framework. In practice investment spending sometimes departs from budget plans
 with major changes during the year. The budget includes all expenditures, including extra-budgetary funds, with
 minimal off-budget expenditures. Extra-budgetary funds constitute less than 10% of total public spending. Albania
 has only two extra budgetary funds, Social Insurance and Health Insurance. There are already some elements of
 fiscal rules written into the 2008 OBL. Currently, there are borrowing limits from the central bank (to strengthen its
 independence) and a public debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP introduced into the Organic Budget Law of 2008.
 The adjustments to correct the path of public debt before the 60 percent ceiling has been reached, usually take place
 during annual MTBP revision process, as has been the case during the last two years. In the meantime, the good
 progress made in establishing the three year rolling budget framework through the Organic Budget Law of 2008, can
 help not only the authorities but also the public and markets to better predict future policies. This is a key
 prerequisite for the successful adoption of a fully fledged fiscal rule. There are ongoing efforts, with the IMF
 assistance, to make it a permanent fundamental of the Medium Term Budget Plan, including requirements to present
 an explanation to parliament together with corrective actions.
 A new treasury system for budget control, monitoring and reporting is being implemented. The Single Treasury
 System planned as the primary source of accounting, budgeting and planning and financial reporting became fully
 operational in April 2010, allowing for the elimination of paper-based authorizations and accounts reconciliation for
 budget execution as of August 2010. In the second half of 2010 the Treasury started direct production and publishing
 timely interim budget execution.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

11.      The current medium term macro-fiscal framework of the authorities assumes a quick
convergence to pre-2009 growth rates mostly driven by the strong pickup of exports and the
expected positive impact on productivity and tourism of the large public investments undertaken
in the last few years. The 2011 budget envisages growth rising from 4.1 percent in 2010 to 5.5
percent in 2011, reaching 6.2 percent by 2013, and remaining at 6 thereafter. Accordingly,
revenues will stabilize at around 27 percent of GDP, and the expenditure share will have a
slightly downward trend. The authorities have decided to continue with a counter-cyclical fiscal
policy in 2011 to speed up the return to pre-crisis growth levels, therefore the deficit will increase
slightly to 3.5 percent of GDP but is planned to decline thereafter to 3 percent. This will allow
public debt to decline from just under 60 percent of GDP in 2011 to 56 percent of GDP in 2014.
The evolution of the key economic indicators under the government's program is displayed in
Table 1. The Debt Sustainability Analysis given in Table 2 gives further details of the evolution of
public debt under the government's program. It indicates that debt declines uniformly going
forward and the framework is sustainable under some of the standard shocks, but it does not
withstand other shocks such as an exchange rate depreciation or a sluggish recovery. Even under
the latter shocks, public debt does not depart significantly from the 60 percent of GDP threshold
and can be brought under control if the fiscal stance is adjusted accordingly.
12.      The external position is expected to remain sustainable and the financial sector sound.
The trade deficit will decline in line with the moderation of large public investments and lower
remittances, which should result in lower imports. The remainder of the declining current
account deficit is expected to be financed through increased exports and foreign direct
investment (including possible privatization revenues and portfolio flows to the banking sector).
The external exposure of the private sector is very limited, which explains the contained impact
of the global financial crisis so far in Albania. International reserves stand at a comfortable level
(1.7 billion or 19 percent of GDP), despite occasional interventions to smooth exchange rate
depreciation. Despite the adverse developments, banks remain sound with a high capital-
adequacy ratio (15.7% of total assets). Credit growth is expected to be moderate compared to the
excessive private borrowing during the pre-crisis period, and this will help banks to improve the
quality of their loan portfolios. The reliance of the banking sector on local depositors' base and
the strong pickup in deposits gives further assurances for the preservation of banking sector
stability. At the same time, the gradual decline of lending to the government (from 33.7% of
GDP in 2010 to 30.9% of GDP in 2014) will ensure there is no crowding-out of private sector
credit. Inflation seems well anchored to stay around the Central Bank's target of 3%.
13.     Considering that the global and European economic outlook remains uncertain, there is a
risk that Albania will have a slower return to pre-crisis growth, with rates perhaps remaining at
around 3.5 percent in 2011 and recovering more gradually to the 5-6 percent range over 2011-
2015, in line with a steady global recovery. The European Commission forecasts EU's GDP to
grow at 1.7% in 2011, and the Autumn 2010 Forecast states that "amid a softening global
environment and the onset of fiscal consolidation, activity is expected to moderate towards the
end of 2010 and in 2011". Western Europe is the main destination of Albania's exports and hosts
the majority of Albanian emigrants. Should Albania's growth, and therefore revenues, be less
than the authorities project, achievement of the public debt target would require additional fiscal
measures. A more moderate post-crisis recovery would lead to fiscal deficits higher than 4
percent of GDP, which means that public debt would remain in the range of 60 percent of GDP.
14.   Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) under slower growth assumptions shows that the debt
to GDP level will decline if the authorities hold to a deficit level at 3 percent of GDP beyond

                                                  8
2011 (see Annex 7). With the lower growth rates, keeping a primary deficit at its historical
average of 1 percent of GDP is insufficient to bring the public debt down. Therefore a primary
surplus would be needed to ensure a declining debt path. This is comparable to a fiscal deficit at
3 percent of GDP, which is in line with the current government medium-term budget plan.
Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP level will stay marginally below 60 percent of GDP in 2011
and will decline to 55.4 percent of GDP by 2015. This is predicted on the basis of restrained
public expenditure, a further gradual increase in revenue collection and a fiscal deficit which
drops from 3.5% of GDP in 2011 to 3% of GDP in 2012 and afterwards. Under these
conditions, total public debt will remain on a stable downward path. Thus both under the
government's medium-term macro-economic framework and in the alternative lower growth,
revenue and expenditure scenario, the macro policies would be consistent with a declining public
debt profile.
15.      However, significant external shocks, similar to the ones of 2009, would push the debt
level above the threshold of 60 percent of GDP. Standard stress tests under the DSA show that
public debt would go beyond 60 percent of GDP under most scenarios, though by only 1-3
percentage points. More extreme shocks, though, elevate the debt level much more rapidly. For
example, if GDP growth were to drop to 3 percentage points in 2011 (as occurred in 2009) and
converge to 6% only by 2014, the debt level would go over 64 percent of GDP by 2015 (Figure
1­ the right graph). An exchange rate shock would have an even larger impact: a 30 percent
depreciation of the Lek in 2011 would bring the debt level close to 65 percent in 2011, and then
lower it to 62 percent by 2015. In such scenarios, the government's commitment to maintain the
budget deficit at 3 percent over the medium-term may not be sufficient to respond to a more
significant shock. Hence, policies that target a more rapid decline of the public debt to GDP level
would give further comfort to the authorities to manage potential adverse economic shocks over
the medium term.
16.     The authorities are well aware of the uncertainty about the future economic outlook and
are prepared to take measures to prevent the fiscal deficit from rising above 3.5 percent of GDP
in 2011 and 3 percent of GDP thereafter, in case revenues are lower than expected revenues. The
budget for 2011 and the medium term budget plan have the scope to accommodate the need for
expenditure cuts on this scale, should they be needed.

 1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are shocks of 2 standard deviations in the first year (3
 standard deviations in the case of interest rate) and 1.5 standard deviations in the second year.
 2/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2011, with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation
 (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).


17.      Possible measures mentioned in the Letter of Development Policy include budgeting of
contingency funds and the moderation of public investment if further adjustment is needed.
First, as in previous years, the 2011 budget contains reserves (unallocated expenditures) of about
0.4% of GDP. In addition, several expenditure items have budget buffers (budgeted amounts
higher than expected needs). For example, interest payments are budgeted at around Lek 3 bln
more than the scheduled amount of interest payments. Other current expenditure items have
buffers of Lek 1.7 bln, bringing the total amount of contingency funds (including unallocated
expenditures) to 0.8% of GDP.
18.      A further buffer is in the form of a mechanism similar to the one applied during 2010,
which would postpone some capital spending until the mid-year budget review when it would be
either initiated or postponed depending on the revenue performance during the first six months.
Capital expenditures are budgeted at 6.2 percent of GDP in 2011, and above 5 percent of GDP
over the medium-term, which gives considerable latitude for fiscal restraint. The authorities stand
ready to implement these adjustments and others with equivalent fiscal saving, if needed to
maintain the deficit below 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and at 3 percent of GDP thereafter to
keep the debt level below 60 percent of GDP.
19.     There is precedent for this form of restraint as evidenced by the mid-year revision of the
2010 budget plan. Until 2008, under the IMF PRGF program, the government agreed to cap
fiscal deficits at 3 percent in order to maintain its commitment to bring the public debt ratio to
below 50 percent by 2012 (also a policy objective in the National Strategy Document). Following
this approach, the authorities were able to reduce the public debt ratio to 53.7 percent in 2007.
Subsequently, particularly after the IMF program expired in January 2009, and after the shocks of
global crisis the policy of debt reduction could not be achieved in practice. Public investment
accelerated, financed by the syndicated loans mentioned in paragraph 8, and together with the
slowdown of growth rates and the depreciation of the Lek, this led to a reversal of the trend in

                                                           11
debt reduction, and at the end of 2009 the public debt ratio reached almost 60 percent of GDP
which is the legal limit under the 2008 Organic Budget Law. Accordingly, the authorities reacted
by cutting spending by Lek 30.4 billion or 2.5 percent of GDP (excluding local government
spending cuts of 8 bln linked to their revenue underperformance). These cuts consisted primarily
of public investments (19.3 bln), operations and maintenance (7 bln), special funds for pension
and salary increases (1.8 bln) and social protection (1 bln). Meanwhile the Government
successfully issued its first ever Eurobond of 300 million with an interest rate of 7.5 percent.
This will be used primarily to refinance the second, expensive, syndicated loan of 200 million
with the remaining part used to meet the financing needs for 2011.
20.     The overall macro-framework is satisfactory. The external position is expected to
remain sustainable and the financial sector is sound. The budget framework is consistent with a
declining public debt profile and should revenues turn out to be less than projected, contingency
funds that the government usually sets aside to preserve fiscal balances will help authorities keep
the public debt to GDP ratio on a declining path. Apart from the steps noted earlier the
Government intends to: (i) set explicit fiscal rules to further strengthen the credibility of the
medium-term fiscal framework, and (ii) accelerate structural reforms directed at improving
competition and the investment climate, the quality of infrastructure and public sector
governance.


POVERTY REDUCTION AND INEQUALITY
21.     Albania's strong economic performance over the last 10 years was accompanied by
positive changes in employment and a strong commendable reduction in poverty rates. The
unemployment rate decreased from approximately 17 percent to 12.8 percent and the poverty
headcount rate decreased to 12.4 percent in 2008 from 25.4 percent in 2002, equivalent to
200,000 people lifted out of poverty during this period (see Figure 2). The reduction in poverty
has been particularly dramatic in rural areas, where the poverty headcount fell from 39.6 percent
in 2002 to 14.6 percent in 2008. Growth accounted for most of the reduction in the poverty rate
during the 2002-2005 period, and contributed 3.7 out of the 6.1 percentage points reduction in
the poverty headcount during 2005-2008. Inequality also decreased during that period, as
individuals in the lower percentiles of the distribution experienced higher income growth rates
than others. The extremely poor population, defined as those with difficulty meeting basic
nutritional needs, decreased from about 5 percent in 2002 to 3.5 percent in 2005 and 1.2 percent
in 2008.
22.      However, Albania has not been immune to the recent global economic and financial
crisis. Most recent growth estimates are between 2 and 3 percent for 2010 and 3 to 4 percent for
2011, while unemployment has stabilized at around 13.8 percent. These trends, coupled with
decreases in remittances and other potential negative income shocks, have likely resulted in a
stagnation of poverty at around 12.5 percent.

23.      Further reductions in poverty face the challenge of high (albeit improving) poverty
incidence in the mountain area and sluggish poverty reduction in urban areas, particularly in the
relatively richer regions of Tirana and the Coast. Between 2002 and 2005 poverty reduction was
led by urban areas, where progress has been minimal since 2005. Rural areas, which made little
progress in the first of those two periods, saw major progress in terms of poverty reduction over
the most recent years. Continued poverty reduction has also been accompanied by significant
reductions of inter-regional inequality. Differences in poverty rates across broadly defined regions
have narrowed substantially compared to what they were in 2005, with the exception of the
Mountain areas. 1 Tirana has the lowest poverty level among regions but there is no further
reduction compared to 2005 (a slight increase to 8.7 percent in 2008 from 8.1 percent in 2005). 2
24.      The economic slowdown in 2010 and continued impact in 2011 is likely to affect
negatively the degree of poverty reduction Albania can achieve. However simulations show that
despite the more adverse growth prospects, poverty would continue declining over the period,
albeit at a reduced rate. 3 An increase in unemployment could also result in increases in poverty.
The unemployment rate has been stable over the 2007-2008 period, and continued stability
despite high growth suggests itself as a reasonable (if somewhat conservative) baseline estimate.
According to World Bank simulations a 2 percent increase in joblessness would increase poverty
by 0.5 percentage points. This would increase the number of poor people by approximately
15,000 people, if not alleviated by social transfers.


1 It is important to bear in mind that these broadly defined regions are not the same as administrative regions ­
commonly referred to as prefectures. Rather, these are areas that have been grouped together because they share
similar geographic contiguity and endowments. There are four such areas defined for survey purposes, while there
are 12 prefectures.
2 The percentage of poor in the Mountain areas has experienced a negligible change from 25.6 percent in 2005 to

26.6 percent in 2008.
3 These estimates are based on pre-crisis GDP growth of 6.1 percent yearly for the period from 2009-2011. Those

have been revised by the IMF (July 2010) to a growth of 2.8 percent for 2009 and at 2.3 percent in 2010, and 3.2
percent in 2011.

MAIN SECTOR ISSUES
25.    The progress achieved over the last decade in poverty reduction went hand in hand with
progress in reforms of the social sectors but there is still an unfinished reform agenda that the
administration intends to continue with renewed emphasis. Specifically,
    In social assistance, there has been progress in setting up a social safety net that can reach the
    poor, but further changes are needed to improve equity, efficiency, transparency and
    effectiveness in the use of resources for poverty reduction
    In health, there has been progress in improving physical and financial access to primary
    health care services, improving the capacity of both the Ministry of Health and the Health
    Insurance Institute (HII), promoting better governance and management in hospitals, and
    improving quality by setting clinical guidelines and training health professionals. However
    the unfinished agenda includes increasing access for vulnerable groups, improving efficiency
    in service provision, and enhancing transparency in the financing of the sector.
26.     Following is a summary of the main sector issues that the DPL is addressing. The
challenges are numbered in corresponding order with the Prior Actions supported by the DPL.


Main Issues in Social Assistance
27.     Challenge I: Existing mechanisms for targeting the Ndihma Ekonomike Social
Assistance Program benefits lack transparency and exclude a large share of the poor.
Ndihma Ekonomike (NE) is the largest cash benefit social assistance program, providing a
monthly cash allowance to approximately 7.3 percent of the population (about 100,000
households) on the basis of a means-test. About one-quarter of total spending on social
assistance in Albania (1.6 percent of GDP) is devoted to NE (0.3 percent of GDP).
28.      Ndihma Ekonomike is financed through central budget allocations to local governments
following a two-step process. First, Parliament approves the allocation of funds to local
governments. Then, local governments determine eligible households and define the level of
benefits based on NE individual assessment criteria. The self-reported income sources are
verified through the relevant institutions (in the case of formal income) and an additional
verification procedure by the social administrators at the claimant's domicile. The eligibility
criteria in the case of urban households consist of a series of "filters" or binary variables that are
applied to exclude households from the benefit. 4 For those households who pass the first
screening, social administrators can still propose to deny eligibility based on "good economic
condition", which is assessed using household characteristics that are not explicitly defined.
Once eligibility is granted, the benefit is calculated based on the demographic characteristics of
the household members and subject to a cap.
29.     The NE program produces respectable outcomes in terms of targeting accuracy (leakages
to the non-poor). The poorest 20% of the beneficiaries receive 56% of all NE transfers, but in
the best performing social assistance programs in the ECA region at least 80 percent of benefits

4 Households that have a member who (i) owns any form of capital, (ii) is economically active (disabled are
exempted), (iii) resides outside of the country, or (iv) is not registered as unemployed looking for work (farmers and
disabled are exempted), (v) refuses to take the land given; (vi) does not collect the benefit within six working days
(except in special cases as defined in the legislation), or (vii) undertakes fraudulent actions to benefit from NE, are
not eligible for NE benefits. Those families with a member receiving a pension (except disability pension) are also
excluded from NE. For rural (farming) families, NE uses a hybrid means test where the household income is
calculated as the difference between the maximum NE benefit and the sum of the income from economic activity,
social protection transfers, and the estimated unverifiable income (imputed income) from land and livestock.

reach the poorest 20 percent of the population. The link to poverty could therefore be
improved, both when it comes to the transfers from the central level to municipalities and when
selecting beneficiaries at the municipality level. Regarding the allocation of funds from the
central level to the municipalities, the Ministry of Labor and Social Assistance (MOLSAE) used
to allocate funds for NE to municipalities taking into account some demographic and socio-
economic characteristics, but did not consider any direct poverty indicators and, consequently,
did not account for regional poverty. 5 In 2010 MOLSAE started using a new methodology that
estimates the number of poor people in a given municipality and takes this estimate into
consideration when determining the allocation of NE resources to the municipality. The relative
importance given to historical allocations and poverty measures are not clearly defined but
depend on the experience and judgment of MOLSAE officials, and therefore the methodology is
not fully transparent and reduces the impact of the geographical targeting of NE using objective
poverty measures. The new approach followed by MOLSAE could be further improved by
systematizing and institutionalizing a clear methodology and allocation formula, using the poverty
map as a guide.
30.     When it comes to selecting beneficiaries at the municipality level, the current mechanism
may end up excluding too many poor households. Figure 3 shows how the system of filters is
applied to select beneficiaries. It shows that a significant number of the poorest individuals are
excluded from the program when the filters are applied in a strict manner. Some filters, like
"having rental income" performs well in that it eliminates only a few very poor individuals, but
other filters, like "receiving remittances" or "receiving an old age pension" exclude a large
number of the very poor individuals and therefore are not good filters. For example, a family
could be quite poor, but still have a job (albeit low paying or seasonal) or have a family member
abroad (but with low paying job), and nonetheless still be excluded from the program due to
application of any one of these ad hoc filters. Based on LSMS 2008 data, World Bank calculations
show that applying the filters in a strict manner may end up excluding approximately 60 percent
of households in the poorest 10 percent of the population (see Figure 3). A mechanism that
selects households on a weighted combination of criteria rather than strict yes/no filters would
provide a better way to identify the poor.




5 Reports show that the regional poverty (as measured from LSMS and Census of 2001) is not always consistent with
the allocation of block grants to local governments. Consequently, local government units that have a high number
of poor households do not receive an adequate level of block grants (Social Protection Sector Strategy, 2007).

31.       The selection process not only excludes a large share of the poor, but could be more
transparent. Eligibility at the household level is determined at the local level, based on centrally-
designed criteria and a final decision by local councils. While involvement of local councils in the
eligibility decision can be viewed as optimizing "local-level" community information for special
circumstances, this discretionary aspect is not applied in a transparent manner in relation to other
eligibility criteria.
32.      Initial simulations show that a closer link to poverty in the allocation of grants from
central level to municipalities could increase the share of NE benefits going to the poor by
almost 8 percentage points. 6 As for eligibility criteria at the household level, initial simulations
show that even slight changes in the "filters" applied to households to determine if they are
eligible could have a large impact on improving targeting to the poor. For example, replacing the
current system of determining eligibility with a scoring formula--which includes objectively
weighted variables correlated with poverty--could result in (i) an 11 percentage points increase in
the coverage of the poorest decile, and (ii) a 12 percentage point increase in the share of NE
benefits going to the poorest decile. 7
33.     Challenge II: Spending on social assistance has been shifting away from poverty
reduction programs. Total spending on social assistance, at 1.62 percent of GDP in 2008, is
similar to the ECA average of 1.65 percent but lower than the OECD average social assistance
spending of 2.5 percent of GDP. Two main social assistance schemes account for the majority
of this spending: the Ndihma Ekonomike (NE) program, which is the main poverty targeted social
assistance benefit, and the disability assistance benefit, a categorical program that is granted
irrespective of socioeconomic status.


6 This simulation is based on a poverty map that was developed using information from the 2008 LSMS and the
2001 Census. It is expected that poverty can be better traced once the new Census takes place in 2011 and that
information is incorporated into the poverty map.
7 This simulation was prepared under a neutral budget scenario.


                                                         16
34.      The relative balance in spending on these two programs has shifted significantly over
time. Outlays on disability benefits increased from 0.4% of GDP in 2000 to 0.9% of GDP in
2008, arising both from the generous indexation of the benefit level and an increase in the
number of certified beneficiaries. The increase in benefit levels outpaced the inflation rate by a
large margin. The adjustment in disability benefits is linked at least to minimum wages, and over
the last ten years, the average benefit level has increased in an ad-hoc manner, and has been at
least twice as high as the inflation rate. The generous indexation rule for the non-contributory
disability program contributes to the increase in spending on this program shifting spending away
from the main poverty focused program. In turn, the number of beneficiaries has more than
doubled, as shown in Figure 6. As currently structured, disability benefits provide an entitlement
irrespective of the degree of disability or the socioeconomic status of the beneficiary. In addition
the review process could be improved in order to increase the transparency of the program and
apply uniform criteria irrespective of the type of disability (currently the legislation is scattered). 8

35.     Challenge III: The NE Social Assistance Program is currently "passive" ­ lacking
proactive links to human capital or employment services that could potentially enhance
its effectiveness for reducing poverty in the long-run. Social assistance benefits in Albania
currently lack a "proactive" mechanism to "get beyond cash handouts" and link beneficiaries to
human capital or activation incentives and services. Reliance on passive assistance has raised
concerns about dependency on transfer incomes, in addition to concerns about the potential
disincentive effects of specific design features of the program (e.g., one-off filters that discourage
economic activity or employment). Currently, employment and social assistance programs are
completely disconnected, except for the requirement of social assistance applicants to register as
unemployed before application (which can create disincentives for work).



                                                               18
36.    Many middle-income and EU countries have adopted mechanisms to enhance the
"proactivity" of social benefits to get beyond passive cash handouts. Some options include:
    Linking child beneficiaries to human capital. Many countries (low-income, middle-
    income and even high-income OECD countries) link receipt of cash transfer assistance to
    school enrollment and attendance to improve the long-run impacts for strengthening human
    capital and reducing poverty. These mechanisms are generally referred to as "conditional
    cash transfers." Such conditioning of benefits could make sense in Albania's context, where,
    contrary to most neighboring countries, enrolment in basic education is not universal. Net
    enrollment is about 90% for basic education and only 60% overall for secondary education,
    while the figure is significantly lower among vulnerable groups. According to administrative
    data, net enrollment in basic education is only 52% among children in families benefitting
    from NE cash assistance. The NE program could be enhanced to incorporate incentives for
    beneficiary families to enroll school-aged children in school and ensure daily attendance, thus
    increasing the "proactivity" of the benefits beyond simple cash handouts.
    Activation links. Many EU and other OECD countries have been enhancing the
    "proactivity" of social benefits programs by linking beneficiaries to incentives, social contracts,
    and services to promote employability and employment opportunities. These efforts could
    include the introduction of work requirements for able-bodied adults, training, education, and
    job search.
37.      Challenge IV: The administration of the Ndihma Ekonomike Social Assistance
Program needs to be strengthened. Benefits administration of NE is hampered by weak
capacity, lack of information systems, and limited oversight and controls. Albania currently lacks
an automated national registry of applicants and beneficiaries and benefit management is largely
paper-based at the local level. This lack of an effective management information system leads to
(a) inefficiencies in applying for and awarding benefits (with high transactions costs);
(b) weaknesses in oversight and controls of fraud and errors; and (c) ineffective monitoring and
evaluation of social policy.
38.      The lack of automated databases and a national registry is a serious constraint. The main
difficulties reported relate to (i) the limited skills of the statistical staff at the regional and local
level (many mistakes are reported in aggregating the tables); (ii) the paper-based data systems at
the regional offices; (iii) the inability of current software and templates from the central SSS
office to link the information across the indicators, and (iv) delays in transferring the information
to the central SSS statistical office. As a result, monitoring is limited to evidencing the payments
and number of beneficiaries. A large amount of information is collected at the local level, but is
not used properly for developing indicators and observing trends over time at the household
level.
39.     Applying the current means test for NE without electronic databases and sufficient
means to document incomes has resulted in a complex system. The transaction costs for
applicants are inflated by numerous documentation requirements, and administrators are slowed
down by verification and cross-check requirements with multiple agencies at different levels of
public administration. Conducting simultaneous cross checks with other programs is
burdensome on all institutions involved. The lack of an automated database also results in weak
oversight and control mechanisms. The primary duty of inspectors is verification of
documentary evidence (beneficiary files); cross-checks of information (exchange of letters with
other public offices like tax, cadastre, car registry, pensions, unemployment); registry checks to
make sure that beneficiary names match with those approved for eligibility; and field visits to


                                                   19
check on the living conditions of beneficiaries. Without the benefit of automated databases,
cross-checks are done on paper.


Main Issues in Health
40.      Challenge V: Access to health care services by poor households is not universal,
and financial constraints limit utilization among the poor. Albania spends about 6 percent
on health care, in line with the average for lower middle income countries, but public sector
contribution is relatively low, well below the average in the SEE countries. As a result of low
public sector spending, out-of-pocket expenditures at the point of service account for about 60
percent of sectoral funding. The high level of direct household spending indicates that the
existing health financing system offers Albania's population limited protection against
catastrophic illness or injury and allows for little redistribution of resources to protect the most
vulnerable groups from health shocks. According to World Bank estimates, approximately 18
percent of households in the lowest consumption quintile had to delay health care when sick, and
about 46 percent of households in the first quintile of consumption state that they have found it
"difficult or very difficult" to afford expenses associated to health care services. The economic
barrier to access can be worsened by lack of health insurance coverage; approximately 30 percent
of households in the lowest consumption quintile do not have any form of health insurance.
41.     Some out of pocket payments can be large. Approximately 26 percent of households
make out of pocket payments for health care that represent 10 percent or more of the total
household expenditure. An analysis of 2005 data showed that health expenditures have a strong
impact on poverty, with the poverty incidence increasing from 25 to 34 percent if out-of-pocket
health expenditure is subtracted from household income. Improving economic access to health
care is one of the main priorities of households, as Table 3 shows (together with improving
attention from health providers). Households were also asked about the priorities where
additional budget should be spent. About 35 percent said that it should be spent on medicine
and vaccine supply while 31 percent on providing free care for the poor (and 15 percent
suggested to provide additional training to doctors and nurses).

42.     Informal payments are still a prevalent problem in Albania. The information from the
LSMS suggests that the share of patients making informal payments has been decreasing over
time. At the same time, informal payments seem to have increased as a proportion of out of
pocket spending. According to 2008 data, gifts to health providers represented 28 percent of out
of pocket payments for households in the lowest consumption quintile, compared to 17 percent
in 2005.
                                                            20
43.     Challenge VI: Funding for Health Insurance is not based on systematic criteria.
Currently, about 75 percent of public sector spending for health comes from general revenues,
while only 25 percent comes from payroll tax contributions to the HII. Contributions to the
program are far from universal, as only 39 percent of households participate in what is by law a
mandatory health insurance scheme, suggesting large contribution evasion. The Government has
in the past proposed that payroll tax contribution rates for HII be raised significantly--from the
current 3.4 percent or payroll--in an attempt to increase the amount of funding available under
health insurance. The Bank has advised against this proposal, for several reasons:
a) Many countries with a payroll tax based social health insurance system have created generous
   categories of insurance beneficiaries that are exempted from making their own contributions,
   aiming for nominal contributions on their behalf from alternative sources (e.g., pension funds
   for pensioners, unemployment funds for the unemployed, government budgets). The system
   could create incentives for a significant share of the population to seek contribution
   exemptions by, for example, registering as unemployed. In combination with broad based
   contribution evasion by the active labor force, this has resulted in systems in which a minority
   of beneficiaries pays for health services consumed by all insurance beneficiaries. This has
   resulted in the need to keep payroll tax contribution rates high to allow for a minority of
   contributors to cover costs of the majority of the beneficiaries. It has also imposed an
   unnecessary burden on other agencies (e.g. Employment Agencies) that detract them from
   performing their work as they spend a significant portion of their time on providing
   exemption status to individuals.
b) Payroll tax contributions for social insurance in Albania have decreased significantly, from
   41.9 percent of payroll to 28 percent, but, given the large percentage of informal workers, an
   increase in the rate could lead to further informalization, which would result in a further
   decline in insurance coverage. High payroll tax contributions raise the cost of labor, thereby
   hurting the competitiveness of Albanian labor.
c) The benefits of a single purchaser system could also be realized without altering the current
   sources of public funds if budget funds for health are pooled and channeled through the HII
   as a health care demand rather than as a supply subsidy.
44.     Challenge VII: The Health Insurance Institute needs to increase its efficiency as
purchaser of health care services. The HII could purchase health services in a more efficient
way, taking advantage of being the single largest purchaser of health services in Albania.
Specifically: (i) the fragmentation in public sector financing for health limits the benefits of a
single purchaser of health services, and (ii) the current provider payment systems fail to create
incentives to improve accountability for performance.
45.      Regarding fragmentation, until very recently, the public purchasing system for health
services was fragmented, as the Ministry of Health was in charge of financing hospitals while the
HII financed the rest of health service provision in the public sector. Primary care general
practitioners were paid by the HII on a modified capitation basis (base salary plus capitation
supplement depending on location and registered patients), while hospitals, with the exception of
Durres Hospital, were financed through the MOH with an input-based line item budget. This
limits the advantage of a single purchaser of health services, in that providers could shift patients
depending on which purchaser pays the most for a given case.
46.     Regarding provider payments and incentives, the HII purchases hospital services based
on historical budgets rather than actual use of services (an indication of actual demand), which
perpetuates an inequitable resource allocation and gives providers no incentives to improve
efficiency or quality of care. Hospital managers have limited expenditure management and

                                                 21
managerial autonomy. They can hire and dismiss staff within the MOH-set norms with
ministerial approval and can select vendors for supplies other than pharmaceuticals. However,
they cannot reallocate funds across budget categories and adjust the overall staffing levels
according to hospital needs. Input-based financing gives providers no incentive to improve
performance, nor does it lead to resource allocation based on outputs or local needs.


  IV.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

47.     In 2007, Albania approved the National Strategy for Development and Integration
(NSDI) for 2007-2013, developed via a participatory process involving stakeholders throughout
the country. One of the key objectives of the NSDI is to achieve rapid, balanced, and sustainable
economic, human and social development. The NSDI has established target growth rates of 6-7
percent and aims for a reduction of poverty headcount to below 10 percent by 2013. In the
social services, the Government aims to increase secondary education enrolment to 76 percent,
introduce a basic package of covered health benefits, strengthen the coverage of social assistance
programs, and reform the public pension system.
48.     The NSDI also commits Albania to achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), which were adapted to better reflect Albania's level of development and its aspirations
to become an EU member. The revision of MDGs took place in 2008 and included a revision of
the wording of some MDGs to reflect more ambitious goals, and a revision of indicators and
targets (e.g. within the MDG 1 of eradicating extreme poverty, a new target was introduced:
"Improve income distribution in order that the Albanian distribution model get closer to the EU
model between 2008 and 2015", to reflect EU social inclusion policy).
49.      The NSDI includes the strengthening of social assistance programs and improving social
sector outcomes as two key Government priorities. As part of the NSDI process the
Government has developed a Social Inclusion Strategy, approved on January 2008 by the Council
of Ministers. It focuses on poverty and social exclusion risks that remain even after the onset of
economic growth. The Social Inclusion Strategy (SIS) is modeled after the National Action Plan
for Social Inclusion of European Union member states and one of its strategic priorities is to
facilitate access to services (social care, education, health, justice, housing, transport,
telecommunications, water and sanitation).
50.     The SIS highlights the following policy challenges in improving social sector outcomes
and services: (i) modernizing social protection systems to ensure that social assistance schemes
are targeted to needy households and individuals; (ii) improving access to services for vulnerable
groups, including social care, health services, and water and sanitation; and (iii) overcoming
participation barriers for vulnerable groups.



           V.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS
51.     This operation supports the second pillar of the 2011-2014 CPS: "Broadening and
sustaining Albania's social gains by improving access to better quality education and health
services, and increasing the effectiveness of its social protection systems". After several CAS
cycles of focusing support on Albania's transition to a market economy and closing the

                                               22
infrastructure gap in an effort to support economic growth, the new CPS includes increased
engagement in the social sectors. While the DPL would support the policy changes needed to
create a better functioning social safety net and a more efficient health sector, the accompanying
investment operations on social protection and health will consolidate these policy changes and
support their implementation. The CPS includes (i) reducing poverty through more efficient
social protection services, and (ii) improving access to quality health care and efficiency of public
spending on health care as Country Development Goals.
52.     The DPL is also consistent with the Governance Filter included in the CPS. The filter
includes governance requirements for new projects related to: (i) public expenditure policy; (ii)
administration and institutional reforms; (iii) use, or partial use of some government fiduciary
systems; (iv) public disclosure and civil society engagement. The DPL would not only increase
transparency and accountability in health and social assistance by promoting the used a systematic
rule to allocate resources, but will do so within the existing budget envelopes for the respective
programs and sectors.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
53.     The Bank maintains close working contacts with the IMF and other donors assisting the
Government for the purposes of harmonizing policy recommendations, seeking synergies among
the respective operations, and avoiding overlaps. Despite the absence of an IMF program, the
proposed DPL has been prepared in coordination with the IMF country team to ensure the
consistency of the macroeconomic framework. In a number of areas where the mandates of the
two institutions overlap, such as public finance, and public financial management, the work is
being closely coordinated to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. The
World Bank team remains in close coordination with the IMF resulting in largely shared views of
the economic situation in the country.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
54.      The reform of Albania's social programs requires both policy and implementation
support, and therefore a combination of development policy and investment lending would be
appropriate. A number of alternatives were explored to best support the reform program in
selected social programs in Albania, and the main competing option to the proposed
combination of policy lending and investment lending support was a programmatic DPL series.
This option would have supported policy implementation during its first phase and the
development of secondary legislation in successive phases. However, since a programmatic series
would have ruled out an accompanying investment operation, given the limited lending envelope
for Albania, this alternative would not have allowed for the concomitant technical assistance and
investments needed to build the institutional capacity to actually implement the reforms. For that
reason a one phase DPL followed by an investment loan is deemed the appropriate combination
of instruments. The DPL is the right instrument to support the policy changes needed to
improve the effectiveness of social assistance programs, and to lend support to introduce changes
in the legislation affecting health financing and service delivery. Once the enabling environment
is created, ongoing and new investment operations would provide on-the-ground support for the
implementation of those policies.
55.     The proposed Social Assistance Investment Project, scheduled for FY12, would support
the development and implementation of improved targeting mechanisms for social assistance
programs (both Ndihma Ekonomike and Disability Benefits programs), improvements in
benefits administration for social assistance programs (management information systems,

                                                 23
payments processes, monitoring systems, oversight and controls to reduce fraud and errors, and
so forth), and possible extensions to link beneficiaries to human capital and/or activation
incentives. The proposed SIL would complement the DPL well as it would support the actual
implementation of many of the policy changes included as prior actions in this DPL.
56.       Current operations also lend support to the DPL. One of the development objectives of
the ongoing Albania Social Services Delivery Project (P055383; closing date 09/30/2012) is "to
improve standards of living of poor and vulnerable population groups in Albania by: (i)
increasing their access to effective social care services, and (ii) assisting the government to
develop effective social care policy and improve its capacity for delivery and monitoring of social
care services". The project was recently restructured to expand capacity building activities at the
Social Insurance Institute (SII), specifically, to develop the SII archive of past work histories.
This complements the DPL as pension benefits and work histories of individuals in Albania are a
valuable source of information used to assess needs and therefore better inform household
eligibility of social assistance programs.
57.      The ongoing Health Systems Modernization Project (HSMP; P082814; closing date
03/31/2012) aims at (i) improving the capacity of the MOH and HII to formulate and
implement health policies and reforms in provider payments, monitoring and quality assurance,
(ii) improving both the access to, and quality of, primary health care services, with an emphasis
on those in poor and under-serviced areas, and (iii) improving governance and management in
the hospital sector. The HSMP is supporting the implementation of an information system for
the Health Insurance Institute, training of HII managers and employees on contracting and
monitoring performance, training of health facility managers, and quality improving activities like
introduction of clinical protocols, licensing and accreditation, and training of providers. These
activities complement well the prior actions included in the DPL that support the adoption of
policy changes in the contracting of hospitals according to performance criteria and the
monitoring of providers.
58.     The gap between the current DPL and the proposed new Social Assistance Investment
Project would be bridged by the support from the abovementioned projects, the TA associated
with the preparation of the new loan, and the resources from a PSIA Trust Fund on Albania. 9
Some of the implementation issues have already been addressed through technical assistance
embedded in the preparation of the DPL, like the updating of a poverty map to allocate social
assistance resources to municipalities based on some indicator of poverty, and the preliminary
design of a scoring formula to allocate social assistance resources to households within a given
municipality.    The legislations supporting the policy changes also include a phased
implementation in order to allow for the technical work to be completed.

LESSONS LEARNED
59.      The following main lessons from earlier work in Albania have informed the preparation
of this operation:
a) In the case of Albania, many reforms in the past have succeeded in introducing policy
   changes but lagged behind in implementation. Therefore it is essential to provide both policy
   and implementation support. Implementation can be, in many cases, the main obstacle to
9
  The main objective is to work with the Government of Albania to improve the effectiveness of safety nets,
particularly disability benefits, by building understanding of (a)Who benefits from disability allowances/pensions in
Albania; (b)Where the disabled fall on a nationally representative welfare distribution; (c)how the proposed disability
reforms may affect them (d)What political constituencies exist that have affected current legislation on disability
reforms; and (e)The potential influences of these political constituencies on the success of future reform efforts.

                                                         24
       overcome. And it usually requires more time than the needed to create the enabling
       environment. For that reason the policies supported by this DPL are complemented with
       investment projects.
b) It is useful to accompany the reforms with technical assistance, in order to refine the details
   of some policy changes and to plan the future changes needed for full implementation of the
   reforms. The policy changes included in the DPL are therefore supported in parallel with
   technical assistance through the existing investment operations and a PHRD grant for health.
c) The portfolio in Albania is highly fragmented and has a number of implementation issues.
   The lesson from this is the need to simplify new operations as much as possible. This is
   therefore a focused operation, it covers only two sectors (health and social assistance), and it
   has a very streamlined format. Rather than adding more sectors to this DPL, a future series
   starting in FY12 will cover other sectors.
d) As with every DPL, ownership by the Government is a crucial element for success. Such
   ownership is visible in both the Ministry of Health and Labor and Social Assistance. The
   World Bank team supported the building of capacity at the Ministry of Labor to contribute to
   the development of the social assistance reforms. This included the training of key staff in
   the ministry on new targeting instruments and participation of officials in international
   workshops and conferences on poverty measuring, targeting mechanisms, and impact
   evaluation techniques.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
60.     The preparation of the DPL has been guided by an analytical agenda supported by both
the World Bank and the Government. In the case of health, the World Bank produced a Health
Sector Note in 2006 that has been the basis for dialogue in the sector over the last three years.
The Note has also informed the contents of the ongoing Health Systems Modernization Project.
This Project financed a number of Technical Reports that have updated specific sector
knowledge (e.g. on performance based payments, contracting to providers, health financing), and
a World Bank financed AAA on governance in health and education provided some insights on
policy changes that could improve accountability and transparency in health. Regarding social
assistance, the World Bank provided support via an extensive programmatic multi-year technical
assistance program in social protection that included workshops, diagnostic assessments and
reports (on disability benefits, the Ndihma Ekonomike Program, and benefits administration),
and a subsequent policy note. Training was provided on the geographic allocation of resources
to the municipalities based on a poverty map. This contributed to the ownership of the reform
program and also influenced the ongoing reform process. The ongoing poverty monitoring work
has also informed the design of the DPL, and as part of this work the World Bank produced new
analytical work assessing the impact of changes in targeting mechanisms for the social assistance
programs. A sub-regional report on social assistance provided valuable information to
benchmark the NE program relative to other programs in the region and identify the main
bottlenecks in targeting and administration, and a series of background reports provided insights
into the disability benefits program. 10




10   These reports are on file and available upon request.

                                                             25
                VI.    THE PROPOSED SOCIAL SECTOR REFORM DPL

61.      The rationale for this operation stems from the need to make safety nets and selected
social programs and services more effective in reaching the poor while maintaining a prudent
fiscal stance. Both are required in light of the potential impact of the global economic crisis and
the recent worsening of the economic prospects in some of Albania's neighbouring countries.


DPL Objective
The objective of the proposed Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan (DPL) is to
support policy changes to (i) improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, and (ii)
enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending, in a fiscally sustainable
environment. In particular, the proposed reform agenda supported by this DPL includes the
following:
   i.   To improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, the DPL would support policies that
        (a) strengthen the mechanisms to allocate funds and select beneficiaries in the main social
        assistance program; (b) introduce incentives for investing in human capital by providing
        an additional benefit linked to school enrollment and attendance for families with school
        age children; (c) initiate the process to create a unified registry of beneficiaries of social
        assistance programs; and (d) change the indexation formula of the disability benefits
        program, to control the share of resources allocated to this program, which is growing
        disproportionately;
  ii.   To enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending, the DPL would support policies
        to (a) introduce more predictable fiscal rules to finance health; (b) improve the methods
        for contracting with providers and the capacity to monitor their performance; and (c)
        grant health insurance coverage to social assistance beneficiaries.

The DPL would also enhance transparency and accountability by supporting policies to improve
the administration of social assistance programs and promoting the use of systematic formulas to
allocate resources in selected social programs and services.


OPERATION DESCRIPTION
62.      The operation is proposed as a standalone single-tranche Development Policy Loan of
an amount of Euro 18.1 million (US$25 million equivalent), complemented by a follow up social
assistance investment operation in FY12. The DPL is the appropriate instrument to support
one-time policy changes to social assistance and health insurance legislation within the context of
the Government's actions to restore macroeconomic stability. The new social assistance
investment project, envisioned in the CPS for FY12, and the two ongoing investment projects,
one in social protection and one in health, would complement the policy changes in the social
assistance programs supported by the DPL by supporting actual implementation.

POLICY AREAS
63.    The DPL supports selected reforms in social assistance programs and the health sector.
Other social services and programs--specifically education and pensions--are supported
through alternative instruments. An Education Excellence and Equity project (P078933; closing
date 12/31/2011) supports governance reforms in basic education, and investments to improve

                                                 26
quality of education and reduce overcrowding in schools. The Social Services Delivery Project
(P055383; closing date 09/30/2012) is supporting investments to improve the managerial
capacity and information systems of the Social Insurance Institute. The choice of health as an
area of support in this DPL stems from the renewed emphasis in the sector and the need to
introduce policy changes through revised legislation that the Government has been working on
with technical support from the World Bank. Social assistance was also chosen as the focus of
this DPL due to the request from the Government, its recognition of the importance of
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of social safety net programs to reduce poverty, and
the assessment that policy changes were needed to improve the functioning of the program,
absent the prospects for additional funding in the near future due to fiscal constraints. The Prior
Actions are listed in Box 1.

                   Box 1 Prior Actions for Albania Social Sector Reform DPL


1. The Government has revised the NE Program resource allocation system to
   municipalities by adding a poverty criterion, and by defining household eligibility
   criteria based on a unified scoring formula with weights across variables associated
   with economic and poverty status.
2. The Government has changed the indexation formula for the disability benefits
   program, de-linking calculation of increases in benefits from wage indexation and
   linking increases to inflation instead.
3. The Government has introduced a bonus for school-age children's attendance in
   compulsory education for households receiving NE.
4. The Government has amended legislation to mandate the creation of an automated
   national registry for applicants and beneficiaries of social assistance programs.
5. The Government has authorized HII to extend coverage of health insurance to NE
   program beneficiaries and has established a package of benefits, thereby enabling the
   cost of providing health services to be estimated.
6. The Government has defined a systematic rule to transfer resources to the HII, using
   cost of services as a criterion for the transfers, and maintained the payroll
   contribution at the current level.
7. The Government has unified the publicly funded purchasing of health services under
   one agency, by transferring financing of hospitals to HII. Additionally the HII has
   signed performance contracts with thirty nine hospitals.




                                                27
                            Box 2 Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The DPL supports the implementation of the Government's strategies in health and social assistance. It fully
reflects the Government's social sectors agenda as stated in the National Strategy Development and Integration
2007-2013. The Bank and the Government worked together in defining concrete actions consistent with the specific
sector strategies

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The Bank and the Government have agreed on a set of policy actions included in a streamlined policy matrix to
measure progress in implementing the program. The development partners' community in Albania is not focused on
health or social assistance (except for a few specific partners like UNICEF and UNDP where coordination has taken
place at the technical level) and therefore no coordination is required

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy changes supported by the DPL also require significant implementation capacity, which in the case of
Albania is at an incipient stage. Therefore the modalities of Bank support have been adapted to combine policy
reform support through the DPL with implementation support through a series of investment projects. Additional
technical assistance is being provided through the preparation of the DPL.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The policy matrix is very streamlined. It contains only 9 Prior Actions and no benchmarks. The DPL is a
standalone operation that supports policies that would create an enabling environment for reforming selected social
programs. These critical actions would require implementation support immediately after, which is to be achieved
through two ongoing and one new specific investment operations

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
Many of the Prior Actions supported by the DPL would promote a more transparent and accountable use of
resources in the social sectors. The reform program supported by the DPL emphasizes the need for evidence based
policy making, and has succeeded in developing a cross-cutting agenda in this area with the Government.



Challenge I: Existing mechanisms for targeting the Ndihma Ekonomike Social
Assistance Program benefits lack transparency and exclude a large share of the poor

DPL Support
64.      The DPL would support measures to improve targeting at the central and municipal
levels. The current legislation governing the NE program would be revised to (i) include poverty
as a criterion to determine allocations of grants for the NE program from the Central to the
Municipal levels, and (ii) specify that a means-testing formula would be adopted to determine
which households are eligible to receive NE benefits within each municipality. The shift in the
definition of eligible criteria would eliminate the use of "yes-no" binary filters and non-
transparent discretionary criteria. Instead, program eligibility criteria could be based on a single
continuous scoring formula that incorporates objective weights and variables that are empirically
associated with poverty status. Such criteria could be adapted for urban (non-farming
households) and rural (farming households) areas, taking into account the different structural
situations of these contexts. This revised formula could incorporate: (a) easily observed and
verified incomes (formal incomes); (b) other proxy variables (such as the imputed value of assets
and possession of consumer durable goods) that represent observable characteristics with
empirical correlation with poverty status and/or help predict "hard-to-measure" incomes.
Special circumstances identified by local councils or social administrators ("discretionary


                                                        28
considerations") could also be considered, as long as these are incorporated into the single
scoring formula with transparent weights relative to other eligibility criteria.
65.      These reforms would improve both the equity of NE benefit distribution (by reducing
errors of exclusion and inclusion) as well as transparency of the system (by basing geographic
allocations and eligibility decisions on standardized and objective poverty-related criteria).



                                          Prior Action 1
      The Government has revised the NE Program resource allocation system to
      municipalities by adding a poverty criterion, and by defining household eligibility
      criteria based on a unified scoring formula with weights across variables associated
      with economic and poverty status


Medium term support after DPL
66.      The DPL would be followed by a proposed Social Assistance Investment loan to provide
implementation support for some of the policy changes. Among other things, the proposed
investment project could support the: (i) revision of poverty estimates by municipality after the
2011 Census Data become available and preparation of a new poverty map; (ii) design of an
allocation formula from MOLSAE to municipalities using poverty indicators; (iii) development of
new means testing formula at the household level (either hybrid or proxy means testing); and (iv)
pilot testing of the revised formula.

Challenge II: Spending on social assistance has been shifting away from poverty
reduction programs

DPL Support
67.     Addressing this shift requires changes to limit both the increases in the quantity of
beneficiaries as well as the average benefit increase. As a first step the DPL would support a
change in the indexation rules, moving from the current indexation (at least minimum wage
increase) to an indexation rule that would adjust benefits based on inflation. This would control
spending while maintaining the living standards of the disability beneficiaries.


                                          Prior Action 2
       The Government has changed the indexation formula for the disability benefits
       program, de-linking calculation of increases in benefits from minimum wage
       indexation and linking increases to inflation instead


Medium term support after DPL
68.      It is expected that in the medium term the Government would initiate a revision of
legislation to improve the functioning of the disability benefit program, including (i) redesigning
the disability assessment criteria; (ii) redefining the size of benefits including introduction of
partial benefits depending on the degree of disability; and (iii) unifying scattered legislation on


                                                29
disability benefits and eliminating special categories based on certain disability conditions. These
objectives would be supported by the proposed follow-up social assistance investment loan


Challenge III: The NE Social Assistance Program is currently "passive" ­ lacking
proactive links to human capital or employment services that could potentially enhance
its effectiveness for reducing poverty in the long-run

DPL Support
69.     In order to make the social assistance system more proactive, the DPL would support the
introduction of incentives for beneficiary families to enroll children in school and ensure daily
attendance. The NE legislation would be amended to provide a bonus for the beneficiaries with
school-age children as an incentive for daily school enrollment/attendance. 11 Linking NE
benefits to education-related incentives of NE families with school aged children would improve
the effectiveness of the program for long-run poverty reduction.



           Prior Action 3
           The Government has introduced a bonus for school-age children's attendance in
           compulsory education for households receiving NE


Medium term support after DPL
70.     The DPL would be followed by a proposed Social Assistance Investment Loan to
provide implementation support for some of the policy changes. This project would support the
design and implementation of the conditional cash transfer, by providing funding and technical
assistance for: (a) defining the specific co-responsibility or conditionality (e.g. enrolment,
attendance) and the optimal level at which it should be applied (primary, lower, or upper
secondary); (b) monitoring co-responsibilities, i.e. making sure families implement the action
required to receive payments and developing a system for enforcing consequences for non-
compliance; and (c) evaluating outcomes associated with the revised and enhanced NE program.

Challenge IV: The administration of the Ndihma Ekonomike Social Assistance Program
needs to be strengthened

DPL Support
71.     The DPL is supporting the first steps to improve the administration of NE benefits.
Improving administration of social benefits through the automation of the system is one of the
main priorities of the Government but it is an endeavor that requires time and significant
funding, especially for creating electronic databases and intercommunicating systems of various
programs. The Government has already taken the first step, completing an assessment of the
current operational aspects of the NE program, including the information flows, financial flows,
functional responsibilities, and institutional capacity. Second, the Government is amending the
NE legislation to institutionalize the automation of the beneficiary registry, mandating the
creation of a national registry of all applicants and beneficiaries.

11   A conditional cash transfer as an additional bonus to the current benefit.

                                                             30
                                            Prior Action 4
       The Government has amended legislation to mandate the creation of an
       automated national registry for applicants and beneficiaries of social assistance
       programs


Medium term support after DPL
72.     In the medium term Albania would establish a unified household information registry to
help avoid duplications and track beneficiaries. As proper identification of beneficiaries is crucial,
a unique social identification number could be used to link registry information and beneficiaries
with other systems and programs. The existing decentralized structure of the NE could be
improved by designing a centralized database while implementation and data collection can
continue to be decentralized. Arrangements could be made to improve the quality of data
collection, such as providing certain incentives to local governments (including financial) to
support data collection.

Challenge V: Access to health care services by poor households is not universal and
financial constraints limit utilization among the poor

DPL Support
73.      The Government is committed to increasing transparency in the health sector and
guaranteeing access to basic care to all. As a first step, it is amending the health insurance
legislation to grant health insurance coverage to all beneficiaries of the NE social assistance
program. The next step in reducing inequality further is to tackle the issue of informal payments.
The system of informal payments is partly encouraged by an unclear copayments policy, which
often blurs the distinction between formal and informal payments. It is also associated with a lax
definition of the type of services that the health insurance should cover. Experience elsewhere
has shown that it is possible to reduce informal payments when this issue is addressed as an
integral part of health finance reforms.
74.     The DPL would support further changes in the system that would contribute to reducing
informal payments. An important step in this process is to set clear limits on what public
resources for health can finance. Defining an explicit package of benefits in this way can help to
improve equity in access and increase accountability for the services specified in the package; as
patients are aware of what services they are entitled to receive and at what prices, the scope for
informal payments is reduced. The DPL would support the definition of an explicit package of
benefits by establishing the principle in the health insurance legislation.


                                            Prior Action 5
       The Government has authorized HII to extend coverage of health insurance to
       NE program beneficiaries and has established a package of benefits, thereby
       enabling the cost of providing health services to be estimated

Medium term support after DPL
75.     Once the benefits package is created by law, the secondary legislation has to define the
specific contents of the package and how much it will cost. The current Health Systems
Modernization project would support the design and costing of this package. As is common in
many countries that adopt an explicit package of benefits to be covered by public funding, a
system of formal copayments should be introduced, including provisions to protect low-income
groups by exempting them from copayments based on some kind of means testing or providing
them with an additional cash benefit to face the increased cost of services. Low income
households could be identified through a health card, which is currently under consideration.
76.    In the medium term other measures could be supported to reduce the extent of informal
payments, like allowing health providers collecting the copayments to retain at least part of those
revenues, and implementing information campaigns to inform the population about their rights.

Challenge VI: Funding for Health Insurance is not based on systematic criteria

DPL Support
77.      The Government is amending the current legislation, to introduce a more systematic
approach to health financing. It would maintain the payroll contribution for health insurance
unchanged, at 3.4 percent, as an increase could have negative impact on labor demand. In
addition, the Government would enact legislation establishing that the transfers from the
Treasury to the HII on behalf of the uninsured would be based on the cost of providing a basic
package of services. Secondary legislation would determine the exact package and the provisions
to cost it.



                                           Prior Action 6
       The Government has defined a systematic rule to transfer resources to the HII,
       using cost of services as a criterion for the transfers, and maintained the payroll
       contribution at the current level


Medium term support after DPL
78.     Over time it is expected that the HII will develop its purchasing function further, and
actuarial and costing estimates provide an accurate figure of the cost of providing services in
order to transfer resources accordingly. The Health Systems Modernization Investment Project
and a PHRD grant are providing technical assistance to determine these costs. Further technical
work with Government will also be important on the overall financing system of the health
insurance sector so that future increases of the payroll tax (which are still being considered)
would not be necessary.

Challenge VII: The Health Insurance Institute needs to increase its efficiency as
purchaser of health care services

DPL Support
79.   In 2009, the Government unified the resources for health under one single agency, the
HII. This means that the HII now purchases most health care services, both at primary and

                                                 32
hospital level. The MoH is responsible for financing Public health activities, two mental
hospitals, the Licensing and Accreditation Center, Blood Banks, and other minor activities. In
addition the HII is, for the first time, developing performance contracts to be signed with
hospitals. These contracts define all general rights and obligations for the HII and hospitals and
a list of indicators to be used for performance evaluation. The contracting of hospitals according
to performance indicators is at a very early stage, and improving it will require a dedicated team
of analysts at the HII that can monitor performance and determine the right indicators to include
in the contracts in order to improve performance of hospitals. In order to build the capacity for
developing and monitoring the implementation of performance contracts the HII is creating a
performance analysis and contracting department.


                                           Prior Action 7
       The Government has unified the publicly funded purchasing of health services
       under one agency, by transferring financing of hospitals to HII. Additionally the
       HII has signed performance contracts with thirty nine hospitals


Medium term support after DPL
80.     The policy changes supported by this DPL are the first steps in implementing a
comprehensive reform in health financing and provision. The DPL would support the creation
of an enabling environment for further changes but additional support will be needed. The
current health investment project would support further implementation of these changes.
Before the HII can move fully into a model of purchasing for services based on performance, the
capacity of providers and purchaser has to be developed further, and the regulatory framework
governing health service provision has to be refined. In terms of capacity building the sector
would need to develop adequate provider reporting and information systems so as to allow for
better monitoring of provider activity and resource use. It would also need to further develop
provider accountability mechanisms.


FISCAL IMPACT OF THE REFORM
81.     The DPL supported policies have a moderate fiscal impact that would be reflected fully
after a transition period of two years, once the legislation that supports the implementation of
some of the policies takes full effect. The overall fiscal impact is negligible for the current year,
with many policies resulting in small savings and offsetting the increases associated with others.
A summary of the fiscal impact is included in Table 4.

                            VII.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
82.      The proposed DPL is expected to have a positive impact on poverty and redistribution,
once the policies supported by the operation become fully implemented. Restoring the
conditions for sustained growth through a stable macroeconomic framework will help address
concerns over the slowdown in poverty reduction over the last couple of years. As GDP growth
declined since 2008, it is projected that poverty reduction will also slow down. After several years
in which sustained growth contributed to more than halving poverty incidence, particularly in
rural areas, the projected poverty rate is 10.2 for 2010 and 9.5 for 2011. 12
83.     In addition the DPL will support enhancements in the social assistance system by
improving targeting mechanisms both at the geographic and household level. The current
targeting of the Ndhima Ekonomike (N.E.) program is adequate, as those in the poorest quintile
receive about 56 percent of the resources. Despite its good targeting accuracy, coverage is not
very high ­ only 25 percent of the population in the bottom 10 percent of the population is
covered by NE.
84.     Focus groups (FG) with NE beneficiaries, NE non-beneficiaries and NE administrators
in different parts of the country have been conducted to understand more fully the application
process and program administration. 13 The study's main findings are that: (a) access to NE by
the poor is oftentimes hindered by costly, lengthy and complex application procedures, (b) that
application procedures are often not only cumbersome but not transparent and provide ground
for the perception that personal connections allow many non-poor beneficiaries to access NE, (c)
the exclusionary nature of some of the filters applied in the targeting of the benefits and (d) the
low level of the benefit. Beneficiaries reported however that even if low the regular nature of the
benefit allowed them to access loans or food on credit, and to reimburse medical and other
expenses
85.     To address possible concerns on how the reforms supported by this operation might
affect the Roma community, targeted FG and in-depth interviews with urban Roma residents
were conducted. In addition to highlighting the role that bureaucratic requirements play in
disqualifying poor Roma who could be eligible for NE, these FG and in-depth interviews
highlighted the difficulties that Roma NE beneficiaries, unlike non-Roma beneficiaries report in
retaining NE eligibility once qualified. This is primarily due to pressure from NE offices and
from the Employment office to renounce NE benefits and find jobs instead (particularly in the
case of households with grown-up children). Roma non-beneficiaries, particularly males, report
discrimination in public offices due to ethnicity, namely lack of willingness on part of NE
administrators to provide necessary information or unequal treatment in obtaining required
documents.
86.    Against this background, the impact of the measures under this DPL that will help
improve the coverage of the poor and provide for more transparent eligibility criteria appears to
be particularly beneficial. The improvements in geographic targeting by basing allocations on
municipal level poverty estimates obtained by small area estimation techniques (Betti and Neri
2010) would result in an improvement in the coverage of the poor even if the budget remained

region (Perondi and Cukalat), Rural Coastal region (Rashbull and Milot), small towns in the Coastal region (Sukth
and Lac) and the urban Roma community.

constant. The improvement would be more noticeable if a poverty severity index rather than a
simple headcount were used to derive the weights (Table 5). Note that allocations based on
severity indices capture more closely the extent of the more extreme forms of poverty in a given
municipality. Further work is ongoing in deriving allocation rules based on a new map focused on
extreme poverty defined as the bottom 5 percent of the population.

 Note: these simulations compare a baseline of "perfectly implemented" allocation of MOLSAE weights, with two perfectly implemented
 alternative allocations; to maintain the assumption of budget neutrality the simulations focus on per capita allocations rather than on allocations
 adjusted for household composition
 Note: Poverty severity measures how poor the poor are. In other words, poverty severity (also called the squared poverty gap) measures how far
 below the poverty line individuals and households are, with more consequence given to those at the very bottom. The larger the poverty
 severity the farther away the poor are from the poverty line, and the larger the effort needed to alleviate poverty




87.     Further, the project supports the adoption of new and clear criteria for identifying
potential beneficiaries. A scoring formula would replace the current system of "filters", which
appear to effectively screen out a number of poor potential beneficiaries with a composite
indicator weighting different household characteristics to identify eligibility. Initial simulations
suggest that if the binary variables currently used to filter households were to be replaced by a
system that weighs different variables according to the consumption profile of households, the
share of benefits accruing to the poorest decile of the population could increase to 58 percent
from the current 38 percent, and the share going to the poor could increase to 61 percent from
the current 42 percent. 14
88.      The benefits of the adoption of this new targeting criteria at the individual level are
expected to go beyond those that can be simulated, and encompass also improvements in the
application of the letter of the law. . In addition to the focus groups conducted as part of this
PSIA, other qualitative evidence on administration of NE in urban areas (UNIFEM 2010)
documents how under the current system there is scope for arbitrary interpretations of the
regulatory system, with women often bearing the brunt of the implicit assumptions of the social
worker or of the regulator. In particular, excluded from NE eligibility are (i) women whose
husbands work abroad, even in the absence of remittances, (ii) women heads of household for
whom child care and home care responsibilities prevent from participation in community works
or vocational training in the absence of social services, or (iii) divorced women who cannot
provide documentation verifying non-payment of alimony (which is difficult to verify). Similar
qualitative work on administration of NE in rural area is currently being undertaken by
UNIFEM. In addition, the World Bank is conducting a series of focus groups in rural and urban
areas of the country, including in Roma communities, to explore how the way the letter of the
law is interpreted by local officials and community councils creates effective barriers to access for
different vulnerable groups. The measures aimed at clarifying the eligibility criteria, supported by
14   These are preliminary estimates. Further calculations are under way and available upon request.

                                                                        36
this DPL, are expected to have a beneficial effect on the gender disparities in qualifying for social
assistance.
89.       Further changes to NE supported by this DPL, such as the creation of a national registry
of NE beneficiaries are expected not to have any negative distributional consequences, while
having the potential to help indirectly those accessing NE by facilitating compliance with the
eligibility and monthly certification requirements. Finally, it can be expected that the reforms in
the Disability Benefits program would free additional resources within a fiscally neutral envelope
to increase generosity and coverage of the NE. In the medium term the Government is planning
to address the problems with the disability benefits program that have resulted in a large increase
in the number of beneficiaries. The World Bank will assist the Government in the
implementation of those reforms, including the design of eligibility mechanisms that would not
discourage those with legitimate claims to apply for this benefit. Since the data available is not
sufficient to obtain a poverty profile of the disabled, the World Bank team is in the process of
obtaining resources (through the ECA PSIA TF) for data collection in this area. It is expected
that at least a minimum amount of information on disability will be provided by the 2011 Census.
90.     The other major area of reforms supported by this DPL is the provision of health
services. According to the latest data (LSMS 2008) only 30 percent of those in the bottom
consumption quintile had health insurance, compared to 55 percent in the top quintile and 42
percent overall. Health insurance coverage is particularly low among recipients of Ndihme
Ekonomike, only 27 percent of those receiving NE support reported having health insurance,
particularly in rural areas (18 percent versus 42 percent in urban areas). Extending the coverage
of health services financed through the Health Insurance Institute to all NE beneficiaries is
clearly a step in the right direction. Given the current composition of recipients of the NE
program, extending coverage to all NE recipients would increase coverage among the poor from
26 percent to 42 percent. Coverage among the poor would increase by 14 percentage points in
urban areas (from 26 percent), and would double in rural areas (where it is currently only 19
percent). In addition, further improvements in the targeting of NE would be reflected in greater
coverage of the poor by health insurance.
91.      Other than direct benefits in improving the affordability of health care ­ note that an
estimated 46 percent of those in the bottom consumption quintile found it difficult or very
difficult to pay for health care during the past 12 months, compared to only 14 percent in the
top consumption quintile ­ the extension of health insurance to the poor is likely to lead also to a
reduction in the probability of paying informal gifts for outpatient services which at the moment
are common, particularly among low income patients ­ 22 percent of patients in the bottom
consumption quintile paid them for outpatient services in 2008, and the mean amounts of gifts
per outpatient visit was also higher in the bottom quintile (1.4 percent of HH consumption,
compared to 0.6 percent overall) (Tomini and Packard, 2010).
92.     The implementation of an explicit benefit package would have to include a co-payment
system, to discourage unnecessary use of certain systems. Using the experience of other
countries in Europe, the co-payment system would also have to rely on either an exemption
policy (ideally means tested), or an additional cash amount to social assistance beneficiaries so
that they are not prevented from using health services due to financial constraints.
93.      Finally, it is expected that efficiency-enhancing measures in the health sector will
contribute to shifting resources to facilities and districts based on need rather than historical
factors, therefore better reflecting the distribution of poverty across the country.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
94.      The proposed operation is not likely to have any significant effects on the environment.
Following OP 8.60, the operation was reviewed for any potential effects relating to the
environment, forest, and natural resources. As this operation focuses on strengthening
institutions, policy framework, and the quality of social protection and health in Albania, it is not
expected to have any impact on the environment.
95.     Since the Prior Actions supported by the DPL would be complemented by two ongoing
and one new investment operation, any unintended environmental impact of the DPL supported
policies could be addressed in that context.

CONSULTATIONS
96.     The two key pieces of legislation supported by this DPL were drafted in consultation
with relevant stakeholders, and participation was assured through the parliamentary process
involved in the approval of the laws. In addition the policy changes that the legislations support
were discussed in various meetings with Central Government officials, members of parliament,
local government officials, NGOs, and donor agencies. Two meetings, one in June 2010, and
another in October 2010, were held to consult with key stake holders on the reforms proposed
by the social sector development policy loan. The main reforms focus on (a) improving the
targeting of the Ndihma Ekonomike (NE) program, thereby increasing the program's coverage
of the poor in Albania; (b) addressing the rapid increase in expenditure on disability benefits--
due to increases in both the number of beneficiaries as well as increase in benefit levels, and (c)
addressing access to health care services by poor households. There was general agreement that
some of the conditions that currently restrict access to the NE program were exclusionary. The
stakeholders made the point that two conditions in particular--one that excludes any family with
a member living abroad, and the second which excludes access to a family that has moved within
Albania since 1991--served to exclude the poor. The stakeholders also raised the issue of closer
co-operation and connection between social administrators who administer the NE program and
the public employment services, so that work-able beneficiaries of the NE program can benefit
from job placement services, or training programs that enhance their skills, and so on. In addition
the stakeholders agreed that current disability legislation is scattered and there is conflict of
interest among people who determine eligibility. They were encouraged to see that the
government plans to address these issues in partnership with the World Bank.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
97.     The implementation of the program will require close coordination between the Bank
team and the respective institutions responsible for implementation. These include the Ministry
of Finance, The Ministry of Labor, Social Assistance, and Equal Opportunities, the Ministry of
Health, and the Health Insurance Institute. The Ministry of Finance oversees implementation of
the Prior Actions included in the DPL while the overall design and technical work is the
responsibility of the respective ministries and related institutions. The Bank has also been
working closely with these ministries in the context of preparation and supervision of health and
social service projects. In addition, since the DPL is part of a package that includes
implementation support through a social assistance investment project, the evaluation of most
Prior Actions will take place in the context of the preparation and implementation of that project.
The Policy Matrix includes a number of outcome indicators to monitor progress. Given the
nature of the reform many of those outcomes will only be achieved in the medium term.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
Public Financial Management and Procurement

98.     A Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA) covering both financial management and
procurement was finalized in August 2006. The report's main focus was on procurement, but it
included follow-up to the 2002 CFA analytical work. In parallel, and in conjunction with the
PEIR (July 2006), a broader assessment of public financial management (July 2006) using the
PEFA framework was prepared and delivered to the Government along with the CFA. The
PEIR assessment demonstrated that although considerable improvements in the PFM
framework, including the legal framework, have taken place, a number of weaknesses remained.
Both the CFA and the PEIR noted that the budget is still not an adequate managerial tool to
manage government's priorities and secure smooth operational performance. The budget is not
implemented as planned owing to unpredictability of investment spending, and poor cash
planning. Other weaknesses identified include significant reallocations during budget
implementation resulting in ad-hoc spending. A follow up PEFA is scheduled to take place in
2011. While standard coverage of PEFA assessment is public financial management at the level
of the central government, this assessment also include local government expenditures, as these
are captured by the budget process and treasury system.
99.     The Bank, the IMF and other donors are supporting the government in strengthening
budget credibility by improving macro and fiscal forecasting, the budget preparation process
(particularly in procurement), and considerably strengthening cash flow planning before and
during budget execution in order to set realistic and manageable cash allotment ceilings as well as
enforce these ceilings. Similarly, the government is making efforts to discipline budget execution
by committing expenditure based on available resources, and continuing to strengthen
accountability through follow-up by Parliament and government on the findings of the High
State Control (Supreme Audit institution). The implementation of the Medium-Term Budgetary
Program (MTBP) has improved, and strengthened further with the approval of the New Organic
Budget Law in 2008, which will help make the process more binding starting from the ongoing
budget cycle. Other notable progress is in the improved budget preparation, the appointment of
authorizing officers with clear responsibilities for effective financial management and budget
implementation and improved budget allocation to spending units. The ongoing project on
`Capacity Building Support to Implement the Integrated Planning (IPS)' seeks to strengthen the
role of the General Directorate of Budget and capacity building of all line ministries to produce
and manage the Medium-Term Budget Program (MTBT) that links to the National Strategy for
Development and Integration (2007-2013), integrate public investment management processes
into the MTBP cycle, and strengthen capacity within government in the implementation the
European Integration Agenda. In addition, the EU is supporting the government implement the
Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) strategy on strengthening financial management and
control laws, regulations and systems, and improved internal audit function in the budget
spending units. A Central Harmonization Unit for internal audit has been created under General
Audit Directorate, with a mission to prepare and improve legal basis and internal audit
methodology framework in line with international standards and best practices. The existing
controls on budget execution are weak, but controls on payroll, cash and debt management and
reporting would be improved with the implementation and progressive rollout of an ongoing
modernization of the Treasury system which has experienced many delays.

Review of Central Bank and Foreign Exchange Management

100. There has been no recent IMF safeguard assessment on the Bank of Albania. Previous
assessment carried out in July 2006 under the IMF's safeguards assessment policy requiring
required full safeguards assessment of the Bank of Albania, with respect to the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The BoA's control environment includes a
well-defined organizational structure and formalized institutional policies. The BoA has
embarked on a program to strengthen the foreign reserves management function. Management
of foreign reserves is conducted in accordance with approved investment policy. However, the
assessment noted some weaknesses in the central bank's safeguards framework. The audited
financial statements for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009 had a clean opinion from the auditors.
But the IMF was concerned about the quality of the external audit and the lack of oversight of
the external and internal audit functions. Seven recommended actions were agreed with the BoA
to address these weaknesses. The authorities have already taken steps to implement some of
these recommendations.


DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
101. Borrower and credit amount. The Borrower is Albania, represented by the Ministry of
Finance. This operation is a single-tranche loan of Euro 18.1 million (US$25 million equivalent).
The loan proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon the effectiveness of the Loan
Agreement between the Bank and Albania.
102. Disbursement. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the Bank of the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between the Bank and Albania, the Borrower will submit a
withdrawal application to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).
IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan into a foreign currency account designated by the
Borrower that forms part of the Single Treasury Account of the country and acceptable to IBRD,
such account to be held at the Bank of Albania (BoA). This account is available for budget
financing and will be managed by and subject to the control of the MoF. The Borrower will
report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and confirm its
availability to finance budget expenditures, within 30 days of receiving such funds. If, after
depositing funds in this BoA account, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to either: (i) return that
amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or (ii) refund the amount directly to the
Bank, in which case the Bank will cancel an equivalent un-disbursed amount of the loan.
103. Auditing. Due to the clean opinion provided by the external auditors on the recent
financial statements of the Bank of Albania and corrective measures taken to address weaknesses,
no audit will be required for this operation.
104. The closing date of the loan is April 30, 2012. The Bank will leave the operation open for
long enough to allow an appropriate response should Albania need supplemental financing as the
international financial crisis unfolds.


RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
105.   The following risks have been identified during preparation of the DPL:



                                               40
106. Macroeconomic: The fragility of Albania's external environment remains a risk which
could worsen the macroeconomic situation and possibly lead to elevated public debt level beyond
the legal limit of 60 percent of GDP.. During 2010 the economy showed clear signs of recovery
although there are still risks ahead given the uncertain global and European economic outlook.
The fiscal deficit jumped to over 7 percent of GDP in 2009 and public debt approached 60
percent of GDP. By mid-2010 government adjusted to the impact of the economic slowdown
and adopted a more realistic budget plan, cutting expenditures by 9.5 percent. This adjustment,
although somewhat delayed, is a step in the right direction for preserving fiscal discipline and
avoiding further increases in public debt. The challenge now is to keep to this plan without
creating major distortions in key public services while pursuing a medium term budget
framework with measures that ensure a declining debt path.
Mitigating Factors: The World Bank has already intensified its dialogue on the macroeconomic
policies, given the lack of a Fund disbursing program. The Albanian authorities are well aware of
the uncertainty about the future economic outlook and have committed to a gradual decline in
the level of public debt. Moreover, they are prepared to protect the fiscal deficit from deepening
in case of revenue underperformance, by building sufficient buffers in the 2011 budget. The first
buffer consists of contingency funds of 0.8 percent of GDP. A further buffer is in the form of a
mechanism similar to the one applied during 2010 which could postpone lower-priority capital
spending until the mid-year budget review when it would be either initiated or further postponed
depending on the revenue performance during the first six months. Capital expenditures are
budget to be 6.2 percent of GDP in 2011, and above 5 percent of GDP in the medium-term,
which gives sufficient flexibility to reduce spending by postponing some of these expenditures.
The authorities stand ready to implement these adjustments and others with equivalent fiscal
saving, if needed to maintain the deficit below 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and at 3 percent of
GDP thereafter to protect the debt level below 60 percent of GDP. Intensified monitoring
coupled with the preparation of a new DPL series starting in FY12 should ameliorate the
macroeconomic risk beyond 2011.
107. Political: The relationship between the opposition and the coalition Government
remains tense, one year after the parliamentary elections. The opposition contested the legitimacy
of the election results and refused to take its seats in Parliament. A compromise in which all
parliamentarians took their seats in Parliament was brokered just ahead of a February 2010
constitutional deadline. Although Albania has already made considerable strides in consolidating
multi-party democracy and peaceful transitions of power, the political climate remains very
polarized.
Mitigating Factors: the context of the EU accession agenda with its strong political criteria and
broad-based support in Albania - across political parties and the general public - should provide
incentives for early resolution of political issues. In addition the measures included in the DPL
have wide support base irrespective of political affiliation.
108. Technical : The DPL is in many instances supporting the creation of an enabling
environment for reforms in social programs and services, but implementation effort will be
needed after the legislation and associated rules are revised in order to consolidate the reforms.
There is a risk that the low capacity in some sectors may hinder the impact of the proposed
policy changes.
Mitigating Factors: The current health investment project and an upcoming social assistance project
will provide implementation support to the policies supported by the DPL. The DPL team is
working with the Government team on technical details as a way to build capacity (e.g. the


                                                41
preparation of the poverty map and a step-by-step guide to use it in the allocation of NE
resources to municipalities).
109. Social : While most of the policy changes would have a positive impact on the poor and
vulnerable, some reforms may result in losses for specific groups with vested interests.
Mitigation: the design of the operation accounts for this risk by phasing the impact of the reforms.
The Government has discussed the reform program with these groups in order to create broad
support.

ANNEX 3: FUND RELATIONS NOTE

                   ALBANIA--ASSESSMENT LETTER TO THE WORLD BANK
                                        MARCH 11, 2011

Albania has weathered the global crisis well and is on track for a gradual recovery. The
slowdown of GDP growth from almost 8 percent pre-crisis to some 3 percent in 2009 and
2010, though substantial, marked a better economic performance than in other countries in the
region. A gradual strengthening of growth to some 3½ percent is likely in 2011, reflecting a
subdued recovery of private consumption and investments. Inflation has largely remained
within the 3±1 percent target range, but the pick-up of global food and fuel prices has recently
pushed headline inflation out of the band, though underlying inflation is contained.

External imbalances declined and continue to adjust. Strong export growth led a large
current account deficit adjustment from above 15 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 10
percent in 2010. Although some of the export gains were one-off, the current account balance
is likely to remain stable in 2011, given the moderate recovery of domestic demand. The
flexible exchange rate has kept the real exchange rate competitive, and FDI and remittances
are expected to recover further.

Fiscal adjustment is the key task and needs to focus on debt reduction and risk
mitigation. The deficit was cut by more than half to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2010, but still left
public debt at around 60 percent of GDP, posing significant rollover risks as well as high debt
servicing costs. While a fall 2010 Eurobond was used to prepay an expensive syndicated loan
and left some cushion for 2011, it was not cheap. Refinancing risks could arise going forward,
especially if there is no credible anchor to cut debt, and sovereign stress again heightens in the
euro-periphery. Continued fiscal discipline and expenditure-led fiscal consolidation--
preferably beyond the 2011 budget deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP--is needed. In any
event, if revenues turn out to be less than the optimistic projections in the 2011 budget,
expenditure adjustments will be needed, as was the case in 2010. Structural fiscal reforms on
both revenue and expenditure sides could support this task and also help establish fiscal
institutions that would foster long term growth.

The financial sector has proved resilient to global and regional crises. The banking
system has remained generally sound with adequate capital and profits are recovering. Greek-
owned banks have stabilized and started to rely more on domestic funding sources rather than
parent financing. While deposits growth reached 18.5 percent in 2010, credit growth slowed
down to 10 percent. To improve financial intermediation, one of the top priorities is resolution
of non-performing loans, including by greater emphasis on collateral execution.

Economic risks to the outlook are broadly balanced but the political situation remains
difficult. The run-up to high-stakes local elections has added further divisiveness to politics.
Export growth may slow down more than projected and private domestic demand could falter.
The budget is not initiating a credible debt reduction, leaving rollover risks and interest costs
at elevated levels. On the upside, a swift resolution of current regional and geopolitical
uncertainties could lead to a faster recovery in Europe and the world. This could bring higher

                                               54
foreign demand and capital inflows, and lead a stronger recovery of domestic demand. An
improved political climate may also help budget consolidation.

      1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are shocks of 2 standard deviations in
      the first year (3 standard deviation in the case of interest rate) and 1.5 standard deviation in the
      second year.
      2/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2011, with real depreciation defined as
      nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus
      domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
      3/ Growth and revenue lower but expenditures do not adjust (primary balance decreases).
