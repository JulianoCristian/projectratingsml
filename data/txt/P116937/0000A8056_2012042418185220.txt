                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the DPL is to support policy changes to (i) improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, and (ii) enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending,
                         in a fiscally sustainable environment. In particular, the proposed reform agenda supported by this DPL includes the following:
                         i.       To improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, the DPL would support policies that (a)strengthen the mechanisms to allocate funds and select beneficiaries
                         in the main social assistance program; (b) introduce incentives for investing in human capital by providing an additional benefit linked to school enrollment and
                         attendance for families with school age children; (c) initiate the process to create a unified registry of beneficiaries of social assistance programs; and (d) change the
                         indexation formula of the disability benefits program, to control the share of resources allocated to this program, which is growing disproportionately;
                         ii.      To enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending, the DPL would support policies to (a) introduce more predictable fiscal rules to finance health; (b)
                         improve the methods for contracting with providers and the capacity to monitor their performance; and (c) grant health insurance coverage to social assistance
                         beneficiaries.
                         The DPL would also enhance transparency and accountability by supporting policies to improve the administration of social assistance programs and promoting the use
                         of systematic formulas to allocate resources in selected social programs and services

                         beneficiaries. The DPL would also enhance transparency and accountability by supporting policies to improve the administration of social assistance programs and promoting the use
                         of systematic formulas to allocate resources in selected social programs and services

                         This DPL, a single tranche operation, supported a medium-term reform program in social assistance and health:

                         On social assistance, the design of the Bank’s overall support program for Albania included policy and implementation support. The DPL supported the adoption of broad policy
                         changes in social programs through revised legislation. More specifically, the DPL supported (i) a more equitable and transparent allocation of resources from the central to the local
                         governments for the Ndihma Ekonomike program on the basis of poverty related criteria; (ii) a more equitable and transparent eligibility criteria (by reducing errors of exclusion and
                         inclusion) in the selection of eligible beneficiaries for the Ndihma Ekonomike program by defining household eligibility criteria based on a unified scoring formula with weights across
                         variables associated with poverty status;(iii) a more efficient and transparent social assistance program by initiating the creation of an automated national registry of applicants and
                         beneficiaries of social assistance programs to strengthen administration and contribute to informed and timely policy making; (iv) the creation of enabling environment for a more pro-
                         active social assistance program by introducing incentives for Ndihma Ekonomike beneficiary families to enroll children in school and ensure daily attendance: an (v) a more fiscally
                         sustainable social assistance program by controlling spending on disability assistance program through linking indexation of disability benefits to inflation. All of these policy changes
                         will enhance effectiveness of social assistance programs in reducing poverty while also promoting transparency. The DPL document, while supporting the policy changes, indicated
                         the need for a follow-on operation to support the implementation of policy changes. Accordingly, the Social Assistance Modernization Project (SAMP), which was approved by the
                         World Bank's Board of Directors on April 3, 2012, will support the implementation of the policy changes that were supported by this DPL. The SAMP will support implementation of
                         reforms both in the Ndihma Ekonomike (poverty focused) and the disability assistance programs through improvements in targeting, eligibility and coverage, benefits structures,
                         benefits administration and management of information; and oversight and controls.

                         On health, the DPL supported a thorough revisi on of the existing legislation, ensuring policy changes in a number of key areas, including: (i) ensuring access to health care services
                         for poor households, (ii) increasing efficiency of the Health Insurance Institute as purchaser of health care services, and (iii) introducing a more systematic approach to health
                         financing. These policy changes are considered crucial for the continuation of the overall health sector reforms. Implementation of these reforms is well complemented by the
                         activities supported under the on-going Health System Modernization Project; such as: quality improvement activities, establishing information systems for the Health Insurance
                         Institute, introducing performance based contracting and monitoring, as well as training of managers and service providers.
