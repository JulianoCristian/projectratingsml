                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the DPL is to support policy changes to (i) improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, and (ii) enhance the efficiency and equity of health
                         spending, in a fiscally sustainable environment. In particular, the proposed reform agenda supported by this DPL includes the following:
                         i.      To improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, the DPL would support policies that (a) strengthen the mechanisms to allocate funds and select
                         beneficiaries in the main social assistance program; (b) introduce incentives for investing in human capital by providing an additional benefit linked to school
                         enrollment and attendance for families with school age children; (c) initiate the process to create a unified registry of beneficiaries of social assistance
                         programs; and (d) change the indexation formula of the disability benefits program, to control the share of resources allocated to this program, which is
                         growing disproportionately;
                         ii.     To enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending, the DPL would support policies to (a) introduce more predictable fiscal rules to finance health;
                         (b) improve the methods for contracting with providers and the capacity to monitor their performance; and (c) grant health insurance coverage to social
                         assistance beneficiaries.
                         The DPL would also enhance transparency and accountability by supporting policies to improve the administration of social assistance programs and
                         promoting the use of systematic formulas to allocate resources in selected social programs and services
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
