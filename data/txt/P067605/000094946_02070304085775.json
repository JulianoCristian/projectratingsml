The project's long term impact is\n            considered to be essentially positive and will lead to a\n            significantly lower vulnerability in the area. The\n            environmental impacts of the works involved by the Project\n            will be minimal and will be addressed in detail in the\n            integrated vulnerability reduction study. The resettlement\n            of 5,000 families currently living in areas vulnerable to\n            natural hazards is the most serious issue and was analyzed\n            very carefully. The new sites for resettlement of the 5,000\n            families will be subjected to environmental screening and\n            environmental management plans will be prepared as needed to\n            ensure that appropriate mitigation measures will be\n            implemented and monitored. The project also aims at\n            removing, offsetting, or mitigating all impacts of\n            unregulated urban development that magnified the adverse\n            consequences of the flash floods of November 10, 2001. This\n            will be done through works to be carried out on the\n            concerned watersheds and embankments, and will include slope\n            stabilization by tree plantations, retention basins, and\n            drainage collectors."}, "docdt": "2002-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
