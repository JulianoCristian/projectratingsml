 Vulnerability Reduction Project



1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The reforms launched by the Government in the mid 1990s, including fiscal stabilization and economic
liberalization, generated a GDP growth of about 3 percent par annum. Insecurity in rural areas during the
so-called "black decade of violence" (1992-2002) had contributed to an acceleration of rural out-
migration, which in turn had worsened acute problems of housing and urban services, particularly in
Algiers, the capital city. The recurrence of natural disasters, resulting from flooding and seismic activity,
increased the vulnerability of the population, particularly its poorest segments, and required costly
rehabilitation programs.

On November 10, 2001, fourteen provinces (wilayas)1 in the Northern part of the country (cf. Map IBRD
32028R, at the end of this report) suffered from flash flood of mud and water following torrential rains in
the Bouzareah massif. The flash flood resulted in more than 800 deaths and substantial material damages,
estimated at about US$400 million. Large landmasses were destabilized by the rain, causing land
movement and excessive mudflows. Carrying everything in their path, these voluminous deposits of mud
and debris ended up in heavily built urban areas such as the low income Bab el Oued and Oued Koriche
districts in Algiers. Vulnerable groups were the most affected by the disaster.

Damage to housing was the most serious accounting for about 33 percent of total damage. The storm
water drainage system and other public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, and schools suffered
heavy losses as well.         The disaster exacerbated ongoing environmental degradation, including
deforestation of the protective vegetation cover.

Algeria is exposed to numerous natural hazards, including earthquakes and floods. Destruction due to
natural hazards is compounded by rapid urbanization and environmental degradation. The urbanization
rate doubled between 1966 and 2000 to about 60 percent. Inadequate maintenance of buildings in low-
income neighborhoods contributed to urban vulnerability. Poorly designed and obsolete storm and
sanitary drainage systems further accelerated the destabilization of buildings and infrastructure.
Uncontrolled development contributed to deforestation. When the floods hit Algeria, the Government
was reviewing its housing strategy and envisaged a shift from supply-driven, public sector dominated to
market oriented policies. It also sought to reduce the burden of public subsidies in the sector.

Rationale for Bank assistance. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was being developed when the
severe flooding occurred. An interim CAS note indicated that key issues to be addressed by the strategy
included low-income housing, illegal residential construction, urban services and unemployment. The
2003 CAS proposed three priorities for Bank assistance, including support to the Government's efforts to
articulate and implement a strategy for better service delivery, particularly for water supply, housing
environmental services (including waste management), and human development.

In the past two decades, the Bank supported several projects in Algeria for post-disaster reconstruction,
which brought about a consensus that the focus of the Bank's disaster assistance should shift to long-term

risk and vulnerability reduction. Despite the significant amount of assistance provided for disaster
mitigation and the success of past Bank interventions in post-disaster reconstruction, neither the
Government nor the Bank had developed a strategy for hazard reduction. The social, economic and
political consequences of the November 2001 disaster and the high vulnerability of main cities
highlighted the need to develop such a strategy. The rationale for Bank's involvement should be viewed
in the context of Algeria's natural hazard vulnerability, its request to the Bank for assistance, as well as
the Bank's experience in that area. For the operation under review, the Bank, in collaboration with the
Government, formulated a strategy aimed at reducing urban vulnerability to natural disasters and
strengthening national capacity for disaster management.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

This project had two main objectives: (i) to reduce vulnerability of most seriously affected urban areas
after November 1001 flooding; and (ii) to strengthen the capacity of national institutions for disaster
management. The first objective was to be achieved by resettling the people who had been affected by
the floods and providing protection directly to about 30,000 people and indirectly to more than 250,000
people living in downstream districts. The second objective was to be achieved through strengthening
early warning systems, improving the means of intervention by risk management of social protection
organizations, and developing detailed plans to reduce the vulnerability of urban zones in the Algiers
metropolitan area.

The Board documents did not include a list of performance indicators. Indicators were provided in the
implementation manual, but were only concerned with physical aspects. There were no indicators for the
institutional aspects of the project.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The objectives of the project were not changed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the project were the people directly affected by the disaster and those located
downstream, who could face similar risks. Other beneficiaries included three agencies in charge of
natural risks prevention and management, the National Meteorological Office (ONM), the National
Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) and the National Agency of Water Resources (ANRH), as well as
the local governments in the Algiers metropolitan area. The project was designed to reinforce their
capacity in the area of risk assessment, prevention and management. Finally, the Government treasury
was to benefit from the project through a reduction of the need to provide for costly rehabilitation after
natural disasters.

1.5 Original Components

The project included three components, capacity building at the national level, emergency physical works
and project implementation management.

The first component (total cost estimated at US$9.55 million, of which US$7.65 million to be financed by
the Bank) was designed to reinforce the capacity of national institutions to anticipate natural disasters and
mitigate their consequences. It included studies for the preparation of an action plan, training and
equipment. The objective of the first study was to design and implement an integrated monitoring and

early warning system for meteorological risks in the Algiers region. The second study aimed at a better
understanding of the natural phenomenon that caused the November 2001 disaster. The third study
sought to identify risks and outline solutions to reduce them in the Algiers region. Training was to be
provided to ONM, DGPC and ANRH staff to strengthen their capacity to forecast, prevent and mitigate
natural disasters.    Equipment included radar and information technology for improved weather
forecasting for ONM, the modernization of emergency assistance equipment for DGPC, and computer
software for ANRH.

Under the second component (total cost estimated at US$114.9 million, of which US$80.45 million to be
financed by the Bank), urgent physical works were to be carried out to restore services and facilities in the
areas affected by the floods in Algiers. These works included the construction of about 10 flood retention
basins, corrective adjustments to rivers in the area to reduce the speed of water, tree planting in an area of
about 600 ha, and the construction of about 5,000 housing units and related social facilities for the
families who had been affected by the flood or lived on vulnerable sites in the area.

The total cost of the third component (project implementation management) was estimated at US$0.61
million, of which US$0.15 million to be financed by the Bank).

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised, but with vastly increased oil revenues, in February 2006 the
government requested the cancellation of an amount of US$77.68 million from the loan, thus reducing it
from US$88.45 million to US$10.77 million. The revised loan amount financed a number of contracts,
which were committed prior to December 31, 2005, including for the studies under the first component
(US$3.2 million), part of the reforestation program, and the studies for the 5,000 housing units under the
second component (US$6.91 million), and equipment for the project management unit under the third
component (US$0.17 million). The loan was reduced, but the total cost of the project increased to
US$168.33 million, mostly due to standard improvements in the housing sub-component. In the end, the
Government only disbursed US$5.56 million, and the loan was fully reimbursed earlier than scheduled.
The Government is now financing all initial project components from its own budget. The objectives of
the project and the closing date of the loan were not changed.

The decision of the Government to reduce the loan did not change its commitment to complete the project
as originally defined. The Government recognized the value added of Bank support, particularly its
technical and institutional advice. In line with its decision to reduce its external debt burden, it opted to
use its own resources for the infrastructure components of the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project was quickly prepared. The first mission visited Algeria in December 2001. The project was
appraised in May 2002 and approved in August 2002. The design of the project took into account the
lessons learned during the preparation and early implementation of the Ain Temouchent Emergency
Earthquake Recovery Project approved in June 2000. Key lessons included the importance of a close
inter-agency coordination mechanism at the local and national level, simplified procedures for accelerated

project implementation, and the need to reinforce the capacity of relevant agencies to better prevent and
manage the consequences of natural disasters.

The project was prepared as a response to an emergency. It did not address the emergency situation as
such, however. It sought to reduce the vulnerability of the population to future disasters. The instrument
selected may not have been the best one for the intended purpose. An investment operation would have
been more appropriate for the project development objectives, as they were defined.

The project provided a comprehensive package of assistance to Algeria, including tools for better
preparedness to natural disasters, and emergency works in the areas affected by the flood, to mitigate the
damages suffered by the population and prevent the occurrence of similar losses in the future. It helped
develop a systematic plan to reduce the vulnerability of the area and populations struck by the flood of
November 2001. The project built upon the rapid response provided by the Algerian authorities, who
were able to provide a shelter to most of the people directly affected within a few weeks of the disaster. It
sought to address the issue of unplanned urban development, which had aggravated the consequences of a
centennial rainfall.

A sociological analysis was carried out to better understand the characteristics of the affected and at risk
population, including their activities, income, levels of education, size of households, housing conditions,
and community aspects. The local authorities were closely involved in the analysis. The work done
served to better understand the process of neighborhood densification. The analysis provided the basis for
the resettlement action plan. Three principles were agreed upon in this plan: involuntary resettlement
should be avoided as much as possible, the resettled population should be allowed to rebuild their
livelihoods to a level at least equal to what they had before, and the local population should be consulted
and invited to participate fully in plan implementation.

As indicated above, the project was in line with the interim CAS note and the CAS, which was under
preparation at the time of project processing and was eventually approved in June 2003.

The project was designed as a comprehensive response to a natural disaster, including works for reducing
the vulnerability of the population to flooding in the affected and at risk urban areas, and a series of
activities for improving the capacity of national institutions to prevent and mitigate similar events. The
project design was fully endorsed by the authorities and agencies concerned. It was fully in line with the
objectives of the project, as mentioned in the Government request for assistance after the disaster. In
2003, however, QAG reviewed the quality at entry of the project and concluded that the housing
component was unlikely to bring about expected benefits (see below).

Several agencies were involved in the response to the natural disaster and in the preparation of the project.
Their efforts were well coordinated through two committees, which were established during the
preparation of the project, one at the national level, and the other at the regional level. Social and
environmental issues were adequately addressed.           A sociological analysis was carried out, and an
environmental management framework was prepared, indicating the mitigation measures to be developed
during the course of the project and the linkages with the vulnerability reduction study financed under the
project.

Three risks were identified: implementation delays due to inexperience of implementing agencies and
poor coordination among them, waning commitment of the authorities to enforce the resettlement
strategies, and deterioration in the security situation of the country.

The establishment of the two coordination mechanisms and the preparation of a project implementation
manual before loan approval, as was done for the Ain Temouchent project, helped mitigate the first two

risks. The implementation manual defined precisely the roles of each agency. The relocation plans were
to be prepared in close association with the population concerned as well and close supervision was
planned. The third risk did not materialize, as security conditions in the country improved during project
implementation. On the other hand, the analysis did not mention the risk that the housing component
might not be effective in reaching the intended beneficiaries.         The risk analysis was moderately
satisfactory.

Quality at entry rating by QAG

QAG reviewed the project in June 2003 and rated the quality at entry as marginally satisfactory (3 rating).
The QAG review concluded that the housing program, to which the bulk of project funds was allocated,
carried a high risk. A previous loan in the sector had been closed with an unsatisfactory status, because
housing policies were not effective in reaching the poor and were not sustainable. The QAG review
considered that the housing program was not thoroughly appraised, and the risks were not fully
acknowledged. QAG concluded that the emergency designation of the project should not imply a
lessened conceptual rigor.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation was delayed, because the Government was slow in recruiting staff for the project
coordination unit, and implementing agencies were not familiar with Bank procedures. Initial delays
were aggravated by the mobilization of staff from some of the key implementing agencies during several
months to provide assistance following the Boumerdes earthquake in May 2003. The Bank was also slow
in responding to non objection requests during the first year of project implementation, but took action to
correct this problem by assigning a procurement specialist and a financial management specialist to its
Algiers' office. This, combined with adequate staffing of the project coordination unit, contributed to
accelerating the pace of project implementation.         Bank review of procurement has contributed to
improving the quality of works and services provided.

Local governments have been extensively associated to the studies carried out under the project. They
have been sensitized to the risks of natural disasters and are now better prepared to cope with them.

The decision of the Algerian Government to reduce the amount of the loan had no impact on project
implementation. The authorities at the national and local levels were strongly committed to the project
and were closely involved in its implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The monitoring and evaluation system was insufficiently developed at the appraisal stage due to the
implementation of this operation. The project implementation manual provided a number of indicators,
mostly concerning the physical aspects of the project. The manual discussed activities required for
establishing early warning systems, but did not provide any indicator to assess their sustainability. The
manual remained silent on prevention through a better identification of at-risk areas (which were the
focus of two extensive studies financed by the project), or on effective integration of risk analysis in the
planning system and the regulatory framework. However, it is worth noting that during supervision
missions, these aspects were extensively reviewed and discussed with the Steering Committee and
executing agencies. They all became aware of the need to continue the efforts made to define and
implement of an institutional framework, which would better address natural disaster risks in the Algiers
region.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The preparation and implementation of the relocation plan was prepared in close association with the
population concerned. Six easily accessible sites were identified and the infrastructure and housing units
designed at those sites will eventually be of better quality than in the damaged and at risk areas. The
work done by design firms was extensively reviewed by the two sociologists hired by the project
coordination unit and by the local consultant recruited by the Bank office.

Following the recruitment of the procurement specialist and the financial management specialist in the
Bank office in Algiers, fiduciary issues were appropriately addressed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation / Next Phase

The risks of natural disasters, including floods and earthquakes, are high in Algeria. It is important
therefore for Algeria to develop and implement early warning systems and to build up its capacities to
cope with the consequences of major natural or industrial disasters. Specific construction regulations are
required to prevent major disasters due to earthquakes. These regulations are yet to be fully developed
and enforced, however.

3. Assessment of Outcome

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the project were highly relevant to the country situation and its development priorities at
the time of project approval. They are highly relevant now, as well. The high occurrence of natural
disasters has sensitized the Algerian authorities to the need of a broad strategy aimed at reducing urban
vulnerability. The project has helped them put in place a series of measures for that purpose. Coming
after a number of post disaster reconstruction projects supported by the Bank, the project under review
sought to put emphasis on improved risk prevention and management.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The first objective was to reduce the vulnerability of the urban zones most affected by the November
2001 flooding. This objective will be substantially achieved when works under the project are completed.
The early warning system is in place. Reforestation is underway to reduce the risks of flooding in the
Bouzareah range and in downstream areas. The bidding process for the civil works, including flood
retention basins, is about to be completed. Construction of 4000 housing units is underway and the first
units are expected to be available in late 2007. Thanks to the extensive work carried out during project
implementation, it is highly likely that the intended beneficiaries, including the victims of the flood and
vulnerable families, will actually move to these units. Local authorities have been sensitized to the need
for improved management of urban areas and increased attention to environment issues. The contribution
of the Bank helped the Government improve the design of the works, which are now being implemented
by the Government with its own resources.

The second objective was to improve the ability of Algerian institutions at the national level to cope with
natural disasters. This objective has been achieved through the strengthening of three national agencies.
They have now the human and technical resources to address the consequences of severe flooding and
other natural disasters. Their capacity to cope with earthquakes had been already reinforced through the
Ain Temouchent project. Early warning and monitoring systems have been developed and are in place.
Detailed vulnerability assessments were prepared and are guiding city planning and investment decisions

in the Algiers region. Also, the recommendations resulting from the various vulnerability studies are
being incorporated into the "Schéma Directeur de l'Aménagement Urbain (SDAU)", and the land use and
coastal management plans for the metropolitan area of Algiers. Finally, local authorities have been
sensitized on ways to address natural calamities efficiently. The Bank's contribution, both financial and
technical, was essential in the satisfactory achievement of this objective.

3.3 Efficiency

Rate of return: not applicable. It is important to mention, however, that the cost in human lives and
physical damages due to the flash flood was much higher than the cost of the project. Improved
prevention and mitigation of natural disasters is significantly less costly than reconstruction after damages
are incurred.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The operation is rated as moderately satisfactory

The project provided a comprehensive response to the problems created by the catastrophic flooding of
November 2001. Tools have been developed and early warning systems are now in place. The capacity
for rapid intervention in case of natural disasters has been strengthened. Plans to reduce the vulnerability
of urban zones in the Algiers region have been prepared. Works for reducing the vulnerability of the
urban zones most affected and at-risk are underway. Steps are being taken to improve the preparedness of
communes to natural disasters through the establishment of communal units for risk management. While
the project did not seek to reform the housing policies of the Government, it contributed to a better
understanding of the housing situation of the affected families through a comprehensive sociological
study that was carried out in a participatory way. The recommendations of this study have been now
internalized. Because of the delays in project implementation, however, institutional arrangements for the
effective use of instruments developed with project support need to be further reinforced. Moreover,
these arrangements should be extended to other urban areas in the country.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The impact of the project on living standards improvement of targeted population will be substantial.
Their living conditions, which were extremely precarious before the project, will indeed be much
improved following completion of the housing program. Women and children will benefit from a greatly
improved and secure environment.         Great attention has been devoted to provide up-to-date social
infrastructure.

The identification of vulnerable areas and their protection will prevent poor families from squatting in
these areas. An inventory of buildings at risk has been carried out in the project area and works are
planned to reinforce them. An analysis of inadequate housing schemes has been completed, with the
objective of relocating all people living there. More generally, the early warning systems developed with
project support will ensure that the people most vulnerable to natural disasters, who are also among the
poorest, are better protected.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

This project has contributed to the establishment of a sustainable coordination framework for disaster
management and prevention among agencies and across sectors. The most important impact of the

 Vulnerability Reduction Project

project has been the sensitization of the national and local authorities to the need for reducing risks related
to natural disasters through a better preparedness and an improved management of urban areas. Tools
developed and equipment provided with project support will allow agencies concerned to better prevent
and cope with natural disasters. These results should now be extended to other urban areas.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Though the project was not designed to make a contribution to housing reform, it helped the authorities
improve their approach to the resettlement of vulnerable groups. It is, therefore, very likely that the
intended beneficiaries will be resettled into the new housing units, because of the participatory studies
conducted with project support. Also, pressures in the housing sector have abated during the project
implementation period, thanks to a large construction program sponsored by the Government.

Another outcome of the project is its success in reinforcing coordination among a number of entities.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk is rated as moderate.

Coordination among agencies in charge of mitigating the impact of natural disasters improved over time.
It is now well established and is likely to stay that way, at least in the Algiers wilaya, because of the
strong leadership of the governor. The importance of strong leadership from the local authorities is well
understood. There was concern that the commitment of the authorities to the project's objectives would
diminish once the immediate consequences of the disaster had been taken care of. This was not the case,
however. Repeated occurrence of natural disasters is a constant reminder to the authorities that they have
to be well prepared. With project support, the authorities are doing their best to resettle the population,
which had been affected by the flood or were at risk. They have also done their best to reduce the
vulnerability of urban settlements in the larger area affected by the flood.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The Bank responded rapidly to the government request for assistance. The project was well designed and
in line with the country assistance strategy. Lessons from a previous experience with a natural disaster in
Algeria, the Ain Temouchent project, were taken into account. The capacity building requirements were
well assessed. The emergency works were adequately prepared. A sociological survey was carried out to
help with the preparation of the resettlement plan. The project addressed the urgent needs for assistance
of the poorest segments of the population of the greater Algiers area. The environmental aspects were
carefully looked into. Bank performance at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory as confirmed by
QAG, due mainly to the lack of effective measures to mitigate the risk of the housing component.

 Vulnerability Reduction Project

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

During the first year of project implementation, supervision was inadequate in view of the serious
weaknesses in the institutional arrangements.      Long delays in responding to no-objection requests
contributed to slow implementation. The Bank team leader was changed and supervision improved.
Supervision missions visited Algeria regularly. They were appropriately staffed. Conclusions and
recommendations of supervision missions were adequately communicated to the Borrower. To support
project implementation, the Bank team was further reinforced by experienced local consultants. The
Bank assigned an architect, a sociologist, a procurement specialist and a financial management to help
with the fiduciary and social aspects of the project. The local team was proactive and provided much
appreciated assistance in solving problems.        This included reviewing the technical and design
specifications for the housing projects and guiding the preparation, by the Borrower, of the social
assessment and resettlement action plan. Great care was taken in the selection of consulting firms and in
the monitoring of their work. This helped ensure a good quality of services provided.

As recommended by the "Quality at Entry Assessment (QA6)", Bank missions discussed the risks facing
the project and defined with the Borrower possible ways of mitigating them, and particularly the risk that
the housing program does not reach targeted population. Lessons learned from the implementation of the
previous Ain-Temouchent operation were fully incorporated into the project implementation
arrangements.

Until end-2004, the project was rated as satisfactory for both development objectives and implementation
progress.   In 2005 and 2006, the ratings were downgraded to moderately satisfactory in view of
continuing implementation delays. Twice the ratings for implementation progress were downgraded to
moderately unsatisfactory, but there were no changes in the ratings for development objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The Bank team was proactive during project preparation and implementation. It helped the Government
formulate a strategy aimed at reducing urban vulnerability to natural disasters and build up capacity. The
authorities have fully internalized the results of the work done under Bank supervision. They have
expressed their satisfaction for the technical support provided by the Bank throughout project preparation
and supervision. Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory, because of insufficient attention
to sector policies in designing the housing component and inadequate supervision early on.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The performance of the Borrower is rated as moderately satisfactory because of the delays in project
implementation and in reaching the project's objectives.

 Vulnerability Reduction Project

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

After a slow start, all implementing agencies, including the Development Bank of Algeria, showed
improved commitment to the project by making its activities a clear priority. Also, Government
familiarity with Bank procurement procedures was initially limited. Project implementation was subjected
to further delays as the staff of most of these agencies was mobilized to provide emergency rescue and
relief following the Boumerdes earthquake of 2003 and, almost a year was lost as a result. However,
cooperation with Bank teams was good and the fiduciary aspects were adequately addressed with reports
received on time.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The Borrower has provided the resources required for project implementation and has demonstrated a
strong commitment to the objectives of the project throughout its preparation and implementation, beside
some weaknesses during a limited period after Boumerdes earthquake. Delays in mobilizing staff to start
project implementation had an impact on timely achievement of the project's objectives, however.
Furthermore, weak capacity in the Project Management Unit (PMU) continued to be a problem
throughout project implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

The attention of decision makers should be focused on preventive activities to reduce the vulnerability of
urban areas to natural disasters. The impact of the torrential rains of November 2001 would have been
much less dramatic, had the Government taken a number of measures to reduce the risks of flooding in
the Bouzareah range and implemented existing regulations concerning urban development.                  The
Government should extend to other urban areas the measures implemented with project support in the
greater Algiers metropolitan area.
Uncontrolled urban development, including the illegal occupation of sensitive areas, aggravated the
consequences of the disaster of November 2001. Urban development plans should include appropriate
measures for preventing severe damages due to natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods.

Annual budgets of agencies in charge of risk prevention and management should include adequate and
well identified amounts for natural disaster prevention. Similarly, budgets of local governments should
include annual allocations for reducing urban vulnerability.

Using the case studies of the Ain Temouchent and the Urban Natural Hazard Vulnerability projects, the
Government should sensitize local authorities and technicians to the need to enforce preventive measures.
Special training courses should be organized in universities on the prevention of natural disasters.

Local authorities should be fully involved in providing relief after natural disasters, as was the case
following the November 2001 floods. Strong coordination of local efforts and simplified procedures are
required. Standard documents for rapid recruitment of consultants and contractors following natural
disasters should be prepared and made available to agencies concerned.

In view of the frequency of natural disasters in Algeria, the CAS should have included an operation aimed
at reducing the vulnerability of the country to such disasters. The operation under review was designed in

the aftermath of a disaster as an emergency operation, but did not address the emergency situation. It
supported activities which should typically be taken before disasters strike.

Over the past decades, the Bank has invested a large amount of resources in Algeria and other countries
for natural disaster management. It is suggested that an evaluation of such support be carried out. The
focus should be on whether lessons from past experience have been internalized.

           Projet: « Réduction de la vulnérabilité des Zones Urbaines de la Wilaya d'Alger
                                    aux Catastrophes naturelles »

         OBJET : A/S Observations Rapport d'Achèvement du Projet
                    de la BIRD



                    Suite à l'examen de votre envoi relatif au rapport d'achèvement
         du projet daté du 05 juin 2007, nous émettons des réserves sur les points
         suivants :


                Point 1.1 « contexte à l'évaluation »:

                Paragraphe 1 : « ...mais n'ont pas eu pour effet de réduire de façon
         significative la pauvreté. Environ 20% de la population algérienne est en
         dessous du seuil de la pauvreté et les conditions de vie ne se sont pas vraiment
         améliorées ».

                Il nous semble que lors de l'évaluation de ce projet, l'aspect « pauvreté et
         seuil de pauvreté » n'a pas été abordé.

                 Paragraphe2 : « le facteur principal qui a aggravé ce désastre était le
         développement urbain massif incontrôlé, dépourvu de solides règles de
         construction ».

                  Cette affirmation est infondée. Il est souhaité de la supprimer du texte.

               « Les programmes de logements sociaux ont contribués à la vulnérabilité
                urbaine »

Algeria                                          - 20 -                                   ICR
Urban Natural Hazard                                                                 June 2007
Vulnerability Reduction Project

                C'est une fausse affirmation car les logements sociaux réalisés par
       l'état Algérien ont permis de reloger prés de 2000 familles au lendemain de la
       catastrophe constaté même par les experts de la Banque en décembre 2001

       Enfin, pour le point 1.1, nous recommandons de se référer au document
       d'évaluation déjà approuvé par le Conseil d'Administration de la Banque
       Mondiale et le Gouvernement.

              Point 1.4 « Principaux bénéficiaires » :

              Paragraphe 1- « les bénéficiaires principaux du projet étaient des
       personnes directement affectées par le désastre et celles habitant dans les zones
       en aval, qui étaient soumises à des risques identiques. Ces personnes étaient
       parmi les plus pauvres..... » .

            Il est souhaité de supprimer la phrase en gras étant donné que le désastre a
       touché toute la population fréquentant cette zone.

             Point 2-1, 3-5 c et 5-1 :
             « A plusieurs reprises est mentionnés l'expression risque que les
          bénéficiaires ciblés ne seront pas réellement relogés dans les 5000
          logements »
              C'est un préjugé non fondé, la BIRD remet en cause les principes d'un
       fondement sur lequel l'état Algérien a mis toute un processus et un dispositif
       pour la réduction de cette vulnérabilité en ciblant les populations les plus
       touchés,nous demandant de retiré cette expression


              Point 2.1 « Préparation du projet, conception et qualité initiale » :

              Paragraphe 8 « Un affaiblissement de l'engagement des autorités après
       que les conséquences immédiates de la catastrophe aient été traitées, le faible
       engagement à mettre en oeuvre la stratégie de relogement, y compris des
       changements de conditions de relogement des populations concernées et la
       détérioration de la situation sécuritaire du pays ».

              Il nous semble que cette affirmation et infondée et de ce fait, nous
       proposons de la supprimer du texte.

              Point 2.2 « Exécution » :

              Paragraphe 2 « l'utilisation des procédures de la Banque a permis une
       large participation de firmes et de recruter des bureaux d'études renommés, ce
       qui n'aurait sans doute pas été le cas si les procédures locales avaient été
       appliquées ».

Vulnerability Reduction Project

         L'argument avancé par la Banque Mondiale nous paraît infondé et de ce
fait nous proposons sa suppression.

         Point 2.3 « Suivi et évaluation (M&E), conception exécution
                        et utilisation » :

         Paragraphe 1 « le système de suivi évaluation du projet n'a pas été
suffisamment préparé au moment de l'évaluation du projet .......... »

         Nous proposons de rajouter à la fin de cette phrase « en raison de
l'urgence de la mise en place de cette opération. ».


         Point 2.5 « Phase post achèvement /Etape suivante » :

         Paragraphe 1 « les activités industrielles, d'exploitation pétrolière et de
transport font aussi courir des risques importants ».

         Cette phrase, à notre sens, n'a aucun lien avec le projet en question objet
du rapport d'achèvement.


     Point 3-5 ­a : Impact sur la pauvreté, aspects des genres et développement
social
       « Les bénéficiaires constituent les couches les plus pauvres du grand
Alger »
         Sur quel critère de détermination ? (Expression à retirer)

  3-5 ( c) Autre résultat et impact non prévu
     « A réussi à obtenir une coordination étroite entre un grand nombre
     d'organisme ce qui a toujours représenté un défit pour l'Algérie »
    La coordination intersectorielle et intercommunale existait avant la naissance
du projet.

4- Evaluation du risque
       « Les dommages causés par l'inondation ont été amplifiés en raison en
       particulier du peu d'attention des autorités aux problèmes aigus dans le
       secteur urbain »
  C'est une fausse affirmation car la Wilaya d'Alger est dotée d'un PDEAU et de
POS et d'un arsenal juridique en matière d'instrument d'urbanisme.
(Expression à retirer)

5-2 Performance de l'emprunteur
     « La cellule de coordination du projet a souffert de certaines Faiblesse
   durant toute l'exécution du projet ».
  Ce n'est pas le cas, la Banque a remarqué que le premier chef de projet de la
BIRD avait causé tout un retard dans la non objection, ce n'est qu'une année
après avec le changement du chef de projet de la BIRD et la mise en place d'une
cellule de coordination au niveau de la BIRD, qui a été demandé par la partie
Algérienne, que les choses ont commencé à devenir de plus en plus claire.
L'emprunteur a toujours montré sa volonté et son vouloir faire pour ce projet
malgré certaines faiblesses enregistré en matière de non objection de la part de
la BIRD.exprimé et révisé

         D'ailleurs, les demandes de Non Objection de la part de la partie
algérienne étaient transmises à temps

      A cet effet, je vous demande de retirer de la publication les affirmations sur
lesquelles nous avons porté nos réserves.
