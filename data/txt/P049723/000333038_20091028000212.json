Due to a deterioration of organizational\n            structures in the state and collective farms, a large\n            reduction in subsidies, and shifts in relative prices for\n            outputs and inputs, agricultural production declined\n            significantly. The rapidly deteriorating irrigation and\n            drainage systems further reduced agricultural output.\n            Despite the complex situation, irrigated agriculture,\n            together with livestock, continued in the 1990s to be a\n            major component in the Kyrgyz Republic's economy,\n            accounting for 45 percent of GDP on average as well as 43\n            percent of employment. The next step was to rehabilitate and\n            modernize on-farm irrigation infrastructure within the\n            former large farms so that the supplied water could be used\n            more efficiently. To ensure adequate maintenance afterwards,\n            the government sought to promote the development and\n            strengthening of water users associations (WUAs) as the\n            critical organization responsible for on-farm irrigation\n            operation and maintenance. Support to the government to\n            address these sector issues was provided under the On-Farm\n            Irrigation Project (Project I), and is being continued under\n            the Second On-Farm Irrigation Project (Project II)."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
