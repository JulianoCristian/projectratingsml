Some lessons\n            learned included: good construction supervision work is\n            essential for satisfactory outcome. In particular, strict\n            supervision for quality of works is required and\n            disqualification of non-performing contractors should be\n            applied. Another lesson is that institution strengthening is\n            a long process and should be given enough resources, regular\n            coaching, expertise, and, above all, time. It also requires\n            institutional support to the Water Users Association (WUA)\n            process to be embodied in government institutions in order\n            to secure its sustainability. WUA command areas should be\n            seen as a single unit from the water management improvement\n            point-of-view. Much attention should be paid to requirements\n            of regulatory structures such as intakes, division boxes,\n            culverts, outlets, cross regulators, energy dissipaters, and\n            flow meters, which will allow WUAs to distribute water among\n            member farmers in a more reliable and timely manner. On-farm\n            canal lining, which is expensive, should be used only for\n            those sections of the system where it will be technically\n            required to reduce high seepage losses."}, "docdt": "2008-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
