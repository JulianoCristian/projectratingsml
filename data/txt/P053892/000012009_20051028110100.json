Often time, a project implementation\n            imbedded in the Ministry of Health (MOH), rather than\n            assigned to an independent project implementation unit\n            (PIU), provides for better coordination, and increases\n            ownership and likelihood of sustainability. Upon designing\n            implementation structures, it is important to ensure that\n            responsibility for implementation of each sub-component is\n            clearly delineated, and, if a PIU structure is used, staff\n            from relevant departments of the MOH be assigned\n            responsibility for each component. Project design therefore,\n            should be kept simple in an unstable political environment,\n            and should match the client's implementation capacity,\n            which is easily compromised under difficult political\n            circumstances. Notwithstanding, with complex health\n            management information system (HMIS) projects, it is\n            essential that the client have capacity to manage the\n            process, while programming and software development should\n            be outsourced to a specialized reputable firm. Clinical\n            guidelines are likely to be more effective if they are\n            complemented by mechanisms to promote adherence, as well as\n            incentives for compliance."}, "docdt": "2005-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
