affordable housing to\n            low-income families; (ii) to strengthen BEV (Banco\n            Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda - Ecuadorian Housing Bank) and\n            JNV (Junta Nacional de la Vivienda - Ecuadorian Housing\n            Bank), which are the two major institutions in the housing\n            sector; and (iii) to support the expansion of low-cost\n            housing in secondary cities. About 50 percent of project\n            investments will directly benefit families with incomes the\n            absolute poverty level and most of the estimated 81,000\n            beneficiaries are individuals who have previously not owned\n            housing. The project includes four major components: new\n            housing, urban upgrading, community facilities, and home\n            improvement loans. The project also includes funds for\n            project management and some technical assistance for the\n            implementing institutions."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
