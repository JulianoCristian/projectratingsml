SECT. INV.

Lessons learned include: first, urban\n            transport reform is intrinsically difficult to achieve as\n            demonstrated by this project. It highlights the importance\n            of setting up realistic development objective in accordance\n            with the agreed time frame. Indeed, expecting to carry out\n            these specific reforms in Tunisia over the initially planned\n            time span of five years, whereas key components were not yet\n            designed when the loan was approved, was probably\n            overoptimistic. Nevertheless, it was reasonable to expect\n            achieving them over the eight and plus years that the\n            project eventually lasted. Second, setting up new\n            structures/institutional arrangements for transport at the\n            regional level is complex and sensitive, touching on\n            decentralization issues going well beyond urban transport.\n            If there are lingering doubts within government on the\n            rationale of setting up new structures whereas existing ones\n            may possibly be used, the challenges will be even greater.\n            Third, reforming public (state-owned) transport enterprises\n            is difficult and sensitive, if not more than reforming\n            public enterprises in many other sectors. Particularly so,\n            if their financial situation and hence capacity to invest\n            for future productivity gains depends heavily on tariffs set\n            or approved by the Government and contributions from the\n            State when they have significant public service obligations.\n            Having a fair assessment of their performance is paramount\n            for the dialogue with the Government on reforming and\n            supporting those enterprises. Benchmarking their performance\n            regularly with strong performers of other countries should\n            be carried out regularly. Fourth, the contractual\n            arrangements between a transport enterprise and its large\n            captive client could turn into difficult issues, even more\n            so when the client is a major exporter like the phosphate\n            mining company selling in a highly competitive world markets\n            and the transporter is the state-owned railway company.\n            Finally, the advanced availability of design studies and the\n            harmonization of clear procurement procedures from the\n            outset of project implementation are critical for a timely\n            implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
