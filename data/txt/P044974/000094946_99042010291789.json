development areas and\n            facilitate privatization. The objectives include the\n            preparation of civil service reforms and a continued effort\n            for improving government revenues, with a focus on public\n            expenditures, prioritizing on education and health sectors.\n            Public enterprise reforms are also considered, mainly in the\n            infrastructure sectors. The Project will benefit the\n            country's development strategy, with a strong growth\n            performance, thus contributing to poverty alleviation.\n            Increased public services in the social and infrastructure\n            sectors, as well as the enhancement of the rule of law, will\n            support economic stabilization and contribute to the private\n            sector development. However, several risks are foreseen. On\n            the political front, despite the reconciliation process,\n            unrest and military challenges are risks to be considered;\n            on the social front, risks due to the opposition of\n            influential civil service unions still exist; and,\n            weaknesses on the implementation capacity front, could\n            hinder the program. Reliability on the Capacity Building for\n            Economic Management Project will mitigate this risk."}, "docdt": "1999-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
