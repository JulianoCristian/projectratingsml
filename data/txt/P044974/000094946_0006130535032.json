project outcome is rated\n            satisfactory with project sustainability as likely. Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are adjudged\n            satisfactory. The three Structural Adjustment Credits were\n            fully consistent with the 1996 Country Assistance Strategy.\n            But the new approach proposed in the 1996 CAS, consisting of\n            moving towards joint funding by the donor community and the\n            Government of a public expenditure program, was too\n            ambitious in a post-conflict situation with this\n            government's limited capacity and track record. The\n            proposal for single-tranche adjustment credits tied with the\n            budget cycle was appropriate given the circumstances. But\n            the second and third credits should have been better\n            anchored in public expenditure reviews carried out jointly\n            with the donor community. Through the divestiture program\n            process, the government gained useful experience and is more\n            equipped to handle large privatizations. The technical and\n            steering committees established for the reform program and\n            its components helped establish a consensus among\n            stakeholders in Chad; the top government officials were kept\n            adequately informed and were able to make required\n            decisions. Little progress was made during program\n            implementation in the areas of civil service reform,\n            reinsertion of demobilized soldiers, and cotton sector\n            reform because these areas were highly sensitive politically."}, "docdt": "2000-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
