outcome is unsatisfactory,\n            sustainability unlikely, and the institutional development\n            impact negligible, in addition to unsatisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank, and Borrower. Among the key\n            lessons, it is once again specified that structural reforms\n            not only require the analytical capacity to propose, and\n            accept changes, but also the capacity to implement them,\n            thus implementation plans need to be developed in relation\n            to the capacity of the agencies undertaking reforms,\n            therefore, project design should be simple to accommodate\n            the borrowers limited, and weak institutional, and\n            administrative capacity. Moreover, project implementation\n            involving land tenure reform, require not only strong\n            political commitment, but clear operational, and sustainable\n            institutional capacity design, which should be tested prior\n            to large scale implementation. Additionally, the excessive\n            salary disparities between project staff, and those from\n            other agencies involved in the same development process as\n            the project, leads to inadequate responsiveness, and\n            non-compliance with targets, or project objectives. And, if\n            co-financing is not assured in the timeframe required, the\n            project should be redesigned, with additional funding\n            available to finance needed activities until donor support\n            is obtained. Finally, assessment of the regulatory framework\n            should be reviewed up-front at project preparation,\n            particularly as in this case, since the decree implementing\n            land nationalization should have been passed as a loan conditionality."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
