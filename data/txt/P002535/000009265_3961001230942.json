will increase and diversify\n            agricultural production through privatizing the\n            publicly-owned agricultural estate sector and promoting\n            smallholder production.  Privatization will increase\n            production efficiency, eliminate the financial losses of the\n            estate sector and provide incentives to diversify production\n            into food and other crops. Secondary objectives of the\n            project are rural poverty alleviation, diversified and\n            sustainable growth in agriculture, and environmental\n            protection. The rights of women to obtain land and access to\n            agricultural support services are guaranteed under the land\n            distribution criteria and procedures.  The project includes\n            the following components: (a) land distribution; (b) labor\n            reduction and economic support measures; (c) operational and\n            management reform of the cocoa sector; and (d) agricultural\n            sector administration and support services."}, "docdt": "1991-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
