Project will\n            assist with the implementation of legislated reforms in\n            forest organization, and management, expected to increase\n            revenues, improve forest management, and enhance\n            biodiversity conservation through participatory approaches\n            in forest land use planning. Component 1 aims at\n            accelerating the implementation of new legal, institutional\n            and economic frameworks. New legal and institutional\n            frameworks, will support the setting of a forest management\n            regime, ensuring the sustainable use, and protection of\n            forest resources, while at the same time pave the way to an\n            autonomous, and self-financing forest sector. Supporting the\n            sector's institutional reforms will assist in work\n            implementation, to support the establishment of the newly\n            created Forest Offices. Technical assistance, and training\n            will be focused on establishing a forest management,\n            financial monitoring system, and basic office equipment, to\n            enable communication, and coordination; and, in addition,\n            operational support will be provided to forest guards, and\n            inspectors, as well as for procurement of, and training in\n            the use of field equipment to ensure compliance with the new\n            forest law, improve transparency, and forest governance.\n            Component 2, Strengthening of Technical Capacity for\n            Sustainable Forest Management, will facilitate the\n            implementation of economically environmentally, sound forest\n            management, and, will set up technical instruments, critical\n            to ensure monitoring and sustainable uses of forest\n            endowment, forest management and forest certification.\n            Component 3, Promoting Biodiversity and Forest Conservation,\n            will address, and respond to the governments commitments, in\n            leveraging the country's biodiversity into protected\n            areas. Component 4, Project implementation, Monitoring and\n            Evaluation, will be managed by two small Project\n            Implementation Units (PIUs), responsible for forestry during\n            project implementation, including procurement, disbursement,\n            accounting and coordination, and, will also strengthen donor\n            coordination regarding the national forest agenda."}, "docdt": "2003-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
