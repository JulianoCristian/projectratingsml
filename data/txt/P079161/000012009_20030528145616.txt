Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
assist 
with 
the implementation 
of 
legislated 
reforms 
in 
forest 
organization and 
management, 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
increase revenues 
from 
forest 
resources, 
improve 
forest 
management, 
and 
enhance 
biodiversity 
conservation 
through participatory 
approaches 
in 
forest 
land 
use 
planning. 
In 
addition, the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
improve 
ownership 
of 
the 
reform 
process at 
the canton level. 
Although 
the 
two 
entities (Federation 
of 
Bosnia 
and Herzegovina 
(Federation); 
and 
Republika 
Srpska 
(RS)) 
are at 
different 
stages 
of 
readiness 
to 
implement 
the 
reforms, 
the 
project 
will 
be 
active 
in 
both 
of 
them, 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
reform 
momentum 
developed under the closed Forest 
Project 
is 
maintained. 
Importantly, the 
lessons 
of 
institutional 
reform 
developed 
under the project 
could 
also 
be 
relevant 
for 
other 
sectors.

Strategic Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) 
goal 
supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
24978 
(Progress 
Report) 
The 
project 
would 
address 
two 
of 
the 
objectives 
outlined 
in 
the 
CAS: 
(i) 
strengthening 
institutions 
and 
governance; 
and 
(ii) 
fostering private 
sector-led 
growth 
and employment. 
The project 
will 
contribute 
to 
strengthening 
institutions and 
improved 
governance 
by 
helping 
to 
implement 
the 
recently 
reformed 
legislative 
framework 
for 
the forest 
sector, 
as 
well 
as 
improving 
the 
operational capacity 
for 
forest 
planning 
and 
inspection. 
To 
contribute 
to 
the 
second objective, 
the 
project 
would 
support 
the 
reform 
of 
forest 
management, 
which 
will 
strengthen 
the 
role 
of 
the 
private 
sector. 
The project 
recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
sustainable use 
of 
forest 
resources 
to 
employment and 
the 
development 
of 
rural 
areas, 
as 
outlined 
in 
the 
current 
I-PRSP. 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
11/12/2002 
Since 
BiH 
recently 
ratified 
the 
Convention 
on 
Biological 
Diversity (CBD) 
and 
is 
now 
eligible 
for 
GEF 
finding, 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
provide 
the basis 
for 
a 
follow-up 
GEF 
operation.  Such 
an 
operation 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
focus 
on 
forest and montane 
biodiversity 
conservation, 
including 
development 
of 
a 
network 
of 
protected 
areas, 
participatory 
land 
use 
planning 
in 
protected 
areas 
and 
support 
to 
biodiversity 
in 
the 
forest 
production 
landscape.

Main 
sector 
issues 
and Government 
strategy: 
Background 
The 
Forests 
of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Forest 
resources 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
(BiH) 
are 
amongst the 
richest 
in 
Europe 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
extent and 
variety relative 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
country, 
covering 
almost 
50% 
of 
the 
land 
area, 
and 
as 
such, 
are 
one 
of 
Bosnia’s 
main 
natural 
resources. 
This 
compares 
with 
24% 
for 
pasture land, 
much 
of 
it 
close 
to 
forest 
areas, 
and 
only 
10% 
for 
arable 
land. 
58% 
of 
BiH’s 
population 
of 
estimated 
3.5 
million 
live 
in 
rural 
areas, 
and 
for 
them 
forests 
are 
an important 
source 
of 
employment 
(in 
forest 
industries), energy 
(fuelwood 
for 
heating, 
largely 
from 
forest 
residues) 
and 
recreation. 
Forests 
are 
also 
a 
source 
of 
non-timber forest products 
(NTFPs), 
including 
mushrooms, 
berries 
and 
herbs. 
Hunting, 
mostly 
quite 
well-organized, 
has 
provided 
additional 
revenues, 
while 
the beauty 
of 
Bosnia’s 
forest 
and 
mountain 
landscapes 
has, 
and 
can 
again, 
provide 
substantial 
job 
opportunities 
for local 
people 
from 
tourism. 
The 
forests also have 
important 
watershed 
protection 
values 
for 
much 
of 
the 
middle 
and 
lower 
Danube. 
Furthermore, 
since 
Bosnia 
has 
quite 
a 
low 
rural 
population 
density 
- 
only 
43 
persons 
per 
square 
km, 
lower 
than 
any 
of 
the other 
Balkan 
countries 
- 
with 
sound management 
its 
forest 
“use” 
values 
(from 
timber 
and 
other 
products) 
can 
provide 
income 
for local 
people 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
its 
“non-use” 
values 
(from 
watershed 
protection 
and 
global 
ecosystem 
values) 
can also 
be 
protected. 
About 
half 
the 
growing 
stock 
of 
forests 
is 
coniferous, 
notably 
fir, 
spruce 
and 
pine 
species. 
The 
main 
broadleaved 
species 
are 
oak 
and 
beech. 
About 
80% 
of 
forest 
and 
other 
wooded 
land 
is 
State-owned. 
The 
remainder 
is 
owned 
by 
a 
large 
number 
of 
individual 
private 
owners. 
In 
state-owned 
production 
forest, 
the 
growing 
stock 
per 
hectare 
is 
estimated 
at 
220 
m3, 
the 
average 
annual 
volume 
increase 
is 
about 
4.6 
m3hectare 
(ha), 
while 
the 
average 
harvested 
volume 
per 
hectare 
reaches 
4.2 
m3ha. 
Nearly 
three-fifths 
of 
the 
forests 
can 
be 
characterized 
as 
production 
forests, 
while 
about 40% 
are 
not 
available 
for wood 
supply. 
Areas 
under 
the latter category 
are 
either classified 
as 
“uncovered 
and 
barren 
lands”, 
are 
economically 
inaccessible, 
or 
fulfill 
other functions 
such 
as 
the 
protection 
of 
watersheds 
and 
other 
critical 
ecosystems. 
Additionally, 
forest accessibility 
is 
aggravated 
due 
to 
a 
low 
forest 
road 
density 
(about 
7-8 
km/I,OOO 
ha) 
compared 
with 
an 
average 
in 
Western 
Europe 
which 
is 
three 
to 
four 
times 
higher. 
In 
addition, 
about 
200,000 
ha 
of 
forests 
are 
contaminated 
by 
mines and therefore 
inaccessible. 
At 
present, 
forest certification, 
which would 
provide 
independent 
third-party 
assurances 
to 
consumers 
that 
forest 
management 
satisfies 
environmentally, 
socially and economically 
responsible 
standards, 
is 
not 
seen 
as 
a 
priority 
in 
forest management 
and 
planning. 
A 
main 
reason 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
raw 
forest 
products 
are 
sold 
almost 
exclusively 
to local 
wood 
processing 
industries, 
which 
currently 
do not 
require 
forest 
certificates. 
However, 
since 
it 
is 
expected that 
BiH’s 
forest 
sector 
will 
increase 
its 
forest 
product 
supply 
to 
international 
markets, 
forest 
certification 
will 
become 
an 
issue 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
BiH’s 
forests 
are 
rich 
in 
biodiversity 
terms, 
although 
only 
0.55% 
of 
the 
territory 
is 
formally 
protected. 
There 
are 3 1 
protected 
areas 
(IUCN 
Categories 
I1 
to 
V), 
and 
the 
National 
Park 
of 
Sutjeska 
includes 
one 
of 
the 
last 
remnants 
of 
primary 
forests 
in 
southern Europe. 
Most 
forests 
are 
classified 
as 
semi-natural. 
As 
the 
above 
demonstrates, 
forests represent 
a 
valuable 
resource 
to 
the 
nation 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
through 
proper 
utilization 
can 
supply 
valuable 
inputs, 
such 
as 
employment 
and 
export 
income, 
and 
assist 
in 
the 
reconstruction 
of 
BiH, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Exports 
of 
BiH 
construction materials and 
high-quality 
furniture 
generated 
an 
export value 
of 
about 
US 
$250 
million 
prior 
to 
the 
war, 
an important 
source 
of 
employment. 
However, 
the war, 
between 
1992 
and 
1995, 
as 
well 
as 
subsequent 
unregulated 
development, 
resulted 
in 
heavy 
damage 
at 
all 
levels 
(according 
to 
current 
estimates, 
direct 
war 
damage 
to 
the forest 
sector 
amounts 
to 
some 
US 
$2 
billion).

Recently 
finalized 
reports clearly note 
the 
importance 
of 
forests 
and the 
wood 
processing 
sector. 
The 
draft 
PRSP, 
currently 
under preparation 
by 
the 
BiH 
authorities, 
identifies 
issues 
addressed 
by 
the 
current, 
and 
envisaged, 
project, 
as 
prerequisites 
to 
increase 
the economic capacity 
for 
sustainable 
forest 
management, 
enhancing 
the 
contribution 
that forests 
make 
to local 
livelihoods, and 
maintaining 
and 
increasing forest biodiversity. 
Ultimately, 
this 
would 
lead 
to 
increased 
employment 
in 
this 
sector 
and 
the 
development 
of 
rural 
areas, 
which 
would 
in 
turn 
result 
in 
measurable 
economic 
advantages. 
The recently 
completed 
National 
Environmental 
Action 
Plan 
(NEAP) 
identifies 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
rural 
areas 
together 
with 
the 
improvement 
of 
environmental 
management 
and 
the 
protection 
of 
biological 
landscape 
diversity 
as 
priorities, 
which 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
new 
project. 
First 
Forestry Project. 
Through 
an emergency 
investment 
operation, 
the 
BiH 
Forestry Project 
(approved 
in 
1998), 
the 
World 
Bank 
contributed successfully 
to 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
stabilization 
of 
the 
BiH 
forest 
sector. 
The 
Project's 
Implementation 
Progress 
and 
Achievement 
of 
Development 
Objectives were 
both 
rated 
Satisfactory. 
The project 
was 
closed 
on March 
31,2003. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
project 
was 
to 
support 
the 
recovery 
of 
the 
forestry 
sector 
and 
its 
economic and environmental sustainability 
in 
three 
key 
areas: 
(a) 
support 
to 
forest 
management; 
(b) 
protection 
and rehabilitation 
of 
forests; 
and 
(c) 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
forestry 
service's 
operational 
capacity. 
The project 
helped 
resume 
sustainable 
forest 
management 
planning, 
and 
provided 
equipment 
to 
implement and 
monitor 
policy 
and 
management 
improvements. 
Forest 
quality 
was 
enhanced 
through 
pest 
and 
insect control, reforestation 
of 
areas 
affected 
by 
erosion, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
protected 
areas. 
Forest accessibility 
was 
improved 
and resulted 
in 
improved 
management 
and 
a 
more 
balanced 
production 
of 
wood, 
which 
partially 
helped 
revive 
economic 
activity 
in 
rural 
areas. 
The 
challenge 
now 
is 
to 
implement 
the 
important legal 
and 
policy 
reforms 
supported 
under 
the project, which, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
project 
implementation, 
gave 
the 
forest 
sector a 
new 
direction, 
in 
line 
with 
the provisions 
of 
the 
Dayton 
Peace 
Accords and 
the 
recently 
ratified 
Convention 
on 
Biological 
Diversity 
(CBD). 
Since 
the 
EC 
- 
until 
September 
2001 
a 
co-financing 
agency 
- 
has 
disengaged 
from 
the 
sector 
and 
the 
activities 
of 
a 
GTZ 
project 
are 
narrowly 
focused 
on 
only 
Geographical 
Information 
Systems 
(GIS) 
and 
remote 
sensing, 
the authorities 
are 
looking 
increasingly 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
continued 
support. 
Forest 
Sector 
Institutional 
Arrangements 
and 
Recent 
Reforms. 
Overall 
responsibility 
for 
forestry 
in 
the 
Federation 
lies 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture, 
Water 
Resources 
and 
Forestry 
(MAWF); 
and 
in 
the 
RS 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture, 
Forestry 
and 
Water 
Resources 
(MAFW). 
The 
Forestry 
Department 
within 
these 
Ministries 
is 
headed 
by 
a 
Assistant 
Minister 
and 
is 
funded 
through 
the 
budget. 
The 
department 
has 
a 
small 
technical 
staff, 
including 
the 
Forest 
Inspection 
Service 
(FIS). 
As 
part 
of 
the 
Dayton 
Agreement, 
10 
Cantons 
have been 
set 
up 
in 
the Federation 
for 
regional 
administration. 
These 
Cantons have 
a 
similar 
administrative structure 
as 
the 
Federal 
administration, 
and 
each 
canton includes 
a 
Minister 
in 
charge 
of 
a 
Cantonal-level 
MAWF. 
Prior 
to 
the approval 
of 
the 
new 
forest laws, 
State 
forest 
enterprises 
(SFEs) 
were 
in 
charge 
of 
managing 
State-owned 
forests. 
Prior 
to 
the 
war, 
they 
typically 
managed 
both 
the 
forest 
industries 
and 
the 
"public" 
and 
"private" 
good 
management 
functions 
of 
the 
surrounding forest 
areas, 
which 
provided 
raw 
material 
to 
those industries. 
In 
most 
cases, 
the 
SFEs 
were 
divided 
into 
separate 
industrial 
enterprises 
(sawmills, 
furniture, 
factories, 
etc.), 
and 
forest management 
enterprises. 
There 
are 
still 
strong linkages 
between 
the 
forest 
management 
enterprises 
and the 
wood 
processing industries. 
With 
the approval 
of 
the 
new 
Federation forest 
law 
in 
May 
2002, 
a 
number 
of 
changes 
were 
introduced 
related 
to: 
(a) 
the 
delegation 
of 
forest management 
to 
cantonal forest 
companies (CFCs) 
for 
each 
canton, 
consistent 
with 
the 
Dayton 
Peace 
Accords; 
(b) 
the creation 
of 
new 
forest 
institutions at 
Federation 
and 
cantonal 
level 
("forest  offices"); 
(c) 
the abolishment 
of 
the 
existing 
State 
Forest Enterprises; 
and 
(d) 
the 
-5- 
Page  10
strengthening 
of 
forest 
inspection 
and protection. 
Changes 
in 
the 
forest 
institutional 
arrangements 
were 
introduced 
in 
RS 
through 
amendments 
to 
the forest 
law, 
also 
adopted 
in 
May 
2002. 
These 
changes are 
mainly 
related 
to, 
inter 
alia: 
(i) 
strengthening 
and 
consolidation 
of 
forest inspection 
at 
the 
ministerial 
level 
(Le. 
abolishment 
of 
municipality 
responsibility 
for 
forest 
inspection); 
(ii) 
clarification 
of 
responsibilities 
in 
forest 
management 
and 
administration; 
and 
(iii) 
use 
of 
the 
“extended 
reproduction 
fund”. 
Despite 
these changes, 
forest management 
remains 
centralized 
in 
RS, 
under 
the 
Public 
Forest 
Enterprise 
Srpske 
Sume, 
which 
is 
an 
appropriate 
arrangement, 
and 
is 
common 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
Europe 
(e.g. 
Croatia, Austria, 
France, 
and parts 
of 
Germany). 
Organization 
of 
Forest 
Management. 
The 
cantonal forest 
enterprises/companies (CFCs) 
in 
the 
Federation 
are 
in 
charge 
of 
forest 
management 
based 
on 
annual 
plans. 
They 
are 
performing: 
(a) 
most 
of 
the forest 
operations 
(harvesting, 
transport, regeneration); 
(b) 
management 
of 
Non-timber 
Forest 
Products 
(collection 
of 
NTFPs, organization 
of 
hunting); 
(c) 
monitoring 
and 
management 
of 
forest 
pest 
infestations 
and 
fires; 
and 
(d) 
advisory 
services 
to 
private 
forest 
owners. 
CFCs 
are 
largely 
financed 
by 
their 
own 
revenues; 
contributions 
to 
the 
national 
budget 
are 
made 
through 
taxes. 
In 
RS 
these 
tasks 
are 
performed 
by 
Srpske 
Sume. 
Forest 
inventory 
and 
the 
development 
of 
forest 
management 
plans 
is 
task 
of 
Forest 
Planning 
Units 
in 
the 
Federation, 
while 
in 
RS 
inventory 
and 
planning 
is 
done 
by 
one 
centralized 
Forest 
Planning 
Center. 
The 
approval 
of 
forest 
management 
plans 
(for 
the 
period 
of 
10 
years) 
and annual 
plans 
as 
well 
as 
its 
implementation 
are 
joint 
tasks 
of 
the 
Forest 
Offices 
(Federation 
and 
Cantonal Forest Offices, 
within 
their 
jurisdiction) 
in 
the 
Federation. 
Additional 
tasks 
among 
others, 
include: 
(a) 
the 
provision 
of 
professional 
support 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
forest 
management plans; 
(b) 
certification 
and 
registration 
of 
production, 
and 
processing 
of 
forest 
seeds 
and 
forest 
seedlings; 
(c) 
monitoring 
of 
forest health, 
preparation 
of 
integral 
pest 
management 
and 
fire 
protection 
plans; 
as 
well 
as 
(d) 
developing 
standards 
in 
forestry. 
In 
RS, 
these tasks 
are 
performed 
by 
the 
Forest 
Departments 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Apculture, 
Forestry and 
Water 
Management.  Forest management 
plan 
implementation 
is 
also 
controlled 
by 
the 
Forest 
Inspection 
Services (FIS). 
The 
FIS 
report 
directly 
to 
the 
Ministerial 
Forest 
Departments 
and 
are 
in 
charge 
of 
monitoring 
and inspecting 
forest-related 
activities 
regularly 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Forest 
Law 
and 
relevant regulations. 
In 
the current 
organization, 
the CFCs and 
Srpske 
Sume 
are 
responsible 
for 
some 
private, 
as 
well 
as 
some 
public 
good 
functions 
of 
forest 
management, 
watershed protection, conservation activities, 
etc. 
This 
set 
up 
- 
common 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
Europe 
- 
requires 
that 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
public 
goods 
functions 
are 
adequately financed, 
either 
directly 
from 
the budget 
or 
from 
revenues 
from 
timber 
sales 
or 
from 
targeted 
funds. 
Forest 
Sector 
Economic 
Framework. 
To 
varying 
degrees 
in 
the 
different 
parts 
of 
the 
country, economic 
and 
administrative/control 
functions 
have 
been 
separated 
as 
part 
of 
recent 
reform 
processes 
in 
the 
sector 
as 
a necessary 
step 
towards 
a 
more 
transparent 
arrangement 
for 
forest 
management. 
Consolidation 
of 
the 
current 
achievements 
through implementation 
of 
the 
new 
legal 
frameworks 
has 
yet 
to 
begin. 
Importantly, 
long-term 
funding 
of 
the forest administrations 
needs 
to be 
addressed. 
Currently the 
forest 
administration 
in 
RS 
is 
funded through 
the 
budget, 
while 
the cantonal forest 
offices 
(CFOs) 
in 
the 
Federation 
are 
financed through 
a 
0.1% 
tax 
on all 
business 
activities 
in 
those cantons. 
Since there have 
been 
difficulties 
collecting 
these taxes, 
alternative 
options should 
be reviewed 
for 
the 
sustainable 
funding 
of 
the activities 
of 
the 
CFOs.

Modern 
information 
management 
systems 
would 
address 
the 
following 
critical 
areas, 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the economic 
framework 
of 
the 
sector: 
(a) 
the methodology 
for 
the setting 
of 
timber 
prices, 
currently 
set 
through 
a 
minimum 
price 
list 
at 
entity 
level, 
and better 
quality 
assortment 
of 
timber; 
(b) 
the 
lack 
of 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
forest 
resources, 
along 
with 
insufficient information 
management, are 
obstacles 
to 
economic efficiency 
and 
sustainable 
forest 
management; 
and 
(c) 
the 
provision 
of 
accounting 
systems 
for 
the 
forest 
companies, 
which would 
distinguish 
between commercial 
and non-commercial 
activities. 
Forest and 
Biodiversity Conservation. 
BiH's 
biodiversity 
is 
currently 
insufficiently 
protected 
and 
under-valued. 
At 
present 
there 
are 
21 
protected 
areas 
covering 
only 
about 
0.55% 
of 
the territory. 
The 
categories 
of 
these 
protected 
areas 
range 
from 
Bird 
Reserves 
to 
Strict Nature 
Reserves 
with 
two 
National 
Parks 
(NPs) 
in 
RS 
(Kozara and 
Sutjeska). 
The recently published 
NEAP 
recognizes 
the importance 
of 
biodiversity, natural 
and 
cultural 
heritage, 
the 
threats 
and the 
need 
for 
expansion 
the 
area 
for 
conservation 
and 
protection. 
The ratification 
of 
the 
Convention 
of 
Biological Diversity 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
one 
step 
in 
this 
direction, 
since 
it 
will 
facilitate 
access 
to 
GEF 
grant 
funds. 
Local 
benefits 
from 
an 
expanded system 
of 
protected 
areas 
would 
include 
recreation, 
employment opportunities 
from 
tourism, 
watershed 
protection, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
maintenance 
of 
gene 
pools 
for 
forests 
products 
harvested 
and used 
by 
the 
local 
population 
(berries, 
mushrooms, 
snails, etc.). 
Biodiversity 
conservation 
will 
be 
enhanced 
both 
by 
incorporating 
ecosystem 
approaches 
into 
forest 
production 
landscapes, 
and 
by 
increasing the 
area 
under 
protection 
in 
BiH. 
Where protected 
areas are 
part 
of 
state 
owned 
forests, 
their 
management 
is 
responsibility 
of 
the 
FEs. 
The 
two 
NPs 
are 
managed 
as 
specialized 
"enterprises" 
under 
Srpske Sume. 
The 
directors 
of 
the 
NPs 
are 
appointed 
by 
and report 
to 
three 
Ministries 
(Forestry, 
Education 
as 
well 
as 
Environment). 
Since 
the 
protection 
status 
of 
most 
of 
the 
areas 
allows 
for 
sustainable 
utilization 
of 
natural 
resources, 
the 
protected 
areas are 
used 
for 
economic activities 
such 
as 
tourism, 
grazing, 
gathering 
of 
NTFPs 
and 
limited 
timber 
harvesting. 
In 
case 
of 
the 
Sutjeska 
NP, 
forest 
harvesting contributes 
to 
more than 
half 
of 
the 
current 
park 
revenues. 
A 
feasibility 
study, 
developed under 
the recently completed Forestry 
Project, 
identified 
good 
prospects 
for 
the creation 
of 
a 
National 
Park 
Igman-Bjelasnica 
with 
a 
proposed 
coverage 
of 
120,000 
ha. 
This 
park 
would 
be 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
protected 
areas 
in 
South Eastern Europe. 
Besides 
its 
very 
high 
biological 
value, 
the 
area 
proposed 
for 
the 
NP 
serves 
as 
an important recreation 
area 
for 
Sarajevo, 
and 
prior 
to 
the 
war, 
was 
a 
popular 
venue 
for 
winter 
sports. 
The Park 
and 
the 
City 
of 
Sarajevo together 
would 
offer, 
in 
international 
terms, 
an 
exciting 
and diverse 
tourism 
product, 
providing 
employment opportunities 
(both 
directly 
and 
indirectly) 
for 
the 
approximately 
12,000 
people 
who 
live 
in 
the 
area, 
through 
tourism 
activities, 
provision 
of 
services, etc. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
park could 
also 
provide 
a 
catalyst 
for 
greater 
economic 
growth 
in 
the 
region 
as 
a 
whole, 
and 
therefore 
increased 
job 
opportunities 
across a 
number 
of 
development 
spheres. 
Spanning 
across 
both 
RS 
and 
the 
Federation, 
the 
park 
would 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
strengthen 
national 
unity 
and contribute 
to 
the 
country's 
political 
and 
economic recovery. 
Government Strategy. 
Forest 
strategies 
and 
their implementation 
are 
defined 
by 
the 
individual 
Entity 
Laws 
on 
Forests 
and related 
regulations 
arising 
from 
Entity 
Laws. 
With 
the 
new 
Law 
on 
Forests 
in 
the 
Federation, 
the foundations 
of 
strategy 
and 
planning 
are 
based 
on 
three tiers: 
a 
forest 
program 
for 
the 
Federation, forest development 
plans 
at the 
cantonal level, 
and 
forest 
management 
areas. 
In 
RS, 
following 
similar 
objectives, the 
centralized 
management 
approach 
was maintained, 
with 
Srpske 
Sume 
and 
its 
forest management 
units 
as 
manager 
of 
the 
forest, overseen 
by 
the 
Ministry 
and the Forest 
Inspection 
Service. 
This 
arrangement 
-- 
of 
forest 
enterprises overseen 
by 
a 
Ministry 
-- 
is 
common 
throughout 
Europe 
(France, 
Latvia, 
Austria, parts 
of 
Germany, Croatia).

The 
new 
forest 
laws 
are 
targeted at 
developing 
a 
modern 
forest 
management 
system, 
with 
the 
separation 
of 
economic 
and 
control 
functions, 
capable 
of 
monitoring 
and ensuring 
the management forest 
ecosystems 
sustainably and effectively. 
Over 
the 
past 
three 
years 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Agriculture, Water 
Management 
and 
Forestry 
in 
both 
entities 
have 
employed 
a 
participatory 
approach 
(round-tables, 
workshops, 
etc.) 
engaging 
a 
multitude 
of 
stakeholders 
to 
increase 
commitment 
to 
a 
reform 
of 
the 
sector. 
The 
challenge 
is 
to 
build 
capacity 
at 
both 
the 
entity 
and 
local 
levels 
to 
implement 
the 
new 
legislation. 
Biodiversity. 
A 
new 
legal framework 
has 
been 
set 
up 
with 
a 
new 
Law 
on 
the 
Protection 
of 
Nature 
for 
RS 
which 
was 
adopted 
in 
July 
2002. 
It 
stipulates 
the revitalization, protection, preservation and 
sustainable 
development 
of 
landscapes, 
units 
of 
natures, 
plants, 
animals and 
their 
habitats 
as 
well 
as 
other 
components 
of 
nature 
that 
are 
part 
of 
the environment. 
A 
similar 
law 
is 
currently under 
review 
to 
be 
passed 
in 
the 
Federation. 
The protection 
of 
forest 
biodiversity 
is 
also 
regulated 
by 
the 
applicable 
Law 
on 
Forests, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
Hunting 
and 
Fishing 
Laws.  The 
RS 
Constitution and 
the 
Law 
on 
Forests 
stipulate 
that 
forests 
and forestland 
are a 
public good 
which 
enjoys the 
special 
care 
and protection 
of 
the 
state. 
The 
challenge 
is 
to 
manage 
existing 
and proposed protected 
areas 
(PAS) 
effectively, 
to 
develop 
participatory 
approaches 
to 
PA 
management, 
to 
expand 
the 
system 
of 
PAs 
and 
to 
incorporate 
biodiversity 
conservation 
into 
the 
production 
landscape. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
situation 
in 
the 
sector 
is 
complex. 
This 
operation 
seeks 
to 
target 
only 
a 
few 
critical 
interventions 
to 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
forest 
sector. 
These 
interventions 
will 
support 
the 
sector's 
overall 
improvement, 
pave 
the 
way 
for  a 
possible 
GEF 
project 
in 
the 
future, 
and 
help 
with 
financial and 
economic reforms. 
Implementing Institutional 
Reform. 
Actors 
in 
the 
forest 
sector 
are 
now 
confronted 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
challenges 
to implement 
the 
new 
legislation, 
including 
decentralization 
of 
forest 
management 
to 
cantonal 
levels, 
greater 
transparency 
of 
management, 
and 
separation 
of 
commercial 
from 
supervisoryladministrative 
functions, 
and 
incorporation 
of 
biodiversity 
conservation 
into 
forest 
management 
activities. 
The project 
would 
assist 
the government 
to 
implement 
the 
institutional reforms 
and improve 
transparency 
of 
financial 
flows 
in 
the 
sector. 
Development 
of 
Modern 
Information 
Technology for 
Sustainable Forest 
Management. 
Transparent 
forest 
management 
information 
systems, 
drawing 
on 
data 
obtained 
through 
a 
National 
Forest 
Inventory, 
would 
help 
implement 
the 
above-described 
institutional 
and economic reforms. 
To 
ensure 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
decentralization, 
the government 
has 
decided 
to 
introduce 
modern information 
systems 
to 
permit 
more effective 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
of 
forests 
and 
multi-purpose 
uses 
of 
the 
forest 
resource. 
Such 
modem 
information 
systems are 
critically 
needed 
to 
enable 
the 
sector 
to 
increase 
efficiency 
in 
management 
decisions, 
which would 
reduce 
costs 
(per hectare 
or 
cubic 
meter) 
of 
planning, 
harvesting and protection. 
Reduction 
in 
costs 
as 
a 
result 
of 
better 
management 
planning 
would 
increase 
revenues 
derived 
from 
forest 
resources. 
The project 
would 
assist 
with 
the 
introduction 
and development 
of 
modern 
forest management tools, 
as 
well 
as 
technical 
assistance, 
workshops and training. 
Need for  a 
Comprehensive State-wide Approach to Biodiversity Conservation. 
Building 
upon 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Action 
Plan 
(NEAP), 
the 
project 
will 
incorporate consultative 
approaches 
in 
landscape, 
forest 
and biodiversity 
planning 
processes 
through the 
development 
of 
a 
National 
Biodiversity 
Strategy, 
and 
participatory 
forest 
management 
plans.  Rather 
than attempting 
to 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
the entire 
country 
all 
at once, 
the 
project 
would pilot 
participatory 
approaches 
to 
forest 
and 
protected 
area 
management 
planning 
in 
the 
IgmadBjelasnica 
area. 
Lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
development 
of 
participatory 
methodologies 
will 
be 
applied 
elsewhere 
in 
BiH 
in 
the future. 
The 
learning 
-8- 
Page  13
outcomes also 
have 
relevance 
for 
the 
wider 
ecosystems 
of 
the 
West 
Balkans, 
and 
therefore 
the 
opportunities 
for 
sub-regional 
learning 
would 
be 
consistent 
with 
work 
linked 
to 
the 
South Eastern Europe 
Stability 
Pact. 
The 
project 
would 
assist 
in 
facilitating 
the 
development 
of 
working 
groups 
and 
workshops 
and 
their 
associated 
costs, 
as 
well 
as 
other technical 
assistance, 
and 
training.

Project Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
Component 
1. 
Acceleratinp 
the 
implementation 
of 
new 
legal, 
institutional 
and 
economic 
frameworks 
A. 
new 
legal and institutional 
frameworks, 
which 
will 
support 
the setting 
up 
of 
a 
modern 
forest management 
regime. 
Implementation 
of 
these 
new 
frameworks 
will 
help 
to 
ensure 
the sustainable 
use 
and protection 
of 
forest 
resources, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time paving 
the 
way 
to 
an 
autonomous 
and self-financing 
forest 
sector 
competitive 
at 
European levels. 
Supporting 
the 
sector’s 
institutional 
reforms 
to 
assist 
both 
entities 
in 
the implementation 
of 
In 
the 
Federation, 
the 
project 
will: 
(a) 
work 
at 
the Federation 
and 
cantonal 
levels 
with 
the 
Ministries 
in 
charge 
of 
forestry 
to 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
newly 
created Forest 
Offices.  Technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
these 
offices 
will 
be 
focused 
on 
establishing 
a 
forest 
management 
and 
financial 
monitoring 
system, 
and 
basic 
office 
equipment, 
to 
enable 
efficient 
communication 
and 
coordination 
between 
the 
offices. 
(b) 
The 
project 
would 
support 
the 
finalization 
of 
contractual 
agreements 
between 
the 
cantonal 
ministries 
for 
forestry 
and 
the CFCs. 
Finally, 
(c) 
the project 
will 
provide 
operational 
support 
to 
the forest 
guards 
and forest inspectors 
at 
Federation and cantonal level, 
as 
well 
as 
procurement 
of 
and 
training 
in 
the 
use 
of 
limited 
field 
equipment 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
new 
forest 
law, and improve 
transparency 
and forest 
governance. 
This 
training, 
together 
with 
that 
provided 
to 
CFCs 
during 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
new 
Forest 
Management 
Information 
System 
(see 
Component 
2A), 
would 
strengthen 
the capacity 
of 
the forest 
guards 
and 
inspection 
services 
to 
tackle ongoing 
illegal 
logging 
and 
corruption; 
(d) 
the 
project 
would 
assist 
in 
the consolidation 
of 
existing 
forest 
enterprises 
into 
one 
single forest 
enterprise 
(Cantonal 
Forest 
Company 
- 
CFC) 
in 
each canton. 
Support 
will 
be 
targeted 
at 
working 
groups 
to 
facilitate 
consensus 
building 
and an 
elaboration 
of 
a detailed, 
phased 
and 
costed 
action 
plan for 
the 
transition 
period 
and 
support 
a 
study 
tour 
for 
decision 
makers. 
Technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
CFCs 
for 
the development 
of 
business 
plans. 
Considering 
the 
ongoing privatization 
of 
forest 
equipment and 
operations 
within 
most 
forest 
companies, 
additional training 
would 
be 
targeted 
to 
staff 
deciding to 
become 
private 
entrepreneurs. 
In 
Republika 
Srpska. 
Similar 
to 
the 
training provided 
to CFCs 
in 
the 
Federation, 
Srpske 
Sume 
would 
receive 
tailored training 
packages. 
As 
in 
the 
Federation, 
the Forest 
Inspection 
Service 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project 
through operational 
support 
and 
training 
in 
the 
use 
of 
field 
equipment 
to 
ensure 
an 
efficient 
forest inspection. 
B. 
Improving 
the 
economic 
and 
financing 
framework 
The 
new 
laws 
in 
FBiH 
and 
RS 
have 
improved 
the 
institutional 
setup 
of 
the 
forest 
sector. 
There 
are 
still 
opportunities however, 
for 
improvements 
in 
the 
financial 
management 
and 
generation 
of 
revenues 
from 
the 
forest 
sector, 
while 
assuring 
sustainable 
forest management practices. 
The 
project 
has 
identified 
opportunities 
for 
targeted 
support, 
which 
can 
be 
grouped 
in 
five 
broad 
categories: 
[a) 
Financial 
flows: Support 
would 
be 
provided 
to 
the CFCs 
and 
Srpske Sume 
in 
reviewing 
accounting 
procedures 
and comparing 
them 
with 
good 
practices, together 
with 
training 
in 
improved 
practice. 
-9- 
Page  14
Support 
would 
also 
be 
provided 
in 
consolidating 
information 
from field 
level 
at 
entity 
level. 
/b) 
Revenues 
from 
Forest 
Activities 
and 
Financing 
Cantonal 
Forest Offices: Forest 
administration 
in 
RS 
is 
funded 
through 
the 
budget, 
but 
Cantonal forest 
offices 
in 
the 
Federation 
(whose annual 
operating 
costs 
are 
estimated 
at 
KM 
2 
million) 
are 
financed 
by 
a 
0.1% 
tax 
on all 
business 
activities 
in 
those cantons. 
There have 
been 
difficulties 
collecting 
these taxes. 
Support 
would 
be 
provided 
in 
developing alternative 
options 
for 
financing 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
CFOs, 
including 
funding 
directly 
from 
the 
budget, 
or 
from 
a 
dedicated forest 
fund 
financed out 
of 
timber 
sales. 
(c) 
Timber 
marketing: 
Timber 
prices 
for 
different 
quality 
timber 
are 
based 
on 
a 
minimum 
price 
list 
developed 
at 
Entity 
level, though 
higher 
prices 
may be 
and frequently 
are 
negotiated 
with 
buyers 
from 
the 
processing 
industry. 
These 
price 
lists 
have 
not 
been adjusted 
since 1998. 
There 
is 
scope 
for 
reviewing 
and 
refining 
the 
lists 
in 
accordance 
with 
latest 
international practice 
on 
timber 
quality, 
grading 
and 
pricing. 
The 
assistance 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
targeted 
to 
improve 
timber pricing, 
the assortment 
of 
timber 
products 
and 
market information, 
which would 
reflect 
international 
best practices. 
Training 
would 
be provided 
to 
CFCs 
and 
Srpske Sume 
in 
implementing 
such 
an 
approach. 
/d) 
Non-timber 
Forest 
Products 
(NTFPs): 
The 
project 
would 
support 
activities 
targeted at 
increasing 
forest 
revenues, 
through 
management 
of 
these 
products, 
as 
well 
through 
designation 
of 
forest 
areas 
for 
NTFP 
use. 
The 
project 
would 
finance technical 
assistance, 
training, 
study 
tours 
and 
workshops, 
as 
well 
as 
appropriate software 
for 
provision 
of 
updated 
information 
on 
timber pricing. 
ComDonent 
2. 
Strengtheninp 
of 
Technical CaDacitv for 
Sustainable 
Forest 
Manapement 
This 
component 
will 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
economically 
and 
environmentally 
sound 
forest 
management at 
the 
level 
of 
Forest 
Management 
Units 
(FMU) 
in 
both 
Entities. 
It 
will 
set 
up 
technical 
instruments 
that 
are 
critical 
to 
ensure 
monitoring 
and 
sustainable  use 
of 
BiH’s 
forest endowment. 
The 
component 
will 
also 
help 
BiH 
to 
develop 
National 
Standards 
that 
would 
be 
the 
basis 
for 
sustainable 
forest 
management 
and 
Forest 
Certification. 
These standards 
will 
be 
applicable 
for 
the 
whole country 
and 
should 
take 
into 
account the 
total 
value 
of 
all 
forest functions. 
This 
component 
include 
two 
sets 
of 
activities, 
each 
of 
them 
covering 
both 
entities 
: 
A. 
Development 
of 
a 
GIS-based Forest 
Management 
Information 
System 
(FMIS). 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
technical 
assistance, 
software, 
hardware 
and 
training 
for 
the setting 
up 
and 
maintenance 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
forest 
management 
information 
system. 
This 
GIS-based system 
would 
be 
used 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
managers 
in 
the 
field 
and 
in 
head 
offices 
for 
planning, 
management, 
monitoring 
and 
supervision 
of 
forest 
operations 
The 
FMIS 
will 
cover 
all 
public 
forests, 
and 
private 
forests 
where 
ownership 
is 
formally 
registered. 
It 
will 
comprise 
three 
inter-related modules: 
(a) 
the 
technical module: 
covering 
data 
from 
forest inventory, 
silvicultural 
and regeneration 
operations, 
records 
and 
forecast 
on 
harvesting volume; 
(b) 
the economical module: 
covering financial 
information 
such 
as 
results 
from 
timber 
sales, 
collection 
of 
fiscal 
revenues, 
and 
accounting 
of 
forest 
enterprises 
and 
(c) 
the geographical 
module: 
each 
FMU 
will 
be 
mapped 
and 
digitalized, 
with 
identification 
of 
conservation 
areas, 
road 
network 
and 
harvesting 
operations. 
This 
GIS-mapping 
module 
will 
be 
developed 
in 
synergy 
with 
the protected 
area 
GIS-planning 
effort 
under component C. 
Based 
on 
the consideration 
that 
forest  enterprises 
within 
BiH 
are 
unequally 
advanced 
in 
the setting 
up 
of 
information 
systems, 
the 
FMIS 
component 
will 
be 
preceded 
by 
an overall 
feasibility 
study 
that 
will 
assess 
the 
information 
systems 
currently 
in 
place 
and under 
development, 
and 
the 
potential 
for 
harmonization. 
B. 
Implementation 
of 
a 
Bosnia-wide 
forest 
inventory. 
To 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
forest resource 
data 
at 
the 
state 
level 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
carry out 
a 
permanent, independent 
NFI, 
which 
should 
be 
established 
to 
serve 
as 
a basis 
for: 
(a) 
forest 
monitoring; 
(b) 
forest 
strategy 
and long-term 
planning 
development; 
as 
well 
as 
(c) 
priority 
setting 
for 
forest 
research 
and development. 
A 
comprehensive 
-

Page  15
methodology 
for 
a 
national 
forest 
inventory, 
under 
consideration 
of 
a 
special 
focus 
to 
biodiversity 
and 
forest protection, 
is 
currently 
being 
developed 
by 
GTZ, 
in 
both 
entities. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
implementation 
of 
the 
inventory 
over 
a 
two-year 
period 
by 
including local 
expertise 
to 
the 
maximum 
extent 
possible, 
as 
well 
as 
supporting 
collection 
of 
data 
in 
the 
field 
and 
computerized processing 
of 
data. 
The 
inventory 
will 
provide 
updated and integrated 
data 
on 
forest 
stand 
and 
health, 
quality 
of 
management, 
biodiversity 
potential, 
and 
cadastre. 
The project 
would 
ensure 
that 
in 
addition 
to 
a 
typical 
forest 
inventory, 
information 
on 
critical 
forest 
ecosystems 
would 
be 
supplied, 
to 
provide 
a base 
line 
for 
forest 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation. 
In 
addition, 
it 
would 
assist 
in 
the 
development 
of 
Forest 
Management 
Standards 
in 
both 
entities. 
The Bosnia-wide 
forest 
inventory 
will 
be 
carried out 
in 
both 
entities simultaneously and 
in 
synergy 
with 
the 
development 
of 
the 
FMIS. 
Component 
3. 
Promoting Biodiversitv 
and 
Forest 
Conservation 
in 
both entities 
This 
component 
will 
address 
the fact that 
only 
0.55% 
of 
BiH’s 
territory 
is 
formally 
protected (NEAP 
2003, 
World 
Conservation 
Monitoring 
Center-UNEP 
website). 
It 
will 
respond 
to 
commitments 
by 
the 
governments 
in 
both 
Entities to 
leverage 
the country’s 
unique 
landscape 
and 
biodiversity 
endowment 
into 
expansion 
of 
protected 
areas, 
and the 
subsequent 
opportunities that 
these 
areas 
provide. 
This 
component 
will 
be 
fully 
funded 
by 
a 
grant 
from 
the 
Italian 
Government.  Importantly, 
this 
component 
will 
pave the 
way 
for 
a 
GEF 
project 
on 
biodiversity conservatiodprotected 
areas 
in 
CY2004l2005. 
The 
component 
will 
be 
conducted 
in 
both 
Entities 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
Environmental 
Steering 
Committee 
comprised 
of 
both 
Ministries 
of 
Environment, 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
relevant 
forest 
institutions and 
organizations. 
The project 
will 
develop 
three 
complementary 
sets 
of 
activities: 
A. 
finalization 
of 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Action 
Plan 
(NEAP), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
recent 
ratification 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Biological Diversity 
(CBD). 
A 
participatory framework required 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
National 
Biodiversity 
Strategy 
has 
been successfully 
employed 
to 
prepare 
the 
NEAP. 
Further, 
the 
institutional framework 
at 
the 
State 
level 
is 
in 
place, 
including 
a 
Biodiversity 
Committee under the 
Ministry 
of 
Physical Planning 
and 
Environment 
for 
FBiH, 
which 
reports 
to 
the 
Environment and 
Sustainable 
Development 
Steering 
Committee, 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Foreign Trade and Economic 
Relations. 
The 
institutional 
arrangements 
planned 
for 
the 
carrying out 
of 
the 
NBS 
build 
on 
the 
successful 
model 
of 
the 
NEAP. 
Participatory 
processes 
and the 
use 
of 
local 
expertise 
will 
be 
emphasized 
in 
preparing the 
NBS. 
To 
guide the technical 
process, a 
number 
of 
thematic 
groups, 
comprising 
experts 
in 
biodiversity, 
biology, 
land 
use 
planning, 
forestry, 
park 
management, 
and other 
fields 
to 
be 
determined, 
as 
well 
as 
community 
groups 
and 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society, 
will 
also 
be 
formed. 
The project 
will 
support: 
(i) 
national 
level 
workshops 
in 
which 
all 
relevant parties 
will 
participate. 
Project 
funding 
will 
include 
provision 
of 
workshop 
space 
facilitation 
services, 
and 
local 
travel and 
per 
diems 
for 
participants 
as 
well 
as 
dissemination 
of 
workshop 
results; 
(ii) 
field 
consultations 
in 
each 
of 
the 
ten 
Federation 
Cantons, each 
of 
the 
RS 
Regions, 
numerous 
municipalities 
in 
each 
Entity 
and 
District 
Brcko; 
(iii) 
target 
round 
table 
discussions 
on 
specific 
themes, 
and 
lectures 
(for 
representatives 
of 
businesses, 
NGOs, 
scientific 
institutions, 
etc.), 
as 
well 
as 
media 
appearances 
and 
interviews. 
In 
addition 
to 
guidance 
provided 
by 
the Goals 
and 
Measures 
of 
the 
NEAP, 
the 
“First 
Draft” 
maps 
of 
proposed protected 
areas 
prepared under 
sub-component 
B 
below 
will 
be 
help 
to 
guide 
the 
work 
of 
the 
NBS 
teams. 
The final 
output 
of 
this 
process 
will 
be 
a 
National Biodiversity 
Strategy, 
which 
incorporates 
the 
goals 
and 
measures 
of 
the 
NEAP. 
Development 
of 
a 
National 
Biodiversity 
Strategy (NBS). 
This 
follows 
naturally 
from 
the 
B. 
Drawing 
up 
of 
proposals 
for 
a 
country-wide protected 
area 
network, 
covering 
up 
to 
5% 
of 
the 
territory 
in 
both 
entities. 
As 
noted, 
only 
0.55% 
of 
BiH’s 
territory 
is 
formally 
protected. 
The 
GIs-based 
mapping 
effort 
and ground-truth operations 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
National 
Forest 
Inventory 
(NFI) 
under 
Component 
B 
will 
provide 
the complete 
detail and scientific 
rigor 
for 
longer-term protected

area 
planning 
throughout the country.  However, 
this 
will 
take at least 
18 
months 
to 
complete. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
it 
is 
desirable 
to quickly 
identify 
areas 
which 
might 
be 
suitable 
for 
protected 
status. 
It 
is 
expected that 
2 
to 
3 
workshops, 
over the 
first 
3 
months 
of 
the project, 
would 
be 
held, 
followed 
by 
a 
concluding 
session 
which 
will 
agree 
on 
the 
“first 
draft”. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
workshop 
space, 
facilitation 
services, 
and 
local 
travel and 
per 
diems, 
dissemination 
of 
workshop 
results, 
and 
including 
printing 
of

C. 
Setting up 
procedures 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
consultation 
process 
for 
protected 
area 
establishment. 
With 
the various 
initiatives becoming 
available 
to 
BiH 
for 
protected 
area 
establishment, 
including 
those 
planned 
under 
this 
project, 
involvement 
of 
a 
much 
broader 
stakeholder 
community 
in 
the 
decision-making 
process 
towards 
establishment 
of 
new 
protected 
areas 
will 
be 
essential. 
The broad 
stakeholder 
community 
would 
include 
local 
population, 
municipalities, 
government 
institutions 
at 
the 
local 
and 
State 
level, 
forest 
enterprises, 
civil 
society, 
and 
the private 
sector. 
Importantly, 
decisions 
on 
new 
protected 
areas 
must 
take 
into 
account 
the importance 
of 
these 
areas 
to 
community 
livelihoods. 
In 
keeping 
with 
the 
‘landscape approach’, 
protected 
areas 
must 
serve 
multiple 
purposes, 
and 
should 
not 
curtail 
local 
population 
access 
to 
traditional 
use 
of 
resources. 
The 
project 
will 
assist 
BiH 
to 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
methodology 
for 
this 
purpose. 
The methodology 
will 
be 
based 
on 
available 
‘best 
practices’, 
which 
include 
transparency, presence 
of 
robust technical 
information, and 
consultation 
procedures 
which 
include 
affected communities. 
The 
proposed 
methodology 
will 
be 
developed 
by 
taking 
into 
consideration 
expertise 
available 
in 
BiH. 
Field-testing 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
the 
Igman-Bjelasnica 
area, 
which 
has 
been 
proposed 
as 
a 
National 
Park 
by 
a 
feasibility 
study 
funded 
by 
the Forestry 
Emergency Project. 
The project 
would 
support 
field 
surveys 
and 
consultation, 
as 
well 
as 
stakeholder 
workshops, 
including 
local 
travel 
and 
per 
diems.

Proiect 
imDlementation, 
Monitorinp 
and 
Evaluation 
The 
project 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
two 
small Project Implementation 
Units 
(PIUs) 
within 
the 
two 
entity 
Ministries 
responsible 
for 
forestry 
with 
the 
overall responsibility 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the project 
including 
procurement, 
disbursement, 
accounting 
and 
coordination. 
Permanent 
staffing 
would 
include 
two 
PIU 
directors 
each supported 
by 
an 
administrative 
assistant. 
This 
component 
will 
also 
aim 
to 
strengthen 
donor 
coordination around 
the 
national 
forest 
agenda 
and 
will 
examine 
the feasibility 
of 
harmonizing 
donor 
procedures, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
prefigure 
a 
future multi-donor 
national 
program. 
The 
PIUs 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
project 
based 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
system 
of 
indicators 
to 
be 
developed 
during 
project 
preparation, 
and 
provide 
quarterly implementation

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The project 
will 
assist 
with 
implementation 
of 
institutional, 
legal 
and 
policy 
reforms 
by 
supporting: 
(i) 
the 
finalization 
of 
the 
re-organization 
of 
the 
forest 
institutions 
to 
guarantee 
that the 
forest administrations 
are 
able 
to 
fulfill 
their obligation 
to 
oversee 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
forest 
laws 
and 
ensure 
sustainable 
fores 
management; 
(ii) 
capacity 
building 
for 
sustainable 
forest 
management 
by 
providing 
training 
to 
state 
and 
private 
enterprises 
in 
the 
sector; 
(iii) 
support 
to 
the 
development 
of 
participatory 
approaches 
for 
forest 
and 
protected 
area 
land 
use 
planning; 
(iv) 
improvements 
in 
financial 
management 
for 
CFCs 
and increased 
revenue generation 
from 
better 
assortment 
of 
timber 
and 
improved 
forest 
management 
including 
certification; 
as 
well 
as 
(v) 
the 
promotion 
of 
biodiversity 
and 
forest conservation, 
which 
would 
enhance 
the 
sustainable management 
of 
protected 
areas, 
including 
the 
possibility 
for 
development 
of 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
and 
most important 
PA 
networks 
in 
SouthedCentral 
Europe, 
by 
assisting 
in 
the 
future 
design and 
management 
of 
protected 
areas 
and 
associated 
relevant policies. 
3. 
Benefits and 
target 
population: 
Economic 
Benefits: 
Economic 
benefits 
are 
expected 
from 
the project, 
since 
the 
operation 
will 
assist 
with 
improving 
value 
added 
from 
forest 
products 
through 
better 
quality 
forest 
management, 
and 
timber 
grading 
and 
pricing 
mechanisms. 
Social 
benefts: 
A 
BiH 
Social 
Assessment 
prepared 
in 
1999 
found 
that generation 
of 
more productive 
employment was 
viewed 
as 
the 
key 
need, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
economic 
development 
and 
social 
stability. 
In 
light 
of 
this, 
the 
social 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
activities 
is 
expected 
to be 
significant and 
positive. 
Improved 
sector 
management 
will 
help 
to 
generate 
jobs 
in 
the 
forest 
sector, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Improved, 
participatory 
forest 
management 
planning 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
needs 
of 
local 
people 
for 
forest 
products 
are 
specifically 
taken 
into 
account 
when 
forest 
management 
plans 
are 
being 
developed. 
In 
addition, 
the 
promotion 
of 
biodiversity 
and 
forest conservation, 
and 
the 
planned participatory 
approach, 
would aim 
to 
combine 
benefits 
to 
local 
people 
with 
sustainable management 
and 
ecosystem 
conservation 
(e.g. 
tourism). 
Environmental 
benefits: 
The 
project 
would 
help 
to 
further 
improve 
the sustainability 
of 
forest 
management 
and protection 
in 
BiH. 
In 
this 
respect, 
it 
will 
build 
on 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
closed 
Forestry 
Project, 
which 
helped 
resume 
sustainable 
forest 
management 
planning, 
and 
provided 
initial 
equipment 
to 
implement 
and 
monitor 
management 
improvements. 
The provision 
of 
training under 
the 
new 
project 
will 
enable 
forest 
users 
to 
establish 
an ecologically 
sound forest 
management system 
in 
BiH, 
which 
would 
meet 
European 
standards. 
It 
would 
introduce 
a 
more holistic 
approach and integrate 
biodiversity 
conservation 
into 
forest production. 
Direct 
environmental 
benefits 
would 
include 
a 
decrease 
in 
biotic 
and 
abiotic 
damages, 
and 
less 
damage 
to 
the 
critical 
forest 
ecosystems 
(High 
Conservation 
Value 
Forests 
(HCVFs)). 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
would 
seize 
the 
opportunities 
to 
harness 
BiH’s 
rich 
global 
forest goods values 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the country. 
Direct 
beneficiaries 
include 
forest 
administrations 
and 
forest  enterprises. 
Indirect 
beneficiaries 
include 
forest 
industries, 
local 
populations 
dependent 
on 
forests 
and 
forest 
management.

Periods 
of Implementation: 
The project 
would 
be 
implemented over 
a 
36-month 
period 
from 
FY2004 
to 
2007. 
Project 
effectiveness 
is 
expected 
by 
September 
2003, 
and the 
Mid-Term 
Review 
would 
be 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
FY05. 
The project 
is 
expected 
to be 
completed 
by 
August 
3 
1,2006 and 
the 
closing 
date 
would 
be 
February 28,2007.

also 
be 
implementing the 
Small-scale

D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
In 
the determination 
of 
the 
Bank‘s 
next 
intervention 
in 
the 
sector, 
multiple 
options were explored. 
A. 
Allow 
the 
Forestry Project 
to 
Close, 
and 
Disengage 
from 
the 
Sector 
(‘No 
Project’ 
Alternative). 
The 
Bank‘s 
Forestry 
Project 
was closed 
in 
March 
2003. 
One 
option 
was 
to 
disengage 
from 
the 
sector. 
However, 
experiences 
show that 
momentum 
for 
reforms 
takes a 
long 
time 
to 
build, 
and 
if 
lost, 
is 
very 
difficult to 
regain. 
Since 
other donors 
(EU, 
Germany, 
Norway) 
are 
pulling 
out 
of 
the 
sector, 
it 
was 
deemed 
prudent 
for 
the 
Bank 
to 
stay 
engaged, 
so 
that 
reforms 
have 
a 
better 
chance 
of 
being 
implemented 
efficiently. 
Perhaps 
most importantly, 
the government requested 
the Bank’s 
assistance 
with 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
laws. 
B. 
Structural 
Reforms 
vs. 
New 
Investment. 
The 
relevant partners 
in 
the 
Government 
of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have 
agreed 
that 
the 
recent 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms need 
to 
be 
implemented, 
and 
the institutions 
for 
forest 
management 
strengthened, 
in 
order 
to be 
effective. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
improve 
the 
enabling environment 
for 
private 
sector 
investment.

Page  19
C.  Piloting 
Reforms 
in 
RS 
Only. 
The 
RS 
has 
a 
centralized 
institutional 
structure, 
and 
as 
such, 
implementation 
there 
could be 
much 
more 
straightforward than 
in 
the 
Federation, 
with 
its 
10 
Cantons. 
However, 
the cantonal 
structure has 
been 
found 
to 
be 
the 
most 
politically 
feasible approach 
in 
the 
Federation, 
and 
this 
approach 
now 
needs 
support. 
In 
many 
ways, 
the 
Federation 
faces a 
much 
more 
difficult 
task, 
as 
they 
have 
to 
'start 
from 
scratch' 
to 
establish 
the 
new 
Cantonal Forest Offices, and 
will 
need immediate help 
to 
succeed 
in 
this 
task. 
Sector issue 
D. 
Choice 
of 
Instrument. 
A 
number 
of 
Bank 
instruments 
have, 
at one 
time 
during 
preparation, 
been 
considered 
for 
this 
project. 
allowed 
somewhat 
faster 
processing, 
as 
well 
as 
allowing 
for 
continuity 
between 
the closing 
of 
the 
Forestry 
project, 
and 
the 
start 
of 
a 
new 
one. 
However, 
the 
closed 
project 
did 
not 
have 
any 
cost overruns. 
As 
this 
is 
the 
over-arching 
criteria 
for 
use 
of 
Supplemental 
financing, 
this 
option 
was 
disallowed, 
even 
though 
the 
proposed 
project met 
all 
other 
criteria 
for 
supplements. 
allowed 
faster 
processing. 
More 
substantively, 
the 
project 
is 
introducing 
a 
number 
of 
novel 
approaches, 
and 
new 
'technologies' 
(Le. 
modem 
forest 
inventory 
techniques, 
and participatory 
methodologies). 
Nevertheless, 
the 
LIL 
option 
was 
rejected, since the project's 
primary 
focus 
is 
on 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
laws; 
Bank 
assistance 
for 
this 
should largely 
take 
the 
form 
of 
technical 
assistance. 
For 
these 
reasons, 
a 
technical 
assistance 
credit along 
the 
lines 
of 
this 
project 
was 
proposed 
as 
the 
most 
appropriate 
instrument.

3. 
Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
The recently completed 
Forestry Project 
has 
offered 
a 
number 
of 
'lessons 
learned', 
which 
are 
specifically 
relevant 
to 
the unusual 
situation 
in 
BiH. 
These lessons 
are 
presented 
in 
Section 
5 
below, 
as 
indications 
of 
the 
Bank's 
added value 
to 
the 
sector. 
In 
addition, 
project 
design 
incorporates 
other 
lessons 
from 
recent 
Bank 
work 
in 
the 
forest 
sector 
in 
Europe. 
Forest 
sector 
projects 
that 
address 
a 
small number 
of 
clearly 
identified, 
understandable 
priority 
objectives 
have 
a greater 
probability 
of 
success 
than do 
projects attempting 
to 
address 
all 
sector 
issues, 
e.g., 
the 
Poland 
Forestry 
Development Program 
that 
addressed 
six 
clear 
issues 
and 
was 
implemented 
within 
budget 
and 
on 
time. 
Another 
lesson learned 
in 
the 
Poland project 
is 
particularly 
relevant 
to 
the design 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
a 
country 
with 
strong traditions 
of 
forestry production, 
well-trained 
personnel,

main

lie 
more 
in 
the 
introduction 
of 
modern 
technologies 
and 
institution 
strengthening 
than 
in 
simply 
expanding forest 
production 
activities. 
The 
support 
under the 
project 
is 
explicitly 
designed 
with 
this 
principle 
in 
mind. 
Where 
multiple 
options 
for 
addressing 
problems 
exist, 
project implementation should 
assist 
clients 
and 
beneficiaries 
to 
select 
the 
most 
appropriate solutions 
for 
local 
conditions, 
thereby 
building 
the 
awareness, 
capacity and 
skills 
necessary 
for 
success. 
This 
lesson 
is 
relevant 
in 
particular 
to 
institutions 
building 
component, 
and 
to 
Component 
three. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
Ongoing 
discussions 
continue 
to 
indicate 
broad 
support 
for 
the project. 
In 
the 
Federation, 
the 
Government 
has, 
as 
noted 
previously, adopted 
a 
new 
legal framework 
for 
the 
sector, 
which 
was 
supported 
under 
the completed Forestry Project. 
In 
RS, 
as 
described 
above, 
there 
is 
already progress 
being 
made 
in 
implementing 
the 
amendments 
to its 
law, 
which 
also were 
developed 
under 
the Forestry 
project 
. 
It 
should 
be noted 
that 
a 
new 
government 
took 
office 
only 
in 
January 
2003, 
following 
elections 
in 
October 
2002. 
The 
sector's 
importance 
to 
the country's economy 
is 
well-known,  and the 
new 
government 
has 
stated 
that 
it 
supports 
further 
Bank 
assistance 
to 
the 
sector. 
Furthermore, 
key 
technical 
line 
staff, 
in 
both 
the Federation 
and 
the 
RS, 
have 
expressed 
strong 
support 
for 
the 
new 
project's 
objectives. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
important 
areas 
in 
which 
the 
Bank 
can 
add 
value 
in 
the further 
development 
of 
Bosnia's forest 
sector. 
These 
areas 
reflect the 
lessons 
learned 
during 
implementation 
of 
the completed 
Forestry Project. 
In 
the 
Bosnian 
forest 
sector 
the 
Bank 
is 
seen 
as 
a 
trusted broker, and can 
help 
achieve 
consensus 
between 
varying 
stakeholder 
interests, 
as 
well 
as 
between 
sub-sectors. 
Since 
BiH 
is 
a 
highly 
divided 
country, 
the Bank's involvement 
and 
commitment 
to 
coordinate 
with 
other international 
institutions and 
donors, 
together 
with 
a 
participatory 
approach towards 
decision-making 
processes, 
can 
help 
to 
ease 
political 
tensions. 
This 
can 
be 
especially witnessed 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the Federation 
Law 
on 
Forests, 
where 
conveying 
multi-stakeholder 
worlung 
groups, 
in 
addition 
to 
studies, 
has 
led 
to 
a 
legal 
framework 
based 
on 
broad 
consensus. 
Bank 
involvement 
in 
the forest 
sector 
can 
help 
consolidate the 
unity 
of 
the 
country. 
The 
Bank 
is 
in 
a 
- 
16- 
Page  21
good 
position 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
between 
legal 
and institutional 
reforms, 
as 
well 
as 
contribute 
to 
a 
national protected 
areas 
approach, 
state-level 
inventories, and 
information 
systems.

Reforms 
are 
expected 
to 
take 
years 
and 
facilitators need 
to 
stay 
involved 
to 
sustain 
processes 
after 
they 
are 
initiated. 
A 
clear 
need 
to 
sustain 
the 
reform 
process 
through 
continuous 
involvement 
has 
been identified, 
which 
was 
launched 
with 
support 
from 
the 
first 
project. 
The 
Bank 
is 
supporting 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reform 
in 
the forest 
sector 
in 
several 
European 
countries 
and 
there 
is 
much 
to 
be 
gained 
in 
building 
on 
this 
cross-country 
experience. 
Of 
the 
above, 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Bank 
as 
"an 
honest 
broker" 
cannot 
be 
overstated. 
The 
Bank's 
continued 
engagement 
in 
the 
sector 
will 
signal 
to 
the various 
interest groups that 
the 
international 
community 
is 
committed 
to making 
the 
reforms work. 
Without 
such 
engagement, 
implementation 
of 
the reforms 
will 
be 
quite 
uneven, 
and 
it 
will 
be very 
difficult to 
generate consensus 
on 
the 
national 
level 
to 
undertake 
further 
reforms 
to 
remove 
sectoral distortions.

the 
section 
below 
only 
evaluates 
incremental  benefits 
in 
qualitative

Benefits 
from 
the 
project 
would 
accrue 
through 
improvements 
in 
forest 
management, 
which  would 
result 
in 
less 
wasteful, 
lower-cost 
harvesting. 
Better-managed  forests also have 
higher ecological 
values 
in 
terms 
of 
watershed 
protection and 
flood 
mitigation, 
as 
well 
as 
higher 
biodiversity 
and 
non-timber forest 
product 
values.

Accelerating 
the 
Implementation 
of 
New 
Legal, 
Institutional and Economic 
Frameworks: 
Benefits 
would 
include: 
(i) 
greater 
efficiency and 
transparency 
from 
separation 
of 
economic 
and administrative 
functions; 
(ii)

services; 
(iii) 
improved

differentiation. 
Strengthening 
of 
Technical 
Capacity 
for 
Sustainable 
Forest 
Management: 
The 
introduction 
of 
a 
FMIS 
will 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
quality 
of 
forest 
planning 
and 
management, 
and 
reduce 
costs 
and 
tighten 
controls, 
to 
prevent 
forest loss 
by 
biotic 
and abiotic 
damage, 
and 
permit 
better 
accountability and 
tracking 
of 
harvested 
timber 
products. 
Promotion

Biodiversitv 
Conservation: 
Activities 
in 
this 
component 
and 
a 
later 
GEF 
project 
would 
generate 
significant 
environmental 
benefits 
by: 
(i) 
securing 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity 
in 
internationally 
important 
critical 
forest 
habitats; 
(ii) 
conservation and 
improved 
management 
of 
global biodiversity 
and 
landscape values 
of 
sensitive 
ecosystems; 
(iii) 
creates 
the  opportunity 
for 
creating

from 
better 
utilization 
of 
non-timber

particularly 
from 
tourism and 
recreation, 
but 
also 
from

The project 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
positive financial impact 
upon 
revenues 
and 
expenditures 
of 
the 
Entity 
governments. 
Improved 
forest  management 
and 
better 
pricing 
information 
systems 
will 
increase 
the 
value 
of 
forest  products  and 
hence 
tax 
revenues. 
By 
supporting  the 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
legislation, 
which 
separates 
economic  and  adrmnistration  functions, 
the 
project 
also 
improves 
the 
enabling environment 
for 
development 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
forest 
operations, 
for 
increased 
local 
employment 
and 
for 
higher 
valued-added 
processing 
industry. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
The long-term fiscal impact 
of 
the 
project 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
positive. 
The 
project 
has 
intentionally 
been 
designed 
to 
achieve 
maximum 
impact 
with 
the 
smallest 
possible 
loan 
size. 
Considering 
the 
long 
repayment 
schedule 
for 
IDA 
Credits, 
and the 
expected increased 
contribution 
to 
the 
national and 
entities 
budgets 
from 
further  efficiency 
improvements 
in 
the  forest 
and 
wood 
processing 
sectors, 
the 
Credit 
should 
not 
present 
any 
undue repayment burdens 
on 
future 
governments. 
The 
government 
contribution 
during 
the 
project 
implementation 
period 
would 
be 
about 
15% 
of 
project 
financing, 
and 
would 
come 
mainly 
in 
the 
form 
of 
taxes 
on 
goods, services 
and 
salaries. 
3. 
Technical: 
Following 
up 
on 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
completed 
Forestry 
Project 
the 
new 
operation 
is 
proposing 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
GIs-based 
Forest 
Management 
Information 
System 
(FMIS). 
This 
FMIS 
would 
use 
data 
from 
a 
National 
Forest 
Inventory, 
which 
will 
integrate 
landscape-ecological 
field 
information, 
such 
as 
estimation 
of 
biodiversity 
parameters, 
identification 
of 
hot 
spot 
areas 
for 
biodiversity 
conservation and 
nature protection. 
The 
introduction and 
use 
of 
such 
a 
system has 
been applied 
in 
different 
parts 
of 
Europe and 
is 
implemented 
or 
proposed 
for 
a 
number 
of 
ECA 
forest 
operations 
(e.g. 
Georgia, 
Russia, 
Romania 
and Bulgaria). 
The 
approach 
to 
institutional restructuring and 
capacity 
building, 
although 
adopted 
to 
the 
very 
special 
Bosnian 
context, 
draws 
upon 
experience 
in 
other European countries 
(e.g. 
Hungary, 
Slovenia, Austria). 
4. 
Institutional: 
The 
Entity 
Ministries 
of 
Agriculture,  Water 
Management 
and 
Forestry 
(MAWFs) 
will 
have overall 
responsibility 
for 
the project, 
including 
procurement, 
disbursement, 
maintenance 
of 
project 
accounts 
and 
coordination 
of 
implementation. 
The 
strength 
of 
this 
arrangement 
is 
that 
these 
Ministries 
have 
experience 
in 
working 
with 
the 
Bank 
due 
to 
the closed 
Forestry Project and have 
well-educated 
staff 
capable 
of 
working 
constructively 
with 
the 
Bank. 
Its 
weaknesses 
are 
that 
in 
these 
Ministries, 
changes at 
the 
political 
level 
are 
common, 
and  were 
frequent 
in 
the 
past, 
which 
can  lead 
to 
delays 
in 
decision-making 
and 
project 
implementation. 
One 
of 
the 
core objectives 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
help 
the 
two 
entities 
in 
BiH 
to 
re-structure 
the 
government's 
role 
in 
forestry 
management 
and help 
it 
in 
establishing 
the 
proper institutional 
pillars 
to 
fulfill 
this 
role, 
including 
the 
successful management 
of 
this 
project. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
For 
successful 
implementation, the 
MAWFs 
needs 
to 
closely interface 
with 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance 
for 
implementation 
of 
an 
adjusted economic 
and financial  framework, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
Ministries 
in 
charge 
of 
Environment 
to 
coordinate the 
activities under 
Component 
3 
related 
to 
biodiversity 
and 
forest 
conservation. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Project implementation 
arrangements 
would 
broadly 
be 
the 
same 
as 
those 
undertaken 
in 
the 
closed 
Forestry 
Project, 
with 
some 
minor 
modifications 
reflecting 
the 
lessons 
learned 
during 
implementation. 
-18- 
Page  23
The 
project team 
has 
reached 
preliminary 
agreements 
with 
the 
Governments 
of 
Italy 
and 
Germany, 
on 
co-financing 
and 
collaboration, 
respectively. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
During 
implementation 
of 
the completed Forestry Project, 
the 
responsible 
PIUs 
have shown 
their 
efficiency and 
effectiveness 
in 
dealing 
with 
necessary 
procurement 
issues 
and 
procedures. 
Therefore, 
no 
procurement 
problems 
are envisaged. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
Financial 
Management 
Arrangements. 
An 
assessment 
to 
determine whether 
the 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
within 
the implementing 
units 
are 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
was 
undertaken 
by 
a 
Financial 
Management 
Specialist 
in 
November 
2002 
and 
March 
2003.  These 
fmancial 
management arrangements 
include 
the 
PIUs' 
systems 
of 
accounting, 
financial 
reporting, auditing, 
and internal 
controls. 
The 
assessment 
showed 
that 
the financial 
management 
arrangements 
for 
the Forestry 
Development and 
Conservation 
Project 
are 
capable 
of 
satisfactorily 
recording 
all 
transactions 
and 
balances, 
supporting the 
preparation 
of 
regular and reliable financial 
statements, 
safeguarding the Entities' 
assets, 
and 
are 
subject 
to 
auditing 
arrangements 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Country 
Issues. 
A 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
for 
BiH 
was 
carried out 
in 
2001. 
The draft 
CFAA 
identifies 
weaknesses 
in 
public 
sector 
budgeting, 
accounting, 
reporting, 
and 
auditing. 
The 
CFAA 
therefore 
recommends 
a 
medium to 
longer-term goal 
of 
mainstreaming 
project 
management 
into 
Ministries 
and 
Departments, 
and 
of 
consolidating implementing 
units 
and 
refraining 
from 
the creation 
of 
new 
ones. 
Accordingly, 
this 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
those 
PIUs 
experienced 
with 
implementing 
the 
previous 
Forestry 
project and 
thereby 'ring-fencing' the project's 
financial 
management 
arrangements. 
In 
addition, 
the 
draft 
CFAA 
identifies 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
country's 
banking 
sector. 
Consequently, 
the 
Special 
Accounts 
for 
the 
project 
will 
be 
opened 
in 
commercial 
banks 
assessed 
as 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Compliance 
with 
Covenants. 
Audit 
arrangement 
are 
entirely between 
the Government 
of 
BiH 
and 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers 
(Netherlands). 
The 
State 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and Treasury 
of 
BiH 
has a 
three-year 
contract 
(2001 
-2003) 
with 
Price 
Waterhouse 
Coopers, 
Netherlands 
for 
the 
audits 
of 
WB-financed projects 
(with 
the exception 
of 
revenue-earning projects). 
The 
FDCP 
will 
be included 
in 
the 
list 
of 
projects 
audited under 
this 
master 
agreement. 
According 
to 
the master 
agreement, 
the audited 
project financial 
statements 
would 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
(6) 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Government's 
fiscal 
year. 
Projects 
managed 
by 
the 
two 
implementing 
agencies 
in 
the 
past 
have 
submitted 
satisfactory 
audited financial 
statements 
on 
time. 
The 
format 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
has 
been 
agreed. 
Proiect Implementation 
Capacity. 
The project 
would 
be 
implemented 
over 
a 
36-month 
period 
from 
FY2004 to 
2006. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and Treasury 
would 
be 
the 
borrower 
of 
IDA 
funds 
and 
would 
onlend 
the 
proceeds 
to 
the Federation 
of 
BiH, 
and Republika 
Srpska Governments. 
It 
would 
also 
establish special accounts 
and make 
arrangements 
for 
auditing. 
The Ministries 
of 
Finance 
of 
both 
Entities 
would be 
responsible 
for 
channeling the 
IDA 
credit 
proceeds 
to 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Agriculture, 
Water 
Management 
and 
Forestry 
(MAWF) 
from both 
Entities, 
providing 
counterpart 
funding, 
and later 
repaying 
the credit. 
The 
Entity 
MAWFs 
would 
oversee 
project 
implementation 
using 
their existing 
forestry 
implementation 
units. 
In 
regard 
to 
this 
project, the 
staffing 
levels 
of 
the 
PIUs 
are 
satisfactory. 
The 
payment authorizations described 
in 
the 
flow 
of 
funds 
diagrams 
for 
both 
implementing 
units 
are 
designed 
to 
ensure 
proper 
segregation 
of 
duties.

Flow 
of 
Funds 
and 
Banking 
Arrangements. 
Because 
of 
the 
weak 
banking 
sector, 
IDA 
Special 
Accounts 
would 
be 
established 
for 
the 
PIUs, 
and 
these 
Special 
Accounts 
would 
be 
held 
in 
commercial 
banks 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
Also, the 
PIUs 
would 
each 
maintain 
local 
accounts 
for 
foreign 
currency payments 
and 
local 
“transaction” 
accounts 
for 
payments 
in 
local 
currency. 
Local 
bank 
balances 
of 
more 
than 
2 
weeks’ 
IDA 
expenditure 
is 
in 
principle not 
allowed. 
5. 
Environmental:

Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for

EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation and 
disclosure) 
and the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
Because 
of 
its 
emphasis 
on 
capacity 
building, 
training, and 
planning 
and 
testing 
new 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
instruments, 
the 
project 
as 
currently 
designed 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
no 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts. 
As 
such, 
no 
EMP 
will 
be 
prepared. 
There 
are

and 
neither any 
logging 
nor 
any 
extractive 
activity 
will 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
project.  The project 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
an overall positive 
environmental outcome 
in 
both 
the 
short- 
and 
the long-term. 
The legal and institutional framework 
will 
be 
strengthened 
and

6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify the project’s social 
development 
outcomes. 
With 
a 
low 
rural 
population 
density 
of 
about 
43 
people 
per 
km2, 
there 
is 
not 
significant 
pressure 
on 
BiHs 
forests. 
People 
use 
forests 
in 
multiple 
ways, 
besides 
timber 
harvesting and 
wood 
processing. 
In 
particular, the 
rural 
population relies 
on 
fuelwood 
for 
heating 
purposes, 
and 
official 
estimates 
show that 
BiH 
produces about 
700,000 
m3 
of 
fuelwood. 
Fuelwood often 
comes 
from 
coppiced 
forests, 
timber 
residues 
and 
fruit 
trees. 
The collection 
of 
non-timber 
forest 
products 
(NTFPs) 
is 
of 
importance 
for 
local 
populations, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
traditional cultural 
values 
and 
potential income 
source.  These 
products 
- 
20 
- 
Page  25
include 
herbs, spices, 
mushrooms, 
and 
wild 
fruits, 
as 
well 
as 
game meat. 
In 
relation 
to 
the 
latter, 
hunting 
has a 
long 
tradition 
for 
the 
rural 
population 
in 
the former Socialist Federal 
Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia 
(SFRY), 
and 
was 
understood 
as 
the 
production, 
rearing, 
protection 
and 
rational 
use 
of 
game. 
Game 
animals 
and 
birds 
made 
up 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
hunting 
industry, 
as 
a 
natural 
resource. 
The 
use 
of 
these 
products 
is 
usually 
managed at 
the 
local 
level, and 
is 
regulated 
in 
the 
new 
forest legislation. 
The project 
will 
help 
to 
ensure 
the 
continuation 
of 
people's 
access 
to 
the 
timber 
and 
NTFPs 
through 
assistance 
in 
participatory 
planning 
approaches 
that 
will 
provide 
state 
forest 
companies 
with 
the tools 
needed 
to 
plan 
for 
the 
continued 
access 
of 
communities 
to 
traditional 
sources 
of 
livelihood. 
The 
undertaking 
of 
the 
project 
will 
involve 
some 
moderate 
social 
risks, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the forest 
sector 
reform, introduction 
of 
modern 
management tools, 
and 
development 
of 
participatory 
approaches 
in 
land 
use 
planning, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
require 
a 
change 
of 
behavior. 
Potential 
risks 
may 
involve: 
(a) 
inadequate 
explanation 
of 
short 
and 
long 
term 
costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
reform 
and 
new 
approaches, 
leading 
to 
reluctance 
of 
stakeholders 
to 
accept 
reforms; 
(b) 
the unwillingness 
of 
stakeholders 
to 
change 
their 
behavior, 
and 
(c) 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
worsening 
economic situation 
in 
rural 
areas. 
There 
is 
one 
major 
social 
development outcome, 
which 
is 
to 
establish 
a 
methodology 
for 
participatory 
planning 
for 
protected 
areas, 
which 
takes 
into 
account the interests 
and 
desires 
of 
all 
affected 
stakeholders 
in 
both 
entities. 
These 
key 
stakeholders 
include 
the 
local 
communities, 
governments 
(at 
both 
federal 
and entity 
level), 
civil 
society 
representatives, 
and 
the 
private 
sector, 
all 
of 
whom 
can 
benefit 
from 
the establishment 
of 
protected 
areas, 
as 
long 
as 
management 
plans 
are 
designed 
to 
benefit 
local 
stakeholders, 
and 
are 
developed 
with 
their 
full 
participation. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
A 
social 
assessment 
was 
undertaken 
as 
part 
of 
project 
preparation. 
Particular focus 
was 
given 
to: 
(a) 
examining 
the 
existing 
socio-economic 
conditions 
of 
the 
population 
likely 
to be 
affected 
by 
the project; 
(b) 
gaining 
an 
understanding 
of 
how 
local 
stakeholders 
presently 
use 
the forest (fuelwood, 
timberhon-timber 
products, 
recreation 
and 
employment 
(formal 
and informal 
sector); 
(c) 
consulting 
stakeholders 
on 
the perceived 
constraints 
and 
opportunities 
envisaged 
under the 
project, 
including 
relationships between 
local 
communities 
and 
forest 
authorities, 
and 
job 
opportunities; 
and 
(d) 
evaluating 
the social 
and 
economic impacts 
to 
the 
population 
resulting 
from 
activities 
carried 
out under 
the 
project. 
There 
are 
a 
two 
major 
findings 
from 
the social 
assessment. 
First, 
the 
local 
population 
has a 
strong 
awareness 
of 
the 
need 
for 
environmental 
protection, and 
they 
are 
very 
interested 
in 
participating 
in 
any 
future 
planning 
activities. 
Second, 
and strongly 
related 
to 
the 
first 
finding, 
they 
are 
generally 
not 
worried 
about any expansion 
of 
protected 
areas, 
because 
they 
view 
this 
as 
providing them 
with 
new 
employment 
or 
income-generation opportunities, 
rather 
than 
viewing 
it 
as 
a 
threat. 
The 
social 
assessment 
did 
not 
find 
a 
significant 
share 
of 
stakeholders 
who felt 
that 
their traditional 
access 
to 
forest 
resources 
would 
be 
in 
danger 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a change 
in 
the 
status 
of 
the 
forest 
areas. 
Further 
details 
of 
the 
findings 
can 
be 
found 
in 
Annex 
11; 
the 
full 
social 
assessment 
is 
available 
in 
the 
project 
files. 
During 
preparation 
of 
an 
envisaged 
GEF 
operation, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
an 
additional 
social 
assessment 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
to 
address 
the 
following 
issues: 
(a) 
important 
social development 
issues; 
(b) 
institutional 
and organizational 
dimensions; 
(c) 
implications 
for 
GEF 
project 
design 
and 
implementation; 
and 
(d) 
recommendations 
for 
social development 
outcomes, 
indicators, 
and 
means 
for 
project 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
The 
assessment 
for 
the 
FDCP 
helps 
to 
determine 
effective 
consultations 
and 
disclosure 
strategies, 
based 
on 
interviews, 
household 
surveys, 
and 
focus 
groups. 
Following 
this 
assessment, 
the 
project 
will 
engage 
-21 
- 
Page  26
relevant 
stakeholders 
in 
a 
process 
to 
detail 
foreseeable 
impacts. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the project 
involve 
consultations 
or collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
NGOs 
and 
civil 
society 
organizations, 
both 
national 
and local, 
will 
be involved 
in 
all 
consultations 
related 
to 
discussing the 
appropriateness 
of 
the proposed 
national 
park. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
At 
present 
local 
communities have 
access 
to 
forest 
resources 
in 
a 
multitude 
of 
ways. 
The 
use 
of 
forests 
for 
small-scale 
subsistence 
activities 
has 
a 
long 
tradition 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
(BiH) 
and 
span 
from 
gathering 
of 
fuelwood, 
to 
the 
collection 
of 
non-timber 
forest 
products 
(NTFPs) 
such 
as 
forest 
fruits, 
mushrooms 
and 
snails. 
Arrangements 
are 
usually 
between the 
population 
and 
the 
Forest 
Enterprises 
(FEs) 
and include 
allowing 
access, 
or providing 
forest products 
on 
a 
grant 
basis, 
or 
with 
a 
substantial 
discount. 
In 
some 
regions 
(eg 
RS) 
the 
arrangements 
are 
based 
on 
community 
needs assessment 
lists 
maintained 
by 
municipalities. 
It 
is 
of 
crucial 
importance that 
these 
forms 
of 
“social 
sustainability” 
of 
forest 
management 
are 
maintained and 
developed, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
reforming 
the 
public 
forest 
sector 
in 
BiH. 
In 
order 
to 
maintain 
these 
user 
and 
access 
rights 
under 
the 
new 
legal 
and institutional 
frameworks 
in 
both 
entities, 
FEs 
should 
be 
required 
to 
include 
existing 
arrangements 
in 
new 
forest 
management 
plans. 
In 
addition, and 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
in 
the 
process, 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
publicly 
announce 
the 
draft 
final 
Forest Management 
Plans 
and 
encourage 
input 
from 
representatives 
of 
key 
interest 
groups. 
Also, the 
anticipated 
introduction 
of 
Forest Management 
Information 
Systems 
(FMIS) 
will 
provide 
FEs 
with 
the 
data 
and 
tools 
needed 
to 
plan 
for 
the 
continued 
access 
of 
communities 
to 
traditional 
sources 
of 
livelihood. 
Component 
3 
will 
help 
develop 
a 
standard 
procedure 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
consultation 
process 
in 
landscape 
decision-making 
processes. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
lessons 
learned 
from 
this 
process 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account, 
and 
in 
the 
longer 
term, 
will 
form 
an 
integrated 
part 
of 
forest 
management 
planning. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development 
outcomes? 
The 
planning 
methodology 
will 
be 
codified 
into 
a 
standard 
set 
of 
consultation 
guidelines, 
which 
can 
then 
be 
used 
anywhere 
in 
the 
country 
where 
similar activities 
are 
to be 
undertaken. 
Completion 
of 
these 
guidelines (and 
their 
publication 
in 
form 
of 
a 
“Operational 
Sourcebook”) 
will 
be 
the 
main 
indicator 
of 
successful outcome. 
It 
should 
be 
stressed 
that 
the 
FDCP 
will 
not 
establish 
protected 
areas.

(Involuntary

A 
social 
assessment 
conducted 
during 
preparation 
confirmed 
that 
access 
to 
forests 
is 
not 
restricted 
for 
satisfying 
local 
community 
needs 
(such 
as 
fuelwood, 
fruits, 
etc.), 
and 
that 
there 
is 
broad 
support 
for 
the expansion 
of 
protected 
areas. 
The 
project 
will 
also support 
a 
broad-based 
consultation 
process 
which 
will 
guide the 
decision 
as 
to 
whether 
to 
create 
a 
National 
Park Igman-Bjelasnica 
and 
what 
its 
boundaries 
and 
management 
regime 
would 
be. 
These 
consultations 
will 
help 
design 
a Process

decision 
to be 
made 
at 
a 
later 
date 
to 
create such 
a

F. 
Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
Sustainability 
of 
project 
benefits 
is 
addressed 
in 
a 
number 
of 
ways. 
In 
general, 
it 
can 
be 
said that 
all 
project 
interventions 
are 
designed 
to 
work 
together, 
so 
that 
the 
overall knowledge 
base 
of 
forest 
resources 
is 
better 
understood. 
With 
this 
understanding, 
forest 
sector 
operators 
and 
relevant communities 
will 
be 
in 
a 
much 
better 
position 
to 
work 
out 
management 
plans 
which 
are 
sustainable 
from 
an 
economic, 
environmental, and social 
point 
of 
view. 
From 
a 
fiscal 
perspective, 
the 
incremental 
recurrent 
costs 
of 
the 
project 
are 
small, 
and 
government 
contribution 
is 
limited primarily 
to 
taxes; 
the 
fiscal impact 
on 
the 
government's 
budget 
is 
therefore 
short-term, 
and 
manageable. 
The 
project 
is 
economically 
sustainable. 
Improved 
understanding 
of 
the 
revenue 
potential 
of 
the 
sector 
will 
lead 
to 
action 
plans 
for 
increasing 
the 
revenue 
accruing 
to 
the 
national 
budget. 
Reorganization 
of 
forest management organizations, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
modem 
information 
systems, 
will 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
planning 
of 
forest 
sector operations, 
leading 
to 
reduced 
costs 
and 
increased 
revenues. 
Institutional 
sustainability 
is 
addressed 
in 
a 
number 
of 
ways. 
First, 
training 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
new 
cantonal 
forest offices, 
and 
cantonal forest 
enterprises 
(in 
the 
Federation).  These 
new 
institutional 
structures 
will 
have 
well-trained 
professional 
staff, 
but 
will 
need 
some 
help 
in 
understanding and 
implementing 
new 
methods 
in 
forest management 
planning. 
Second, 
new 
information 
technology 
will 
help institutional 
decision-making 
to 
be 
as 
informed 
as 
possible, 
which 
should 
lead 
to 
management 
planning 
which 
maximizes 
revenues, 
and 
hence, 
ensure 
that 
the 
institutions 
will 
have 
the 
money 
needed 
for 
their 
operations. 
The 
project 
is 
environmentally 
sustainable. 
The 
project 
itself 
has 
only 
limited 
impact 
on 
forest 
resources. 
However, the 
FMIS, 
the 
national 
forest inventory, the 
biodiversity 
strategy, 
and 
the 
methodologies 
for 
participatory 
planning, 
will 
help 
to 
ensure 
that future 
management 
planning 
has 
a 
stronger focus 
on 
environmental 
aspects, 
rather 
than 
on 
purely 
economic 
ones. 
The project 
is 
socially 
sustainable. 
As 
noted 
in 
various 
sections 
above, 
the 
project 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
have 
significant negative social impacts. 
To 
the 
extent 
that social impacts 
are 
revealed 
during 
implementation, 
the 
FMIS 
and 
the 
participatory 
planning 
methodologies 
will 
be 
powerful 
tools 
to 
- 
23 
- 
Page  28
assist 
forest 
offices 
to 
work 
with 
communities 
to 
mitigate 
these 
impacts. 
Communities 
would 
have 
the 
opportunity 
in 
participating 
of 
developing 
forest management plans. 
The 
methods 
for 
eliciting 
participation, and incorporating community 
needs 
into 
management 
plans, 
will 
be 
constantly 
evolving, 
and 
will 
be 
tailored 
to 
individual 
communities' specific 
needs. 
This 
process 
will 
likely 
continue 
after 
the 
project 
is 
over, 
and 
broad 
participation 
is 
expected 
to 
become the 
status 
quo 
within 
the 
medium-term 
(within 
3 
years 
after 
project 
completion).

Acceleratinp 
the 
implementation 
of 
new 
lepal, 
institutional 
and 
economic 
frameworks 
This 
component 
will 
sustain 
BiH’s 
ambitious 
reform 
program 
in 
the forestry 
sector, 
which 
was 
initiated 
in 
1998 
with 
support 
from 
the completed Forestry Project. 
The 
new 
TA 
operation 
will 
help 
both 
entities 
complete 
ongoing 
legal 
reforms; 
implement 
follow-on 
institutional 
re-organizations; 
and make 
necessary 
adjustments 
to 
optimize 
the 
contribution 
of 
forests 
to 
the 
overall 
economic 
development. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
help 
both 
entities 
monitor 
progress 
in 
implementation 
of 
those 
changes 
at 
both 
central 
and 
local 
levels. 
Activities 
under 
Component 
1 
will 
be 
conducted 
in 
both 
entities, 
independently 
but 
concurrently. 
The 
legal, 
institutional 
and 
economic 
reform 
process 
is 
at 
different 
stages 
in 
both 
entities; 
and 
legal 
and 
economic 
reforms 
are 
placed 
under 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
entities’ 
governments. 
A. 
new 
legal and institutional 
frameworks, 
which 
will 
support 
setting 
up 
of 
a 
modem 
forest management 
regime. 
Implementation 
of 
these 
new 
frameworks 
will 
help 
to 
ensure 
the 
sustainable use 
and 
protection 
of 
forest 
resources, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
paving 
the 
way 
to 
an 
autonomous 
and 
self-financing 
forest 
sector 
competitive 
at 
European 
levels. 
Supporting 
the 
sector’s 
institutional 
reforms 
to 
assist 
both 
entities 
in 
the implementation 
of 
In 
the 
Federation, 
a 
Law 
on 
Forests 
has 
been 
approved 
in 
May 
2002. 
The 
law 
calls 
for 
a 
profound 
institutional 
re-organization, 
with 
re-distribution 
of 
mandates, 
and 
new 
contractual 
agreements 
between 
the Federation 
and 
the 
Cantons. 
In 
addition, the 
privatization 
of 
production 
functions 
has 
been 
completed 
in 
several 
cantons, 
although 
in 
different 
ways.  Some 
cantons 
have 
privatized physical 
assets 
(mainly harvesting and 
transportation 
equipment), 
while 
others 
have 
privatized 
up 
to 
49% 
of 
the 
capital 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
joint 
stock company. 
In 
the 
latter 
case, 
the government remains 
the 
biggest 
shareholder 
of 
these 
companies. 
The 
new 
project 
will 
provide 
assistance 
as 
described 
below. 
The project 
will 
work 
at 
the Federation and cantonal 
levels 
with 
the 
Ministries 
in 
charge 
of 
forestry 
to 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
newly 
created 
Forest 
Offices 
(“Federation 
Forest 
Institute” 
and 
“Cantonal Forest 
Institutes”). 
Technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
these 
offices 
will 
be 
focused 
on 
supporting 
an 
improved 
forest 
inspection 
and 
monitoring 
system. 
The 
project 
would 
also 
provide 
basic 
office 
equipment 
for 
all 
forest offices. 
This 
equipment 
will 
consist 
of 
computer hardware 
and 
software, 
and 
networking, 
to 
enable 
efficient communication and coordination 
between the offices. 
Importantly, 
the technical specifications 
for 
the hardware 
will 
take 
into 
account the requirements 
for 
successful 
implementation 
of 
a

System 
(FMIS) through 
Component 
2. 
In 
addition 
to 
assisting the 
newly 
created 
institutions and 
enterprises, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
operational 
support 
to 
the forest 
guards 
and 
forest 
inspectors at 
Federation 
and 
cantonal 
level, 
as 
well 
as 
procurement 
of 
and 
training 
in 
the 
use 
of 
limited 
field 
equipment 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
new 
forest 
law, and 
improve 
transparency 
and 
forest 
governance. 
This 
training, 
together 
with 
that 
provided 
to 
CFCs 
during 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
new 
Forest Management 
Information 
System, 
would 
strengthen the 
capacity 
of 
the 
forest 
guards 
and inspection 
services 
to 
tackle 
ongoing 
illegal logging 
and 
corruption.

As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
new 
law, 
the 
Sumes 
(BH 
and 
HB) 
were 
officially 
abolished, 
the 
separation 
of 
administrative 
and 
economic functions 
was introduced, 
and 
existing 
forest enterprises 
are 
required 
to 
be 
consolidated 
into 
one 
single forest 
enterprise 
(Cantonal 
Forest 
Company 
- 
CFC) 
in 
each 
canton. 
The 
CFCs 
are 
in 
charge 
of 
performing 
all 
commercial 
functions, 
and 
all 
public 
good functions 
except 
for 
inspection and 
control, according 
to 
1 
O-year-management 
plans. 
To 
operationalize 
this 
arrangement, 
new 
contractual 
agreements 
between 
the 
Cantonal 
Ministry 
and the CFCs 
are 
required. 
The 
project 
would 
also 
assist 
in 
the 
finalization 
of 
these 
contractual 
agreements. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
working 
groups 
to 
facilitate 
consensus 
building 
and an 
elaboration 
of 
a detailed, 
phased 
and 
costed 
action 
plan for 
the 
transition 
period, 
as 
well 
as 
support 
a 
study 
tour 
for 
decision-makers. 
Technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
support 
the 
development 
of 
business 
plans, 
which 
will 
include: 
(a) 
a 
human 
resource 
management 
system; 
(b) 
improved 
financial 
management 
and 
accounting 
systems; 
and 
(c) 
an 
annual 
planning, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system. 
The project 
will 
provide 
training, 
based 
on 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
human 
resource 
and 
training 
needs 
within 
CFCs, 
which 
will 
be 
carried out 
in 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation. 
The project 
would 
support: 
(a) 
a 
review 
and 
analysis 
of 
capacity 
of 
CFCs 
in 
financial 
management 
and accounting 
as 
well 
as 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation; 
(b) 
an 
identification 
and 
assessment 
of 
available 
training 
courses 
including 
distance learning; 
(c) 
the 
design 
of 
course 
curricula 
for 
selected staff, 
detailing 
main 
topics, 
duration, 
location, 
training 
methods and 
targeted staff; 
(d) 
the 
identification 
of 
staff 
for 
a 
targeted 
training-for-trainers; 
and 
(e) 
the 
development 
and implementation 
of 
a detailed, 
phased 
and 
costed 
training 
program 
including 
an implementation 
schedule. 
Considering 
the 
ongoing 
privatization 
of 
forest 
equipment 
and 
operations 
within 
most 
forest 
companies, 
additional training 
would 
be 
targeted 
to 
staff 
deciding 
to 
become 
private 
entrepreneurs. 
Republika 
Srpska 
recently 
amended 
its 
forestry 
law 
and completed 
a 
privatization 
process, 
at least 
on 
formal 
grounds. 
The 
introduced 
changes 
were 
relatively 
straightforward, and 
as 
a 
result, 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
provisions 
in 
the forest 
law 
in 
RS 
is 
well 
underway. 
In 
addition 
and 
similar 
to 
the 
training 
provided 
to 
CFCs 
in 
the Federation, 
Srpske 
Sume 
would 
receive 
tailored 
training 
packages. 
As 
in 
the 
Federation, 
the 
Forest 
Inspection 
Service 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project through 
operational 
support 
and 
training 
in 
the 
use 
of 
field 
equipment 
to 
ensure 
an efficient 
forest 
inspection 
and 
compliance 
with 
the 
existing 
forest regulation, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
improve 
transparency 
and forest 
governance. 
B. 
Improving 
the 
economic 
and 
financing 
framework 
Forests 
represent a 
valuable 
resource 
to 
the 
nation 
as 
a 
whole 
and through 
proper 
utilization 
can 
supply 
valuable 
inputs, such 
as 
employment and 
export 
income 
and 
assist 
in 
the reconstruction 
of 
BiH, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Total 
forest 
cover 
is 
2.7 
million 
ha. 
The 
total timber 
production 
is 
about 
4.2 
million 
m3 
per 
year 
(approximately 
half 
in 
RS 
and 
half 
in 
FBH) 
corresponding 
to 
a 
total 
tum-over 
of 
US 
$150 
million 
(proceeds 
from 
timber 
sales 
by 
Forest 
Enterprises 
to 
processing 
industries; 
equivalent 
to 
10% 
of 
the country’s budget 
and 
5% 
of 
GDP). 
Forests 
are 
an 
important 
source 
of 
employment, 
particularly 
in 
timber 
processing 
industries. 
Exports 
of 
BiH 
construction materials 
and high-quality furniture 
generated 
an export 
value 
of 
about 
US 
$250 
million 
prior 
to 
the 
war. 
In 
addition, 
58% 
of 
Bosnia’s 
estimated 
3.5 
million 
people 
live 
in 
rural 
areas, 
and 
rely 
on 
forests 
for 
energy 
fuelwood. 
Forests 
are 
a source 
of 
non-timber 
forest products 
including 
mushrooms 
and 
berries. 
Hunting 
also 
provides 
additional 
revenues. 
BiH’s 
landscapes 
and 
biodiversity 
assets (bears, 
wolves) 
can 
provide 
substantial 
job 
opportunities 
and 
revenues 
from 
tourism. 
The 
forests also 
have 
important 
watershed 
protection 
values 
for much 
of 
the 
middle 
and 
lower 
Danube 
River. 
Forests 
in 
Bosnia 
are 
even 
more important 
given 
the 
relative 
scarcity 
of 
other 
resources. 
The 
country 
is 
covered 
with 
24% 
of 
pasture 
lands, 
and 
has 
only 
10% 
of 
arable 
land.  There 
is 
some 
potential 
for 
aluminum 
production, 
but 
other 
than 
this, 
forests 
are 
the 
most important 
source 
of 
natural 
resource-based 
-

Page  37
revenue 
for 
the 
State, 
Entity 
and 
Cantonal 
govemments. 
The 
forest 
resources 
are 
the 
major 
asset 
that 
generate 
local 
employment 
and 
lead 
the 
development 
of 
other 
sectors 
(transportation, 
etc). 
Since 
the 
collapse 
of 
other 
industries (coal 
mining, 
steel 
industry) 
during 
the 
war, 
timber 
processing 
is 
seen 
as 
the 
“shelter 
sector” 
where employment 
and 
minimum 
incomes 
are 
still 
possible. 
The 
new 
laws 
in 
FBiH 
and 
RS 
improve 
the 
institutional 
setup 
of 
the forest 
sector. 
There 
are 
opportunities however, 
for 
improvements 
in 
financial 
management 
and 
generation 
of 
revenues 
from 
the 
forest 
sector, 
while 
assuring 
sustainable 
forest 
management practices. 
These 
opportunities can 
be 
grouped 
in 
five broad 
categories: 
(a) 
Financial flows:  CFCs and 
Srpske Sume 
prepare accounts 
and 
reports 
of 
forest 
operations 
which 
provide information 
on 
expenditures 
on 
forest 
protection 
and 
regeneration, 
as 
well 
as 
revenues 
from 
sales 
of 
timber.  There 
may 
be 
scope 
for 
separating 
more clearly 
expenditures 
on 
“public 
good 
“ 
functions 
such 
as 
forest protection, 
from 
those 
which 
generate 
revenue. 
Support 
to 
the CFCs and 
Srpske Sume 
in 
reviewing 
accounting 
procedures 
and 
comparing 
them 
with 
good 
practices 
in 
State 
Forest 
Enterprises 
in 
other European countries 
which 
provide 
a 
similar 
mix 
of 
functions 
(e.g. 
Germany, 
France) 
would 
be 
provided, 
together 
with 
training 
in 
improved 
practices 
as 
appropriate. 
Support 
would 
also 
be 
provided 
in 
consolidating, at 
the 
entity 
level, 
information 
obtained 
from 
the 
field 
level, 
and 
review 
of 
financial 
management practices 
by 
CFOs and 
at 
entity level. 
(b) 
Revenues 
from 
forest 
activities 
and 
financing 
Cantonal 
Forest 
Offices: 
Total 
turnover 
from 
timber 
sales 
from 
State 
Forests 
is 
estimated at 
US 
$150 
million. This 
finances 
CFCs’ and 
Srpske Sume’s 
costs, 
including 
costs 
for 
salaries, 
amortization, 
forest 
road 
maintenance, 
control 
of 
forest harvesting 
operations, 
fire 
and 
pest 
management, 
and forest regeneration 
and 
protection. 
18% 
of 
revenue 
from 
sales 
is 
retained 
for 
forest 
regeneration. 
CFCs 
and 
Srpske Sume 
also 
pay 
15% 
of 
revenue 
from 
sales 
of 
fuel-wood 
(accounting 
for 
about 
25% 
of 
the harvest 
in 
volume 
terms) 
as 
turnover 
tax 
to 
the 
Treasury, 
providing 
an estimated 
US 
$7 
million 
per 
year, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
normal 
charges 
on 
personnel, 
and 
profits 
taxes 
of 
30%. 
In 
addition, 
timber 
processing 
enterprises 
pay 
profits 
taxes 
and turnover 
tax 
on 
sale 
of 
final 
products.  Forest 
administration 
in 
RS 
is 
funded through 
the 
budget, 
but 
Cantonal 
forest 
offices 
in 
the Federation 
(whose 
annual operating 
costs are 
estimated 
at 
KM2 
million) 
are 
financed 
by 
a 
0.1% 
tax 
on all 
business 
activities 
in 
those 
cantons. 
There have been 
difficulties collecting 
these 
taxes. 
Support 
would 
be 
provided 
in 
reviewing 
alternative options 
for 
financing 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
CFOs, 
including 
funding 
directly 
from 
the 
budget, 
or from 
a 
dedicated 
forest 
fund 
financed 
out 
of 
timber 
sales. 
(c) 
Timber 
marketing: 
Timber 
prices 
for 
different 
quality 
timber 
are 
based 
on 
a 
minimum 
price 
list 
developed 
at 
Entity 
level, 
though higher 
prices 
may 
be, 
and 
frequently 
are, 
negotiated 
with 
buyers 
from 
the 
processing 
industry, 
especially 
for 
timber 
of 
Grade 
1 
and 
2 
quality. 
These 
price 
lists 
have 
not 
been 
adjusted 
since 1998. 
There 
is 
scope 
for 
reviewing 
and 
refining 
them 
in 
accordance 
with 
latest 
international practice 
on 
timber 
quality 
and 
grading, 
which would 
permit Bosnia 
to 
increase 
the 
value 
per 
cubic 
meter 
of 
its 
forest 
products.  Prices 
are 
generally 
reached 
by 
agreement, 
with 
annual 
contracts 
between 
the 
CFCs 
and 
Srpske Sume 
and timber 
processors. 
There 
would 
be an 
advantage 
in 
piloting 
alternative 
approaches, 
such 
as 
auctions.  Support 
would 
be provided 
to 
development 
of 
an 
approach 
to 
timber 
pricing 
and 
grading 
which 
reflects international 
best practices, 
and 
training 
would 
be 
provided 
to 
CFCs 
and 
Srpske 
Sume 
in 
implementation 
of 
such an 
approach. 
Timber 
processing 
is 
highly 
&verse; 
large 
enterprises 
exist beside 
small 
processing 
enterprises, 
many 
of 
which 
nevertheless 
export 
timber 
products. 
There 
is 
over-capacity, 
in 
part 
because 
large numbers 
of 
small 
enterprises 
sprang 
up 
after 
the 
war, 
and 
much 
processing 
uses 
old 
equipment and 
is 
limited 
to 
primary 
processing 
with 
high 
wastage. 
Access 
to 
credit 
and 
(understandable) 
risk 
aversion 
are 
constraints 
to 
modernization 
of 
the 
sector; 
there 
is 
scope 
nevertheless 
for 
improved 
assortment 
of 
products and 
improved 
market information. 
Support 
would 
be 
provided 
for both 
of 
these.

(d) 
Non-timber 
forest products:  Forests 
are 
used 
for 
collection 
of 
berries, 
mushrooms and other 
products, 
and they 
are 
also 
used 
for 
hunting. 
There 
is 
scope 
for 
increasing forest 
revenues 
from 
these 
activities, 
both 
through more 
active 
management 
of 
these 
products, 
as 
well 
as 
through 
marketing 
and 
possibly 
designation 
of 
certain forest 
areas 
specifically 
for 
these 
activities. 
The project 
would 
finance technical 
assistance, 
training, 
study 
tours 
and 
workshops, 
as 
well 
as 
appropriate software 
for 
provision 
of 
updated 
information 
on 
timber 
pricing. 
Implementation 
would 
be 
coordinated 
with 
representatives 
of 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance, 
Industry 
and 
Agriculture. 
Activities 
would 
be 
developed 
by 
worhng 
groups 
composed 
of 
technical 
staff 
of 
these 
ministries, 
together 
with 
representatives 
from 
CFCs, Srpske 
Sume, 
timber 
processing 
enterprises, 
and 
local 
administrations. 
Project Component 2 
- 
US$2.39 
million 
Strengthening 
of 
Technical Capacity 
for 
Sustainable 
Forest Management 
This 
component 
will 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
economically and 
environmentally-sound  forest 
management at 
the 
level 
of 
Forest 
Management 
Units 
(FMU) 
in 
both 
entities. 
It 
will 
set 
up 
technical 
instruments that 
are 
critical 
to 
ensure 
monitoring 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
BiH’s 
forest 
endowment. 
The 
component 
will 
also 
help 
BiH 
to 
develop 
National 
Standards 
that 
would 
be 
the 
basis 
for 
sustainable 
forest 
management 
and 
Forest 
Certification. 
These standards 
will 
be 
applicable 
for 
the 
whole 
country 
and 
should 
take 
into 
account 
the 
total 
value 
of 
all 
forest functions. 
This 
component 
include 
two 
sets 
of 
activities, 
each 
of 
them 
covering 
both 
entities 
: 
A. 
Development 
of 
a 
GIs-based 
Forest Management 
Information 
System 
(FMIS). 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
technical 
assistance, 
software, 
hardware and 
training 
for 
the 
setting 
up 
and 
maintenance 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
forest 
management 
information 
system. 
This 
GIs-based 
system 
would 
be used 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
managers 
in 
the 
field 
and 
in 
head 
offices 
for 
planning, 
management 
and 
monitoring 
forest 
operations, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
forest 
inspectorate 
for 
supervision. 
It 
will 
ensure 
transparent 
and efficient 
public 
forest 
administration 
functions, 
and 
will 
help 
enforce forest regulations 
and 
combat 
illegal 
activities 
as 
well 
as 
over-harvesting, 
which 
deprives the 
country 
from 
economic 
benefits 
and 
threatens 
the sustainability 
of 
forests. 
Technical, economical 
and 
geographical 
information 
will 
be 
entered 
into 
the 
system 
at 
the 
FMU 
level 
and 
be 
consolidated 
at 
the 
national 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
overall 
management 
decisions. 
The 
FMIS 
will 
cover 
all 
public 
forests, 
and 
private 
forests 
where ownership 
is 
formally 
registered. 
This 
component 
will 
also support 
current 
initiatives 
launched 
at the 
cantonal 
level 
to 
set 
up 
digital 
log-tracking 
system 
with 
a 
view 
to 
supporting future 
certification 
of 
operations. 
It 
will 
comprise 
three 
inter-related modules 
: 
0 
0 
0 
the technical module: 
covering 
data 
from 
forest inventory, 
silvicultural 
and 
regeneration 
operations, 
records and 
forecast 
on 
harvesting 
volume; 
the economical module: 
covering financial 
information 
such 
as 
results 
from 
timber 
sales, 
collection 
of 
fiscal 
revenues, 
and accounting 
of 
forest 
enterprises; 
the 
geographical module: 
each 
FMU 
will 
be 
mapped and 
digitized, 
with 
identification 
of 
conservation 
areas, 
road network 
and harvesting 
operations. 
This 
CIS-mapping module 
will 
be 
developed 
in 
synergy 
with 
the 
protected 
area 
GIS-planning 
effort 
under component 
C, 
and 
both 
together 
will 
provide 
the 
foundation 
of 
a 
Bosnia-wide 
forest 
and 
environment 
land-use 
planning. 
In 
Republika 
Srpska, 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
FMIS 
has 
already 
been 
initiated 
by 
Srpske 
Sume. 
In 
the 
Federation, cantons 
are 
unequally 
advanced 
in 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
information 
systems 
and 
some 
cantons 
still 
need 
to go 
through 
profound 
institutional 
re-arrangements. 
Based 
on 
these 
considerations, 
the 
FMIS 
- 
34 
- 
Page  39
component 
will 
be 
preceded 
by 
an overall feasibility 
study 
that 
will 
assess 
the 
information 
systems 
currently 
in 
place 
and 
under 
development, 
and 
the 
potential 
for 
harmonization. 
It 
is 
likely 
that, 
based 
on 
this 
initial 
assessment, 
the 
component 
will 
be 
implemented 
first 
in 
Republika 
Srpska, 
and 
in 
cantons 
of 
the Federation 
which 
are 
further 
advanced. 
B. 
Implementation 
of 
a 
Bosnia-wide 
forest 
inventory. 
Forest 
inventories 
are 
an integrated 
part 
of 
mid-term 
management 
planning 
with 
the 
intent 
to 
provide 
location-specific 
information 
and 
support 
the 
development 
and implementation 
of 
forest management.  Since 
planning 
agencies 
are 
continually 
updating 
and 
upgrading their 
forest 
inventories, 
the 
age 
of 
the inventories 
is 
changing. 
To 
meet 
changes 
in 
the 
basic 
criteria 
for 
planning, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
revise the 
long-term 
plan, 
whenever 
changes 
are 
substantial. 
Compiling 
information 
from 
mid-term 
management 
plans 
at 
national 
level 
offers 
only 
a snapshot 
of 
different 
aged 
information, collected 
according 
to 
a 
number 
of 
different 
standards 
and 
methodologies. 
To 
provide 
unbiased, 
reliable, and 
reproducible 
forest 
resource 
information 
continuously, 
which 
is 
independent 
from 
ownership 
at 
national 
level, 
many 
countries 
(Switzerland, 
Finland, 
Austria, 
France, 
Lithuania, 
Canada) 
have conducted 
National 
Forest 
Inventories 
(NFIs) 
over 
the 
last 
decades. 
NFIs 
are 
usually 
sampling-based 
inventories 
combining 
measuring 
on 
permanent 
and 
temporary plots, 
and 
their 
assessment 
by 
satellite 
maps, 
as 
well 
as 
aerial photos. 
Between 
1964 and 1968 
a 
First 
National 
Forest 
Inventory 
was 
carried out 
for 
the 
territory 
of 
Former 
Yugoslavia. 
This 
1’ 
NFI 
provided 
overall 
information 
regarding the 
forest 
situation 
in 
BiH 
and 
formed 
the 
basis 
for 
the development 
of 
the current forest 
classification 
system. 
Since 
then, 
the 
information 
has 
been 
updated 
only 
intermittently, 
and 
not 
across 
the entire country, while, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
civil 
war 
and 
related 
causes 
have 
contributed 
to 
great 
damage 
to 
the 
forests. 
To 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
the forest 
resource data at 
the 
national 
level, 
a 
Forest 
Management 
Planning 
Study, 
carried out 
in 
the Bank’s Forestry 
Project calls 
for 
a permanent, 
independent 
NFI, 
which 
should 
be 
established 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
basis 
for: 
(a) 
forest 
monitoring; 
(b) 
forest 
strategy 
and long-term 
planning 
development; 
as 
well 
as 
(c) 
priority 
setting 
for 
forest 
research 
and 
development. 
A 
comprehensive 
methodology 
for 
a 
BiH 
NFI, 
which 
considers 
a 
special 
focus 
on 
biodiversity and 
forest 
protection, 
is 
currently 
being 
developed 
by 
GTZ, 
with 
both 
entities. 
The 
NFI 
based 
on 
this 
methodology 
will 
provide 
detailed and 
reliable 
information 
on 
forest 
resources 
in 
BiH. 
In 
addition 
the 
NFI 
will 
respond 
to 
the need 
to 
methodologically collect 
and 
process data 
on 
biodiversity 
in 
forest 
ecosystems, 
as 
identified 
in 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Action 
Plan 
(NEAP). 
By 
providing 
this 
information 
the 
NFI 
will 
fulfill 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
NEAP 
related 
to: 
(a) 
the ecologic 
classification 
of 
forest 
ecosystem; 
and 
(b) 
assessment 
of 
the 
actual 
state 
of 
bio- 
and geo-diversity 
in 
forests. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
NFI 
will 
facilitate 
the preparation 
of 
maps 
of 
flora 
and 
fauna 
in 
BiH 
using 
internationally 
accepted 
methodologies. 
Information provided 
by 
the 
NFI 
will 
be 
used 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
the 
elaboration 
of 
national 
and 
entity 
policies 
and 
strategies 
for: 
(a) 
developing 
forest 
resources, 
including 
structural 
targets, 
such 
as 
desired 
species 
and 
age 
distribution 
of 
growing 
stocks, 
sustainable 
annual 
cut 
volumes, 
production 
targets 
for 
different 
forest products 
(timber 
for 
saw 
milling, 
fuelwood 
and 
pulp 
production); 
(b) 
environmental 
protection, 
biodiversity 
and ecological 
development 
in 
forests, 
especially 
in 
habitat 
protection 
for 
rare 
or 
endangered 
fauna 
and 
vegetation 
species 
and 
societies; 
(c) 
managing 
and 
utilizing 
non-timber forest 
products 
(NTFPs), 
such 
as 
mushrooms, 
berries, 
snails 
and 
game; 
(d) 
improving 
watershed 
management, 
erosion 
control 
and 
soil 
protection 
in 
high 
mountain 
areas 
and 
Karst 
ecosystems; 
(e) 
forest 
land 
use 
planning 
with 
effects 
on 
forest 
land, such 
as 
infrastructure planning, 
land 
development 
planning, 
identifying

priority 
areas 
for 
conversion 
into 
agricultural 
use 
or 
vise 
versa, 
and 
planning 
of 
industrialized 
zones; 
(f) 
other economic 
land 
utilization, 
especially 
for 
development 
of 
tourism 
(hiking, 
mountaineering, 
rafting 
and 
canoeing 
on 
rivers 
and 
lakes); 
and 
(g) 
promoting 
and 
developing 
wood 
processing 
industries 
(identification 
of 
priority 
regions 
and 
sites 
for 
industries 
based 
on 
availability 
of 
required 
raw 
material), 
NFIs 
help 
to 
filfill 
reporting 
requirements 
of 
international 
commitments, 
including 
the 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
Protection 
of 
Forests, 
the 
Kyoto 
Process, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Convention 
on Biological 
Diversity 
(CBD). 
The 
assessment 
methodology 
will 
be 
an 
interactive 
process, 
in 
which 
interpretation 
of 
satellite 
data and 
field 
evaluation 
will 
be 
alternating 
and complementary.  Pre-selection, 
field 
assessment, 
and 
final/additional interpretation 
of 
satellite 
data 
will 
carried out 
as 
consecutive 
and 
interactive 
steps. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
inventory 
over a two-year 
period 
by 
including local 
expertise 
to 
the 
maximum 
extent possible. 
While 
being 
carried out 
in 
both 
entities 
simultaneously, 
the 
NFI 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
synergy 
with 
the 
development 
of 
the 
FMIS. 
In 
addition, 
it 
would 
assist 
in 
the 
harmonization 
of 
Forest Management 
Standards 
in 
both 
entities. 
Project 
Component 
3 
- 
US$0.60 
million 
Promoting Biodiversity 
and 
Forest 
Conservation 
in 
both 
entities 
This 
component 
will 
address 
the 
fact that 
only 
0.55% 
of 
BiH’s 
territory 
is 
formally 
protected (NEAP 
2003, 
World 
Conservation 
Monitoring 
Center-UNEP 
website). 
It 
will 
respond 
to 
political 
determination 
in 
both 
entities 
to 
take 
better 
advantage 
of 
the 
country’s 
position 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
Europe, 
and 
its 
unique 
landscape 
and 
biodiversity 
endowment.  Bosnia’s 
natural 
habitats and 
game 
resources have 
the 
potential 
to 
support 
a 
significant 
tourism 
industry 
and 
provide 
employment 
in 
rural 
areas. 
This 
component 
will 
be 
fully 
funded 
by 
a 
grant 
from 
the 
Italian 
Government. 
Importantly, 
this 
component 
will 
pave the 
way 
for 
a 
GEF 
project 
on 
biodiversity 
conservatiodprotected 
areas 
in 
CY2004/2005. 
The 
component 
will 
be 
conducted 
jointly 
in 
both 
entities 
in 
coordination 
with 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Steering Committee 
comprised 
of 
both 
Ministries 
of 
Environment, 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
relevant forest 
institutions 
and 
organizations. 
The 
project 
will 
develop 
three 
complementary 
sets 
of 
activities: 
A. 
finalization 
of 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Action 
Plan 
(NEAP) 
(publication 
date 
March 
2003), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
recent 
ratification 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Biological Diversity 
(CBD). 
As 
discussed 
in 
the 
Main 
Sector 
Issues 
and 
Government 
Strategy 
section 
of 
the 
main 
text 
(Section 
B.2.), 
Bosnia 
and Herzegovina 
has 
a 
rich 
biodiversity 
due 
to 
its 
location 
in 
three 
distinct geological 
and 
climatic 
regions. 
The 
main 
problem identification 
and 
analysis 
related 
to 
biodiversity 
issues 
has 
already been 
completed 
in 
the 
NEAP. 
In 
addition, 
the 
NEAP 
outlines 
the 
goals 
and 
measures 
necessary 
for 
protection 
and 
enhancement 
of 
BiH’s 
biodiversity 
assets. 
Goals include: 
protection 
and balanced 
management 
of 
biological, 
geological and 
landscape 
diversity; 
classification 
of 
ecosystems 
as 
a precursor 
for 
sustainable 
protection 
and 
management; 
improvement 
of 
the 
legislative background 
for 
protection 
and 
sustainable management 
of 
biodiversity; treating 
biodiversity 
as 
one 
of 
the 
functions 
of 
development 
of 
BiH; 
assessment 
of 
the 
actual 
state 
of 
biodiversity 
from 
the 
aspect 
of 
endangerment; 
promotion 
of 
environmental 
education and 
information; 
and 
establishment 
of 
a 
monitoring 
system. 
Measures 
to 
achieve 
these 
goals 
include: 
passing 
of 
basic 
legislation 
relevant 
to 
biodiversity, 
in 
accordance 
with 
EU 
criteria, respecting 
local 
ecologic, 
economic 
and 
political 
specificities; preparation 
of 
maps 
of 
flora 
and 
fauna 
using 
internationally 
accepted methodologies; 
ensuring 
conditions 
(on 
an 
expert 
basis) 
for 
signing 
and/or 
ratification 
of 
international 
documents 
relevant 
for 
sustainable management 
and 
protection 
of 
biodiversity; 
preparation 
of 
programs 
and 
standards 
for 
sustainable 
use 
of 
biological 
resources 
in 
order 
to gain 
economic 
profit 
Development 
of 
a 
National 
Biodiversity 
Strategy 
(NBS). 
This 
follows 
naturally 
from 
the

and 
reduce 
poverty 
in 
BiH; 
and 
preparation 
of 
an 
estimate 
of 
the current 
state 
of 
endangered 
flora 
and 
fauna. 
The 
Goals 
and 
Measures 
provide 
a 
strong 
foundation 
on which 
a 
national 
strategy can 
be 
formulated. 
Importantly, the 
participatory framework required 
for 
preparation 
of 
a 
National Biodiversity 
Strategy 
has 
been 
successfully 
employed 
to 
prepare the 
NEAP. 
Further, 
and 
also 
critically 
important, the 
institutional 
framework 
at the 
State 
level 
is 
in 
place, 
including 
a 
Biodiversity 
Committee under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Physical 
Planning 
and 
Environment 
for 
FBiH, 
which 
reports 
to 
the Environment 
and 
Sustainable 
Development 
Steering Committee, 
under the 
Ministry 
of 
Foreign 
Trade 
and Economic 
Relations. 
The institutional 
arrangements 
planned 
for 
the 
carrying 
out 
of 
the 
NBS 
build 
on 
the 
successful 
model 
of 
the 
NEAP, 
though 
with 
a 
smaller 
worhng 
group. 
Participatory 
processes 
and 
the 
use 
of 
local 
expertise 
will 
be 
emphasized 
in 
the 
methodology 
adopted 
in 
preparing the 
NBS. 
To 
guide 
the 
technical 
process, a 
number 
of 
thematic 
groups, 
comprising 
experts 
in 
biodiversity, biology, 
land 
use 
planning, forestry, 
park 
management, 
and 
other 
fields 
to 
be 
determined, 
as 
well 
as 
community 
groups 
and 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society, 
will 
also 
be 
formed. 
To 
achieve 
this 
level 
of 
involvement, 
which 
is 
critical 
to 
the 
successful 
completion 
of 
the 
NBS, 
the 
project 
will 
support: 
National level 
workshops 
in 
which 
all 
relevant parties 
will 
participate. 
Project 
funding 
will 
include 
provision 
of 
workshop 
space 
facilitation 
services, 
and 
local 
travel and 
per 
diems 
for 
participants. 
The project 
would 
also 
provide for 
dissemination 
of 
workshop 
results. 
Funding 
for 
field 
consultations 
in 
each 
of 
the 
ten 
Federation 
Cantons, 
each 
of 
the 
RS 
Regions, 
numerous 
municipalities 
in 
each 
Entity, 
and 
District 
Brcko. 
Funding 
for 
target 
roundtable 
discussions 
on 
specific 
themes, 
and 
lectures 
(for 
representatives 
of 
businesses, 
NGOs, scientific 
institutions, 
etc.), 
as 
well 
as 
media 
appearances 
and interviews.

In 
addition 
to 
guidance 
provided 
by 
the 
Goals 
and 
Measures 
of 
the 
NEAP, 
the 
“First 
Draft” 
maps 
of 
proposed protected 
areas 
prepared under 
sub-component 
B 
below 
will 
be 
help 
to 
guide the 
work 
of 
the 
NBS 
teams. 
The 
final 
output 
of 
this 
process 
will 
be 
a 
National 
Biodiversity 
Strategy, 
which 
incorporates 
the 
goals 
and 
measures 
of 
the 
NEAP. 
B. 
up 
to 
5% 
of 
the 
territory 
in 
both 
entities. 
As 
noted, 
only 
a 
very 
small 
percentage 
of 
BiH’s 
territory 
is 
formally 
protected. 
The 
GIs-based 
mapping 
effort and 
ground-truth 
operations 
to be 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
National 
Forest 
Inventory 
(NFI) 
under 
Component 
2B 
will 
provide 
the complete 
detail 
and 
scientific 
rigor for 
longer-term protected 
area 
planning 
throughout the country.  However, 
this 
will 
take at least 
18 
months 
to 
complete. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
it 
is 
desirable 
to 
quickly identify 
areas 
which 
might 
be 
suitable 
for 
protected 
status. 
Drawing 
up 
of 
preliminary 
proposals 
for 
a 
country-wide protected area network, 
covering 
First, 
with 
the recent 
signing 
of 
the 
CBD, 
BiH 
is 
now 
able 
to 
access 
GEF 
Grant 
funds, 
and 
a 
GEF 
project 
proposal 
is 
under 
development; 
full 
preparation 
is 
expected 
to 
begin 
in 
late 
2003, 
with 
approval expected 
by 
Fall 
2004. 
This 
new 
GEF 
project 
will 
have 
a 
specific focus 
on 
protected 
area 
development 
and 
biodiversity 
protection, 
and 
hence 
it 
is 
preferable 
if 
potential protected 
areas 
can 
be identified 
prior 
to 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
NFI. 
Second, 
along 
with 
the 
standard 
inventory 
of 
forest 
stock, 
this 
NFI 
will 
have 
a 
‘green’ 
element, 
focusing 
on 
quantifying 
critical 
habitat 
for 
biodiversity. 
With 
a 
preliminary 
identification 
of 
possible protected 
areas 
in 
hand, 
the 
NFI 
teams 
will 
be 
in 
a 
much 
better 
position 
to know 
which 
areas 
to 
target 
for 
in-depth 
analysis 
of 
the 
‘green’ 
elements 
of 
their 
work. 
Fortunately, 
BiH 
possesses 
substantial 
internal 
expertise 
which 
can 
be 
drawn 
on to 
develop 
preliminary 
proposals 
for 
potential 
new 
protected 
areas.

biodiversity and 
natural 
heritage. 
Under 
the 
IDA-funded 
Forestry Project, the 
Institute 
for 
Protection 
of 
Cultural, Historical, and 
Natural 
Heritage 
(IPCHNH) 
completed 
an ecological 
survey 
of 
high 
conservation 
value 
areas 
in 
production 
forests, 
which 
provided 
recommendations 
for 
integrating 
protection 
measures 
into 
forest 
management 
planning. 
Representatives 
from 
the 
Biodiversity 
Committee 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Physical 
Planning 
and 
Environment, 
available 
NEAP 
participants, 
and 
the 
IPCHNH, 
along 
with 
other relevant 
experts 
in, 
inter 
alia, 
forestry, 
biodiversity, biology, 
land 
use 
planning, and 
park 
management, 
as 
well 
as 
community 
groups and 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society, 
will 
be 
brought 
together 
for 
a 
series 
of 
intensive workshops 
to 
reach 
agreement 
on 
a 
“first 
draft” 
set 
of 
maps 
proposing 
a 
nationwide 
network 
of 
protected 
areas. 
The 
primary 
criteria 
for 
consideration 
of 
protected 
status 
would 
be 
the 
presence 
of 
critically 
important 
habitats 
for 
biodiversity 
conservation, 
and 
appropriateness 
of 
protection, 
taking 
into 
account 
political, 
social, 
and 
economic 
aspects. 
Proposed 
areas 
should 
also 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
goals 
and 
measures 
outlined 
in 
NEAP 
Chapter 
5.7.3. 
The 
areas 
would 
be 
ranked 
in 
order 
of 
importance 
for 
protection, 
e.g. 
Critical, 
Significant, 
Modest, 
or 
Marginal 
(or 
any 
appropriate 
ranking 
determined 
by 
participants). 
Regardless 
of 
ranking, 
each 
area 
in 
the proposed 
network 
will 
be 
assigned 
a 
tentative 
protection 
category 
(according 
to 
Table 
11 
in 
Chapter 
5 
of 
the 
NEAP), 
and 
will 
show the 
core 
areas 
suitable 
for 
full 
protection 
status, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
multipurpose 
management 
area 
in 
the surrounding 
buffer 
zones. 
In 
addition 
to 
supporting the 
GEF 
and the 
NFI, 
this 
initial 
map 
of 
proposed 
areas 
would 
provide 
guidance 
to 
the 
formulation 
of 
the 
National Biodiversity 
Strategy. 
It 
is 
expected that 
2 
to 
3 
workshops, 
over 
the 
first 
3 
months 
of 
the 
project, 
would 
be 
held, 
followed 
by 
a 
concluding 
session 
which 
will 
agree 
on 
the 
“first 
draft”. 
The 
workshops 
would 
take place 
in 
appropriate 
locations 
in 
RS 
and the 
FBiH. 
The project 
would 
provide 
workshop 
space, 
facilitation 
services, 
and 
local 
travel 
and 
per 
diems 
for 
participants. 
The project 
would 
also 
provide 
for 
dissemination 
of 
workshop 
results, 
including 
printing 
of 
maps. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
while 
the 
workshop 
process 
will 
be broadly 
participatory, 
any 
formal 
recommendations 
to 
the government 
for 
delineation 
of 
any 
area 
for 
protected 
status 
could not go forward 
until 
affected communities have 
been 
fully 
involved. 
Sub-component 
C 
will 
be 
targeted 
to 
this 
effort. 
It 
should 
also 
be 
stressed 
again that the 
goal 
of 
this 
project 
is 
not to 
create 
any 
protected 
area, 
but 
rather 
to 
establish 
the 
detailed 
information 
and 
participation 
framework 
that 
would 
be 
needed 
for 
establishment 
under 
a 
later project. 
C. 
various 
initiatives becoming 
available 
to 
BiH 
for 
protected 
area 
establishment, 
including 
those 
planned 
under 
this 
project, 
involvement 
of 
a 
much 
broader 
stakeholder 
community 
in 
the decision-malung 
process 
towards 
establishment 
of 
new 
protected 
areas 
will 
be 
essential. 
The 
broad 
stakeholder 
community 
would 
include 
local 
population, municipalities,  government 
institutions 
at 
the 
local 
and 
State 
level, forest 
enterprises, 
civil 
society, 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
Importantly, 
decisions 
on 
new 
protected 
areas 
must 
take 
into 
account 
the importance 
of 
these 
areas 
to 
community 
livelihoods. 
In 
keeping 
with 
the 
‘landscape 
approach’, 
protected 
areas 
must 
serve 
multiple 
purposes, 
and 
should 
not 
curtail 
local 
population 
access 
to 
traditional 
use 
of 
resources. 
Setting 
up 
the 
standard 
procedures 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
consultation 
process. 
With 
the 
The 
project 
will 
assist 
BiH 
to 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
methodology 
for 
this 
purpose. 
The methodology 
will 
be 
based 
on 
available 
‘best 
practices’, 
which 
include 
transparency,  presence 
of 
robust 
technical 
information, and 
consultation 
procedures 
which 
include affected 
communities. 
The 
proposed 
methodology 
will 
be 
developed 
by 
taking 
into 
consideration 
expertise 
available 
in 
BiH. 
Field-testing 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
the 
Igman-Bjelasnica 
area, 
which 
has 
been 
proposed 
as 
a 
National 
Park 
by 
a 
feasibility 
-

Page  43
study 
funded under 
the completed Forestry Project. 
This 
area 
is 
also 
highly 
relevant 
as 
a test 
case, 
because 
a 
social 
assessment 
carried out 
in 
the preparation 
of 
the 
FDCP 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
(e.g. 
park 
boundaries, 
access 
to 
resource, 
mine 
contamination, 
etc.) 
related 
to 
the 
proposed 
park, and 
established 
key 
community 
contacts. 
This 
social 
assessment 
also 
indicates 
a 
strong willingness 
on 
the 
part 
of 
these 
communities 
to 
collaborate 
in 
park 
planning 
activities. 
Therefore, 
testing the methodology 
in 
this 
area 
would 
serve 
two 
purposes. 
First, 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
methodology 
could 
quickly be 
determined 
and further 
developed. 
Second, 
while 
the 
feasibility 
study 
proposes 
an 
area 
of 
approximately 
120,000 
ha, 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
that the proposed 
park 
dimensions 
are 
appropriate, 
particularly 
from 
social 
and 
political 
points 
of 
view. 
The political 
dimension 
is 
especially 
important 
since 
the proposed 
park 
area 
overlaps 
both 
RS 
and 
FBiH. 
The project 
would 
support 
field 
surveys 
and 
consultation, 
as 
well 
as 
stakeholder workshops, 
including 
local 
travel and 
per 
diems. 
The 
output 
from 
this 
activity 
will 
be 
an 
Operational 
Sourcebook 
which 
will 
provide 
guidelines 
for 
consultation 
processes, 
including 
design 
of 
surveys, 
methods 
for 
facilitating 
broad 
stakeholder 
participation, 
conflict 
resolution 
techniques, 
and collaboration 
with 
technical 
specialists. 
The 
Sourcebook 
would 
also 
provide 
‘Lessons

Assessment 
of 
the 
apencv’s 
capacitv 
to 
implement urocurement 
In 
Republika 
Srpska, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
Federation 
of 
BH, 
the implementation 
functions 
(procurement, 
management, 
reporting  and 
auditing) 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
performed 
by 
the 
existing Project 
Implementation 
Units 
(PIUs) 
within 
Ministry 
in 
line 
of 
respective 
Entities 
of 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina. 
The 
PIUs 
are 
the 
same 
as 
for 
the Bosnia and Herzegovina 
Small 
Scale 
Commercial 
Agriculture 
Development 
Project 
(SSCADP), 
negotiated 
in 
February 
2003. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the capacity 
of 
the 
PIUs 
to 
implement 
procurement 
actions 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
preparation 
of 
the  SSCADP. 
The 
findings 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
assessment 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
Forest 
Development  and 
Conservation 
Project 
FDCP). 
Both 
PIUs 
have 
limited 
experience 
with 
World 
Bank 
financed 
projects. 
The Overall 
Procurement 
ksk 
has 
been 
assessed 
as 
“High” 
for 
this 
Project. 
The 
procurement capacity should 
be 
strengthened 
-46- 
Page  51
by 
additional training 
of 
the 
PIU 
procurement 
staff. 
In 
addition,  the 
procurement 
specialist based 
in 
the 
World 
Bank 
Resident 
Mission 
in

should 
explain 
Bank 
procurement 
procedures 
in 
detail 
during

Summary 
of 
the

Management 
Assessment 
Country 
Issues. 
A 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) for 
BiH 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
2001. 
The draft 
CFAA 
identifies 
weaknesses 
in 
public 
sector 
budgeting, accounting, 
reporting, 
and 
auditing. 
The 
CFAA 
therefore 
recommends 
a 
medium to 
longer-term goal 
of 
mainstreaming 
project 
management 
into

and 
Departments, 
and 
of 
consolidating implementing 
units 
and 
refraining 
from 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
ones. 
Accordingly, 
this 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
PIUs 
with 
experience 
of 
implementing 
the 
previous 
Forestry 
project and 
thereby 
ring-fencing 
the project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements. 
In 
addition, 
the 
draft 
CFAA 
identifies 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
country’s 
banking 
sector. 
Consequently, 
the 
Special Accounts 
for 
the project 
will 
be 
opened 
in 
commercial banks 
assessed 
as 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Both 
Forestry 
PIUs 
have 
the 
advantage 
of 
having 
experienced 
financial 
managers 
with 
extensive 
experience 
from 
IDA 
projects 
as 
well 
as 
projects financed 
from 
other 
sources. 
Both 
of 
them 
satisfy the 
Bank’s 
minimum 
requirements 
for being 
financial managerdproject

The 
IDA

would 
be 
lent 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
BiH, 
which 
would 
onlend 
the 
proceeds 
to 
the 
Federation 
and 
to 
Republika

The 
Credit 
would 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
Forestry 
PIUs 
under 
the 
overall responsibility 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture, Water 
Management 
and Forestry 
(MAWF) 
in 
the 
Federation, 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture, 
Forestry 
and Water 
Resources 
(MAFW) 
in 
Republika 
Srspka. 
The 
main 
task 
of 
the 
PIU 
is 
to 
prepare 
new 
projects, 
as 
well 
carrying 
out 
annual planning, 
financial 
management, 
contracting and

Directors report 
to 
the 
Ministers 
of 
Agriculture 
in 
the 
respective 
Entities. 
The 
Forestry 
PIU 
in 
the 
Federation 
has 
implemented the previous Forestry Project and 
will 
also 
be 
implementing 
the Small-scale 
Commerical Agricultural 
Development (SSCAD) 
Project.

The 
total project

for 
RS 
and 
the Federation 
would 
be 
US 
$5.09 
million

of 
which 
US 
$3.74 
million 
would 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
IDA

US 
$0.6

the 
Italian 
Government, 
and 
US 
$0.75 
million from 
the 
two 
Entity 
Governments. 
The 
counterpart

would 
be 
transferred 
to 
a 
“government”

managed 
by 
the 
PMU 
and

Two 
IDA 
Special 
Accounts 
would 
be 
established 
(one 
for 
each 
PIU), 
and 
both 
these 
Special

would 
be 
held 
in 
commercial

Also, the 
PIUs 
would 
maintain 
local

The 
Forestry 
PIU 
in 
the Federation 
consists 
of 
a 
Director 
(appointed 
by 
the 
Entity 
Government 
in 
the 
Federation),  a 
Finance 
Manager, 
and 
a 
Procurement 
Specialist. 
The 
Forestry 
PIU 
in 
RS 
consists 
of 
a 
Director 
(appointed 
by 
the 
Entity 
Government 
of 
RS), 
a 
Finance 
Manager, 
a 
Procurement 
Specialist 
(consultant), 
and 
a 
Staff

In 
both 
implementing 
units 
the

Accounting 
Policies and Procedures. 
There 
is 
a 
separate 
project 
underway, 
financed 
by 
USAID, 
to 
strengthen 
financial 
management 
in 
the 
two 
Entity 
Governments, 
but 
this 
project 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
fully 
implemented. 
Project 
accounting 
is 
therefore 
maintained 
within 
the 
implementing 
units. 
Accounting 
procedures 
are set 
out 
in 
the Financial 
Management Manuals. 
In 
the 
Federation, 
the Forestry 
PIU 
will 
use 
the 
same 
accounting 
software, 
accounting 
policies and 
procedures 
for 
both 
the Forestry 
Development and 
Conservation Project and the 
Small-scale 
Commerical Agriculture Development 
(SSCAD)  Project. 
In 
RS, a 
completely 
new 
financial 
management 
manual 
has 
been 
prepared. 
Both 
manuals 
have 
been 
found 
to be 
satisfactory, 
and 
hence 
to 
meet 
the financial 
management 
requirements 
for 
Board 
presentation. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
Internal 
Audit. 
The 
PIUs 
have 
no 
internal audit 
function 
and none 
is 
considered 
necessary 
given 
the 
small 
size 
of 
the 
organizations. 
External 
Audit. 
Audit 
arrangement 
are 
entirely 
between the Government 
of 
BiH 
and 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers 
(Netherlands). 
The 
State 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
Treasury 
of 
BiH 
has 
a 
three-year 
contract 
(2001 
-2003) 
with 
Price 
Waterhouse 
Coopers, 
Netherlands 
for 
the audits 
of 
WB-financed 
projects 
(with 
the exception 
of 
revenue-earning projects). 
According to 
the 
master 
agreement, 
the 
audited project financial 
statements 
would 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
(6) 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the Government’s 
fiscal 
year. 
The audit 
agreement has 
had 
the effect 
that 
most audit 
reports 
in 
BIH 
have been submitted 
on 
time. 
Audit 
reports 
for 
project 
financial 
statements 
include opinions 
on 
the 
project 
financial 
statement 
(including 
statements 
of 
expenditures), 
the Special Account, 
and 
on 
the 
company’s 
internal control 
arrangements 
and cover 
all 
financial 
sources 
(IDA, 
Tmst 
Funds, 
Government 
accounts, 
etc.). 
Projects 
managed 
by 
the 
PIUs 
have 
in 
the 
past 
submitted 
satisfactory audited 
financial 
statements 
on 
time 
and 
have also 
complied 
with 
all 
other 
FM 
requirements such 
as 
submitting 
satisfactory 
PMRs 
on 
time. 
As 
the 
BIH’s 
Treasury 
auditing 
arrangements 
with 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers 
(Netherlands)  are 
satisfactory 
to 
the Association, 
it 
has 
been agreed that 
these 
audit 
arrangements 
should 
be 
extended 
to 
this 
project. 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers 
(Netherlands) 
would 
audit 
each 
of 
the 
implementing 
units 
separately, 
and 
issue 
separate 
Audit 
Reports 
as 
well 
as 
Management Letters. 
They 
would 
also 
audit 
the consolidated 
project

The 
Terms 
of

used 
would

issued 
by 
the 
BiH 
State 
Ministry 
of

Audit 
Opinions

Even 
if 
other 
audit 
arrangements 
were 
to 
be 
proposed 
for 
the 
BiH 
portfolio, 
the 
Bank’s 
general 
requirements 
would 
apply. 
The audit 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
appropriate 
auditing 
principles 
consistently 
applied. 
The 
contract 
for 
the audit 
would 
be 
extended 
from 
year 
to 
year 
with 
the 
same 
auditor, subject 
to 
satisfactory performance.

The 
Forestry 
PIU 
in 
RS 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
purchasing 
an 
accounting 
software 
developed 
and used 
in 
the 
Federation 
for 
a 
number 
of 
projects. 
However, 
until 
the 
software 
has 
been installed, 
implemented, 
tested, 
and 
the 
users 
trained 
in 
its 
use, 
all 
of 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
June 
30,2003,  the 
RS 
PIU 
will 
continue 
to 
use 
the 
manual 
accounting 
system 
that 
was 
used satisfactorily 
under 
the 
first 
Forestry 
Project. 
The 
Forestry 
PIU 
in 
the Federation 
has 
already 
procured 
(under the 
SSCAD 
Project) accounting 
software 
from RS 
to be 
also 
used 
for 
the 
Forestry 
Project. 
Both 
of 
these 
accounting software 
packages 
have 
been 
successfully 
used 
in 
the 
other 
WB 
projects. 
Both 
systems 
will 
be 
able 
to: 
(i) 
record 
the 
transactions 
of 
the project; 
(ii) 
provide 
reliable 
financial information 
for 
managing 
and 
monitoring 
project 
activities; and 
(iii) 
provide 
quarterly 
FMRs 
and/or 
PMRs 
on 
a 
timely 
basis. 
The 
systems 
are

reflect 
the 
sources 
of 
funds 
and can 
be 
broken 
down into 
different

of 
expenditures 
for 
the 
project. 
Further, 
they 
provides 
information 
on 
the

and 
are 
able 
to 
produce

comparing 
budget 
with

The 
systems are 
capable 
of 
providing 
financial

to 
measure 
performance 
when 
linked to 
the outputs 
of 
the

Both

This 
documentation 
would 
be 
made 
available 
for 
the 
required audit 
as 
well 
as 
to 
Bank 
Supervision 
Missions, and

Total 
Special account: 
To 
facilitate 
timely 
project 
implementation,  the  Government 
of 
BiH 
would 
establish, 
maintain 
and 
operate, 
under 
terms 
and conditions 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
two 
Special 
Accounts, 
denominated 
in 
Euro, 
with 
either 
Special 
Account 
for 
the 
accounting 
purposes 
of 
the Federation and 
RS, 
respectively. 
Before 
a 
bank 
is 
selected 
to 
hold 
either 
Special 
Account,  the 
Borrower 
shall 
provide 
sufficient 
information 
for 
IDA 
to 
make 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
true 
diligence 
of 
the 
bank 
in 
question.

Supervision 
Plan. 
The 
frequency 
of 
supervision 
would 
be 
dependent 
on 
the 
Project’s 
Risk 
rating. 
During 
supervision 
missions 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management and 
disbursement 
arrangements 
(including 
a 
review 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
SOEs 
and 
movements 
on 
the 
Special 
Account) 
would 
be 
reviewed 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
minimum fiduciary 
requirements. 
The 
Country 
FMS 
would 
review 
the 
FMRs 
for 
the 
project 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
and 
the 
results 
andor 
issues 
would 
be 
followed 
up 
during 
the 
supervision missions. 
The 
Audited Project 
Financial 
Statements 
for 
the 
PIus 
would 
be 
reviewed 
and 
identified 
issues 
would 
be 
followed 
up 
with 
each 
implementing 
unit.

Summary Social Assessment 
BOSNIA 
AND 
HERZEGOVINA: FOREST DEVELOPMENT 
AND 
CONSERVATION PROJECT 
1. 
Research 
was 
hired to 
carry 
out 
a 
Social 
Assessment 
of the proposed 
project under 
the 
general guidance 
of 
a 
World 
Bank 
Social 
Development 
Specialist. 
This 
annex presents 
the summary 
of 
findings 
of 
this 
assessment 
and 
their 
impact 
for 
project 
design and 
implementation. 
The 
SA 
was 
carried out 
mainly 
focusing 
on 
the 
IgmanBjelasnica mountain 
ranges, 
an 
area 
in 
which 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
establish 
a 
National 
Park. 
Although 
the 
area 
and 
population 
living 
in 
it 
are 
not 
entirely 
representative 
for 
BiH 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
findings 
allow 
the 
identification 
of 
key 
development 
issues 
related 
to 
forest 
use, 
stakeholder 
interaction 
and 
socio-economic 
conditions. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Forest 
Development 
and

Project 
(FDCP),

Social 
Assessment 
Objectives 
and 
Methodology 
2. 
improve 
design and 
implementation 
of 
the 
FDCP. 
Particular 
focus has 
been 
given 
to: 
(a) 
assessing 
the 
existing 
socio-economic 
conditions 
of 
the 
population 
likely 
affected 
by 
the project; 
(b) 
gaining an 
understanding 
of 
how 
local 
stakeholders 
presently 
use 
the 
forest 
(fuelwood, 
timberhon-timber 
products, 
recreation 
and 
employment (formal 
and informal 
sector); 
(c) 
consulting 
stakeholders 
on 
the perceived 
constraints 
and opportunities 
envisaged 
under 
the project, 
including 
relationships 
between 
local 
communities and forest 
authorities, 
and 
job 
opportunities; 
and 
(d) 
evaluating whether activities carried 
out 
under 
the project 
would 
have social and economic impacts 
to 
the population.. 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
the 
SA 
was 
to 
establish 
sufficient social 
information 
and 
documentation 
to

methods 
were 
focus groups 
and in-depth interviews 
in 
the 
municipalities 
of 
Hadzici, Ilidza, 
Kalinovik, 
Kiseljak, 
Konjic, 
Kresevo, 
Tmovo 
FBiH 
and Trnovo RS.  Public 
opinion 
poll-survey 
plus 
personal 
interviews and 
telephone 
interviews 
were 
applied 
as 
quantity 
methods. 
A 
Guide 
for 
Discussions 
and 
Organized Focus Groups 
was 
created. 
7 
group 
discussions 
were 
held. 
Local 
population, 
selected 
on 
the 
“head 
of 
household” 
principle 
participated 
in 
the 
discussions. 
The 
groups 
were 
formed 
in 
the 
participants’ residential 
areas. 
A 
total 
of 
9 
in-depthhemi-structured 
interviews 
was 
conducted 
with 
the 
representatives 
of 
different 
key 
groups 
(municipalities, 
State 
Forest Enterprises 
(SFEs)). 
Telephone 
interviewing 
was 
conducted 
with 
a 
representative sample 
of 
750 
respondents 
from 
whole 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
using 
random 
selection 
of 
the 
telephone numbers. 
A 
method of 
personal 
interviews 
was 
used 
as 
a 
part 
of 
public opinion 
poll 
and 
included 
almost 
330 
respondents 
randomly 
selected 
(using 
the 
“Random 
Walk” 
method) 
on 
the 
territory 
covered 
by 
the 
SA. 
During 
the 
sample designing, 
it 
was 
taken 
into 
account 
to 
conduct 
a 
survey 
in 
the 
cities 
and 
suburban 
areas 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
villages. 
The

war 
most 
inhabitants were 
employed 
in 
the forest 
sector 
and 
timber-processing 
industry, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
they 
worked 
as 
cattle 
breeders 
and 
farmers. 
After 
the 
war, 
the situation 
has 
changed 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
as 
factories 
and 
companies 
are 
not 
operating 
anymore, 
the 
financial situation 
is 
not allowing 
the 
renewal 
of 
the 
livestock 
fund, 
and 
there 
are 
no 
incentives 
and 
conditions 
for 
the 
selling 
of 
agricultural 
products. 
Many 
inhabitants have 
not 
found 
any 
alternative 
source 
of 
regular income. 
Limited 
sources 
of 
income 
are 
the 
major problem 
leading 
to 
other problems 
as 
well: 
low 
standard 
of 
living, 
poor 
infrastructure 
- 
roads, 
schools, 
sewage system, 
very 
few 
social 
(and 
cultural) 
events, 
young 
people 
leaving 
the country, 
etc. 
The 
general 
economic situation 
in 
the 
IgmadBjelasnica 
area 
is 
extremely 
difficult. Before

source 
of 
regular income. 
One 
third 
of 
respondents 
receive 
income 
from 
engagement 
in 
temporary jobs, 
one 
third 
receives 
a 
pension, 
and 
a 
very 
low 
percentage 
of 
respondents 
receive 
income 
from 
other 
sources. 
In 
terms 
of 
non-commercial 
subsistance 
activities, 
the 
first 
ranked 
is 
woodcutting 
for 
their 
own 
purposes 
- 
heating 
(30% 
of 
the 
households), 
then 
milk 
and 
cheese 
production 
(20% 
and 
17% 
of 
households). 
Very few 
households 
carry 
out 
these 
activities 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
generating income. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
first 
ranked 
is 
sale 
of 
milk 
(1 
3%) 
and 
cheese 
selling 
(10% 
of 
households), 
fresh 
meat 
(4%) 
and 
butter 
(3% 
of 
households). 
As 
already 
mentioned, 
sources 
of 
income 
are 
limited. 
Only 
half 
of 
the 
respondents have 
some

6. 
Although 
livestock breeding 
has a 
long 
tradition and 
provided 
substantially 
to 
household 
income 
in 
the 
area 
before 
the 
war, 
today 
few 
people 
own 
cattle 
and 
smaller 
livestock. 
Lack 
of 
financing 
(suitable 
for 
livestock 
production) 
and poor 
infrastructure, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
migration 
of 
young 
people 
are 
obstacles 
to 
economic 
development. 
7. 
Although 
a 
significant 
percentage 
of 
forests 
are 
privately 
owned, 
selling 
of 
timber 
is 
not 
an 
important 
source 
of 
income. 
The 
local 
population predominantly 
uses 
wood 
as 
a 
source 
of 
heating, 
felling 
trees 
marked 
by 
foresters. 
All 
necessary 
construction 
timber 
is 
bought 
from 
the 
SFEs/sawmills. 
The 
illegal cutting 
of 
trees 
has 
been 
reduced 
significantly compared 
to 
the 
war 
and post-war 
period. 
One-third 
of 
the 
population 
believes that 
no 
trees are 
being 
cut 
illegally, 
while 
another 
third 
of 
respondents 
believe 
that 
up 
to 
a 
quarter 
of 
total 
trees 
is 
being 
cut illegally. The 
majority 
respondents 
(over 
80%) 
believe that 
SFEs 
are 
over-exploiting 
the forest 
resources.

are 
employed 
in 
these 
now. 
However, 
in 
the 
RS 
part 
of 
the 
area 
assessed, 
this 
kind 
of 
employment 
is 
the 
major 
source 
of 
income. 
Before 
the 
war many 
inhabitants 
were 
employed 
in 
the 
timber 
companies, 
but 
only 
a 
few 
of 
them 
9. 
Gathering 
mushrooms and 
herbs 
is 
not 
profitable 
since 
former 
farmers’ 
associations 
are 
not 
operating 
and 
the 
purchase 
price 
is 
not high 
enough 
to 
cover 
related 
travel 
expenses 
if 
the 
products 
are 
being 
transported 
to 
larger 
urban 
centers. 
As 
a 
result 
the 
rural 
population 
engages 
in 
these 
activities 
mostly 
for 
subsistance purposes. 
Threats 
to 
the 
Environment 
10. 
Respondents 
believe 
that 
the 
greatest 
threat 
to 
the 
environment 
is 
illegal 
waste deposit 
areas. 
The 
second 
ranking 
is 
cutting 
trees 
and 
mines. 
Problems 
with 
the 
sewage 
system 
is 
also one 
of 
their 
concerns. 
About 
85% 
of 
the 
respondents 
would like 
to 
protect 
the 
environment and believe that 
the 
best 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
would 
be 
the 
introduction and 
enforcement 
of 
legal 
regulations. 
The 
second 
most mentioned 
solution 
is 
to 
stop waste 
depositing 
and carry 
out 
cleaning. 
Other 
solutions 
mentioned 
are 
the 
promotion 
of 
environmental 
concerns 
and 
preventing 
tree 
felling, and 
some 
believe that 
the 
most important 
activity 
would 
be 
clearing 
of 
mines.

One 
third 
of 
respondents 
in 
the 
IgmadBjelasnica region 
was 
familiar 
with 
the 
FDCP 
objective 
to 
work on 
the expansion 
of 
protected 
areas 
including 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
ground 
for 
a 
National Park 
in 
the 
area, 
although 
municipal 
bodies 
seemed 
to 
be 
better 
informed 
about 
it. 
The 
sources 
of 
the 
information 
are 
mostly 
friends, 
relatives 
or 
neighbors 
and 
TV 
stations. 
Almost 
90% 
of 
respondents 
say 
that 
they 
are 
fully 
or 
generally 
in 
support 
of 
the idea 
of 
the 
FDCP 
objective. 
Reasons 
for 
support 
are 
mostly 
a 
positive 
influence 
on 
the 
economy 
and 
tourism. 
The 
second 
ranking 
reason 
for 
their 
support 
is 
a 
cleaner 
environment. 
80% 
of 
the 
respondents 
are 
interested 
in 
obtaining 
more 
information 
about 
the 
FDCP, 
and 
some 
of 
them 
would like 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
planning 
of 
these 
activities. 
Rural 
residents expressed 
a 
high 
level 
of 
interest 
in 
project 
involvement, 
since 
they 
expect 
that the implementation 
of 
the 
project 
would 
have 
a 
significant effect 
on 
all 
aspects 
of 
their 
lives. 
They 
consider that 
the most effective 
means 
of 
informing 
them 
are 
public 
discussions 
and 
meetings organized 
in 
most 
villages. 
They 
consider 
that 
representatives 
of 
all 
households 
should 
be invited 
to 
participate 
in 
these 
meetings.  Some respondents 
from 
rural 
areas 
suggested 
that 
printed 
materials 
and 
brochures 
be 
distributed 
prior 
to 
the 
public 
meetings 
so 
that 
they 
would 
be 
able 
to 
prepare questions 
on 
points 
of 
interest. 
None 
of 
the 
participants supported 
the 
idea 
of 
only 
distribution 
of

materials.

Municipality 
representatives consider 
that the most effect 
form 
of 
informing 
residents 
is 
through 
themselves 
and 
neighborhood 
councils, 
organizing 
public 
meetings, 
and through 
the 
production 
and 
distribution 
of 
written

The 
majority 
of 
urban 
residents 
believes that the 
most efficient 
and 
effective 
way 
of 
informing 
the 
public 
about 
the 
Project 
is 
TV, 
followed 
by 
local 
authorities 
(municipalities 
and

anticipate 
higher income 
in 
the 
future. 
Most 
respondents expect 
income 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
organic 
food 
products. 
Some expect 
to 
earn 
income 
from 
tourist 
tours, 
other 
tourism 
related 
services, 
sale 
of 
herbal 
products, 
sale 
of 
souvenirs, 
and 
renting 
rooms 
to 
tourists. 
Half 
of 
the 
respondents 
believe 
that the 
realization 
of 
the Project 
would 
have 
a 
somewhat 
positive 
effect 
on 
the economic 
status 
of 
their 
households. 
Two-thirds 
believe 
it 
would 
have 
positive 
effects 
on 
their 
settlement 
and municipality. 
The 
respondents emphasized 
that 
a 
condition 
for 
the 
positive 
effects 
to 
occur 
it 
is 
vital 
that the 
concept 
of 
the 
Project 
does 
not 
restrict the 
number 
and free movement 
of 
cattle 
and 
development 
of 
tourist 
activities. 
Although 
there 
were 
no 
significant 
incomes achieved 
from 
tourism 
last 
year, 
respondents 
13. 
would not 
mind 
first 
offering 
the purchase 
of 
their 
land 
on 
the 
condition 
that the 
price 
corresponds 
to 
the 
market price. 
Around 
90% 
of 
respondents 
also 
believe 
that 
they 
would 
not 
mind 
the 
proposed 
restrictions 
relating 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
new 
and 
reconstruction 
of 
old 
buildings. 
All 
respondents 
who 
gave 
positive 
answers 
to 
these 
questions 
come 
from 
the 
rural 
areas. 
In 
case 
that that the 
National 
Park 
is 
designated, 
just 
under 
90% 
of 
respondents 
state 
that 
they

believe 
it 
would 
improve 
their 
lives, 
18% 
believe 
that 
it 
would 
not 
have 
any 
effect, 
and 
only 
one 
in 
fifty 
respondents 
believe 
it 
would 
result 
in 
the 
general 
regression. 
When 
asked 
to

effect 
of 
the Project 
on 
their

in

Almost 
one-third 
believes that 
the

and 
only 
one 
in 
twenty 
respondents 
believe 
that such 
restrictions 
will 
have 
a 
somewhat 
negative 
effect 
on 
their 
households. 
Respondents emphasized that 
the 
restriction should 
not 
apply 
to 
woodcutting

otherwise 
they 
would 
be left 
without

However, 
if 
it 
would 
prevent 
excessive 
woodcutting, 
encourage 
development 
of 
local 
communities and 
tourism, 
then 
they 
expect

to

creation 
of 
a 
national 
park 
will 
pose 
obstacles 
to 
their livelihood. 
Concerns expressed 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
national 
park 
are 
mainly 
related 
to 
(a) 
restrictions 
in 
user 
rights 
(movement, 
selection 
of 
engagement 
of 
economic activities 
(including 
farming),  use 
of 
their 
own 
property, 
cattle 
breeding, 
grazing, 
fuel 
wood 
cutting); 
(b) 
loss 
of 
employment 
opportunities 
(mainly 
in 
forest 
sector 
and 
wood 
processing 
industry); 
and 
(c) 
possible 
resettlement. Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
not 
expected 
that 
those obstacles 
will 
occur, since 
in 
Europe people 
live 
in 
and 
engage 
in 
economic 
activities 
in 
national 
parks. 
From 
the 
responses 
of 
stakeholders, 
it 
is 
clear that 
they 
do 
not 
expect 
that

FDCP or 
the

Respondents also 
emphasize 
on 
expectations that 
activities towards the expansion 
of 
a 
protected 
areas 
network 
would 
result 
in 
the 
revival 
of 
the 
local 
communities. 
They 
hope 
that 
the 
assistance 
provided 
through 
a 
well 
designed 
protected 
areas 
project (taking 
into 
account avoidance 
of 
the 
potential 
difficulties 
related 
to 
restrictions 
in 
peoples 
access 
to 
resources.) 
would 
be 
a 
major 
opportunity 
for 
the 
development 
of 
local 
communities. 
Positive 
outcomes 
identified 
include: 
(a) 
Reduction 
in 
unsustainable 
forest management 
performed 
in 
some areas 
by 
SFEs; 
(b) 
employment 
opportunities; 
(b) 
environment 
protection and 
conservation; 
(d) 
improved 
infrastructure 
(roads, 
water, 
sewage); 
increased 
tourism; 
(e) 
better opportunities 
for 
marketing 
of 
agricultural 
products; 
and 
(f) 
reduced 
migration 
to 
urban 
centers.
