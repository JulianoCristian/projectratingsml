"The Nutrition and Social Protection\n            Project for the Republic of Honduras had an overall\n            moderately satisfactory outcome with the performances of the\n            Bank and the borrower being deemed to be moderately\n            satisfactory as well. Of the three project development\n            objective indicators, one was achieved fully, one was\n            achieved to a large extent, and the third was achieved\n            partially. Of the nineteen intermediate outcome indicators,\n            one was not achieved, one dropped during restructuring, two\n            achieved, five partially achieved, and ten surpassed the\n            target. Significant lessons learned during the\n            implementation of the project are: 1) implementing projects\n            with more than one executing agency is complex; 2)\n            monitoring and evaluation of project activities is critical\n            to identify the project's achievements and demonstrate\n            a country's commitment; 3) consistency in procurement\n            guidance is key to avoid bottlenecks in implementation; and\n            4) sharing best practices designed and piloted with World\n            Bank support to promote sustainability is important."}, "docdt": "2013-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
