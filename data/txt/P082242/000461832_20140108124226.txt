F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to improve Honduras social safety net for children
and youth. This would be achieved by (i) improving nutritional and basic health status of
young children through and expanding the successful AIN-C program, and (ii) increasing
employability of disadvantaged youth through piloting a First Employment program. The
coordinated implementation of these interventions constitutes the first step towards
consolidating the government’s institutional and technical capacity to formulate,
coordinate, and monitor a comprehensive social safety net. This objective supports
government’s strategy of fostering human capital investment among poor families in the
poorest municipalities of the country to reduce poverty.

  The project represents the initial phase of a concerted effort to improve Honduras social
safety net. With its emphasis on improving the institutional framework for the two
program interventions, the project will help to: (i) create conditions to further expand
such programs based on sound policies and strategies and accurate information from
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; (ii)enhance the GOH’s capacity to include
additional vulnerable groups and interventions gradually as part of the process to
consolidate a national social protection structure, and (iii) improve and consolidate a
monitoring and evaluation system for social protection programs.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO did not change in substance but it was re-worded to improve its clarity as
follows: to improve the social safety net for children and youth by: (i) strengthening the
Borrower's capacity to administer social assistance programs; (ii) improving nutritional
and health status of young children by expanding the AIN-C program; and (iii) increasing
employability of at-risk youth by piloting a First Employment program.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     At the time of appraisal in 2005, Honduras was one of the poorest countries in
Latin America. Despite modest gains in poverty reduction in the 1990s, the prevalence of
vulnerability remained high. For many Hondurans, economic and human development
was beyond their reach and the most vulnerable were young children and youth. These
groups were exposed to additional risks that increased their probability of being poor. For
young children, the critical risk was chronic malnutrition; for youth 15-19 years of age,
the risk was the inadequate level of skills due to incomplete and low quality education.
The Government of Honduras (GOH) was focused on addressing the challenge of
breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty in the context of the Honduras
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), which proposed to accelerate human capital
accumulation through integrated social policies targeted to the most vulnerable groups,
with complementary social protection interventions. Table 1 below shows the evolution
of some key development indicators from Project appraisal to closing.
                                  Table 1: Honduras Development Indicators
                            Indicators                                2005       2012
Poverty (national)                                                     48%       46%
Chronic malnutrition (children 0-5)                                    30%       23%
Anemia (children 0-5 years)                                            36%       29%
Youth unemployment                                                     7%        6.9%
      For sources and definitions, see Annex 9.


2.   The World Bank had been financing IDA operations to support the PRS, and had
been working with the Government to develop the analytical and operational building
blocks to support public efforts to reduce poverty sustainably. The World Bank’s focus
was largely on including young children and adolescents in a social protection policy.
The Project built on these previous efforts.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

3.    The PDO, as stated in the original PAD, was to improve Honduras’ social safety
net for children and youth. This would be achieved by: (i) improving nutritional and basic
health status of young children by expanding the successful community-based nutrition
program (Atención Integral a la Niñez en la Comunidad, AIN-C); and (ii) increasing
employability of disadvantaged youth by piloting a First Employment program. The key
PDO indicators were:
     Coherent institutional structure for policy formulation, planning, budgeting,
        coordination, implementation and M&E of social protection actions for children
        and youth in place;
     Reduction in the rate of chronic malnutrition of children under 2 years old, by 8
        percentage points from the baseline data; and



                                                  1
         40 percent of program graduates in paid employment or self-employment six
          months after program graduation.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

4.     In June 2011 additional financing (AF) for SDR 2.3 million (US$3.6 million
equivalent) was approved for the Project. The PDO did not change in substance, but it
was re-worded to improve its clarity1 and to include the strengthening of the Government
institutional and technical capacity in social protection as a component, as follows: to
improve the social safety net for children and youth by: (i) strengthening the Borrower’s
capacity to administer social assistance programs; (ii) improving nutritional and health
status of young children by expanding the AIN-C program; and (iii) increasing
employability of at-risk youth by piloting a First Employment program.

5.    The key PDO performance indicators2 were revised to read as follows:
      Institutional structure for social protection policy formulation, planning,
       implementation and evaluation is created by Governmental decree;
      Reduction in chronic malnutrition for children under 2 years of age participating
       in AIN-C by 8 percentage points; and
      40 percent of program graduates in paid employment or self-employment six
       months after program graduation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.    The original Project expected to benefit: (i) under Component 1: children and youth
as a whole through the strengthening of social safety net interventions; (ii) under
Component 2: 35,000 children under two years of age in 1,000 communities who would
benefit from the AIN-C nutrition program; and (iii) under Component 3: around 6,000
15-19 year old in urban areas who would benefit from the FEP. With the approval of the
AF, additional beneficiaries included: under Component 1: 75,000 families who would be
eligible to participate in the CCT program Bono 10,000; and (ii) under Component 3:
2,300 youth to reach a total of 7,100.3

1.5 Original Components

The Project consisted of three components:

7.    Component 1: Institutional strengthening of the social protection framework
for children and youth (US$1.00 million). This component sought to support long-term
efforts to create a coherent institutional structure to make policy decisions, coordinate

1
  The PDO in the legal agreement was vague: To assist the Borrower in: (i) improving the nutritional condition of
   children inside its territory (as opposed to those who are poor and vulnerable), and (ii) increasing the job
   marketability of its disadvantaged youth (marketability is not a term used in social protection, and disadvantaged was
   not defined).
2
  Annex 10 includes a comparison of the original PAD and AF PAD indicators.
3
  The actual number of youth participating in the FEP had reached 4,883 due to higher training costs than estimated in
   the original PAD.

                                                           2
implementation and monitor social protection interventions. It had four subcomponents:
(i) Social protection policy formulation and coordination; (ii) Instruments to improve the
effectiveness of social protection expenditures; (iii) Support to the Secretariat of the
Presidency as coordinator of Social Protection Policy and coordinator of the Project; and
(iv) Social Audit of Social Protection Programs.

8.     Component 2: Consolidation and expansion of the AIN-C program (US$15.0
million of total Project cost). This component aimed to prevent early childhood chronic
malnutrition by strengthening the institutional base and expanding coverage of a
community-based program of growth promotion and basic health services (AIN-C). It
had two subcomponents: (i) Coverage expansion of the AIN-C model; and (ii)
Institutional strengthening of the Secretariat of Health (SOH) at the central and local
levels.

9.     Component 3: First Employment Pilot Program (FEP) for Youth at Risk
(US$7.3 million of total Project cost). This component aimed to promote labor market
insertion of poor urban youth aged 15-19 who were not enrolled in formal education or
enrolled in an alternative education program with a minimum of three years of formal
education, or who were unemployed or visibly underemployed through the development
and implementation of a pilot employment project. It had four subcomponents: (i)
targeting and selection of beneficiaries; (ii) training services and preparation for the labor
market; (iii) promotion, dissemination and support for labor market insertion; and (iv)
program management and evaluation (see Annex 2 for a description of the
subcomponents).

1.6 Revised Components

10. While the Project’s general components were not changed with the AF some new
activities were introduced. Under Component 1: (i) household data collection to identify
eligible beneficiaries for the Bono 10,000 program4 financed under the Social Protection
Project (P115592); and (ii) the provision of technical assistance for development of the
targeting methodology for urban areas to receive the CCT. In Component 3: drawing
lessons from the first three rounds of the FEP, the age limit to select beneficiaries was
increased to 21 years old and the requirement to be enrolled in a program of alternative
education was dropped (to include as participants in FEP youth who were not enrolled
due to lack of access, while still encouraging enrollment in formal education). The 2013
restructuring (see paragraph 13) also added new activities to Component 1, namely
consultancies to consolidate the social agenda for the transition to the new Government in
2014.

1.7 Other significant changes

11. Original credit (P082242; Cr. No. 4097-HN). The original Credit (SDR13.3
million or US$20 million equivalent) was approved in July 2005 and became effective in
February 2006. The credit was amended in December 2007 to increase the allocation of
4
    See footnote 5.

                                              3
the Special Account of the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security (SLSS) and in June
2010 to extend the closing date to May 31 2012.

12. Additional financing (P126158; Cr. 4964-HN). The AF appointed the Secretariat
for Social Development (SSD) as the implementation agency for Component 1; revised
Project indicators; adjusted targets, and added indicators to measure new activities in
Component 1 and improvements in health status of beneficiary children; and extended the
closing date to June 30, 2013.

13. The AF was restructured in April 2013. Changes to Component 3 included:
switching the implementation agency for the training scheme of the FEP from the
Advisory Center for Human Resource Development (CADERH) to the National Institute
for Professional Training (Instituto Nacional de Formación Profesional, INFOP);
condensing the length of the technical and life skill training for the fourth round and
making the internship optional,5 and revising the target in the indicator for number of
business offering internships. Regarding Component 1, the restructuring changed a
disbursement category to allow financing of new activities6 to strengthen the social
protection framework: key studies on social protection topics (citizen participation,
services for indigenous populations, efficiency of public expenditures in social
protection), a National Forum on Social Protection, and a strategy for the sustainability of
social protection.

14. Restructuring in June 2013. The Project was restructured again on June 19, 2013.
This restructuring included the key elements of the April 2013 restructuring for
Component 1 as well as cancelations of funds in light of the impossibility to implement
the training under the fourth round of the FEP because the condition of effectiveness of
signing the subsidiary agreement with INFOP was not fulfilled. It involved: (i) a
reallocation of expenditures among disbursement categories under the original Credit; (ii)
a change in a category to allow disbursements under Component 1 of the AF, explained
in paragraph 13, and (iii) a cancellation of funds under both Credits. AF funds for US$2.6
million under Component 3 were cancelled and an additional US$50,000 was cancelled
from Component 1, since the SDS found alternative resources to fund the Social
Protection Forum.7 A total US$105,000 from the original Credit was cancelled as well.




5
  Though not best practice, given the short time left to implement the fourth round of the FEP, it was not possible to
   maintain the mandatory internship. Instead of eliminating it altogether, the internship was made optional and allowed
   to continue beyond the end of the fourth round of training. Participating youth would still receive support and advice
   about job search and job placement through the SLSS during training.
6
  The Government financed the development of an urban targeting methodology with national resources, leaving
   resources available under Component 1 for other activities.
7
  A Social Protection Forum took place in Tegucigalpa in June 2013 with participation of other countries in the LAC
   region and national stakeholders.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15. Solid background analysis and preparation. Project preparation was based on
thorough analysis and knowledge of the country’s context.8 Government commitment9
was adequate, led by the Secretariat of the Presidency (SOP), which was coordinating the
social protection agenda at the time. Stakeholders were involved in Project preparation
through the social assessment carried out as part of preparation. The preparation took into
account that elections were due in 2005 and a new government was going to implement
the Project. The PAD included many effectiveness conditions that could have
substantially delayed Project implementation. Some of them were key, such as the
definition of detailed implementation plans for each component, the operational manual
as well as the strengthening of the project execution units in each secretariat. Despite this
shortcoming at design, effectiveness was not substantially delayed thanks to the
Government’s commitment and the World Bank’s support.

16. Sound though complex Project design. The PDO was well chosen, aligned with the
Government and country’s priorities and in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy. The
Project’s components were adequate, as well as the activities to achieve the PDO.
However, Component 1 lacked definition of specific activities, which would result in
slow implementation later. In addition, the Project design was complex; institutional
arrangements were challenging and complicated, given the number of institutions
involved in implementation and their weak capacity.

17. Lessons learned were incorporated into the Project’s design. Lessons from youth
programs in the region (Chile, Peru, Colombia) were taken into account when designing
the pilot for the FEP. These included the incorporation of life and vocational skills,
effective targeting and internship as a sign of training pertinence. Lessons from the pilot
experience regarding the AIN-C program were taken into account as well. These included
the importance of: (i) adequate targeting to improve the program’s impact; (ii) developing
an institutional structure to supervise the program; (iii) training and refresher training;
and (iv) periodic evaluations to better understand the programs implementation, its
outcomes and impacts.

18. Risks were adequately assessed during preparation. The World Bank identified
overall weak implementation capacity of the Honduran Government and identified
mitigation activities. It foresaw the need to support intensely all of the administrative
units responsible for Project implementation throughout the life of the Project. It also
acknowledged the need for the use of third parties to implement the Project, easing the
burden of the implementing agencies. In the case of Component 2, it opted for working
with NGOs to implement the AIN-C package; in the case of Component 3, it opted for
working with an institution to provide the training courses and the administration of the
training contracts. The World Bank and the Borrower started with pilots for the AIN-C

                                                        5
and the FEP to consolidate the institutional arrangements, before scaling up these
interventions.

2.2 Implementation

19. Strong government commitment to the social protection agenda. Throughout the
life of the Project, the various Government administrations showed commitment to
consolidating and advancing the country’s social protection agenda, in particular for
children and youth, by overcoming the difficulties faced during implementation after
elections in 2005 and 2009, the suspension of implementation during the 2009 crisis, and
the 2010 change of Government.

20. Piloting activities allowed for feedback loops and improvements during
implementation. In the case of Component 3, each round of the FEP introduced changes
and innovations, incorporating lessons learned during implementation. During the first
round, the training centers (Centros de Entrenamiento y Capacitación, CECAPS) showed
low capacity to offer a diversity of courses to meet the expected quota and labor market
needs. This was overcome in the next round through closer work with each participating
CECAP before they would prepare their offers of courses and a more aggressive
information campaign. The SSLS developed a system to assess the performance of the
CECAPs and to control payment to beneficiaries, improving the FEP effectiveness. Other
changes included closer coaching of participants, introduction of psychological
counseling, life skills training and greater involvement of the CECAPs. In the 3rd round
of the FEP, the CECAPs led the beneficiary selection process and promotion activities to
capture beneficiaries. Promotion activities became more local and alliances were
developed with institutions working with youth and indigenous organizations. In the case
of the AIN-C, a systematization of experiences of implementing the program with NGOs
was carried out after the first year of implementation of the program, capturing the main
factors that had helped and hindered the achievement of the programs goals and
contributing to introduce mitigating measures in the subsequent rounds.

21. The political crisis stalled implementation. In June 2009 a political crisis began
when the President was removed from office, and an interim administration held office
until elections five months later. The World Bank suspended disbursements to the
country during that period. Though the political crisis lasted six months, it affected the
Project’s activities for a longer period of time, given that AIN-C and FEP were
exclusively financed by the Project. In the case of Component 3, it disrupted the third
round of the FEP. The first phase of the FEP started in June 2009 and could not conclude
until April 2010. This delay increased dropouts, which reached 30 percent of the initial
enrollments. In the case of Component 2, it interrupted the provision of services to
communities. Contracts with NGOs were put on hold after having been signed in May
2009, restarting in January 2010. One of the NGOs opted not to continue implementation
as a result of this pause, due to the cost for the NGO to start anew the work in the
communities.




                                            6
22. Weak institutional capacity, combined with complex implementation arrangements
and budget management, delayed implementation. The SOP, SOH and SLSS were weak
at preparation, though they were strengthened as a main focus of the Project. They were
the agencies with the mandate to carry out activities in their areas and thus with all of the
institutional and political support to carry out the Project. The SOP, through the UNAT
(changed to UAP) was responsible for overall Project coordination. It collaborated with
the Consultative Council (Consejo Consultivo) which included civil society and other
secretariats. The SOP led the Social policy and the Social Protection Strategy, a pillar of
the PSRP. Once the SSD was established, responsibility for part of Component 1 was
moved to that secretariat, although the SOP remained as overall Project coordinator.
Because of weak capacity, implementation was slow at the beginning. In the case of
SOH, there were internal bottlenecks due to the slow operation of the UECF, the
uncertainty regarding the contracts of the program team that were month to month and
complex coordination within the SOH for procurement processes. Moreover, Credit
resources had to be incorporated into the national budget’s quotas of the implementing
agencies before they could access them. This delayed implementation by up to four
months, since the executing agencies delayed some Project activities until they were
certain that the resources would be made available.

23. Initial lack of defined priorities regarding Component1. During the first years of
implementation (2006-2008) the SOP had difficulties in identifying concrete activities
which could contribute to strengthen its capacity to administer social protection
programs, the main objective of Component 1. There were constant changes of priorities
and activities. This was due in part to the steep learning curve the Government
experienced to develop an integrated social protection strategy and to establish the
Secretariat for Social Development in 2009. Performance of this component improved
after the mid-term review in October 2008, when the Government and the World Bank
agreed to define concrete products for this component. After surpassing its goals (see
section 3.2), the AF expanded the scope of this component’s activities to support the
implementation of the Bono 10,000.

24. Change in the implementation arrangements under the FEP derailed
implementation of the fourth round of training. As a result of an increase in CADERH’s
costs, the SLSS requested the World Bank’s approval for the SLSS PCU to carry out the
training activities. After having approved this option in early 2012 and modifying the
Operational Manual, the World Bank and the Government deemed bidding processes to
hire the CECAPs to be too complex and therefore not feasible. In June 2012, the SLSS
requested that INFOP provide the training, aiming to reach the target for trained youth set
in the AF. The World Bank and the SLSS worked together from June 2012 to March
2013 to assess alternatives and address the challenges associated with this choice of
implementation partner. The main obstacles revolved around the contract for INFOP,
which were amply discussed between May and September 2012. In September 2012, the
World Bank indicated that INFOP, being a public institution, was not eligible to be hired
as a consultant to execute the Project and instead, a subsidiary agreement needed to be
signed, the Project restructured, and INFOP’s fiduciary capacity assessed by the World
Bank. The World Bank conducted the fiduciary assessment in October 2012 and its

                                             7
findings were discussed with the Government over the subsequent months. The full
restructuring process took a long time and was finally completed in March 2013. In the
end, this proved too late to implement the fourth round of FEP before the Credit closing.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

25. Monitoring and Evaluation was considered moderately satisfactory in the design
phase and improved during implementation. The design of the results framework began
during project preparation, with some weaknesses. During implementation, monitoring
systems were established or strengthened and baseline studies and evaluations were
conducted, providing important information on Project results.

Design.

26. Overall, the results framework was moderately satisfactory, though the PDO was
too broad and the outcome indicators presented some weaknesses in terms of measuring
outcomes that could be attributable to Project interventions. Monitoring and evaluation
systems were under preparation in each of the three implementing agencies at the time of
approval and they were to be supported by the Project, as all components included
activities to build up and strengthen the information systems. The PAD indicated that an
M&E system would generate reports on the physical and financial progress of each
component prepared by the SOH and SLSS, they would be consolidated and would
collect data and allow analysis of outcomes. The SOP would coordinate with line
ministries as the ultimate responsible agency for the social protection strategy and the
Project’s implementation. The PAD also indicated that the Project was to finance
baselines studies and impact evaluations for Components 2 and 3.

Implementation.

27. Monitoring systems were established or strengthened in the implementing agencies.
The Project supported the creation of a Project monitoring system in the SLSS that was
later used by the management evaluation and planning unit (UPEG) in the SLSS to
monitor other projects at institutional level. An information system (SIME) was
established to monitor and evaluate the implementation and outcomes of the AIN-C.
Providers and SOH staff at decentralized levels were trained on its use. The Project
supported the SSD in the development of a monitoring and evaluation system for the
social protection policies and programs.

28. Baseline studies and evaluations were carried out for the AIN-C and the FEP
programs. The SOH and the SLSS monitored the activities of the components they were
implementing, and presented regular progress reports. The SLSS gathered information on
the youth participating in 1rst and 2nd rounds of the FEP and monitored the labor market
insertion of FEP participants. A more complete baseline was prepared to carry out an
evaluation of the 3rd round of FEP (a longitudinal study10) based on information of 1,270

10
     Descriptions of the methodology of the FEP longitudinal study and of the AIN-C impact evaluation are included in
     Annex 11.

                                                            8
FEP participants and 880 young people as the control group. Personal, socio-economic,
and labor data; job insertion; quality of employment; and life skills behavior of
participants were captured. The evaluation’s findings served to design the fourth round of
FEP and its main findings are included in sections 3.2, 3.3 and Annex 2. An impact
evaluation (IE) of the AIN-C program was carried out between 2010 and 2012 to measure
the program’s outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental model, it was based on a sample of
9,000 children under two years old who participated in the program. Four measurements
were done to gather data, using well-structured questionnaires. Information was gathered
on height, weight, hemoglobin, household characteristics, infrastructure, wealth, mothers’
education, and knowledge of nutrition and healthcare. Its main findings are included in
section 3.2 and Annex 2.

29. Systematization of experiences were prepared as well for the AIN-C and the FEP
programs to capture know-how on the implementation, challenges and lessons on the
programs. Key findings are included throughout this ICR, in particular in section 6.

Utilization.

30. The SLSS used the key findings from the evaluation and systematization of
experiences of the three rounds to introduce changes to the fourth round of the FEP, as
mentioned in paragraph 26. Changes were related to the type of courses, monitoring, and
administrative aspects to improve the FEP as a training program. Changes to the
enrollment, administration and monitoring system for the fourth round. These
improvements to the program could not be tested, as the fourth round of training was not
implemented. The SOH used the information captured through the SIME and through the
monitoring of the providers’ contract to better implement the AIN-C program.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31. Indigenous Peoples. An IPDP was prepared and agreed upon with the SOH and the
SLSS. In the 3rd round of the FEP,11 in order to fulfill the safeguard commitment, changes
were introduced to the enrollment documents to capture information and monitor
participation of ethnic youth. Promotion activities were locally focused and the SLSS and
the CECAPs worked with local indigenous and afro-descendant organizations to identify
and reach indigenous youth in La Ceiba, Tela, San Pedro Sula and La Esperanza,
resulting in enrollment of Lenca, Chorti, Garifunas and Misquitos beneficiaries. In the 3rd
round, 206 ethnic youth enrolled in the FEP, 189 took the training, 96 completed the
training and 39 were employed six months after training completion. For the 4th round,
two intermediate indicators were specifically introduced to monitor participation and
retention of indigenous and afro-Hondurans youth. The SLSS collaborated with the
Secretariat for Indigenous and Afro-Honduran People (SEDINAFROH), the National
Education Program for Indigenous and Afro-Honduran People (PROHEEAHH), the
Organization for Ethnic Community Development (ODECO) and the Program for the

11
     For the 1rst and 2nd FEP rounds, which were small pilot rounds, participation of indigenous and afro-Hondurans was
     not monitored. The 1rst round took place in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa with participation of 320 youth. The
     2nd round took place in five urban areas.

Integral Development of Autochthonous People (DIPA) to coordinate and tailor the
program (enrollment, promotion, etc.) to better target these youth groups.

32. In the case of the AIN-C program, the Program was implemented in multi-cultural
geographical areas, where 30 percent of the population was Lenca and Chorti and 50
percent from Lenca tradition. The SOH carried out a study to prepare a module to train
providers and SOH staff. The study included the traditional feeding and medical practices
in caring for pregnant women, newborn and young children among the Maya Chorti and
Lenca. The program took this into account in its design to reach all of the population in a
culturally adequate strategy.

33. Procurement. Procurement was slow throughout the Project in particular during the
first two years of implementation, suffering from slow bidding and contracting processes.
Procurement delays affected the Project’s implementation, especially in the early years in
Component 2 and were a major cause for extending the closing date of the Project in
2010. The fact that there were three procurement teams in three PCUs in three different
implementing institutions in a country with weak institutional capacity was challenging.
Internal bureaucracy, political interference and lack of previous experience in working
with the World Bank or other international agencies contributed to slow and bumpy
procurement that affected implementation. Thanks to continuous training and emphasis
on using the Annual Action Plans to guide the procurement activities contributed to
improvements in performance and to the successful use of most of the credit’s resources
and to the establishment of well trained and capable procurement teams in each of the
implementing agencies by Project completion. Unfortunately there was a cancellation of
funds before closing (see paragraph 1.7).

34. Financial Management. There were weaknesses in financial management in the
first two years of implementation during which performance was considered moderately
satisfactory. Performance improved through Bank’s technical assistance and action on
the part of the implementation agencies to improve their internal controls.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35. The SOP led the preparation of studies, financed by the Project and completed in
June 2013, to prepare a transition agenda to the Government, which will take office in
January 2014. The studies summarize the achievements in social protection to ensure
continuity of human development policies in Honduras. A Social Protection (SP) Project
(Credit No. IDA 5294-HN; P115592) is being implemented which includes strengthening
national capacity to administer social protection programs focusing on the management
of the CCT program Bono 10.000. Additional financing for the SP project was approved
in July 2013, to scale-up the CCT program by targeting rural areas and strengthened
management in rural areas. A Rapid Social Response (RSR) grant is under
implementation until December 2013 in support of the AIN-C Program. It finances a pilot
of early childhood stimulation, the provision of powdered micronutrient supplements,
training, mobile technology for data collection, and dissemination activities. The FEP is
not being continued by the SLSS due in part to a change of priorities of the new Minister,

                                            10
who took office in 2013. Nevertheless a 40 million-Euro program inspired by the FEP
will be implemented by SEPLAN, INFOP and the German Cooperation to provide job
training to 2,500 youth at-risk and 100 professionals, in cooperation with key Honduran
public and private institutions. This indicates that the FEP pilot has had a powerful
impact despite not being continued by the SLSS.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

36. The relevance of the PDOs is considered high. As illustrated by table 1 (section
1.1.), the PDO remains in line with the country’s sector priorities as stated in the Visión
de País 2010-2038, the Plan de Nación 2010-2022, the Plan de Gobierno 2010-2014 and
the PRSP. The PDO is in line with the Plan de Nación 2010-2022 social goals to
eradicate extreme poverty, to improve social protection system, to reduce vulnerability
among its population and to develop opportunities of quality employment. The PDO is in
line with the strategic and specific objectives of the Social Protection Policy, approved by
the Government in 2012. They are in line with the Country Partnership Strategy 2010-
2015 (Report 63370-HN) which has as one of its strategic objectives the expansion of
opportunities through the reduction of vulnerabilities and as one of the key results the
consolidation and strengthening of the social protection system.

37. The relevance of design is considered substantial. The components were well
chosen to achieve the PDOs, despite not having defined all activities designed upfront for
Component 1. The relevance of implementation is considered substantial with
shortcomings. The World Bank worked with the Borrower to adapt to the institutional
changes in the country with the creation of the SSD which became the implementing
agency for Component 1, the introduction of new activities related to the CCT program
supported by another Bank Project, and the support for the preparation of the strategic
transition agenda. The World Bank and the Borrower built on the implementation of
activities on the FEP to expand the program and incorporate lessons learned in the
previous rounds of training. Despite the positive implementation performance for a
substantial part of the life of the Project, the World Bank and the Borrower did not
succeed in overcoming the difficulties arisen by the change in the implementation
arrangements under the FEP, which resulted in the fourth round of training not taking
place and a lost opportunity to contribute to the institutionalization of the Program.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

38. Out of the three PDO indicators, one was fully achieved and even surpassed, and
two were largely achieved (reaching more than 75 percent achievement). Out of 18

one was not met. Table 2 shows the Project’s achievements for each PDO indicator,
measured by the key performance indicators.

Strengthening the Borrower’s capacity to administer social assistance programs

39. By Project completion the institutional capacity in Honduras to administer social
assistance programs had significantly improved. An adequate institutional structure for
social protection policy formulation, planning, implementation and evaluation was in
place, including the Secretariat of Social Development (SSD), created by Decree 193-
2009, which is responsible for coordinating, designing, implementing and evaluating
social policy. The SSD led the formulation of the Social Protection Policy, approved by
decree (PCM 008-2012) on March 8, 2012 and signed into law in June 2013. Before
Project completion, the content of the policy was disseminated to government and civil
society organizations, and at the central and regional level. Furthermore, an action plan to
operationalize the social protection policy was developed and is under implementation.
The SOP also was strengthened through the creation of the Presidential Technical
Support Unit (Unidad de Apoyo Técnico Presidencial, UATP) by Decree in 2010. This
unit provides support to the President within the SOP in public policy, governance, and
policy implementation cycles.

40. Within this institutional framework, the National Information Center for the Social
Sector (Centro Nacional de Información del Sector Social, CENISS) has been established

12
  Note that one intermediate results indicator, “Coordination mechanisms defined and in use,” was dropped, leaving a
total of 18.

                                                         12
and strengthened. The CENISS includes a Single Registry for Beneficiaries (RUB) and
the Registry for Institutions (ROI). An information system for social policies, the Social
Public Policy Single Evaluation System (Sistema Único de Evaluación de Políticas
Públicas Sociales, SUEPPS), has been developed and is being implemented. The Project
contributed to strengthen the management of social protection programs by providing
support and technical assistance to the SOP and the SSD, including: (i) defining SSD’s
functioning and structure; (ii) consultations to prepare the Social Protection Strategy and
its Implementation Plan; (iii) revising the competencies of existing public institutions
with responsibility in social policies design; and (iv) design of the SUEPPS and CENISS.

Improving nutritional and health status of young children by expanding the AIN-C
program

41. The health and nutritional status of young children in 1,038 communities in six
departments (Copán, Intibucá, La Paz, Lempira, Ocotepeque and El Paraíso) where the
AIN-C Program was implemented, improved by Project completion. The program’s
Impact Evaluation (IE) shows the AIN-C strategy had considerable impact in educating
mothers, improving their behavior towards their young children regarding feeding,
micronutrients, and exclusive breastfeeding. These changes resulted in significant
improvement in the growth of children two years of age and younger, measured by
chronic and acute malnutrition indicators. The AIN-C strategy also increased the
knowledge of caretakers in prevention and treatment of diarrhea and acute respiratory
illnesses (ERA).13

42. The AIN-C Program resulted in a reduction in chronic malnutrition, or stunting.
The impact evaluation found a 4.7 percentage point reduction in chronic malnutrition
among children under-two who benefited from the program for an average of one year.14
The target was established for a two-year period, with 6 percentage-point reduction for
two years of treatment. Adjusting this target for a one year reference period, the adjusted
annualized target would be a reduction of 3 percentage points for one year of treatment.
Therefore, the impact of 4.7 percentage points achieved 78 percent of the two-year target
of 6 percentage points and out-performed the annualized target of 3 percentage points for
one year of treatment.15 Underweight in Honduras was reduced by 3.1 percentage points
and risk of acute malnutrition was reduced by 4.6 percentage points for children under
two with an average of one year exposure.

43. The Project contributed to these outcomes through the financing of the
consolidation and expansion of the AIN-C Program in 1,038 communities, surpassing the
target of 1,000 communities. NGOs were hired to provide the AIN-C services in six
13
   The IE indicated, however, that this knowledge did not translate into lower prevalence rate for these diseases. Some
   reasons for this could be the higher reporting of diarrhea cases by mothers and increase in diarrhea due to factors out
   of the Project’s control such as contaminated water.
14
   Reasons for this are: (i) the impact evaluation was delayed by the political crisis, so its duration was shortened, and
   (ii) the evaluation captured children from the age group 0-2 years who were entering and exiting the program based
   on their age – overall the average participation of these children was one year.,
15
   Note all measurements cited here use the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth reference, The IE
   used both the NCHS reference and WHO standard. Using the WHO standard, the reduction in chronic malnutrition
   was 6.7 percentage points, but this result is not statistically significant.

                                                           13
  departments with high poverty levels. A total of 3,530 monitoras were trained and 36,766
  children under 2 years of age participated. The Project also strengthened the institutional
  capacity of the different levels of the SOH and of the health institutions providing the
  prevention services and the consolidation and expansion of the community based
  program, as described in section 3.5.

  Increasing employability of at-risk youth by piloting a First Employment program

  44. The FEP contributed to improve employability and social inclusion of the youth at
  risk who participated in the program. The FEP provided training courses and internships
  to youth at risk 15-19 years old in three rounds of training; however, the fourth round of
  training was cancelled. Participants built technical and life skills, enhancing their
  opportunities to access the labor market as they completed the program better prepared to
  meet labor market demand and more knowledgeable of employment opportunities. Table
  3 summarizes the key achievements of the program:

  45. The Project contributed to this outcome by financing the implementation of the
  FEP program in three rounds. It provided support to the SLSS to carry out the activities
  to target, select and enroll the beneficiaries and supported the changes and improvements
  in each round to better target and enroll the beneficiaries. It provided resources to
  contract CADERH to manage the youth training process. It also financed a stipend which
  was paid to the beneficiaries upon enrolling in the training. The Project contributed to


                                                           14
institutional strengthening, supporting the construction of the monitoring and evaluation
system to follow up beneficiaries and strengthening the SLSS as explained in section 3.5.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

46. Actual Project costs, based on data from the SLSS, were in line with the PAD
estimates for Components 1 and 2 (see Annex 1). However, the cost of training was
underestimated for Component 3, in part due to the higher number of hours of training
received by the participants (see table 2, Annex 3) and to the extension of the third round
due to the political crisis.16 The higher cost resulted in a lower than expected number of
adolescents trained, though the cost of training was gradually lowered from
approximately $1,404 in the first round to $1,048 in the third round, or by 25 percent (see
Annex 3).

47. Overall, however, the Project achieved its outcomes and targets, surpassing many
of them, within the credit resources approved. Efficiency was limited by a longer than
planned implementation period, in part due to factors out of the Government’s control
(e.g. the 2009 political crisis) and in part due to factors related to weak institutional
capacity and lack of experience of working with the World Bank.

48. The ICR team reviewed the economic analysis both at preparation and at the time
of AF to assess the economic rationale of the Project at the time of completion. In the
case of the FEP, the economic rationale for investing in youth at risk in Honduras
remains valid based on two considerations: (i) participants improved their employability
through the training received; and (ii) the labor market insertion of youth who neither
work nor study would diminish the probability of them engaging in risky behavior. The
evaluation of the 3rd round of the FEP provided some findings relevant to the economic
analysis related to the direct and indirect benefits of the Program: (i) while direct benefits
were realized by those participants employed six months after the program, the
beneficiaries’ ability to find a job was affected by the political crisis and marked by
national legislation limiting employment opportunities for people in their age group; (ii)
the average salary for beneficiaries was higher than the national average for that age
group (15-19 years old); (iii) the Program had positively impacted their personal, family
and professional lives, as they perceived it; and (iv) only 20 percent of the participants in
the study had found work in the area they were trained on. Annex 3 includes comparative
information on salaries and cost with the control group and by training provider.

49. The IE of the AIN-C Program highlights some of the impacts of program
implementation in participating communities (included in Annex 3), as well as the cost of
the program by areas of intervention. The results suggest that the community-based
approach has been effective in changing feeding and caring practices, resulting in
improved nutritional outcomes. According to an analysis by the World Bank on the costs
and benefits of community-based nutrition programs, changes in behavior in mothers and

courses offered by the training institutions in each of the rounds, as indicated by the SLSS.

                                                       15
caretakers are estimated to bring benefits of US$53-153 per disability-adjusted life-year
(DALY) saved.17 This suggests that the impacts of AIN-C carry important positive
consequences.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

50. The overall outcome rating is considered moderately satisfactory. While the
relevance of objectives remains high and relevance of design is substantial, there were
shortcomings in implementation. On the positive side, the outcome was deemed to be in
the range of "satisfactory" because (a) the relevance of objectives remains high; (b) the
relevance of project design is substantial; and (c) the goal for strengthening the capacity
of the Government to manage social protection programs was surpassed. The overall
outcome rating is "moderately satisfactory" because implementation was more complex
than envisaged. Also, the achievements regarding the reduction in chronic malnutrition
and increase in employability of youth at-risk targeted by FEP fell somewhat short of the
goals set, due in part to disruption of the 2009 political crisis, and, for the employability
target, in part due to the cancellation of the fourth round of training, leaving 2,300
beneficiaries untrained and missing the chance to better streamline the achievements of
FEP within the SLSS. Other shortcomings justifying the moderately satisfactory rating
are: (i) the longer than planned implementation time; and (ii) the significantly higher than
foreseen budget costs to the World Bank.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

51. The AIN-C Program was implemented in six of the poorest departments of
Honduras. It focused on vulnerable populations in remote rural areas. It contributed to
improve knowledge and behavior of women through monthly growth monitoring and
with the support provided through the monitoras and the health staff with whom they
worked. Social capital was built through the training of the monitoras, who accompany
women in their communities in the prevention of malnutrition and illnesses in young
children. The AIN-C Program contributed to improve the eating habits in these
communities and fostered the use of local products in their diets.

52. The FEP has contributed to improve the human capital in a group of youth at risk.
The program focused of adolescents who had low levels of skills to enter the job market
or who were out of school. The FEP benefited in similar scale male and female students.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53. The Project contributed to strengthen the three implementing agencies (SOH,
SLSS, SSD) and the SOP through technical assistance and training. Significant
institutional strengthening took place though the preparation of the four rounds for the
17
     World Bank, 2010. Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will it Cost?

                                                          16
FEP and with the implementation of three of these rounds. Also, the Project provided
support to define core competencies and functioning of the SSD and support for AIN-C
contributed to significant institutional building at the central, regional and local level in
the SOH. (See Annex 12 for more details.)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

54. The qualitative aspect of the Impact Evaluation for the AIN-C captured feedback
from the mothers participating in the program on the access, transmission and application
of the knowledge and training provided by the monitoras and health promoters. It
captured the views of the monitoras, SOH personnel, and health promoters on the
implementation of the strategy (see Annex 5 for more details). Components 2 and 3
carried out focus groups to gather feedback from beneficiaries and to systematize the
Project’s experiences. The main findings are in Annex 5.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

55. The risk to the development outcomes is considered moderate. There are clear solid
factors contributing to sustaining the Project’s achievements. The Social Protection
Policy was passed into Law, strengthening it as a national policy, beyond a single
administration’s mandate, and its implementation plan is underway. The Government
prepared strategic papers on relevant topics of the social protection agenda, as part of the
transition preparation for the next administration. The SSD is well established within the
Honduran institutional landscape to manage social protection programs. The SUEPPS
continues to be developed to provide Honduras with a functioning monitoring and
evaluation system for social protection policies.

56. AIN-C is streamlined into the national program for integrated childhood assistance.
Standards for this program were established and implemented and they are being
implemented by other organizations supporting AIN-C. Since Project completion, the
program has continued working through the cooperation between the SOH at central and
decentralized level and the municipalities, though without resources for the monitoras or
health workers (promotores). AIN-C has been consolidated as a model to provide
preventive support for mothers and children in rural areas, education and results-based
health service provision agreements.18

57. The SENAEH has been strengthened through the establishment of the Employment
Orientation Service (Servicio de Orientación de Empleo) and the Citizen Assistance
Service (Servicio de Atención al Ciudadano, SAC) within it premises.


18
     Under the RSR grant, the Secretaries of Health and Education signed a collaboration agreement through the program
     EDUCATODOS to increase the level of education of mothers, monitoras and parents of the beneficiary children.
     The aim is to increase the level of education among these to facilitate learning and acquisition and application of the
     content of the training provided under the AIN-C.

                                                              17
58. There are, however, some risks to the sustainability of the outcomes achieved. In
the case of the AIN-C Program, the cost of the initial training provided to the monitoras
and the materials produced make the first year of the program expensive. The AIN-C
Program as supported by the Project included goods for which financing would be
needed. The Program can work without these as well. After the Project’s completion, the
program will not be implemented through NGOs, but instead through the SOH
department and local levels.

59. Failing to implement the fourth round of the FEP prevented the SLSS from piloting
the work with INFOP and has tested the functioning of the employment support program
through a public institution which could have contributed to its sustainability. There are
risks to the institutional strengthening achievements within the SLSS as the know-how
and the monitoring systems developed for the FEP were not properly handed over within
the SLSS before Project completion.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

60. The World Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry was moderately
satisfactory. The Project was in line with the country’s development priorities and the
World Bank’s CAS at the time. A sound and thorough analysis of the country and sector
context was carried out at preparation. Assessment of risk was adequate, identifying weak
institutional capacity at the SOH and SLSS as factors of high risks. The World Bank
worked with the Borrower during preparation to propose arrangements to overcome the
risks identified during preparation. The World Bank aimed to strengthen those
institutions which had the mandates to carry out the Project activities.

61. The main shortcomings were: (i) the complexity of the implementation
arrangements, despite knowing the agencies’ weaknesses; and (ii) the number of
effectiveness conditions, most of them important for the readiness for implementation.
This reflected a lack of readiness to execute, with substantial information gaps (there
were no baselines for Components 2 and 4 or detailed information for the implementation
plans for each component). Despite this, effectiveness was not substantially delayed.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

62. The World Bank carried out regular supervision missions, well-staffed during
which it provided quality technical assistance to the Borrower. The Bank used the
supervision missions to adjust the Project’s activities to better achieve the PDO. The mid-
term review was used to propose adjustments to Project activities to achieve targets and
outcomes. The World Bank provided substantial technical assistance and training to the

                                            18
implementing units within each of the Secretariats to become acquainted and proficient
on World Bank fiduciary procedures. The World Bank supported the country’s efforts by
supporting the preparation and approval of additional financing for the Project, in the
context of satisfactory implementation. The Project was led by four task managers and
transitions were overall smooth. However, changes in the procurement team affected
implementation as they brought changes of interpretation to the procurement practices the
Project had been applying.

63. The main shortcoming during supervision was the lack of effective coordination
within the Bank team to provide a timely and clear response to the Borrower’s request to
change the implementation arrangements for the FEP. The World Bank and Government
explored several alternatives to implementation (for example, moving FEP to another
Project with a longer implementation period); however, these were not deemed feasible.
The World Bank took longer than desirable to provide guidance to the Borrower on
changing the implementation arrangements of the FEP, and to carry out the necessary
capacity assessment of INFOP, which had not previously worked with the Bank, missing
the opportunity to implement the last round of the FEP.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

64. Overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory given that quality at
entry was moderately satisfactory, quality of supervision was moderately satisfactory and
the overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

65. The Government worked closely with the Bank during preparation and showed
strong commitment to the PDO during preparation and supervision. Despite the political
crisis the country experienced in mid-2009, the Governments sustained their commitment
to the PDO, the sector objectives and national social protection policy. The Government
provided the committed budget resources and additional national resources to carry out
some key activities under the Project, such as the development of a methodology to target
rural areas for the Bono 10,000. There were some shortcomings in the Government’s
performance: (i) the budget practices were quite bureaucratic and required a few months
for the Project’s activities to receive the Project’s funds; (ii) there was political
interference at some points of implementation which delayed implementation as it
affected the technical aspects of the components’ implementation; and (iii) the budget
ceilings created by the need to incorporate the credit resources to the national budget
adversely influenced implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

66. Secretariat of the Presidency: The SOP carried out the coordination of the Project
as a whole and the implementation of Component 1. During early implementation, the
SOP took time to focus the activities to be financed under Component 1 to effectively
prepare the social protection strategy and not follow procurement guidelines by virtue of
hiring consultants without the no-objection of the World Bank. Closely working with the
World Bank, the SOP adapted the implementation arrangements to the new institutional
framework for social protection with the establishment of the SSD to achieve the PDO.

67. Secretariat of Social Development: The SSD adequately implemented the Project
activities under Component 1, overcoming the difficulties in procurement with World
Bank support and succeeding in establishing a structure to implement the Project
activities in support of the development and implementation of the social protection
strategy.

68. Secretariat of Labor and Social Security: The SLSS worked with the World Bank,
the SOP and CADERH to successfully implement the FEP. It succeeded in establishing a
PCU that effectively implemented the Project activities, organized carrying out the
evaluations of the rounds of training and extracted lessons from each round to improve
the next one. It worked to fulfill the commitment towards indigenous populations
participating in the program.

69. Secretariat of Health: Overall the SOH carried out an adequate implementation of
the component. The implementation team was well staffed with capable professionals
that remained as part of the team for most of the life of the Project, providing continuity
to the program’s implementation and contributing to a timely achievement of outputs and
outcomes of the AIN-C. The initial weaknesses of the procurement team were overcome
with World Bank’s support. Despite the high rotation of ministers (four in five years) and
the difficulties faced during the 2009 political crisis, the team maintained a good dialogue
with the NGOs, the decentralized SOH levels to keep the implementation of the program
going in a difficult context. There was at time a difficult coordination with the SOP,
which was resolved through dialogue. There were internal tensions between the Unidad
de Extension de Cobertura y Financiamiento (UECF before UDECOFIS) and the PCU
for the AIN-C Program with the Project’s support, which caused delays and confusion.
The World Bank provided technical support through the local office to the technical team
with the Minister, for signatures, approvals, to improve implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

70. The overall Borrower performance is considered moderately satisfactory given that
the Government and the implementing agencies’ performances are considered moderately
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned


71. Implementing projects with more than one executing agency is complex. In a
country with limited institutional capacity, to have more than one executing agency
makes implementation difficult. In the case of the Project, there were three and later on
four implementing agencies with a clear role and responsibility for implementing the
Project’s activities. Giving that the implementation role to each of these secretariats had a
rationale, and contributed to build their institutional capacity, it required significant
coordinating efforts on the part of the SOP, the overall Project coordinator. For example,
the SOP integrated all Project activities in a single procurement plan, requiring great
coordination efforts on the part of SOP, and creating bottlenecks.

72. Monitoring and evaluation of project activities is critical to identify the Project’s
achievements and demonstrate a country’s commitment. The Project benefited from the
preparation of baseline studies, systematization of experiences, and impact evaluations
that help understand implementation problems, draw lessons, and introduce changes
along the way. This contributed to solidly documenting the Project’s outcome
achievements and provided a deeper understanding of its impacts. In Honduras, these
accomplishments are remarkable given the implementation agencies’ institutional
weaknesses, and therefore signal strong country commitment to learning and improving
to achieve the agreed targets and outcomes.

73. Consistency in procurement guidance is key to avoid bottlenecks in
implementation. Changes in World Bank procurement staff brought changes in points of
view on how to procure the Project’s activities. This was particularly the case in
Component 2 and Component 3. If changes break with the way activities were procured
previously in the life of the Project, great efforts should be made not to delay
implementation. Clear guidelines on how proceed when hiring a public institution should
be provided in a timely manner to the country in order to enable the implementation of
activities within the Project’s life and achieve the PDOs. Time to answer and provide
guidelines on next steps often took a long time and when decisions are not taken in a
timely manner, it undermines confidence in public programs.

74. Importance of sharing best practices designed and piloted with World Bank support
to promote sustainability. The World Bank should take the chance to communicate to
other stakeholder who can provide financial resources to replicate successful programs.
This is the case of the FEP, which will continue but not with World Bank financing. The
FEP’s experience, training model, and lessons learned have been taken into account to
formulate similar projects with an improved model for vocational training, for example
the recently launched training program implemented by INFOP, SEPLAN and the
German Cooperation. For Component 2, the SOH reached out to the Salud
Mesoamericana initiative to ensure continuation of some activities.




                                             21
Lessons on the FEP

75. Involvement of local organizations contributes to reach indigenous populations. It
is important to monitor from the beginning of the program indigenous groups to be sure
to achieve the goals set. Activities to reach out to these groups must be different from the
general outreach activities. Local elements must be included form promotion and
enrollment of students. In general, promotion of the program through local media and
local institutions proved to be more effective in reaching out to the targeted population.

76. Youth employment programs are more effective if three elements are combined:
private sector participation, combination of classroom work and internships and some
form of counseling. The FEP had a combination of the three of them, with the
involvement of the private sector through the internships. The evaluation study after the
3rd round of training pointed that in the case of Honduras, the youth who was working
after the training did it on jobs not related to the training received, suggesting a mismatch
between the skills provided and the demands of the labor market. The counseling
provided in the framework of the FEP was found helpful as life-skills building for
participants.

77. Follow up of participants for a longer period of time could provide more
information on the effectiveness of the program. The Project focused on the ability to
find work six months after internship completion while some participants were
unemployed up to nine months after training and found work afterwards. Monitoring
participants throughout a longer period of time would be beneficial to better understand
the implications, achievements and shortcomings of the FEP. Given that longitudinal
studies were carried out after the rounds of FEP, it would be worthwhile to have a follow-
up of participants to gather further information on earnings and of the sustainability of the
FEP’s benefits.

Lessons on the AIN-C program

78. Emphasis on elaborating clear procedures for the program contributed to achieve its
objectives: Implementation of this component focused initially in organizing and
developing the AIN-C, which had been piloted before the Project. The focus on
organizing and strengthening the counseling (consejeria) and monitoring took a long
time, but it allowed the program to achieve positive results.

79. Choosing professional NGOs contributed to continuity. Some of the NGOs hired
had higher costs, but there was less staff turnover, which is critical for a program such as
AIN-C. CARE or CRS were more expensive but consistent.

80. Continuous support through training of field personnel and critical actors is the key
to the adequate implementation and sustainability of the AIN-C program. The
systematization of experiences has shown that continuous training beyond the initial one
provided to the monitoras is needed for them to acquire and maintain the skills and



                                             22
abilities to carry out their tasks. Continuous training of field personnel (promotores and
decentralized SOH staff) is also critical for the monitoring and support of the program.

81. A good communication strategy contributes to the achievement of a program’s
objectives. In the case of AIN-C, emphasis was placed on socialization activities with
communities and municipal leaders, which contributed to greater involvement and
ownership by the beneficiaries.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

82. The Borrower’s contribution includes contributions from the SOP, SDS, SOH and
SLSS (See Annex 7). One key point raised by the SLSS is that changes in the
procurement team and respective procurement practices affected the preparation and
design of the fourth round of the FEP.

The Project performed along the lines set for the overall Honduran World Bank portfolio.
The quality of Project management improved markedly after 2011 thanks to extensive
training and support on fiduciary matters. Disbursement improved for activities within
the Project not linked to the fourth round of FEP, which could not be implemented.

     Component 1: Institutional Strengthening of the social protection framework for
     children and youth. This component contributed to improve the government capacity to
     administer social programs by creating a coherent institutional structure to make policy
     decisions, coordinate implementation and budget allocations and monitor social
     protection interventions. This component provided support initially to the SOP who was
     responsible for the coordination of social policy formulation and monitoring, including
     social protection. Later on, it provided support to both the SOP and the SSD, once this
     one was created by Decree 193-2009. The SSD coordinates the Social Protection
     Technical Committee (CTPS) comprised of government institutions (which ones) and
     civil society organizations. It is supported by the Executive decree PCM008-2012. The
     Project through Component 1 supported the strengthening of the SDS.

     1.       The following was achieved under the four subcomponents:

     1.1 Social protection policy formulation: it supported the definition, formulation,
     implementation evaluation and monitoring of children and youth social protection
     policies, strategies and programs. The main outputs were:

              The elaboration of the Social Protection Policy and its implementation plan: The
               IP was elaboration in a participatory manner, with full involvement of civil
               society. The IP is being implemented.
              Preparation of a strategic agenda 2014-2018: to prepare the transition for the new
               Government, identifying the main implementation lines in the IP for each social
               protection area. Studies/consultancies were financed on five pillars: (i)
               macroeconomic; (ii) management of public finances; (iii) competitiveness; (iv)
               human development and social protection; and (v) governance and security.
              Social Protection Forum: to position the Honduran Social Protection System
               nationally and internationally. The Project financed the majority of the event



                                                      26
1.2 Instruments to improve effectiveness of social protection expenditures; development
of instruments, systems and mechanisms designed to ensure the efficiency of public
expenditures in the area of social protection. The outputs were the following:

      Development and implementation of information systems: development of the
       Centro Nacional de Información del Sector Social (CENISS) and its components:
       the Single Beneficiary Registry (Registro Unico de Beneficiarios, RUB); Registro
       de Oferta Institucional, ROI and Centro Nacional de Documentación (CENAD).
      Sistema Unico de Evaluación de Políticas Públicas Sociales (SUEPPS):
       workshops to design the system (with UPEGs and key sector actors), development
       of social development indicators to be monitored; technical assistance to explain
       the relationship among the different monitoring systems of social indicators (SOP,
       SEPLAN and SSD) and technical assistance and IT equipment for the
       development of the system.
      The collection of household data to identify eligible beneficiaries for Bono
       10,000. The INE carried out this exercise, since it had already carried the first
       surveys for Bono 10,000 and it had experience in household surveys.
      Technical assistance for development of a targeting methodology for urban areas.
       A targeting scoring formula was defined and a data collection instrument was
       designed and piloted.

1.3 Support to the Secretariat of the Presidency as coordinator of Social Protection Policy
and coordinator of the Project: During the first years of implementation, the Project
financed staff for financial management and procurement to strengthen the UNAT within
the SOP to implement the Project activities. The Project financed staff in the Technical
Office in charge of Red Solidaria, a program which coordinated social protection
interventions for people in extreme poverty. The Project financed consultancies seeking
to improve the effectiveness in public expenditure in social protection.

After the approval of the AF, the Project supported activities to build capacity in the SOP
and SSD to undertake policy development and Project coordination activities. The SSD
became responsible for the implementation of project activities and technical oversight of
Component 1. It prepared progress reports for this component, updated the
implementation plan. The SOP (through the UAP) remained responsible for the
procurement and FM for Component 1 and it remained responsible for coordinating the
entire Project.

1.4 Social Audit of Social Protection Programs: This subcomponent was implemented
until the AF. After the AF, this subcomponent was dropped since the Government’s
Social Protection Strategy included participatory social monitoring of social program
mechanisms and these were financed by the national budget.




                                            27
Component 2: Consolidation and Expansion of the AIN-C program.

2.     This component had two subcomponents: expansion of coverage and
institutional strengthening of the SOH at all levels. The AIN-C Program was
implemented in 1,038 communities in six of the poorest departments in Honduras
through contracting NGOs to deliver the AIN-C services. The expansion was carried out
gradually, in three phases of service provision. The program sought to provide services
to: (i) parents or people caring for children under two years of age; (ii) mothers of
children under five years of age with diarrhea and respiratory diseases in their
communities; (iii) children under 2 years of age to monitor their growth and treatment of
disease; (iv) pregnant women or those who recently had a child; and (v) children under 5
years old who are experiencing diarrhea and respiratory diseases.

4.    The selection of the NGOs to provide the services was carried out through
International Competitive Bidding. The Project financed the following activities:

                                           28
           Planning: These activities were carried out by the Project, the PAIN, NGOs and
            the SOH regional departments. The main outputs were: (i) the selection of the
            communities to benefit from AIN-C; (ii) hiring the firm to prepare the baseline for
            the impact evaluation and carrying out the baseline, (iii) updating the key AIN-C
            documents and manuals; (iv) hiring the NGOs to provide the services; (v)
            approval of the operational plans prepared by the service providers; (vi) selection
            of 3,530 monitoras in the 1,038 communities; and (vii) authorization to operate by
            the regional regulation department of the NGOs.
           Training: Monitoras, NGOs’ field personnel and regional SOH staff were trained
            on the key components of AIN-C: growth monitoring, caring of sick children in
            their communities, caring of pregnant women and newborns and early
            stimulation. Manuals and guides were used to carry out the appropriate training
            for each group.
           Implementation: The main results were the implementation of the program in
            1,038 communities; monthly meetings in each of the communities carried out by
            the monitoras with participation of 94 percent of children under two; the
            establishment of support groups and groups of nutrition practices in each of the
            beneficiary communities; use of an instrument to follow up the activities of the
            monitoras in their communities.
           Monitoring: These activities strengthened the intuitional capacity of all
            participants in the program and all levels of the SOH. The main outputs under this
            activity were: (i) the development of the Monitoring and Evaluation System
            (SIME) to capture information on the program implementation from the
            monitoras and the NGOs in the communities and send it to the central level of the
            SOH, to monitor the program; (ii) training of NGOs’ technical staff and SOH
            regional staff in the use of SIME; (iii) design and use of a monitoring of a
            monitoring instrument to assess the performance of the service providers and
            training of the SOH staff on how to use to evaluate the performance of the NGOs;
            and provision of technical assistance to the SOH regional offices to develop and
            implement the AIN-C activities in their departments.

5.    The IE found that the strategy had more impact on the reduction of chronic
malnutrition when the mothers had completed primary school, were between the ages of
19-25, the family had a vegetable garden, the population was not indigenous, when the
family lives farther away from a health post, and the head of the family was a single
woman.

Component 3: First Employment Pilot Program for Youth-at-Risk

6.    This component succeeded in promoting the labor market insertion of 4,883 poor
urban youth ages 15-19 (versus a target of 7,100) who had abandoned the education
system and who did not work or worked in very low return informal activities. The
component financed the development and implementation of a pilot program known as
Mi Primer Empleo which was part of a larger effort by the Government for to construct a
system for training and professional development for youth to improve their possibilities
for labor market insertion. The FEP was implemented in 2006-2011 in three rounds
(Convocatorias) of training in 33 cities providing training courses and internships to at
risk youth. The program was evaluated after the implementation of the 3rs round in 2011
to draw lessons that were incorporated into the design of the 4th round of training to make
sustainable, reduce the cost per trainee and to institutionalize it. 1.

Subcomponent 3.1 – Targeting and selection of beneficiaries

7.     This component financed the targeting, enrollment and selection of youth who
participated in the program. Its implementation was led by the SLSS. A total of 5,000
youth ages 15-19 were selected to participate in the program in three rounds of training
between 2006 and 2011. Of these, 4,883 culminated the training, including those selected
initially to participate and those waitlisted as substitutes in case the selected students
would drop out.

8.    The SLSS gathered information on youth seeking to participate in the program. The
SLSS developed a form (“ficha de inscripción”) to capture socio-economic information
of youth to determine their eligibility for the program. Young people were selected
randomly (through an automated process based on the information they provided). The
selection process of each round had its own characteristics, and it gradually improved.
The third round included a more direct participation of the training centers (Centros de
Capacitación, CECAP), and enrollment took place directly in their premises. An
information system was developed during the third round to identify in real time the

                                            30
availability of courses in the training centers. The MIS served to better control the
selection and participation process, providing information on the youth enrolled by city,
by course, etc. For the fourth round, the selection process was designed in coordination
with the SSD through the single registry of beneficiaries (Registro Unico de
Beneficiarios, RUB) and selected a total of 2,300 additional youth eligible to participate
in the program.

Subcomponent 3.2 – Training services and preparation for the world of work
9.     This subcomponent financed the costs of providing the courses and paying the
youth participants a stipend to cover transportation costs. The Advisory Center for the
Development of Human Resources (CADERH) was hired to manage the provision of
training for the three rounds of the FEP. A total of 4,209 participants completed the
technical training and the internship. 2,316 of the beneficiaries received certifications
provided by CADERH after passing the tests required. A total of 1,261 youth were
employed or self-employed six months after the completion of the program. Other
beneficiaries found employment after the six-month period or decided to go back to
school. The cost of training under the FEP was higher than anticipated as well as number
of training hours needed. Therefore the target to train 6,000 youth was not achieved
before the AF.

10. The courses evolved during the three rounds to become more relevant, including
topics such as environment and entrepreneurship. Around 65 CECAPs enrolled in an
enrollment registry (Registro de Oferentes de Capacitación, ROC) and provided the
courses. The number and variety of courses offered through the FEP increased in each
round, from 22 courses in the 1rst round, 174 in the 2nd round to 493 in the 3rd round (a
total of 689 by Project completion). A total of 247 courses were selected to be taught.
The quality of the courses offered improved, as well as the CECAPs capacity to reach
out, enroll youth and connect with private companies as a result of the FEP. CADERH
assessed their performance in the different phases of the program from enrollment of
youth to the provision of courses and provision of stipends.

11. First Round: this pilot round took place between July 2006 and October 2007.
CADERH selected and invited the training centers to participate. A total of 12 CECAPs
registered with the Registry of Training Institutions (Registro de Oferentes de
Entrenamiento, ROFE) and 7 of those offered 22 courses. The Technical Committee to
evaluate the courses offered (CTEP) selected 18 of the 22 courses to train 321 students in
5 CECAPs in urban area in the northern part of the country. The selection of youth was
carried out by the PCU in the SLSS, who worked in coordination with the CECAP.

12. Second Round: it took place from March 2007 to November 2008. A total of 76
CECAP registered in the ROFE, a substantial increase in the number of centers in
response to more promotion and carrying it out as a public open competition. The
CECAPs offered a total of 176 courses, which were evaluated by the CTEP with support
from technical experts on the topic of the courses. A total of 89 of the courses were
selected and 1,512 beneficiaries took them. A system to monitor the implementation of
the courses and assess the performance of the CECAPs was established and they were

                                           31
classified accordingly to their performance. An automated system to monitor the payment
of student compensation was developed improving the control over payments and the
performance of the CECAPs on this task.

13. The main shortcoming of this round was the high cost of the courses per students as
the bidding documents did not indicate a cost ceiling and the excessive number of certain
courses such as computers and hairdressers, revealing low capacity of some of the
CECAPs to offer a more diverse and relevant set of training courses.

14. Third Round: This round lasted from October 2008-February 2011 training 3,031
youth beneficiaries. It was implemented in three phases in an open competition among
CECAPs. Coverage of the program expanded to areas in the south, east and west in the
country not previously considered in the program. The main reasons were: (i) low
participation of CECAPs in the high urban areas targeted by the Project; and (ii) low
relevance of the courses offered by CECAPs in previous rounds, already saturated which
were not in line with the labor market demands of skills. This was the first rounds in
which 100 percent of youth graduated received their certifications.

15. First Phase of the 3rd round: Training of 1,933 youth started in June 2009 and
finished in April 2010. Training had to be interrupted due to the political crisis in June
2009 which delayed the implementation of the training and caused drop out to soar to 30
percent of the original enrollment. A total of 1,035 youth finished the training and only
785 of them got certificated.

16. Second Phase of the 3rd round: A total of 37 courses were selected and 688
beneficiaries received the training between April and May 2010. All youth who
participated in the program as a replacement for a participant who dropped out was given
the change to opt to get their certification.

17. Third Phase of the 3rd round: This phase had not been originally planned but it was
carried out given there were funds remnants from the previous ones due to drop out from
students, given the political crisis in 2009-2010. The CTEP added 26 courses for 400
students between July 2010 and January and February 2011.

18. Fourth Round: A 4th round was designed to be financed with AF approved to the
original Credit. The new round included lessons learned from the evaluation of the 3rd
round. During the preparation of training delivery, CADERH announced an increase in
their costs which caused the SLSS to opt for requesting a change in the implementation
arrangements to work with INFOP to provide the training. This change required an
amendment of the AF agreement and an assessment of the fiduciary capacity of INFOP.
This process took longer than expected and given the time left until the Credit’s closing,
the Bank and the Borrower revised the length of the technical and life skill training to two
and a half months (from four months in the first three rounds). With this change, there
was not enough time for a mandatory internship before the Credit’s closing, so the
internship was made internship optional and, thereby, could continue beyond the Credit
closing. To compensate for the reduction of the time of training, the life skills module

                                            32
was expanded by fifty per cent, entrepreneurship training was added, technical courses
were to be offered in a more intense fashion and the youth who would complete the full
training package would be accredited by the INFOP. In place of the mandatory
internship, participating youth will receive support and advice about job search and job
placement through the STSS during and after the training;

Subcomponent 3.3 – Promotion, dissemination and support for labor market insertion.
19. The Project supported the dissemination of the program and the creation of an
intermediation service (Servicio Orientación de Empleo, SOE) within the National
Employment Center (SENAEH). By Project completion the SENAEH was providing
support to youth seeking employment, working as an intermediary between job seekers
and job providers. An electronic job market platform within SENAEH, called
“Empleate”, was functioning, led by the SLSS accessible to firms and individuals.
SENAEH remains involved in enrollment and monitoring of the implementation of
employment programs such as FEP. Around 2,942 beneficiaries who did not get
employment received support from the SOE.

20. The Project strengthened the Department of Employment (DGE) by: (i) supporting
the definition a new organizational structure for the DGE, (ii) the provision of furniture,
equipment and upgraded infrastructure for the SLSS, provision of information systems;
(iii) the establishment of “Empleate” as the first electronic job market accessible to
individuals and companies as part of the SENAEH; (iv) financing of DGE staff; (v) the
design and implementation of the psychometric tests system to support the performance
of the DGE; (vi) the establishment of an orientation service to citizens (Servicio de
Atención al Ciudadano) within the SLSS to direct people within the SLSS; and (vii) the
provision of IT support (internet access and webpage for FPE) for the SLSS regional
offices in San Pedro Sula, Choluteca, Danli, El Progreso, Comayagua, La Ceiba y
Tegucigalpa.

Subcomponent 3.4 – Program Management and Evaluation.
21. The Project financed the development of a monitoring and evaluation system in the
SLSS to inform and support the development of a youth training and labor market
insertion system, following up participants after they completed the program. .It financed
part of the staff of the PCU in the SLSS.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.    The ICR team reviewed the economic analysis both at preparation and at the time
of AF to assess the economic rationale of the Project. The Project costs were in line with
the original PAD estimates for Components 1 and 2 while the costs of training was
underestimated for Component 3. Part of the increase in cost was due to the higher
number of hours of training received by the participants. The higher cost resulted in a
lower than expected number of adolescents trained. Overall, the Project achieved its
targets within the credit resources approved. Implementation took longer than planned in
part due to factors out of the Government’s control e.g. the 2009 political crisis and in
part due to factors related to weak institutional capacity and lack of experience of work
with the Bank and Bank procedures. The cost of supervision was much higher than
budgeted in the PAD.

2.     In the case of the FEP, the economic rationale for investing in youth at risk in
Honduras remains valid based on two considerations confirmed in the longitudinal study:
(i) participants improved their employability through the training received, improving
their knowledge of labor demand and of the labor market; and (ii) the labor market
insertion of youth who neither work nor study diminished the probability of them
engaging in risky behavior. The Project achieved direct benefits in terms of labor
insertion for participants and higher salaries. Labor insertion was lower than envisaged in
the PAD (30 percent versus a target of 40 percent), reducing the direct benefits from the
Project. The evaluation of the 3rd round of the FEP, carried out in 2011 after its
completion, provided some findings relevant to the economic analysis. Namely: (i) the
beneficiaries’ ability to find a job was adversely affected by the national political crisis,
the global economic crisis and marked by the labor legislation that imposed restrictions to
hire people in their age group; (ii) the average salary for beneficiaries was higher than the
national average for that age group (15-19 years old); (iii) the program had positively
impacted their personal, family and professional lives, as they perceived it. Though not
quantified, the indirect benefits from this behavior are expected to impact the society as a
whole. Youth criminality and violence continue to be one of the most serious problems
the country is facing today; and (iv) only 20 percent of the participants in the study had
found work in the area they were trained on.

3.    In terms of earnings, the study found that participant saw their earning increased,
compared to the control group and that male earnings were higher than female earnings.
The study found a trend of decrease in salary for this age group.

6.    The average cost of the training per students was approximately 15,000 Lempiras
during the three FEP rounds. Each participant received US$2.50 per day attended to
cover transportation, insurance and the cost of the evaluation of their labor competencies
for the certification.

8.     The cost of the first year of implementation of the AIN-C Program was the highest
in all departments since it required resources for equipment, medications and training of
all staff at all levels. The average cost per child in the six departments was 2,295
Lempiras ($120.66). The cost depended upon the number of children serviced by
community: Lempira had the lowest cost (1,806 Lempiras with 25 children per
community) versus Ocotepeque (2,837 Lempiras with 18 children per community). A
cost-benefit study was under revision at the time of the ICR, though the updated
conclusions were not yet finalized.

9.    The Impact Evaluation of the AIN-C Program evidenced the positive outcomes
achieved in the intervened communities in terms of reduction of chronic and acute
malnutrition, as well as the improvements in caretakers’ behaviors regarding nutrition,
breastfeeding and immunizations of young children, among other aspects of their care.
Given the evidenced impacts, it is feasible to affirm that the AIN-C program was an
effective intervention to reduce chronic malnutrition in the benefited communities.

10. The original PAD identified direct and indirect benefits derived from the
implementation of the AIN-C Program; among the direct benefits were the savings in
health care costs resulting from the reduction in the number of SOH outpatient
consultations. The indirect benefits resulted from the children’s lives saved as well as the
positive physical and cognitive impact. Given the outcomes achieved through the
implementation of the AIN-C Program, evidenced in the impact evaluation, it is safe to
affirm that these benefits have been realized as a result of the implementation of the
Project.

11. The ICR team used evidence from several studies20 as a proxy of the savings in
costs and monetized benefits of similar nutrition interventions. A regional study

estimated the cost of malnutrition (measured as underweight) in Honduras at 10.6 percent
of GDP in 2004.21 Regarding benefits, a longitudinal study in Guatemala demonstrated
that children who received fortified complementary food before they were three years of
age grew up to have wages that were 46 percent higher than the control group (for
males). Finally, community-based nutrition programs show that changes in behavior in
mothers and caretakers are estimated to bring benefits of US$53-153 per disability-
adjusted life-year (DALY) saved.22

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Study of the 3rd round of the FEP
1.    The study focused on the analysis of five aspects for the beneficiaries and a control
group: (i) Life conditions; (ii) Training; (iii) Employability; (iv) values and life skills; and
(v) gender equity in FEP.

2.    The study included a total of 1,211 beneficiaries, 478 youth as control group from
phase I, 1,344 beneficiaries and 297 youth as control group from phase II. The total
number of participants in the FEP was 4,883 in all three rounds of the program. Thus the
study included around 50 percent of participants.

3.     Labor situation and conditions: the participants were minors and they were socially
vulnerable socio-economic status. Access and conditions of access to the labor market by
the participants was framed by the laws and regulations on minimum wage, permission to
participate in the labor market, social security, etc. The study found that around 25
percent of the participants were working six months after the completion of training. The
main reason for this was that the participants had not found a job or they were studying.
The large majority (around 60 percent) was working as an employee or worker for a
private company. Regarding the conditions of labor, 80 percent of the study’s participants
expressed the view that their jobs entailed occupational risks and 12 percent said their
jobs meant risks as they work on the streets and they can be victims of aggressions.
Around 65 percent is employed in temporary jobs. The participants received higher
salaries than the control group though in a context of decreasing salaries overtime
(salaries were lower between the first and second phase of the 3rd round of FEP). In
general, male participants reported longer hours of work than females and over the 40-44
rage of hours per week (45 hours).

4.    Participants reported low reception of social benefits. 65 percent of participants
reported not receiving any social benefits; 9 percent reported having received holidays; 2
percent paid vacations; 2 percent considered a benefit receiving the minimum wage and 5
percent had received a Christmas bonus.

5.    Participants received placement assistance directly through the firms where they
carried out their internships. Otherwise, newspapers, radio ads or no placement services
were used to find a job. The study showed that a low number of female participants were
register in the SENAEH, while a larger number of women in the control group were
enrolled in that service.

6.    The beneficiaries expressed that their participation in the FEP program contributed
to diminish their participation in risky behaviors.

Contribution from the Secretariat of the Presidency
Component I – Information on the Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR). An evaluation of the objective, design, operational experience, and execution
of the operation.

The “Law for the Establishment of a Country Vision and the Adoption of a National Plan
for Honduras” defines the guiding principles for development, strategic lines of action,
and national objectives and goals for 2010-2038. The Country Vision refers to a
panorama of social, political, and economic targets that the country should achieve for
each cycle of 28 years, through the execution of successive national plans and
government plans that are consistent with each other. The National Plan sets out the
strategic pillars around which public and private action should be executed to achieve the
midterm objectives of the Country Vision, in successive 12-year periods, and it defines
the indicators for each national target, with 2009 as the baseline. The Government Plan is
the set of policies, programs, and projects that each government administration
establishes in order to contribute to the achievement of the goals and indicators of the
National Plan.

In addition, this Law defines the entities responsible for its execution, with the Secretariat
of the Presidency (SDP) responsible for executing and supervising fulfillment of the
National Plan by: (i) ensuring that the National Plan is successfully executed and that its
national targets and indicators are achieved; (ii) coordinating the government’s sector
cabinets for execution of the National Plan; and (iii) ensuring compliance with the
agreements of the government’s sector cabinets, among other activities.

In line with the above and emphasizing and affirming the authority of the SDP as the
policy arm of the Presidency, through Executive Decree PCM-008-2010, published on
7 April 2010, the Technical Support Unit of the Presidency (UATP) was created as a
technical agency that would enable the SDP to support the President of the Republic,
sector cabinets, regional planning commissions, and other presidential commissions in
the areas of public policy, policy cycles, transparency, governance, and others.

In this regard, the Honduran government and the G-16 signed a joint declaration in
August 2012 that established a critical path to be supported through cooperation and
implemented by the Honduran government in the following priority areas: political
process for the 2012-2013 elections, citizen security, human rights, socially inclusive
growth, and fiscal governance and transparency in public administration.

For the purpose of strengthening the transition agenda, efforts were made to coordinate
and harmonize public policies around critical paths and plans, in order to lock in
sustained growth with social equity and strengthen democratic governance.




                                             42
The design and execution of a strategy were needed to guarantee the smooth transition of
government, including disseminating and providing training on priority issues during the
transition.

It was decided at the highest level that the SDP would lead the transition process, and in
this framework, a strategy has been developed to guarantee the provision of technical and
operational assistance for a transition process that involves activities to document and
disclose information to interested parties and to build skills among staff in the incoming
administration at the central level as well as at the regional and municipal levels.

In the framework of this strategy, the government has decided to focus its efforts on
readying the processes and documents that will be transferred, which are grouped into
four levels:

1.) Transition documented with reporting by the entire public sector, consisting of the
preparation by each secretariat of a document with the main issues and public policies
affected by the transition, and documentation by the National Office for Integrated
Internal Control (ONADICI) of the operational files;
2.) Positioning of strategic issues in the context of the transition, grouped around five
thematic pillars (macroeconomics and public debt sustainability, management of public
finances, competitiveness and business development, human development and social
protection, and governance and security). This level includes technical studies and
documents;
3.) Transition paths prepared with the participation of civil society; and
4.) Institutional reforms.

The World Bank, through the Additional Financing for the Nutrition and Social
Protection Project, Credit IDA 4694-HO, provided strong support for this strategy under
its thematic pillar Human Development and Social Protection, after a restructuring to
include activities related to strengthening Honduras’s Social Agenda.

I. An evaluation of the outcome of the operation in relation to the agreed upon
objectives.
The project objective to improve Honduras’s social safety net for children and youth by:
(i) strengthening the recipient’s capacity to administer social assistance programs has
been fulfilled. This has been accomplished by strengthening the institutional capacity of
the SDP to improve investment in the human capital of poor families through:

a.) Support for the definition, formulation, execution, evaluation, and monitoring of
social protection policies, the strategy, and programs for children and youth;
b.) Development of instruments, systems, and mechanisms to guarantee the efficiency
of public spending on social protection;
c.) Support for building capacity at the SOP and SSD to carry out policy formulation
activities and project coordination activities; and
d.) (a) collection of household data to identify eligible beneficiaries for the Bono
10,000 program; and (b) provision of technical assistance for the development of a

                                           43
targeting methodology for urban areas by, inter alia: (i) defining a targeting scoring
formula; (ii) designing a data collection instrument; and (iii) piloting the data collection
instrument.

II. An evaluation of the borrower’s own performance during preparation and
execution of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that could be
useful in the future.
In relation to the evaluation of performance in executing Component I, the SDP and its
partner institutions have reflected on the lessons learned throughout the design,
preparation, and implementation of the different actions contained in the annual work
plan for the component. In this framework of lessons learned, performance was good in
terms of gathering socioeconomic information on eligible households for the Bono
10,000 program, which culminated in the development of a database of beneficiaries with
descriptive information on the target population. The learning that stands out in this area
is the ongoing improvement made in interagency coordination processes, with respect to
the timely and precise joint definition of technical specifications for procurement
processes. In addition, the operational mechanism for the Bono 10,000 program entails
strong institutional coordination, so this exercise has contributed to better communication
among the partner entities and by extension has enhanced all program processes.

As mentioned previously, the Honduran government has proposed a Government
Transition Strategy 2013-2014, the basic objective of which is to ensure an orderly and
smooth transition to prevent the planning gaps and delays that have traditionally occurred
during changes in administration. With this in mind, through the UATP/SDP, a series of
prospective studies were conducted on the efficiency and inclusion of social programs
and the outcomes achieved in the area of social protection and were strategically
disseminated to position the Social Agenda on all levels and ensure the sustainability of
the core social policies that have been approved and are in execution.

Regarding the prospective studies and the studies on the efficiency and inclusion of social
programs, relevant and timely diagnostic information was obtained, which will serve as
an input for the formulation of public social policies and the strengthening of programs
and projects, in the framework of execution of the Social Protection Policy and the
Consolidated Social Protection System.

It should be noted that the UATP/SDP implemented the strategy to promote collaboration
among the different consultants who were in charge of carrying out the studies, which
yielded a relevant lesson, by virtue of the level of performance achieved in preparing and
executing these activities, about the effectiveness of teamwork, especially with respect to
the collection and analysis of information that is not always available for doing research.

Moreover, while diagnostics were being conducted, action proposals were prepared for
the government transition process and the new authorities, which were also analyzed
jointly. A lesson learned from this process is that by analyzing a country’s social
problems from various viewpoints, more comprehensive solutions can be identified.



                                            44
Monitoring of the four subagendas of the Social Strategic Agenda, in the framework of
the National Accord, yielded as a lesson learned that these monitoring mechanisms
provide the inputs needed to make informed decisions at the highest level, provided that
priority is given to the most strategic goals, oriented towards solving the country’s
problems and aligned with national planning instruments. Moreover, it is important to
develop indicators that are timely and feasible in terms of quality, quantity, and
measurement times.

Also noteworthy is the work done to position the Social Agenda to ensure the
sustainability of the core social policies that are approved. A main lesson from these
activities is the importance of results-based planning and monitoring.

Lastly, in terms of the overall performance of this component, the technical support
provided for planning and monitoring procurements and financial management was
timely in terms of ensuring that the required administrative, contracting, and
procurements processes were conducted in due time and form. Accordingly, this strategy
constitutes an important lesson learned.

III. An evaluation of the Bank’s performance, including the effectiveness of its
relationships, with a special emphasis on lessons learned.
The World Bank team provided support to the UATP at all times, which made for a
streamlined implementation process. There was ongoing communication with the Bank’s
team, which meant that response times to requests for no objection were quite short. In
addition, the team authorized the restructuring of the project when a proposal was made
for a series of studies and technical assistance operations that would provide inputs for
monitoring the targets and indicators of the Social Agenda (in its four subagendas: social
protection, education, health, and food security), for monitoring the National Accord, as
well as elements for decision-making on the public social policies that would be given
priority in the framework of the 2014-2018 government transition. These activities fall
under five categories: prospective studies, studies on efficiency and inclusion of social
programs, strategic communication of the results achieved in the area of social protection,
and technical-fiduciary support for project implementation. All this made it possible to
position the Social Agenda at all levels and prepare transition agendas for the social
sector. These activities were implemented by the SDP in close coordination with the
SDS. In addition, the Bank provided valuable support that contributed to the success of
the Latin American Forum on Social Protection: Challenges for the Consolidation of
Social Policy.

IV. A description of the provisions that are proposed for the future operation of the
project.
With Bank financing and in light of the results obtained from each one of the consulting
assignments contracted that are directly related to the government transition strategy and
in relation to the objectives, it can be concluded that the SDP has sufficient
documentation to strengthen the government transition process, on core issues and public
policies in its thematic pillar Human Development and Social Protection, all in
coordination with the Secretariat of Social Development and civil society.

Contribution from the Secretariat of Social Development
1. Evaluation of the objectives, design, and implementation of the project.
The Government of Honduras and the World Bank (WB), in November 2010, agreed to
strengthen the Secretariat of Social Development (SDS) with resources from Component
1 of the Nutrition and Social Protection Project (Credit IDA-4097) and from Component
1.3 of the Social Protection Project in support of the Bono 10,000 (Credit IDA-4774), for
the purpose of establishing a Comprehensive Social Protection Strategy for Honduras.

The actions contained in this project have enabled the SDS to lay the groundwork for
effective implementation of social assistance and protection measures in the country,
through a strategy that promotes broad participation by public and private actors not only
at the central level but also at the level of the confederations of municipalities selected for
validation.

The strategy used for project implementation has five components, which are the vehicle
for achieving the project objectives: (1) Definition, Enactment, and Approval of the
Social Protection Policy; (2) Strategic Plan for Implementation of the Social Protection
Policy; (3) National Information Center for the Social Sector (CENISS) and the
Consolidated Public Social Policy Evaluation System (SUEPPS); (4) Capacity-building
of the UAP/SDP and SDS; (5) Operational Expenses of the SDS.

Part (1), Definition, Enactment, and Approval of the Social Protection Policy, was
based on a broad consultation and consensus-building process among the government
institutions in the social sector, civil society organizations mostly representing the most
vulnerable sectors in the country, and private business, in order to have a national policy
in place whose sustainability would be assured.

Plans called for a consulting assignment for the design of the Social Protection Public
Policy and three workshops for a review of background, new competencies of institutions
involved in social development and poverty, creation of the Social Protection Technical
Committee, analysis and discussion of progress towards developing the Policy, as well as
dissemination of the final document.

The Social Protection Policy was unanimously approved by the Council of Ministers
through Executive Decree PCM 008-2012, published in the official gazette “La Gaceta”
on Wednesday, 28 March 2012.

Part (2), Strategic Plan for Implementation of the Social Protection Policy, was also
based on a broad consultation process between the public sector and the civil society
organizations representing the vulnerable sectors targeted by the agreed upon Social
Protection Policy.

Plans called for a consulting assignment for the design of the Strategic Plan for
Implementation of the Social Protection Policy 2011-2015 and three workshops to


                                              46
establish the strategic guidelines, identify co-responsibilities, and review and adjust the
strategic plan.

Institutional, public, and audible versions of the approved Social Protection Policy were
circulated. The latter was arranged in collaboration with civil society organizations
representing the disability sector in the framework of the Social Protection Technical
Committee.

At project completion, the SDS has an implementation plan for the Social Protection
Policy, which it is executing as planned. In preparation for the transition, the SDS is
positioning the Social Protection Policy in coordination with the SDP, and the activities
to define the strategic transition agendas for social protection incorporate the guiding
principles of the implementation plan for the Social Protection Policy.

Part (3), National Information Center for the Social Sector (CENISS) and the
Consolidated Public Social Policy Evaluation Center (SUEPPS), is based on the
conceptual design and development of the tools needed for timely decision-making using
quality social data, based on the experience and expectations of the various actors
involved in the implementation of social policies and programs.

A consulting assignment was arranged for the conceptual design of the Consolidated
Public Social Policy Evaluation System (SUEPPS), including the organization of two
workshops with technical representatives to design the components and publicize the
conceptual design, a consulting assignment to analyze and design the following
submodules: (1) program and project monitoring; (2) consultations, reports, and
executive panels on social program and project monitoring processes;
(3) administration of users for the previous subsystems, as well as consulting
assignments to analyze and design the following submodules: (1) registry of indicators
for monitoring public policies; (2) systematization, searches, and consultations on
the systematization of social program and project monitoring processes; and (3)
administration of users for the previous subsystems. Both consulting assignments are
part of the SUEPPS Monitoring Module.

In the framework of implementation of the SUEPPS, the following actions should be
noted: (i) monitoring exercise following the methodology proposed in the conceptual
design of the program Vaso de Leche [Cup of Milk]; and (ii) analysis of the evolution of
the Basic Social Development Indicators in the confederations participating in the Social
Protection Roundtables (COLOSUCA, MANCOURISJ, MAMUNCRAC, GUISAYOTE,
Gulf of Fonseca Region). At present, the process is being organized to establish the
baseline for evaluating the nutritional status of children in preschool and first grade who
receive a school snack in coordination with the SEDUC, SESAL, and the PMA. There
are plans in 2013 to conduct monitoring of the basic social development indicators in the
social protection roundtables. At project completion, the SDS has the SUEPPS
information platform developed and implementation is under way for the Monitoring
Module, and the platform for the system evaluation module is in development.



                                            47
As for the National Information Center for the Social Sector (CENISS), under the project,
hardware for use of the SUEPPS was procured, technical assistance was contracted for
the design, layout, and production of information and training materials on the CENISS
and the SUEPPS, an event was held to launch the CENISS, and specialized trainings
were organized to build the skills of the CENISS team.

At present, the CENISS is helping to equip the Honduran government with tools to make
social sector interventions in the country more efficient and effective. The SDS, with
national funds and financial support under the project and from other partners (UNDP),
has been developing the infrastructure of the National Information Center for the Social
Sector (CENISS) and its components Unique Registry of Beneficiaries (RUB, for its
acronym in Spanish), the Institutional Provider Registry (ROI), and the National
Documentation Center (CENAD). Development of the conceptual design and the
software application for the CENISS and the Institutional Provider Registry (ROI)
component was completed in the first half of 2012 with national funds. To date, both are
in operation and functional.

Part (4), Capacity-building of the UAP/SDP and SDS, has consisted in contracting
consulting services for administrative and procurement support for the project, which is
executed and supervised by the SDP, and a consulting assignment to coordinate, liaise,
and monitor SDS institutional strengthening activities for the implementation of projects
with the World Bank and the UNDP, whose results and lessons learned have been
systematized, the procurement of portable audiovisual equipment for workshops,
meetings, and coordination events, an exchange mission for the Honduran and Mexican
governments to share their experiences with evaluation and monitoring and the
registration of beneficiaries of social programs, as well as a mission for Honduras and the
Dominican Republic to share experiences for the implementation of the targeting system
for social compensation mechanisms.

Lastly, Part (5), Operational Expenses of the SDS, consisted in the procurement of some
materials for workshops.

2. Evaluation of the project impacts against the project objectives

In light of the results obtained in relation to the objectives, it can be concluded that the
SDS has a comprehensive framework of policies, strategies, and tools in place to promote
inclusive social development. Following its approval, the Social Protection Policy has
been integrated into the Institutional Plans in the framework of the strategic plan for
implementation of the Policy, and specific measures are already being taken in the
relation to the pillars of coordination between and within institutions as well as
among policies, inclusion of the population in conditions of poverty, extreme
poverty, vulnerability, and social exclusion, establish permanent monitoring and
evaluation systems for the Social Protection Policy, in the framework of the
components of the Social Protection Policy.




                                            48
Likewise, in coordination with the SDP and the civil society organizations that make up
the Social Protection Technical Committee, a transition agenda is being developed that
will enable the progress made thus far to be integrated into the new government’s action
plans so that financing is available for the implementation of specific priority actions for
the sectors targeted by the policy.

The CENISS has already proven to be an effective decision-making tool for important
programs and projects such as the Bono de Solidaridad Productiva [Productive Solidarity
Supplement Program], Mi Primer Empleo [My First Job], Vivienda de Interés Social
[Low-cost Housing], and the Bono 10,000 program.

3. Evaluation of the government’s performance during project preparation and
implementation.
Since the start of his administration, President Lobo has worked hard to lay the
groundwork in the social sector for the nation’s sustainable development. Based on this
commitment, he created the Secretariat of Social Development, which has made it
feasible to set the framework conditions for social policy. In the context of the project,
the SDS fully assumed its role in the design, execution, monitoring, and evaluation of the
planned activities, bringing them successfully and sustainably to fruition. The SDS has
fulfilled its role in guiding the formulation of the Social Protection Policy and its
Implementation Plan, coordinating institutional services for vulnerable sectors, improving
the targeting criteria and mechanisms of the principal social programs and projects, and
laying the foundation for monitoring and evaluation.

4. Evaluation of the World Bank’s performance during project preparation and
implementation.
The team designated by the World Bank provided support to the SDS throughout the
project implementation process, demonstrating an attitude of openness to the specific
needs identified by the institution and a constant willingness to help us technically with
the different components of the project. Despite the problems that arose with
procurements, contracts, and infrastructure, the Bank team helped the SDS follow
through with these processes, which were completed satisfactorily, along with systematic
and timely supervision of the project.

5. Discussion of project sustainability and the government’s plans for the future of
the program and the different incentives under the project.
Based on the results obtained with the project and with the approval of the Framework
Law on Public Social Policies, the legal foundation is established, as well as the
institutional competencies for regulating, steering, and coordinating the actions for
transforming the human, sociocultural, and material conditions with an emphasis on the
vulnerable population, the creation of the National Council on Coordination of Social
Policies, which strengthens the Social Protection Technical Committee, consolidates the
competencies of the Secretariat of Social Development, defines the mechanisms for
allocating resources for financing, and lastly, instructs the public institutions that execute
social programs to adjust their work plans and budgets for coordinated implementation, it



                                             49
can be concluded that the project results are completely aligned and consistent with the
stated objectives, and their sustainability is assured.

Contribution from the Secretariat of Health

a.   Implementation of the AIN-C

Services began to be provided as part of implementation of the AIN-C strategy in May
2008 with the first 265 communities and an average registration of: (i) 3,749 children;
(ii) 951 pregnant women in 13 municipalities in 4 departments: Copán, Lempira,
Intibucá, and La Paz. With the inclusion of the departments of El Paraíso and
Ocotepeque, coverage was expanded and the second and third stages were formalized
with 773 communities, with an initial average registration of (i) 11,006 children under the
age of two; (ii) 4,522 pregnant women in 63 municipalities in 6 departments. With the
process of selection, the physical target of 1,000 communities was met at the start of the
intervention, and 1,038 communities were ultimately covered.

In the third stage of communities selected for intervention with the AIN-C strategy,
coverage was expanded to the departments of Copán, Lempira, Intibucá, and La Paz,
reaching 452 communities and 5,824 children under the age of two. The delivery of AIN-
C services was facilitated by external health providers who were contracted in a
competitive bidding process.

By department, the main findings on global malnutrition were as follows: Department of
Copán: In May 2008, the organization ESA/ASP was contracted to provide the AIN
services in Copán, for 68 communities and 698 children, with a global malnutrition rate
of 21%. Department of Lempira: The second stage involving 135 communities was
contracted to the provider ANED for a period of two years, with a global malnutrition
rate of 16.4% at completion. Department of Intibucá: The second stage involving 107
communities was contracted to the provider ANED for a period of two years, with
services provided to an average of 1,556 children under the age of two, and a global
malnutrition rate of 16.4% at completion. Department of La Paz: The provider CRS
provides AIN-C services in 22 communities serving on average 349 children, and with
22% of children below the third percentile, coverage was expanded to 1,471 children.
Department of Ocotepeque: This department was selected due to its high rates of
poverty and malnutrition; the ELB identified 1,086 children in 130 communities in 14
municipios in the department of Ocotepeque. A service contract was signed with
Christian Relief Services, and 1,390 children were receiving services at completion, with
a global malnutrition rate of 14%. Department of El Paraíso: The purpose was to
improve the nutritional status of 2,295 children registered with the ELB, in 184
communities in 9 municipios in the department of El Paraíso, with 2,365 children
ultimately registered, and a global malnutrition rate of 11.3% at completion.

b.    Summary of indicators by health region

The percentage of children remaining in the program has averaged 96%, an indicator
that suggests that the strategy has been embraced by parents and the children who are
the primary beneficiaries.

The percentage of children below the third percentile for weight is the global
malnutrition seen in the targeted communities through the AIN-C strategy, with Intibucá
having the highest malnutrition rate, at 25%, among the departments, followed by
Lempira at 21% and La Paz at 19%. The average rate for this indicator is 19%.

The strategy promotes and monitors exclusive breastfeeding in a child’s first six months
of life, a practice that has been shown to support the health and good growth and
development of the baby.

c.   External impact evaluation of the AIN-C strategy.
The results of the impact evaluation of the most important nutritional indicators point to
declines of 4.7 percentage points in chronic malnutrition, 3.1 percentage points in global
malnutrition, and 4.6 percentage points in the risk of acute malnutrition. These results are
statistically significant with 95% confidence.

The AIN-C strategy also resulted in expanded delivery of micronutrient supplements to
children under two years of age. Zinc supplementation increased by 21.9 percentage
points and iron supplementation by 20.4 percentage points. Nevertheless, no significant
impacts have been observed on anemia levels, which suggests that the strategy should be
strengthened by counseling mothers to refrain from giving their children supplements
with other types of food, such milk and eggs, which inhibit absorption. The AIN-C
strategy has also had a positive impact on breastfeeding and child nutrition indicators: the
percentage of children being breastfed exclusively to six months has increased by 4.2
percentage points, and the consumption of liquids other than water and milk prior to six
months has fallen by 3.5 percentage points. There has also been an increase in the
consumption of cereals, eggs, and thick soups after six months of age. The positive

                                            51
impact on the percentage of children consuming thick soups is very important because it
is specific recommendation made by the AIN-C strategy to mothers through health
workers.
Although the evaluation did not find significant impacts on child morbidity, it does show
that mothers have acquired more knowledge about health, on acute diarrheal disease,
acute respiratory infection, and health care during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Checkups have increased by 13.1 percentage points for pregnant women, by 11.3
percentage points for children with acute diarrheal disease, and by 13.5 percentage points
for children with acute respiratory illness. Referrals to health clinics for cases of acute
diarrheal diseases increased by 6.5 percentage points, and the percentage of women
receiving prenatal care rose by 3.2 percentage points. Based on these findings, continuing
with the AIN-C strategy and strengthening it with food security strategies is
recommended. It is also important to look further into the reasons why the strategy has
not had an impact on the prevalence of childhood anemia and identify possible solutions.


d.   Implementation of the AIN-C with the early stimulation component

AIN-C services under the early stimulation module are being provided by the Christian
Children’s Fund (CCF) in 17 communities in the municipio of Chinacla, department of
La Paz, with coverage for 297 children under the age of two and the participation of 52
health workers; the services will be continued by the Red Cross.

e.   Main lessons learned
-    The decentralized provider implementing the strategy should have experience with
     the health component, inasmuch as it will be facilitating the fieldwork. It should
     also have a solid financial base.
-    The provider’s technical team should include an information technology specialist,
     with training in the electronic SIME and the AIN-C, since during the first year,
     management of the information system was problematic, with responsibility falling
     to the technical personnel.
-    The health workers are key for the development of the process considering that
     each worker should not be responsible for more than eight communities, or seven
     communities in the case of the early stimulation component, in order to ensure the
     quality of monitoring. In addition, these workers should receive appropriate pay so
     they do not resign.
-    The technical personnel in the departmental health control regions and the
     Coverage and Financing Extension Unit (UECF) who conduct performance
     monitoring and evaluations should be trained in all components of the strategy as
     well as in the methodology and instruments that are applied for contract
     monitoring.
f.   Financing
Component 2 has two subcomponents: (i) coverage expansion of the AIN-C model with a
budgetary allocation of US$11.5 million; and (ii) institutional strengthening of the
Secretariat of Health with a budgetary allocation of US$3.0 million.

                                            52
In summary, there was a total investment of credit funds of US$11,363,524 as of June.
However, during this grace period, the execution of the remainder of the credit and
counterpart funds is pending, due to the fact that payment of income tax of
GESAWORLD is being incorporated, so to date the financial execution rate is 99% and
will be 100% of the total once the incorporation has been approved and that tax is paid
(the total approved credit was US$11,500,000). As for counterpart funds, US$2,326,884
of US$3,000,000 had been executed as of June, for an execution rate of 78%, with the
expenses from the grace period still pending. The total investment of external and
national funds was US$13,690,408, for an overall financial execution rate of 98% as of
June 2013.

Contribution from the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security

Impacts of the Mi Primer Empleo [My First Job] Program
The program generated a number of impacts at the institutional level, on the young
beneficiaries, on the training centers (CECAP) that participated, and on the firms that
hired these young people for internships or employment. The SLSS partnered with other
institutions such as the Secretariat for Indigenous and Afro-Honduran People
(SEDINAFROH),, the Secretariat of Education through PRONEEAH, chambers of
commerce, the Honduran Institute for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug addiction
(IHADFA), and the Secretariat of Health, with a shared objective and created job training
opportunities for young people, with a comprehensive system of services, strengthening
the Department of Employment through orientation services, which also provided
psychological counseling services for the young people participating in the program. The
Secretariat of Social Development joined forces with the SLSS, becoming the first
project in which a partnership was created to select young people eligible for Mi Primer
Empleo, through the Unique Registry of Beneficiaries (RUB).

The young people who graduated from the program received training in technical skills,
giving them a tool for social inclusion and employment. Of them, 975 had jobs six
months after completing the program, enabling them to provide their households with
new aspirations and income, and a large number of them returned to school. Of the young
people from indigenous groups, 39 of them, mostly from the Lenca community, found
employment.

Based on the lessons learned from the first three rounds, the fourth one was designed to
better coordinate the involvement of the different institutions that could refer at-risk
youth, with the result that 1,900 young people were enrolled, 105 from indigenous
groups. Cancelling the fourth round has a negative impact on young people, especially
those who were already enrolled, and on the associations and institutions with which the
program was promoted.

Aspects to note
As part of the program execution process, there are aspects that as the executing agency,
the SLSS, through the project coordination unit (PCU), recognizes and recommends to

                                            53
financial institutions, for the purpose of improving program results and execution. The
following as some aspects that the PCU considers to be important:

      Operations carried out with more than one executing agency are complex, and
       execution can be challenging, with communications compromised by staff
       turnover in positions at the executing units.
      The World Bank’s Procurement Plan Management System (SEPA for its acronym
       in Spanish) is not designed to provide independence to each executing unit of the
       participating institutions, so a great deal of coordination must occur in order to
       upload a single procurement plan to the system, making the SEPA a bottleneck in
       project execution.
      The Bank’s procurement specialist is willing and able, but due to the volume of
       work generated by the country portfolio, we understand that it is hard to provide
       quick service, so it would be a good idea to have technical assistance to provide
       support in this area.
      A culture of communication should be promoted within the Bank, so that
       decisions on actions related to the execution of projects are made by consensus
       among all the areas involved, thus preventing burnout within the institution and
       additional work for the executing units.
      The absence of clear guidelines for contracting the co-executing agency for Mi
       Primer Empleo was one of the biggest obstacles, and as a result the program was
       not executed.
      Greater commitment by the government is needed to execute this type of project,
       in pursuit of national development.
      Bureaucratic processes at the level of the World Bank and the government draw
       out response times and delay decisions that are essential to the program.

On the quality of the World Bank’s contribution:
We would like to acknowledge the technical assistance that we received from the World
Bank’s fiduciary, procurement, and technical teams, as well as the support of the country
office team. We value the contributions and confidence of the World Bank teams to
overcome the various obstacles that arose over the course of the project, especially in
terms of the internal processes to comply with the stipulations of the Agreements and
Operating Manual for the Program.

Annex 11: Methodology of the FEP and AIN-C evaluations

First Employment Program
1.    A longitudinal study of phases I and II of the third round on training of the FEP
program was carried out in 2011. The study analyzed four aspects:

      The participation in the training program improved the beneficiaries’ results in the
       labor market in terms of salaries, benefits and quality of employment;
      The participation in the program reduces risk behavior in beneficiaries;
      Effectiveness of the training provided;
      Comparison among evaluated groups of their live standards.

2.    The study followed youth who participated in the training and those who enrolled
but did not take the training. The study was designed to capture information nine months
and 12 months after completing the training. The study covers a sample of 1,641 young
15-19 year-olds of a universe of 2,150 (or 76 percent). A total of 1,491 are the
beneficiaries and 290 are the control group. Questionnaires were designed and applied to
the participants. The consulting firm that carried out the study used as the baseline the
database provided by the SLSS.

AIN-C Program

3.    The impact evaluation of AIN-C used a quasi-experimental evaluation that applied
an intensity model with and without effects in the communities. The results obtained
through this methodology were further explored through workshops in beneficiary
communities to undertake a deeper qualitative analysis of AIN-C.

4.    Quantitative methodology: the primary data were collected in four moments in time
with a first measurement and three follow up measurements: six, 12 and 22 months, after
the first data collection. The sample was divided in two groups: beneficiary and non-
beneficiary communities. The units of observation were: children under two years of age,
pregnant women, monitoras in the communities under evaluation and community leaders
in the non-intervention communities. The departments were Copan, El Paraiso, Intibuca,
La Paz, Lempira and Ocotepeque.

5.    The IE document includes details on the preparation of the sample, the preparation
and validation of the questionnaires applied and the quality control of the information
collected. This document is part of the ICR electronic files.

Annex 12: Institutional Change/Strengthening Outcomes

1.     The Project contributed to strengthen the three implementing agencies (SOH,
SLSS, SSD) and the SOP through technical assistance and training. Significant
institutional strengthening took place though the preparation of the four rounds for the
FEP and with the implementation of three of these rounds. The SLSS was strengthened
through the establishment of the PCU staffed with personnel trained to manage projects.
It’s financial and procurement capacity was significantly improved with Bank support
and the implementation of internal controls, succeeding in using all available resources
for the FEP and contributing to increase transparency in their working processes, all
available in the SLSS’s web. Provision of furniture, equipment for information systems
and upgraded infrastructure for the SLSS contributed to institutional strengthening as
well. The Directorate for Employment (Dirección General de Empleo, DGE) was
strengthened through the definition of a new organizational structure and staff. The
CECAPs were strengthened as well, empowered to lead the beneficiaries’ selection
process and the promotion activities, tailored to be local and close to the potential
beneficiaries. They led a process of interaction with grassroots local organizations in
particular to reach afro-Hondurans and indigenous youth. The SENAEH was also
strengthened. An orientation service to citizens (Servicio de Atención al Ciudadano)
within the SLSS was established to direct people within the SLSS and IT support
(internet access and webpage for FPE) was provided for the SLSS regional offices in San
Pedro Sula, Choluteca, Danli, El Progreso, Comayagua, La Ceiba y Tegucigalpa.

2.    The Project contributed to design a comprehensive support system for youth at risk
who were targeted by FEP. The DGE was strengthened through the establishment of the
Employment Orientation Service (Servicio de Orientación, SOE) where young people
could receive psychological guidance and support as they prepared to look for a job.
Psychometric tests were applied to young people as part of the support provided to find a
job. The SLSS established alliances with key institutions such as the Secretariat of
Education (through the Program for Education of Indigenous People, PRONEEAH),
Secretariat for Indigenous People (SEDINAFROH), chambers of commerce, SOH,
Honduran Institute for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug addiction (IHADFA). In
the context of the fourth FEP round, the SLSS and SSD agreed to collaborate using the
Single Beneficiary Registry (RUB) to select the young people to participate in the FEP,
based on the requirements of the Program.

3.    The support for AIN-C contributed to significant institutional building at the
central, regional and local level in the SOH. The SOH played a leading role in developing
a basic package of services for centralized and decentralized providers, to be followed by
other donors who implement the AIN-C Program. The Project supported the development
and implementation of an information, monitoring, and evaluation system (Sistema de
Información, Monitoreo y Evaluación, SIME) to capture the program’s information and
generate indicators to assess progress. SOH staff at municipal and regional levels was
trained in the content and use of the SIME, which contributed to better quality of
information provided from these levels and the use of the indicators generated by the
SIME to adjust the program when needed. Furthermore, the AIN-C program has been

                                           61
incorporated to the university level studies of nursing. Teachers were trained in
Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, and La Ceiba in the modules of monitoring and growth,
assistance to sick children in their communities and assistance to pregnant women in their
communities in 2011 and 2012.

4.    The AIN-C Program worked with results-based contracts with the NGOs, building
a culture of performance and results. The management and supervision of these contracts
contributed to building capacity in the regional and municipal levels of the SOH.

5.    The Project provided support to define core competencies and functioning of the
SSD. Technical assistance was provided to strengthen the SSD administrative and
procurement capacity, and project management capacity building activities. Study trips to
understand how other social programs work and other countries experiences were carried
out with Mexico and the Dominican Republic.
