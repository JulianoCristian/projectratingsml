I Project Introduction
1.1 Background and Significance of the Project
(1) The Capacity-Expansion Project of Wuchang-Guangzhou Railway Line, covering a
length of 1082 km starting from Wuchang in the north and ending at Guangzhou in the
south, including the sublines related either to Wuhan pivot or Guangzhou pivot,
traverses over 20 cities and counties in Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong provinces.
In 1992, a feasibility report was finished for the Capacity Expansion of Wu-Guang Rail
Line, a national key construction project, and was submitted to the State Planning
Commission for approval. In 1996,a technical design was made and was examined and
approved by the Appraisal Center of the Ministry of Railways in March 1997.
Subsequently in March 1997, the 4h Surveying & DesigningInstitute of the Ministry of
Railways, as the designing agent, began spot-surveying along the rail line and by
Feb. 1998 had virtually finished the detailed design for construction.
The construction of the Capacity Expansion Project, to be started full-scaled in 1998,
will approach from the south to the north, with the section from Hengyang to
Guangzhou to be attempted in 1999 and the whole line to be completed in 2000.
(2) Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, a trunk line traversing China from north to south, has
been playing a very important role in boosting national economic growth and propelling
the society forward by functioning as the mainstay in the overall railway networks in
China. Wuhan and Guangzhou, two metropolises and passenger transportation centers,
are crucial termini in the passenger transportation framework along Jing-Guang Line.
After the engineering of the electrification capacity expansion for the section from
Beijing to Wuchang was completed, it is even more strategically urgent to start the samne
engineering for the section from Wuhan to Guangzhou so that the capacity expansion
4



will be able to augment transport volume, increase trains in operation, expedite the
transferring speed, add more comfort to passengers, improve the prestige of the railway
and enhance the competitive ability of the railway. More important is that Wu-Guang
line is the land line linking inland and coastal cities. It has been playing a very
important role in politics, economy and other fields in the past, at present and will still
be so in the future, and it is also the important transport artery from north to south in the
existing and planned railway net.
1.2 The Ownership of the Project and
the Organizational Institutions
The Ministry of Railways (MOR) is the project owner of the Capacity Expansion of
Wuhan-Guangzhou Railway Line.  Guangzhou Railway Conglomerate Company
(GRCC) and Zhengzhou Railway Bureau (ZRB) are the authorized agents functioning
as the project owner in the capacity of MOR. GRCC has set up an engineering
headquarters at Zhuzhou responsible of the engineering in Guangdong Province and
Hunan Province. Likewise, Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has also set up an engineering
headquarters at Wuhan responsible of the engineering in Hubei. The land acquisition
and resettlement for the Project have been contracted by the MOR respectively to the
Guangdong Provincial Land Administration Bureau (LAB), Hunan Provincial LAB and
Hubei LAB. The MOR and the local governments have reached agreements about
such issues as organizational institutions, compensation policies, population
resettlement, and compensation payment.
1.3 Measures for Minimizing Land Acquisition
and Housing Demolition
A remarkable revision has been made to the original design plan for the Capacity-
5



Expansion Project by the MOR based on the following considerations:
(1) Beijing-Guangzhou railway shall center on passenger transport while Beijing-
Kowloon on cargo transport. Thus Jing-Guang railway line shall be the mainstay in
China's north-south passenger transport at the end of this century and early next
century.
(2) "Electrification based on the current status " principle shall be applied in Wuhan-
Guangzhou rail line capacity expansion, which means except for a few railway stations,
railway yards and passenger service installations, the current railwvay installations shall
largely remain unaltered, without adding new tracks and extending the existing tracks to
the stations and the sections along the line.
(3) In principle, no new living facilities shall be constructed and the building of new
residential housing shall be strictly limited. The welfare residential housing shall be
built only sufficiently for the new recruits resulting from the expansion project.
(4) Technical renovation shall be minimized. Wherever it is necessary, it shall be
proved with sufficient sound grounds.
(5) No new water sources shall be built.
(6) The design for construction shall be optimized.  The relation between land
acquisition and resettlement on the one hand and the engineering construction on the
other shall be tackled in an appropriate way, taking full advantage of slack farning
seasons and the breaks between rounds of crop growing, diminishing the impacts.
(7) Some sub-projects which are not necessary ones and have more difficulty and more
housing demolition were canceled in the second examination of the Project. For
example: the sub-project of Huadu engine back-tuming section, the sub-project of
6



Huadu train repairing section, the sub-project of Changsha passenger engine
maintenance yard, the sub-project of Liouyanghe linking line, the sub-project of Miluo
rail track increase and station reconstruction.
Compared wvith the original design plan, the revised one shows a considerable drop of
the land amount to be acquired, the housing to be demolished and the number of
persons to be affected. According to the original plan, a sum of 6582 mu of land
would be acquired along the line for the project as against only 3708.26 mu in the
revised plan, a decrease by 44%; 279467 m2 of housing would be demolished and
relocated as against 11365.64m2 in the revised plan, a decrease by 60%;.
According to the revised plan, the land acquisition will be concentrated on Wuhan
railway pivot, Changsha district, Zhuzhou pivot, Hengyang pivot and Guangzhou pivot
where the capacity expansion will focus on electrification engineering and its necessary
auxiliary engineering of facilities conceming communication, signal system and engine
maintenance sector, and the technical renovation engineering necessary for enhancing
the travelling speed of passenger train and the capability of ensuring its traverse, arrival
and departure.
1.4 Preparatory Work for Land Acquisition, Housing
Demolition and Relocation, Resettlement
(1) Circumscription of Land Acquisition
The project designing unit conducted explorations along the line for the project during
its technical design stage, surveying and circumscribing the land to be acquired and
housing to be demolished, working out the cross-sectional drawings of the rail line and
the drawings of housing.  The land acquisition and housing scope maximally
circumnscribed at the technical design stage, can be more specified and diminished in
the actual implementation of land acquisition and housing demolition & relocation
7



according to the design of construction.
(2) Socioeconomic Survey
In order to make analyses of the impacts on the localities caused by the Project and
work out a practicable and feasible action plan, the 4th Surveying & Designing Institute,
entrusted by the MOR, collabourated with the Wuhan Engineering Headquarters of
Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and Zhuzhou Engineering Headquarters of Guangzhou
Railway Conglomerate Company in conducting a socioeconomic survey along Wuhan-
Guangzhou rail line. The joint survey squad, in close cooperation with the land
administration departments of Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong provinces, organized a
socioeconomic survey to Guangzhou, Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Changsha, Wuhan and their
subordinate districts and counties from May to Sept of 1998. A great amount of
valuable information was obtained by collecting various existing statistics, making on-
the-spot interviews and conducting sample investigation.The socioeconomic survey has
provided a sound base for mapping out the resettlement action plan.
(3) Investigation on the Project Impacts
In June 1998, ZRB and GRCC respectively entrusted the local government of various
levels in Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong to conduct on-the-spot investigations on the
various subprojects of the Project, conceming the land acquisition, the housing
demolition & relocation, the number of affected population, the labour resettlement,
infrastructure, above-ground attachment, etc. By investigating from village to village,
block to block and door to door, the investigation squads got to know in great detail the
damages caused by the project engineering.
(4) Consultation of the MOR and the Relevant Provinces
In May 1998, vice-minister Cai Qinghua of the MOR, director of Foreign Capital
Introduction & Utilization of the MOR and their party went to Hubei, Hunan and
Guangdong to interview the vice-govemors of these provinces who are responsible of
national key projects. They reached a consensus on the issues relating to land
S



acquisition, housing demolition and population resettlement, as well as the forming of
organizational institutions and the coordination between the MOR and the local
govermnents.
(5) Preparation of Population Resettlement Action Plan
The preparation of resettlement action plan (RAP) was entrusted by the project owner
to GRCC, ZRB and the 4h Surveying & Designing Institute of the MOR and joined by
the land administration departments of Hunan, Hubei and Guangdong provinces. The
project owner also invited specialists in resettlement from the Research Institute of
Foreign Capital Introduction & Utilization of SWJU as advisers for the project. All
the particinants in the drawing-up of RAP have successively finished the founding of
the resettlement institutions, the scope detennination of the project impacts, the
socioeconomic surveys, the investigation on the property damage, the study and analysis
of relevant policies and regulations, the consultation and decision of the resettlement
plan of affected population, and the compensation estimation calculation. Based on
the above work, the Resettlement Action Plan for the Electrification Capacity
Expansion Project of Wuhan-Guangzhou Railway was completed.
The following table shows the statistics of the land acquisition and housing demolition
along the Wu-Guang railway line.

2 Project Impacts
In the design of the capacity expansion engineering of Wuhan-Guangzhou rail line,
means have been tried as many as possible to minimize land acquisition by making full
use of the existing rail lines and facilities. Nevertheless, land, however limited, has to
be acquired and housing to be demolished, and some people to move away to a new
place. This is especially true with such pivot sub-projects as in Guangzhou, Hengyang,
Zhuzhou, Changsha and Wuhan.
2.1 Land Acquisition
(1) The Project will use 3708.26 mu of land, including 2397.72 mu cultivated land
and, with 16210 persons from 3871 households to be affected.
(2) The Project will use 1562.46 mu of land in the three big cities ( Guangzhou city,
Changsha city and Wuhan city ), and 2145.8 mu of land along the line in the three
province (Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan). Except for 1000 mu of waste land in Qingyan
city, only 1145.8 mu of land will be acquired along over 1000 Km of line in the three
provinces, only one mu of the land being acquired per Km.
(3) Land acquired are owned collectively, the land left after acquisition, therefore
allow of reallocation within the village, Except for the three big cities, namely
Guangzhou, Wuhan and ChangSha which may have troubles in land reallocation, the
other places along the line can handle the land for people affected by way of land
reallocation.
X All cities and counties along Wu-Guang line are comparatively developed rural
areas. The income from farming makes up low proportion in their total income. For
example, the income from farning of peasants on the suburb of Guangzhou taken up
less than 10% of their total income, that of Changsha taken up 20% of their total
income. So, it is possible to handle the production problem of people affected by way of
various means.
11



(5) The Project involves 100 mu of the land owned by the Railway and cultivated by
farmers. Though the consultation between the railway construction units and local
goverrnents , the same land compensation standards will be adopted with these land,
which means these land will be treated in compensation as land owned by collectives.
The following table is about the amount, types and places land acquired along Wu-
Guang line.

2.2 Housing Demolition & Relocation
(1) After the original design for the Capacity Expansion Project was revised on the
principle of "electrification based on the current conditions", the housing demolition
demand of the project has decreased drastically and has been highly concentrated on
such major subprojects as Guanzhou pivot, Wuhan pivot, Changsha pivot, Zhuzhou
pivot and Hengyang pivot--especially Changsha Pivot. In order to alleviate pressure of
passenger transportation, the MOR has decided to have Changsha passenger station
expanded. As a result, Shangsha Station is protrude as a convergence of housing
demolition.
(2) The affected population who will lost the whole or part of their housing is 618
persons from 167 households. Except for 5 urban households, the others are farners.
The existing housing is improperly set with sanitary conditions poor and building
construction rough.
(3) Besides private housing, 35 enterprises and shops need to be demolished and
illegal buildings owned by 9 households does so. The illegal buildings were temporarily
built by the jobbing peasants from other places when they were employed in Wuhan.
(4) Among the features of the demolition along Wu-Guang line is that demolition
within the railway sector takes up the half of the whole demolition. In other words,
there are 256 households with 783 population and 34 enterprises within the railway
sector to be demolished, in addition to 3 illegal buildings owned by railway staff and
workers to be demolished.
The following table is about the housing demolition outside and within the railway
sector along Wu-Guang line.

2.5 Analysis of Project Impacts
The impacts resulting from the land acquisition and housing demolition for the
Capacity Expansion in Wuhan-Guangzhou Railway Line fall into three types:
(1) Impacts along the Line
Because of the application of "electrification based on existing facilities", there are
almost no projects along the line, no extension of rails nor widening of tracks, except
for some minor auxiliary projects involving very little land acquisition, averaging Is
than one mu every square km with a population affected, averaging less than one person
every square km. So the project can produce little impact along the line. The affected
villages can re-arrange the production and livelihood of the affected individuals by
reallocating land, which means there is no surplus laborer to be resettled.
(2) Impacts at the Pivots
As the land acquisition for the Expansion Project is converged at such major pivot areas
as Guangzhou, Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Changsha and Wuhan, a considerable amount of
land acquisition will result in a considerable amount of housing demolition in those
areas. The affected areas are either prosperous cities or comparatively prosperous
urban-rural junctions. The magnitude of land acquisition in the city suburbs is bound
to aggravate the problem of more population with less land, this is especially true of the
extra-large cities like Guangzhou, Changshs and Wuhan., along with urbanization and
modemization, which have caused a rapid diminution of cultivated land,. However, the
economic mainstay of those areas is no longer agricultual production. The income
from farming counts only 10% of the entire income in those areas. Therefore,
although land acquisition can generate grave impact on the local income from
agriculture, its impact on the total income of those areas is comparatively slight
Moreover, the local township enterprises and secondary and tertiary industries may
provide means of life and employment chances for the affected people.
(3) Impacts on the railway sector
33



The Capacity-Expansion Project of Wu-Guan Railing involves more than 50000 square
meter of housing, tens of shops, hundreds of the railway worker's housing to be
demolished. Particularly in Changsha and Xiannin , the People involved are
comparatively more, and demolition extends wide. The Ministry of Railway makes use
of the land of its own to handle employment and residence of affected people with the
Railway sector, moreover, these affected people from the places involved mass
demolition are resettled through purchasing a mass of Commercial apartments for them.
So no laborer will lose his job.
For detailed date of the impacts from the land acquired and housing demolition along
Wu-Guang line, see the following table:

3 Law Framework
In China, policies, laws and regulations conceming land acquisition and population
resettlement fall into a four-level hierarchy: at the top level are the fundamental polices,
laws and regulations stipulated and issued by the central government; at the second
level are the detailed implementation methods issued by provincial governments for the
motional regulations; at the third level are the specific policies and regulations by
municipal and county governments feasible in the localities and at the lowest level are
the preferential policies specifically stipulated by local governnents for a certain
project.
3.1 Policies, Laws and Regulations as the Basis
The following are the major policies, laws and regulations for the land acquisition and
resettlement of the Project to go by:
(1) "Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China" (issued in June 1986
and revised in 1988).
(2) "Implementation Methods for the 'Land Administration Law 'of the People's
Republic of China".
(3) "China Regulations for Urban Housing Demolition & Relocation" (1991).
(4) "Guangdong Provincial Implementation Methods for the 'Land Administration Law
of China"'(July 1991).
(5) "Guangdong Provincial Regulations for Urban Housing Demolition & Relocation"
(1993)
(6) "Land Administration Regulations of Guangzhou City" (Dec. 1991).

national land administration laws and taking the local reality into consideration.
(4) The following are the general regulations of Guangdong, Hunan and Hubei
39



Provinces for land compensation:
A. In the acquisition of cultivated land, the compensation rate is 6 times the value of
the annual average output in the past three years prior to the land acquisition.
B. In the acquisition of such land as fish ponds and orchards, the compensation rate is
5 times the value of the annual average output in the past three years prior to the
land acquisition.
C. In the acquisition of such land as barren hilly land and shoals, the land shall be seen
as value-yielding and the compensation rate is 3 times the value of the annual
average output in the past three years prior to the land acquisition.
D. In the acquisition of housing ground site, the compensation rate is the same as that
for the neighboring cultivated land.
E. The compensation rate for young crops and above-ground attachment is the value
of one crop yield.
(5) The following are the general regulations of Guangdong, Hunan and Hubei
Provinces for resettlement compensation:
A. For the land expropriated unit whose cultivated land possession averages more than
one mu per capita before the land acquisition, the resettlement subsidy is 3 times
the value of the annual average output per mu in the past three years before the land
acquisition.
B. For the land expropriated unit whose cultivated land possession averages less than
one mu per capita before the land acquisition, the resettlement subsidy is 4 times
the value of the annual average output per mu in the past three years before the land
acquisition.
C. With every drop in average cultivated land possession by 0.1 mu per capita, the
resettlement subsidy shall accordingly rise one time the value of the annual average
output. But the maximum of resettlement subsidy shall be 10 times the value of
the annual average output.
D. If the above-stated compensation rates are still insufficient for the affected villagers

3.3 Preferential Policies Specfically Stipulated for
the Project of Wu-Guang Line
The Capacity-Expansion engineering in Wu-Guang railway section is profoundly
significant in that it can raise the railway transport capacity of Guangdong, Hunan and
Hubei provinces, improve the investment environment of the three provinces, accelerate
the refonn and opening to the outside world and boost the economic development of the
three provinces. Some specific preferential policies have been made in each of the
three provinces, different in minor points but the same in essentials, for the purpose of
rendering support to the project engineering. Take Document No. 13(1993) of Hunan.
Provincial Government for example. There are some actual measures taken by the
local government to show its support to railway construction:
(1) According to the document, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau will be the
general contractor, the prefecture, municipal and county govenmments will be the
subcontractors;
(2) The land compensation and resettlement subsidy will conform the lowest times of
the Hunan Implementation Methods for Land Administration.
(3) Development fund for fish pond and vegetable plot, fee for auxiliazy projects to
urban construction, labour fee, fee for city layout planning and designing, post
installation fee and construction fund for traffic facilities will be exempted
unexceptionally at provincial, prefecture, municipal and count levels;
(4) Any additional fees claimed by townships and villages shall be exempted;
3.4 The Concord of the Reseftlement Policies
between the World Bank and China
44



(1) The General Policies and Goals Set Out by the World Bank
The major principles advocated by the Bank on population resettlement can be boiled
down into the following two: First, try the best to minimize the amount of land to be
acquired, housing to be demolished and the number of population to be affected by
comparing and appraising alternative resettlement action plans and adjusting the design
plans; second, try the best to handle the resettlement of the affected population if land
acquisition and housing demolition is inevitable, and at least to ensure the affected
population a living standard not lower than that before the land acquisition and further
to enable them to enjoy a better living standard by benefiting from the project.
Such principles of the Bank's can be expounded in the following ways:
A. All the alternative plans should be taken into consideration for the purpose of
avoiding or minimizing land acquisition, housing demolition and the number of
affected population.
B. If population displacement is inevitable; resettlement action plans should be
prepared at the initial stage of engineering preparation.
C. The affected population should receive the compensation sufficient enough to make
up for their loss before their actual removal.
D. The affected population should get help during their removal and transitional
period.
E. The affected population should have means of life and chances of getting better-off.
There should be resettlement policies and plans whereby the production and
livelihood of the resettlers can be rehabilitated.
F. The affected population should be encouraged to take an active part in the whole
process of the planning and conducting of resettlement Appropriate forms of
mass participation should be sought for and the conduit for grievance appealing
established.
G. The immigrants should become identical economically and socially with the native
residents of the resettlement area.
H. Special concern should be shown to the vulnerable group by giving them more
help.                              45



(2) High Concord of China's Policies with the Requirements of the Bank
The current polices and regulations regarding population displacement caused by
project engineering are unanimous with the Bank's goal for migrant resettlement, which
can be illustrated by the resettlement of four types of affected population in the project:
Type 1: urban or rural population affected in residential housing demolition
All the regulations concerning housing demolition issued by the provinces concerned
are meant to ensure the affected population at least a recovery of their former living
standard. According to such regulations, the floorage of the resettlement housing shall
not be less than that of the fonner one; the compensation to all sorts of housing shall be
calculated according to the reconstruction cost; compensation shall be disbursed before
demolition; favorable policies shall be offered to the vulnerable group who are very
poor and suffering from difficult housing condition (if their floorage is below the lowest
average urban floorage standard, the gap shall be mad up; the solitary old folks will be
resettled at the same standard as the one for a couple)
Type 2: enterprises and their employees affected in industrial and commercial housing
demolition
All the regulations concerned are intended to protect the interests of industrial and
commercial enterprises from  being impaired.  According to such regulations,
enterprises and shops shall be compensated at reconstruction cost price.
Compensation shall also be paid for the loss caused by a cessation of production or
business, the cost of moving out and business doing in other place.
Type 3: villages and villagers affected in rural land acquisition
The detailed implementation metiods of land administration by the provinces
concemed prescribe the minimal and maximal sums of compensation for land
compensation. Whenever possible, compensation should be made by land exchange in
46



order to diminish resettlement risk.
Type 4: proprietary right owners and the residents affected in the demolition of
infrastructure
Each province concemed has specific regulations for the infrastructure land acquisition.
According the regulations, infrastructure can be demolished only after it is
reconstructed at the same size elsewhere.
47



4 Compensation Fees
The fee for the land acquisition, housing demolition and resettlement in the Capacity
Expansion Project of Wuhan-Guangzhou railway line, as art of the total budget of the
project, shall be disbursed by the MOR (the project owner). The support from local
governments is manifested in the favorable policies to reduce or exempt various taxes.
4.1 Principles for Compensation
(1) Compensation for land acquisition and housing demolition will be paid in
accordance with "Land Administration Law", and "Housing Demolition Regulation"
issued by the state and the detailed implementation regulations issued by the localities
that are consistent with terms of this RAP, and the relevant regulations of the RAP.
(2) Replacement cost is the criterion whereby to determine whether the compensation
standard is reasonable
(3)Whether the affected population is ensured a recovery of its   former
living standard in the shortest possible time is the criterion to judge the compensation
standards in terms of sufficiency.

4.3 Calculation of Compensation Rate for Land Acquisition
1) On account of the ever-increasing difficulties with labour force resettlement, the
proportion of resettlement subsidy in this project has been raised to 60% in contrast
with that of land compensation, which is 40%.
2) That the compensation disbursed in this project is sufficient enough to ensure the
rehabilitation for the affected villages and groups can be illustrated with Guangzhou
and Puqi, where the compensation is either the highest or the lowest in this project.
3) The compensation for land acquisition in Guangzhou is 150000 yuan per mu, of
which the land compensation fee is 60000 yuan, equal to the annual output value of
vegetable plot 1800 yuan/mu x 33.3 times; the resettlement subsidy is 90000 yuan,
equal to the annual output value of vegetable plot 1800 yuan/mu x 50 times.
According to the land law of the state, the sum of the land compensation fee and
resettlement subsidy should not exceed 20 times of the annual average output value
of the past three years prior to land acquisition. However, in view of the great
difficulty in the land acquisition, the total sum of land compensation fee and
resettlement subsidy in Guangzhou has reached 83.3 times of the annual average
output value of the past three years prior to land acquisition, far in excess of the
maximum fixed in the state land law.
4) The compensation for land acquisition in Puqi is 15000 yuan per mu, of which the
land compensation fee is 6000 yuan, equal to the annual output value of vegetable
plot 1200 yuan/mu x 5 times; the resettlement subsidy is 9000 yuan, equal to the
annual output value of vegetable plot 1200 yuan/mu x 7.5 times, the total
compensation thus being 12 times of the annual output value of vegetable plot per
mu. The compensation has reached the standard stipulated in the land law of the
state, sufficient enough to secure the welfare of the affected villages and individuals
from being impaired.

4.4 Calculation of Compensation Rate for Demolition and
Relocation
1) The housing compensation standard shall be determined by referring to the housing
reconstruction price. The used material from the demolished housing shall not be
deducted from the compensation fee.
2) Illegally set-up housing shall be treated in the same way as other housing in respect
of compensation standard.
3) Compensation for housing demolition and relocation is sufficient enough for the
affected units and individuals to reconstruct their housing at the reconstruction price,
which can be illustrated with the cases of Guangzhou and Hengyang, where the cost
of housing construction is either the highest or the lowest in this project.
4) In Guangzhou, the compensation rate outside the railway sector is 1200 yuan per
square meters for concrete-brick structured housing and 800 yuan for brick-wood
structured housing; that within the railway sector is 700 yuan per square meters for
concrete-brick structured housing and 400 yuan for brick-wood structured one. By
calculation, the reconstruction prices per square meters of concrete-brick and brick-
wood housing in Guangzhou are respectively:
Concrete-brick structured: material cost (steel bars, cement, sand, aggregate, bricks,
etc.) + labuor cost + machinery cost + earth & stone work cost = 700 yuan;
Brick-wood structured: material cost (timber, cement, sand, aggregate, bricks, etc.)
+ labuor cost + machinery cost + earth & stone work cost = 400 yuan;
Obviously, the compensation standard outside the railway sector is higher than the
reconstruction price, which accounts for the difficulty of the demolition and
relocation in Guangzhou.
5) In Hengyang, the compensation is 500 yuan per square meters for concrete-brick
structured housing, and 250 yuan for brick-wood structured housing. By calculation,
the reconstruction prices per square meters of concrete-brick and brick-wood
55



housing in Hengyang are respectively:
Concrete-brick structured: material cost (steel bars, cement, sand, aggregate bricks,
etc.) + labuor cost + machinery cost + earth & stone work cost = 500 yuan;
Brick-wood structured: material cost (timber, cement, sand, aggregate, bricks, etc.)
+ labuor cost + machinery cost + earth & stone work cost = 250 yuan;
By calculation, the compensation rate is sufficient enough for the affected units and
individuals to reconstruct housing at the reconstruction price.
4.5 Calculation of Compensation for Fruit Trees
Compensation with fruit trees is little bit more complicated compared with other
aboveground attachment. Along with the development of economy, the market
compensation for fruit trees has now doubled the standard prescribed by the
government. See the table of the categories, amount and unit prices of compensation for
the detail.

5 Reseftlement and
Rehabilitation Plans
5.1 Goals of Resettlement
(1) The displaced population should be given the chance of benefiting from project
development;
(2) The displaced population will be able to raise, with the help from the govermment,
their income standards, or at least restore their former income standards;
(3) The resettlement of agricultural population should depend on land as much as
possible in order to minimize resettlement risk;
(4) In the transference of jobs whenever necessary, the educational background of the
affected persons should be fully taken into account and consideration should be
given to the willingness of the affected persons;
(5) The resettlement plan should be made jointly with the villager representatives
through consultation and mass participation should be encouraged throughout the
whole process of resettlement;
(6) Before the actual implementation of land acquisition and displacement, the
affected population should get their due compensation for all their loss at the
standards stipulated in the RAP;
5.2 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Rural PAPs
S2.1 Resettlement Plan for Rural PAPs in Land Acquisition
(l)The fact that the land to be acquired along the railway line is small in amount and
segregated in distribution will produce comparatively slight impact on the per capita
land possession in the affected villages. On the other hand, the towns along the
railway line have over I mu of land possession per labour. Internal land reallocation
70



method, therefore, can be adopted in the affected villages along the line. Land
compensation fee will be utilized convergently in the transformation of the low- and
mediocre- yielding field, in the introduction of proved scientific and technological
achievements in order to raise the output value, which will be realized mainly in:
-improvement of irrigation facilities;
- amelioration of the soil, leveling of the fields and more application of fertilizer;
- more fumding in economic plants which are expected to bring more profit, for
example, development of hothouses to plant vegetables;
- development of such sideline production as the breeding of pigs, cattle, chicken
and ducks;
-  sensible choice of 2 or 3 industries with potential to alter the rural production
setup.
(2) Very little land will be acquired from the counties of Guangdong Province along the
line, which will result in little impact, except for Qingyuan City where the amount of
land to be acquired is comparatively large, but the cultivated land to be acquired
takes only a small portion, of which 1000 mu is bushy and hilly land, all non-
cultivated with no economic plants. The Lianlian town in Qingyuan city has 0.92 mu
of land possession per labour before the land acquisition and 0.9 mu after the land
acquisition, so there will be little impact with the land acquisition.
(3)The land to be acquired for the construction of a new railway station in Puqi, Hubei
Province, several score mu in area, was specifically approved by the MOR at the
request of Puqi Municipal Govemnment. The present Puqi Station, closely adjoined
by a cement factory and thus severely suffering from pollution, is left with little
space to expand. For this reason, express trains seldom stop here. Puqi Govemment,
feeling an urgent need to boost the local economy, offers to acquire land with its
own fund to build a new Chibi Station (taking advantage of the renowned historical
site of Chibi (inflamed cliff) originating in the Three Kingdoms time) where all the
passing express btans are expected to halt The present station will then fimction as
a freight station.
71



The affected population is pleased with the new station project for the reason that
the development of a new urban district and a Three Kingdoms tourist resort
centering on the new station will surely provide the affected population with more
openings of jobs and enable them to increase their income. In addition, business
floorage will be reserved in the new station square for the affected villages and
production groups. Puqi Government will also invest 50 million November 15,
1998yuan RMB to build such infrastructures as water and power supply, roads,
hospital and green belt auxiliary to the station. The affected population will be the
first to benefit from such construction which is bound to greatly augment the value
of the land around the station. Moreover, the present per capita land possession in
Puqi is 1.3 mu (that of Hubei Province being 0.86 mu). Even after the land
acquisition, the land possession per capita will still be over one mu in the affected
villages, which means the production resettlement can be done by internal land
reallocation.
The compensation rate for the land acquisition by Puqi Government is 1S thousand
yuan per mu for the land along the line, the stipulated standard for the project. Puqi
Government has by now disburse 50% of the total fund to the municipal land
administration bureau, with the rest part to be punctually paid once the contract
between the land bureau and the affected population is signed. The construction of
the new station will not be started until then.
(4) In subuiban rural areas, the villagers have already been left with comparatively small
land quantity. The project, again, will acquire a considerable amount of land from
Guangzhou, Changsha and Wuhan, which will certay make the problen more
acute. Internal land reallocation, therefore, is not applicable in this case. The local
governments, however, have found out solutions to this problem, each in a different
way:
-In Wuhan, the measure 'acquire ten to return one" is adopted in consideration
that the cultivated land in the suburbs is decreasing and it is impossible to prevent
the living standards of the affected population from descending by depending on
72



agriculture only. As a matter of fact, over 80% of the income of the suburban
villagers is no longer from agriculture. For the sake of affected population, the
government has decided to acquire ten percent more land in the land acquisition to
return it to the villagers. As the ownership of the returned land has changed (from
collective-owned to state-owned), it now can be used by the affected villages to
develop business (as collective-owned before, it could only be used for agricultural
purpose). The measure "acquire ten to return one" will be adopted in Chasha and
Guangzhou.
-In Changsha, the govenmuent has made a policy of providing the displaced
population with large-sized flats. After the land acquisition, a few production groups
will be virtually left with no cultivated land. In view of this situation, a unique
resettlement plan has been contrived in Changsha, according to which, housing
ground site will be chosen in prosperous urban zones to build four-storied housing
with government provided infrastructure (including facilities for water and electric
power and road and so on) and with each unit for only two households. The average
housing area for each family is about 280 m2; the household live on one floor with
the other three floors about 210 m2 in total area to be rent out If affected people is
in lack of funds, they can get loan from banks at low interests. It has turned out that
the income from the rent is over twice that from farming Again, the housing is
looked after largely by old or female folks of the household with the able-bodied
family members seeking jobs elsewhere to obtain more income.
Such large-sized flat providing method has also been adopted somewhere in
Guangzhou and Wuhan.
(5) According to the relevant regulations of the state, if the land possession per capita is
below 0.1 mu after land acquisition, the rural residential registration of the affected
villagers may be converted to non-rural one. The affected villagers in the suburbs of
Guangzhou, Changsha and Wuhan are by and large eligible for such conversion. But
according to investigation and questionnaires, the affected population basically tend
to abandon such 'chancee and keep their rural registration, probably for the
following reasons:
73



A. Suburban rural collective economy is usually well developed and the village and
production group have fairly good economic means. If the affected villagers
remain their rusal registration, they can get a yearly bonus about 5000 to 10000
yuan from the collective. Otherwise, they can not have such bonus. Take
Hejiatun Village for example. It has village enterprises as many as 36 with an
annual output value last year 7 hundred million yuan. In other words, each
labourer had a bonus of ten thousand yuan. Any one above 50 of age there is
counted as senile and as such is eligible for a monthly pension of 120 yuan. Same
is the case with Huoju Village, Furong District of Changsha and Jianggao Town
of Guangzhou.
B. Urban enterprises, with limited oapacity of absorbing rural labourers, will pay
relatively low salary and are unable to guarantee sure jobs. Besides, the
requirements are strict, which appears disagreeable to the undisciplined villagers.
C. On the. other hand, suburban villagers enjoy numerous chances of earning money,
such as seeking jobs elsewhere, undertaking transportation or small business,
renting out their housing and working in township enterprises.
(6) Against the general economic background that China is transferring from planned
economy to market-oriented one, self-employment is the commonest and the most
realistic choice. Those who seek jobs by themselves may get a lump-sum
compensation, respectively, 60000 yuan per capita in Guangzhou, 25000 yuan in
Changsha and Wuhan, and 13000 yuan in Hengyang and Zhuzhou. Together with
income from other means, the living standards of the affected population can be
secured against a drop. One thing to note is that all the other job seekers do not like
to get the compensation for the reason that if they keep the compensation for
themselves, they will be seen as separated from the village collective and
accordingly they will no longer have their share in the village bonus and other
village welfare. The village collective will use land compensation fee and the
resettlement compensation to start village industries whereby the villagers can have
their bonus share. In this way, moreover, the surplus rural labourers will have more
74



job openings and the villagers will have another steady source of income.
7) An investigation on the suburban villagers of Guangzhou, Changsha and Wuhan
shows that long before the project, the affected villagers of the three cities no longer
relied on agriculture to earn their living. Such methods as " acquire ten to return one"
and " large-size flat" and the comparatively high compensation standard will accelerate
their urbanization.
A. The population of 4940 from 1109 households in Guangzhou affected in land
acquisition will be resettled in 4 different ways: first, they can renounce their cash
compensation of self-employment and thus remain their membership of the village
collective. In fact, they have already found jobs for themselves, such as undertaking
small business or transportation. About 45% of the affected people will be resettled
in this way. Second, they can seek jobs in township or village enterprises. Some
people had already been working in such enterprises before the implementation of
the project. The land compensation fee and resettlement subsidy will be used
collectively to ameliorate and expand the original township enterprises. About 25%
of the affected people will be resettled in this way. Thirdly, they can make use of the
land returned by means of "acquire ten to return one" to develop commercial
business, set up farm product markets or office buildings. About 18% of the
population will be resettled in this way. Finally, they can rent out part of their large-
sized flats to immigrant workers. About 12% of the affected will be resettled in this
way.
B. The population of 1533 from 465 households in Changsha affected in land
acquisition will be resettled in 3 different ways: First, they can make use of the land
returned by means of "acquire ten to return one" to develop commercial business.
Take Gaoqiao Township. They have successfully resettled over 300 labourers by
75



using the 56 mu of returned land to set up large warehouse and develop
transportation business. About 48% of the affected population will be resettled in
this way. Second, they can rent out part of their large-sized flats. In addition, the
young and able-bodied labourers of the households can go out and find jobs
elsewhere. About 35% of the affected population will be resettled in this way.
Thirdly, they can start new township and village enterprises or resettle labourers in
the existing township enterprises. About 17% of the affected population will be
resettled in this way.
C. The affected population of 5026 from 1169 households in Wuhan will be resettled in
four different ways: First, they can be resettled in the existing township enterprises.
Take Hejiatun Village of Jianghan District. They have resettled nearly 200 labourers
in the present 36 village enterprises. The land compensation fee and resettlement
subsidy can be used collectively to renovate and develop the current enterprises.
About 30 % of the affected population will be resettled in this way. Second, they can
make use of the returned land from "acquire ten to return one" to develop
commercial business and other secondary and tertialy industries. Take Binghu
Village of Hongshan District. They make full use of the advantageous location of
the returned land to start hotels and catering trade and have resettled a large number
of labourers. About 38 % of the affected population will be resettled in this way.
Thirdly, they rent out their large-size flat and have their able-bodied household folks
seek jobs elsewhere. About 17% of the affected population will be resettled in this
way. Finally, they renounce their cash compensation for self-employment and
reserve their collective membership. In fact, they have found jobs for themselves
such as undertaking small business or transportation. About 9% of the affected
population will be resettled in this way.

(8) In consideration of the arduousness of the land acquisition in Guangzhou, Changsha
and Wuhan, the governments of the three provinces involved offer to add 10000
yuan per mu to the compensation for the land acquisition in the three cities with the
aim to give support to railway construction and boost the local economy. This
additional sum will be on local finances.
(9) Since the implementation of the project, the affected rural population has got access
to many means to retrieve their income by developing agriculture and non-
agricultural production. By a joint calculation with the relevant departments of local
governments, it is estimated that the average annual income per capita of the
affected population, either along the line or of the suburbs of the three cities, can
increase by 10% to 14%, which shows the living standards and income index of the
affected population are far from being deteriorated by the project.
For the impact with the land acquisition, please see the cultivated land of the towns
affected by the Wu-Guang capacity expansion project.
5.2.2 Resettlement Plan for Displaced Population in Housing Demolition
(1)In the villages and production groups along the line where land acquisition and
housing demolition have resulted in slight impact on the local production and
livelihood, the affected villagers will still stay in their villages and groups. The
village commission will allot housing ground site for the affected villagers to set up
new housing and demolish the old one on their own.
(2) Compensation standards and principle for the displaced households along the line:
-The housing compensation standard shall be determined by referring to its
reconstruction price. The used materials tom from the old housing belong to the
household and such materials shall not be deducted from the compensation.

-The housing compensation shall be paid by installment with 70% delivered
before the construction of the new housing and the remaining 30% delivered after.
In rural areas, new housing shall be set up before the old one is torn down. If for
some special reason the old housing has to be demolished before the new one is set
up, the railway side shall pay transition fee according to the standard, namely, 3
yuan per square meter each month.
- The railway shall pay the cost for removal according to the standard, namely,
350 yuan per lorry shift
- Such public infrastructures as roads, water and power supply shall be designed
and financed by the local government and the construction shall be completed before
the displaced population move into the new housing.
- In locating housing ground site, priority should be given to such place with stable
geological structure, convenient for road construction and water and power supply.
At the same time, it should be as close to the original housing site of the displaced
population as possible in order to facilitate their production and life.
-  The displaced population should be notified of the date of removal at least two
months in advance in order that they can have sufficient time to set up new housing.
(3)The village commission will take effective measures ( for example seeldng labours,
choosing housing ground for housing reconstruction, buying materials and so on) to
help the difficult families of the old, weak, ailing and disabled and families without
male labourers, by consulting their opinions, to build new housing and move in. The
poor households will get help in funds to ensure basic resetflement housing
(4) In the suburbs of large cities as Changsha, Guangzhou and Wuhan, as little land is
left (in some places, even the new housing ground site is hard to find), the new
housing has to be built congregately in urban district in order to provide the
displaced population with large-sized flats, as is the case in Changsha. For
fiagmentary displacement, the railway construction unit shall buy commodity
housing in urban district for the households, as is the case in Guangzhou. Another
alterative is to locate the new housing ground just in the current living place of the
displaced population for them to set up new housing on their own, as is the case in
Wuhan. Some displaced residents own two or more flats; the remaining housing can
82



still suffice them even one of their flats is torn down. In such case, compensation
can be disbursed in one lump sum to them at their request.
(5) Compensation standards and principle for the displaced households in the suburbs of
the big cities:
-The housing compensation standard shall be determined by referring to its
reconstruction price. The used materials torn from the old housing belong to the
household and such materials shall not be deducted from the compensation.
-- The housing compensation shall be paid by installment with 70% delivered
before the construction of the new housing and the remaining 30% delivered after.
But it shall be paid in one lump sum to those households buying commodity
housing.
- For those households who demolish their old housing and build the new one on
their own, new housing shall be set up before the old one is torn down. If for some
special reason the old housing has to be demolished before the new one is set up, the
railway side shall pay transition fee according to the standard, namely, 4.5 yuan per
square meter each month.
- The railway shall pay the cost for removal according to the standard, namely,
460 yuan per lorry shift
-  Such public infastuctures as roads, water and power supply shall be designed
and financed by the local government and the construction shall be completed before
the displaced population move into the new housing. The affected people can not
pay for these infiasucture fees.
-  In locating housing ground site, priority should be given to such place with
stable geological structure, convenient for road construction and water and power
supply. At the same time, it should be as close to the original housing site of the
displaced population as possible in order to facilitate their production and life.
- The displaced population should be notified of the date of removal at least two
months in advance in order that they can have sufficient time to set up new housings.
(6) The village commission will take effective measures to help the vulnerable families,
by fully consulting their opinions, to build new housing and move in. Special
RI



concern shall be given to those vulnerable families buying commodity housing or
resettled in congregately built housing flats. For instance, the old, ailing and
disabled households will be arranged under 4th floor. The poverty-stricken families,
if possible, will be arranged on the ground floor so that they may take the
advantage to open small shops to earn their living. The poor households will get
help in funds to ensure basic resettlement housings.
5.3 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Urban Displaced
Population
5.3.1 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Urban Displaced Population
(1) The impact of Wu-Guang Project on urban residents is found convergently in
Wuhan only. Exactly, the housing of 5 households and the temporary sheds
unlawfilly built by 8 immigrant households will be demolished. Still a temporarily
built warehouse of a residential commission will also be tom down.
(2) For the 5 urban households, the measure of purchasing commodity housing in the
nearest place possible will be adopted. Because though the size of the commodity
housing is smaller, the environment and residential quality will be by far improved.
Their original housing, close to the railway, has no lavatory, in an environment foul
and noisy. They are happy to buy commodity housing
(3) For the unlawfully built sheds, compensation will be paid at 150 yuan per square
meter according to the relevant standard of Wuhan City. In addition, the government
will find housing for them to rent, with the compensation they are given.
(4) The temporarily built warehouse is not to be rebuilt elsewhere once it is tom down.
Compensation will be paid at 150 yuan per square meter, according to the
regulations.
(5) Housing resettlement principle for urban residents:
84



- Consultation with the displaced population on equal standing;
- Depreciation of the demolished housing shall not be considered in the
reconstruction price;
-If the former average floorage per capita of the displaced residents is lower than
the stipulated lowest standard for urban residents, the deficiency shall be made up in
resettlement without charging fee for the made up area;
-The resettlement site shall be decided on by the government. Two resettlement
sites may be provided for the residents to choose, whenever conditions permit;
- The displaced residents shall move into the resettlement housing directly
without transitional period. Whenever transition is absolutely necessary,
compensation shall be paid at 4.5 yuan per square meter;
- Removal fee shall be paid by the railway construction unit at 450 yuan per lorTy
shift;
- Publicize the inforrmation and make announcement 60 days in advance so that
the affected population will have enough time to move out.
(6) Process for the housing demolition & relocation and resettlement:
-The govenmmental institutions responsible of resettlement shall send personnel
to conduct on-the-spot investigation and checking about the affected households on
the household number, the ownership, structure, area and other attachment of the
housing;
-Publicize the resettlement plan, the policy for housing demolition & relocation,
the resettlement procedure, the resettlement compensation, the scope of demolition
and the time limit for removal, so as to have the mass participate in and supervise;
-The govermmental institutions responsible of resettlement and the displaced
households shall sign agreement on compensation standard, compensation sum, the
size and the location of resettlement housing, etc.;
- After the displaced households have made an on-the-spot survey, an additional
agreement shall be signed between the department responsible and the households
on such more detailed issues as the story, the disposition and the room number of
the resettlement housing;
- The agreements on resettlement shall be signed and sealed by both parties and
notarized by the notary office;
85



- The displaced population moves into the new housing.
5.3.2 Resettlement Plans for Enterprises and Shops
(1) Resettlement plan for enterprises
A Wu-Guang Project involves 12 enterprises, all small-sized (means there are less 50
workers), of which the metal products factory in Guangzhou has stopped its
production; Ruyi Plastic Factory has long been in deficit. The several chicken
ranches involved in Guangzhou have only the coops demolished. The police
substation in Jianggao Town has a car parking lot and several simple-structured
sheds demolished. The other 4 enterprises (small sized, less 50 workers)
respectively in Yingde City of Guangdong Province, Changsha and Hengyang cities
of Human Province are getting along with their regular production. The relocation
of enterprises will not result in unemployment for their stuff members.
B. The compensation standard for the enterpnses shall be made according to the
reconstruction price; no depreciation will be taken into account.
C. Compensation shall be paid by installment with 70% delivered before the
construction of the new housing and the remaining 30% delivered after.
D. The demolition and relocation of enterprises shall be done only after the new
housing has been set up. If for some special reason demolition has to go before the
constuction of new housing, the railway construction unit shall pay, according to
the compensation standard, a sum of compensation for the cessation of production
or business, which will ;cover the monthly salary of all the employees and an
additional 15% as managerial fee and another 15% as socially collected insurance
premium. This compensation, to be paid by month, is 1000 yuan per month for
each person in Guangzhou, and 600 yuan in Changsha and Yingde.
E. The railway construction unit shall pay for the enterprise removal, at 460 yuan per
lorry shift in Guangzhou and Changsha, 350 yuan in Yingde and Hengyang. A lorry
shift means a four-ton lorry running for the whole day. The railway construction
unit shall pay for whatever lorry shifts needed for the enterprise removal.
F. The new site for the enterprise should be as close to the old one as possible, in
order to keep the existing market environment of the enterprise intact If the
86



enterprise asks for a different relocation, it could be allowed if conditions permit.
G. If the housing of the enterprise has been fitted up, and the fit-up standard is
confirmedly higher than that of housing compensation, the gap can be compensated
by the railway construction unit.
HF The enterprise shall be informed of the removal 60 days in advance so that it will
have enough time to get prepared and avoid unnecessary loss.
(2) Resettlement plan for shops
A. Wu-Guang Project involves 23 shops in the relevant three provinces, 16 in
Guangzhou, 2 in Yingde and 5 in Changsha. The involved shops in Guangzhou and
Yingde are small (with less 10 korkers), and their business is not good; the profit is
mediocre. The 5 shops in Changsha, however, are comparatively large-sized (with
less 100 workers), with fairly good profit. Though there are far more salesclerks in
these 5 shops, the relocation will not result in unemployment for them.
B. The resettlement measures taken by Guangzhou and Changsha governments are: to
provide stalls in the nearby markets for the PAPs . The PAPs can rend these stalls
by there compensation fees. If the affected persons are not successful in their
business and want to try other trades, the government will, in addition to the
payment of compensation, introduce new means of life to them.
C. In Yingde, the govenmment will build new housing for the 2 small shops nearby to
ensure that they could continue their business in their former market environment
D. The compensation standard for the shops shall be made according to the
reconstruction price; no depreciation will be taken into account
E. Compensation shall be paid by installment with 70%  delivered before the
construction of the new housing or removal and the remaining 30% delivered after.
F. The demolition and relocation of shops shall be done only after the new housing
has been set up. If for some special reason demolition has to go before the
construction of new housing, the railway construction unit shall pay, according to
the compensation standard, a sum of compensation for the cessation of production
or business, which will cover the monthly salary of all the employees and an
additional 15% as managerial fee and another 15% as socially collected insuance
premium. This compensation, to be paid by month, is 1000 yuan per month for
87



each person in Guangzhou, and 600 yuan in Changsha and Yingde.
G. The railway construction unit shall pay for the shop removal, at 460 yuan per lorry
shift in Guangzhou and Changsha, 350 yuan in Yingde. The railway construction
unit shall pay for whatever lorry shifts needed for the shop removal.
H. If the housing of the shop has been fitted up, and the fit-up standard is confirmedly
higher than that of housing compensation, the gap can be compensated by the
railway construction unit.
I. The shop shall be informed of the removal 60 days in advance in order to get
prepared.
5.4 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Railway Internal
Demolition
5.4.1 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Railway Clerks
(1) The impact of Wu-Guang Project on the residential housing of railway clerks
involves 783 persons of 256 households, including 595 persons from 198
households in Furong District of Changsha, 165 persons from 53 households in
Xianning City and only 23 persons from 5 households in Guangzhou.
(2) The affected railway clerks, like other affected residents outside the railway sector,
should also be compensated for their demolished housing, at the compensation
standards shown as follows: 700 yuan/m2 for brick-&-concrete housing; 400
yuan/m2 for brick-&-wood housing and 150 yuan/m2 for simple-structured housing.
As for the tansition fee and removal fee, they should be the same as those outside
the railway sector.
(3) The affected railway clerk shall be informed of the removal 60 days in advance in
order to have enough time to get prepared.
(4) As there are very few clerks affected in Guangzhou, GRCC will disburse the
compensation to the individuals for them to buy commodity housing downtown.
88



(5) As there are quite a number of affected households in Changsha, GRCC has decided
to buy commodity housing convergently near Changsha Railway Station for them,
the average size for each household being 65 m2. If the original housing is less than
the average 65 m2, the gap will be made up free of charge; if the household want to
buy the area exceeding 65 m2, they will have to pay for the exceeding part on their
own. The affected 198 households in Changsha have been living in the housing
transformed from workshop and office housing for a long time, without lavatory or
even kitchen, in poor living condition. They are happy to have such opportunity to
move into commodity housing.
(6) ZRB will set up new dormitory building on railway-owned land for the 53
households in Xianning, Hubei Province. The living environment and quality of the
53 households will then be greatly improved. The construction of new housing will
absolutely go before old housing demolition.
(7) In Guangzhou, the project impact also involves the unlawfully set structure on the
railway by three railway households, 400 m2 in size, dwelt by 11 persons. The
compensation paid by GRCC according to the standard is 200 yuan per square meter,
and the removal fee 460 yuan per lorry shift The three households have long been
living in shabby sheds and afflicted by roaring trains. And now they could use their
compensation of several ten thousand yuan, together with their own money, to buy
commodity housing in the urban district of Guangzhou.
5.4.2 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Railway Enterprises and Shops
(1) Wu-Guang Project involves 28 railway enterprises; 7 in Guangzhou, 10 in Changsha,
5 in Wuhan, 1 in Shaoguan, 3 in Puqi and 2 in Xianning. Railway enterprises enjoy
the same relocation policy as the non-railway enterprises. Each relevant railway
bureau shall conduct old housing demolition and new housing construction on
railway-owned land, strictly following the stipulation of construction prior to
demolition. The railway enterprise removal will not give rise to transition problem,
nor cessation of production and business, much less unemployment even to one
89



individual of the enterprises.
(2) The railway shops involved are mainly found around Changsha Railway Station.
The 6 involved shops are owned by the Passenger Service Company of Changsha
R- 'way Station, initiated to provide jobs for the children of the railway clerks. In
o;       -.re jobs for those children, Changsha Railway Bureau has decided to
find nev uusiness zone near the station on railway-owned land for them. The old
shops will not be demolished until the new ones have been set up. Therefore, the
removal will not -sult in a cessation of business and unemployrn -It The
compensation tc      -s will be done in the same way as the shop. outside
railway sector.

6 Organizational Institutions
The organizational institutions for the expansion engineering of Wu-Guang rail section,
a complex system, involve not only 20 odd cities and counties in Guangdong, Hunan
and Hubei, but the coordination between the MOR and local governments, between the
two authorized agents of the MOR, GRCC and ZRB. Many executive institutions and
relevant departments from several administrative levels and subsystems will take part in
the designing, preparation and undertaking of the project.
631 Institutional Establishments
(1) A successful execution of the resettlement for the Capacity-Expansion Project by
and large depends on a forceful network of migration executive institutions. In view
of the difficulties in the coordination between provinces crosswise and those between
the MOR and the provinces vertically, a network of resettlement institutions is
extremely necessary for accomplishing planning, organizing, coordinating and
supervising resettlement action in order to reach the desired goal.
The migration institutional network for the Capacity-Expansion engineering is
composed of two systems, one being the land acquisition and resettlement organizations
of the railway construction units, as the project owner, the other being the land
acquisition and resettlement organizations of local govemments of all levels, as the
contractor.

6.2 Responsibility of the Institutions
6.2.1 Responsibility of All the Resettlement Institutions of the MOR
(1) Land Acquisition & Resettlement Working Group of the MOR.
The Land Acquisition & Resettlement Working Group of the MOR, made up of the
persons responsible from the Foreign Capital Introduction & Utilization Office of the
MOR, is the supreme power institution responsible of the land acquisition and the
resettlement of displaced population in the project functioning in the capacity of the
project owner.  Its main responsibility is to strengthen the leadership for key
engineering projects and ensure a smooth progress of the land acquisition, housing
demolition & relocation and resettlement for the Capacity Expansion Project. It is
responsible of coordinating GRCC and ZRB. Its staff members, each specialized in
one sector of job, include the experienced specialists in migration work from Foreign
Capital Introduction and Utilization Office and professionally specialized technicians
and clerks with rich experience behind from GRCC and ZRB.
(2) Personnel of the MOR Specifically Engaged in Land Acquisition and Housing
Demolition
In order to strengthen migration resettlement, a staff member is appointed in the
Foreign Capital Introduction & Utilization of the MOR to be specifically engaged in
land acquisition and housing demolition, who has the following responsibilities:
A. Organizing, during the feasibility research stage of the project, the relevant units to
work out the framework for resettlement plan as the basis for project appraisal;
organizing, 6 months prior to the construction commencement of the project, the
relevant units to compile and complete the resettlement action plan (RAP);
B. Examining regularly, in accordance with the RAP, the execution of the resettlement
of the project on the part of the local govemments and railway departments;
C. Keeping close supervision of the progress of resettlement work, conducting
93



marnagerial work through computation and regularly renewing and enriching data,
and providing relevant data to external monitoring institute;
D. Investigating and gathering information irregularly on the spot of land acquisition
and housing demolition; punctually reporting the problems discovered to either the
local government and the relevant organs of the MOR in order to have the problems
solved promptly;
E. Accompanying the officials from the World Bank to the site of land acquisition and
housing demolition to get to know the progress; managing consultation and
subsequent procedures of negotiation;
Managing the compiling and examination of reports concerning resettlement to be
submitted to the World Bank.
(3) GRCC and ZRB
These are the leading bodies made up of the leaders of GRCC and ZRB, and the heads
of the capital construction departments of GRCC and ZRB, with the main responsibility
of strengthened leadership over the project implementation within their jurisdiction,
coordination the resettlement institutions under their leadership, supervising and
examining the work of the subordinate engineering headquarters, ensuring a smooth
progress of land acquisition and resettlement within their jurisdiction.
(4) Engineering Headquarters of GRCC, Engineering Headquarters of ZRB
Both headquarters, as the agencies of GRCC and ZRB respectively, are in full charge of
handling attains in land acquisition and resettlement within each administrative scope,
including the application to the departments concemed for the design license for land
utilization and the construction license for land utilization, the entrusting of the
investigation institution with measuring of the scope and degree of project impact, the
supervision and coordination in the drawing-up of RAPs, the signing of agreements and
contracts with local land bureaus, township governments and villagers, the compiling of
the work progress schedule, the provision of resettlement budget, the management of
compensation disbursement, the supervision of the execution of resettlement and the
94



handling of troubles rising from execution, the close connection with local governments,
the submission of intemal monitoring reports to the Bank, the examining of
independent mentoring & evaluation reports and the handling of grievance appeals.
(5) Land Acquisition & Resettlement Section of the Engineering Headquarters.
As the subordinate standing institution of the headquarters, it is engaged in the actual
work of acquisition and resettlement and carries out all the tasks the headquarters
assigns to it. The section is usually made up of 10-14 members who work almost the
whole day at the construction site and keep a close contact with the local governments
especially governments at the gross-roots level and the affected population and the
construction units. It is a very important operational body in that the ideas and
opinions of the local governments and the affected population will be notified to the
headquarters by it and the mandates from the headquarters will be carried out by it.
(6) Staff in Charge of Land Acquisition & Resettlement in the Construction Units
Railway construction projects have their particularity in that there are usually quite a
number of construction units simultaneously undertaking construction of the same or
different type on the same line or various lines. Therefore, the headquarters requires
that each construction unit have at least one staff member specialized in acquisition and
resettlement. As a matter of fact, the head of each construction unit often sees to
acquisition and resettlement all by himself in spite that there is already an official in
charge of this matter.
6.2.2 Responsibility of the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Institutions of
Local Governments
(1) Provincial Leading Groups for Supporting Railway Construction
As the work conceming land acquisition and resettlement is of heavily policy-relying
nature, the provincial governments have attached great importance to it. A leading
body for aiding railway construction has been formed in each of the three provinces
95



involved headed by a vice-governor responsible of state key construction, with the
persons in command from the provincial planning commission, land bureau, design
office and some other relevant departments as the group members. For a better
coordination, the leading group has also invited the leader from the railway bureau to be
the second head or the deputy secretary-general of the group.
The main responsibility of the leading group of each province is to carry out the polices
by the state and the province about railway construction, supervise and spur the units
concemed accomplish railway construction projects in time and in good quality
according to the approved scale, standard, investment, engineering schedule and annual
plan, supervise and urge the local government of all levels to administer unitarily the
allocation and acquisition of land to be utilized for railway construction in conformity
with the relevant policies of the state, settle problems in acquisition and resettlement
through mediation, contemplate preferential policies and implementation methods for a
speedier railway construction and have them carried out, urge the departments
concerned to collect and allot fund indispensable to railway construction punctually and
supply the needed material and facilities to the railway construction, supervise the use
of resettlement compensation, mobilize the enthusiasm of every party to transact
resettlement successfully, tackle the major issues rising from the construction promptly
and ensure a smooth implementation of state key construction projects.
(2) The Provincial and Municipal Land Administration Bureaus
As institutions contracting the land acquisition, housing demolition & relocation and
resettlement for railway construction projects in the capacity of their govenmments, the
provincial and municipal land bureaus have very important function in that they have
the power to examine and ratify any requests for land acquisition and resettlement,
negotiate on behalf of local govemments with project owners about compensation
standards, formulate various policies and regulations for local resettlement and
supervise their execution, participate in the drawing-up of resettlement action plans,
sign contracts on acquisition, demolition and resettlement with project owners on behalf
of local governments, supervise the implementation of resettlement and the allocation
and utilization of acquisition and resettlement fund, coordinate project owners and local
96



governments and handle contingent disputes, problems and appeals.
(3) Land Acquisition Offices
This is a unique creation by Hunan province in the formation of institution different
from Guangdong and Hubei provinces. In Hunan, every prefecture and city has its
own land acquisition office subordinate to the corresponding land bureau. The land
acquisition and housing demolition contracted by the Provincial and Municipal Land
Bureaus shall be transacted by the land office acquisition which consists of the land
acquisition section, the housing demolition & relocation section, the resettlement
section, the reconstruction section, the policies and regulations section and the financial
affairs section. The offices have been playing an important role acting on the principle
of "centralized designing, land acquisition & housing demolition, administration and
developing".
(4) County Land Administration Bureaus
County land bureaus are the executive institutions of acquisition and resettlement.
They are responsible of acquisition and resettlement in the counties in accordance with
the overall arrangement by the province and the city. They prepare the resettlement
plans for the county and see. to their being carried out according to the population
statistics provided by the investigation department and the resettlement polices
formulated by the province and the city, direct and supervise the work of township
resettlement working groups, mediate between the state, the collective and the
individual, see to the proper use of compensation fees collected, submit regular reports
on acquisition and resettlement of the county to the province and the city, cooperate
closely with construction units to ensure a smooth implementation of land acquisition,
housing demolition and resettlement within the county and receive grievance appeals.
(5) Township Resettlement Working Groups
They are institutions headed by town administration chiefs with the township land
administration offices as their functioning body. Their main duties are to provide
97



assistance in project survey, organize mass participation, publicize resettlement policies,
conduct and keep account of the resettlement in the township, sign agreements on land
acquisition and housing demolition & relocation with the affected villagers, take charge
of the disbursement and utilization of compensation fees, cope with disputes and
difficulties rising from acquisition and resettlement and provide information concerning
resettlement to the higher authorities, the project owners and the external monitoring
institutions.
(6) Village Commission and Villager Representative Groups
They are the gross-roots institutions for acquisition and resettlement, whose main
responsibility is to choose location for population displacement, allot housing ground
site to displaced households, make intemal land reallocation, allocate compensation for
housing demolition and young crops, offer help to the poor households, mobilize the
villagers to production developing and report the opinions and proposals from the
villagers to the high authorities, the project owners and the external independent
monitoring institutions.
6.2.3 Other Institutions Concerned
(1) External Independent Monitoring Institution
The extemal independent monitoring institution of this project is the Research Institute
of Foreign Capital Utilization of Southwest Jiaotong University, whose major
responsibility is to assist the departments concemed in preparing resettlement action
plans, make on-the-spot investigation and provide M&E reports to the Bank, the project
owner and the local governments, run training classes for the personnel involved in
acquisition and resettlement from the local governments and the project owner unit and
offer technical consultation in data gathering and processing. Refer to Chapter 8 for
the detailed description about the external dependent monitoring institutions.
(2) Designing Institutions
98



The designing agency for this project is the 4h Surveying and Designing Institute of the
MOR, which, as the engineering designer for a project covering a 1082km-long rail line,
is also playing a remarkable role in land acquisition and resettlement with regard to, on
the one hand, their effort to optimize the design and minimize the land acquisition and
housing demolition and on the other, their punctualness in working out engineering
drawings and their promptness in altering the design in order that resettlement can come
into action as early as possible.
6.3 Coordination and Liaison between
the Institutions
The Capacity Expansion Project has involved many institutional systems, which
necessitates a good coordination and liaison, not only between the MOR and the
involved provinces, but also between the provinces, and between GRCC and ZRB. In
addition, what is equally important is the coordination between the headquarters and the
construction undertaking units, the local governments and the project owner on the one
hand and the supervision units and the designing units on the other, the project owner
and construction units on the one hand and the local governments on the other. The
land acquisition and resettlement for the project will be undoubtedly hampered if
there's no good coordination between institutions.
The MOR and Guangdong, Hunan and Hlubei provinces all attach great importance to
coordination. They often hold joint meetings, exchanging information, conversing one
another and sending the minutes to all institutions concerned. Some other measures
such as information announcing and revealing are also taken to strengthen the
coordination.
MOR and the provinces of Hunan, Hubei and Guangdong have entered into contracts
specifying implementation procedures (see appendices). Issues or problems arising
during implementation are to be resolved locally when feasible. Issues that cannot be
resolved at the local level will be referred to a working group, including a provincial
vice-governor and a MOR vice-minister, for resolution. No change in compensation
99



rates, or eligibility criteria for entitlements is to be made without prior approval of the
Bank.
6.4 Measures Taken to Enhance the Capabilities
of the Institutions
(1) More Able Personnel
Both the MOR and the local govermments have carefully chosen persons experienced in
acquisition and resettlement with managerial skills and data processing skills to form
the resettlement institutions of all levels.
(2) More Training
Beginning from the second half of 1998, the MOR will start training classes of
"Displaced Population Resettlement for the World Bank Loaned Projects" for the major
staff members engaged in acquisition and resettlement from the institutions of both
railway and local systems to learn and have a good grasp of China's resettlement
policies, the Bank's requirements and the successful cases of other administrative
sectors in China and learn to master the skills of collecting and processing data.
(3) To reinforce internal monitoring and evaluation and resolve problems wherever
they are found.
(4) To reinforce external independent monitoring and evaluation and set up the
early warning system.

7 Consultation, Mass Participation and
Grievance Appeal Conduits
7.1 Consultation
Consultation is constantly adopted during the implementation of land acquisition and
resettlement of the Capacity Expansion Project chiefly on the compensation standards
for land acquisition and housing demolition, the methods of housing reconstruction and
population resettlement.
Consultation is mostly between (1) the MOR and the provinces and cities; (2) the
railway construction headquarters and the prefectures, cities and counties; (3) the local
land administration departments and the land expropriated townships villages, and
production groups; and (4) township, villages and production groups and farm
household.
(1) The consultation between the MOR and provinces (Guangdong, Hunan and Hubei)
is mainly about the amount of land needed for the railway project, the time for using the
land and the compensation standards for land acquisition and housing demolition, -etc.
Such consultation was held many times during the project preparatory stage (between
1997 and 1998) before the commencement of Wu-Guang project engineering. In May
1998, Cai Qinghua, vice-minister of the MOR and his party went to the three provinces
to hold talks with the vice-governors who are responsible of state key construction
projects in their own provinces; they reached a consensus on acquisition and
resettlement and formed the minutes.
(2) The consultation between Zhuzhou Project Engineering Headquarters and Wuhan
Engineering Headquarters on the one hand and the prefectures, cities and counties
concerned along the line of Wuhan -Guangzhou section on the other is about the
amount of land to be acquired, housing and attachment to be demolished, the number of
102



population to be affected and the compensation standards for housing and attachment.
Such consultation was held many times before the land acquisition and will continue to
be held during the land acquisition, substantially between the Land Acquisition &
Resettlement Sections of the Headquarters and the County Land Bureaus, detailed even
on every sub-project and every piece of land. The land acquisition and housing
demolition & relocation for each subproject is accomplished not without quite a
number of or even several scores of rounds of consultation.
(3) The consultation between the local land administrative departments and the land
expropriated townships, villages and production groups is usually held before land
utilization and housing demolition. According to the Land Administration Law, any
other institutions (including project owners) have no right to undertake land acquisition
except county land administration bureau, the only authorized department to acquire
land from the rural areas on behalf of the state. However, even entitled to conduct
centralized land acquisition for state construction, the county land administration
departments will have to consult with land expropriated townships, villages and groups,
mainly about the compensation standards (for land, housing, attachment and population
resettlement) and resettlement plans (for housing reconstruction, conversion of
residential registration, employment, self-employment, etc.). The leaders of townships,
villages and groups will be at the consultation.
(4) The consultation between townships, villages and groups on the one hand and
village households on the other (or between the demolisher and the demolished in cities)
is mainly about the distribution and utilization of compensation fees, the measures for
housing reconstruction, worker taking-in and land relocation. The affected households
will express their reasons for compensation and demands for compensation whatever at
the consultation. Every household will eventually sign agreements on land acquisition,
compensation and resettlement with the township, the village and the group. Such
consultation is chiefly attended by household heads and, in some consultation, by
villager representatives.
103



7.2 Meetings on Displaced Population
During the negotiation on land acquisition and housing demolition, two kinds of
meetings will be held in each village or group on population to be displaced:
(l)meetings of village representatives and (2) all the villagers.
(1) Meetings of village representatives are presided over by the county land bureau or
the township government. The purpose is to get across the significance of the project,
the scope and site of land acquisition, the time for acquisition, the relevant laws,
policies and regulations. The meetings are usually called at the same time as the
consultation and negotiation before the land acquisition for a certain subproject.
(2) Meetings for all villagers are called by the village commission, attended by all the
villagers or the household heads with the purpose of expounding the relevant lans,
policies and regulations, informing the villagers of the scope and amount of land to be
acquired, the compensation standards, the measures for housing reconstruction and
production resettlement. The meetings are usually held during the implementation or
land acquisition and the time limit for signing agreement.
In addition to the above two forms of meeting, the railway construction unit and the
resettlement institution will put up posters in residential quarters before they make a
decision with the aim to consult the opinions of the affected population and ask for their
supervision and examination. This is especially true with compensation standards which
must be made known in the affected area in notice.
7.3 Mass Participation
Mass participation will take place alongside (1) during the preparatory stage of the
project and (2) during the implementation of the land acquisition for the project,
involving (1) consultation; (2) meetings on population displacement; (3) investigation
on property loss and socioeconomic survey; (4) discussing about compensation standard;
(5) choice of housing reconstruction site; (6) setting up new housing by the villagers
104



themselves; and (7) seeking job by oneself
(1) During the preparatory state of the project, that is from 1997 to 1998, mass
participation was chiefly concerned with socioeconomic survey, investigation on
property loss, consultation meetings and the publicizing of land acquisition affairs.
Consultation meeting is about the discussion and conferring among institutions of all
sorts at all levels on the issues conceming land acquisition and compensation, with the
purpose of getting the villagers to know about the land acquisition for the project so that
they will be able to get prepared for that. Investigation on property loss and the
socioeconomic survey by the engineering design institution and the RAP compiling
institution entail the participation of the masses in the affected areas.
During the compiling of RAP, a typical investigation and a sample investigation were
made to the cities, prefectures, counties, townships, villages and households whose land
is going to be acquired, participated by households, village and group leaders, township
heads, the land administration departments, the planning departments and the statistical
departments at county level, and the relevant departnents of municipal and prefectural
level.
(2) During the implementation of the land acquisition for the project (1998-2000),
there will be an extensive mass participation on the part of the affected population in
the measuring and determining of property loss, the discussion about the compensation
standards, the signing of agreements on the compensation for households, the choice of
new housing ground site, the demolition of the old housing by the villagers themselves
in order to use the material, the construction of new housing by the villagers themselves
and self-employment. Mass participation, judging from above facts and measures, is
encouraged in China in order to arouse the masses' enthusiasm and achieve a more
desirable resettlement result.

7.4 Grievance Appealing Channel
During the actual implementation of the land acquisition and the resettlement of
displaced population, if the affected population have any problems, grievances and
discontent regarding land acquisition, housing demolition, compensation payment and
resettlement, they may appeal to either (1) the project owner, (2) the external
independent monitoring institution, (3) the township and the county land administration
department, (4) the county government or (5) legal action.
(1) Appealing to the Project Owner Unit
The project owner is the eventual user of the land acquired, and has the duty to resolve
problems rising from land acquisition, housing demolition and resettlement. The
project owner of this project is the MOR with Zhuzhou Headquarters and Wuhan
Headquarters functioning in its capacity during the project engineering, and ZRB and
GRCC executing the managerial duty after the project engineering is completed.
Therefore, appeals to the project owner may go to either of
A. the MOR;
B. GRCC and ZRB;
C. Zhuzhou Headquarter and Wuhan Headquarters of the Electrification Capacity
Expansion of Wuchang-Guangzhou Rail Line.
(2) Appealing to the External Monitoring Institution
The external monitoring institution conducts chasing-up investigation on the production
of affected villages several times in the year during the monitoring period, and evaluates
the resettlement consequences and submits its M&E reports to the project owner, the
local institutions conducting land acquisition and housing demolition and the World
Bank. The affected persons, therefore, may express their discontent and grievances to
the extemal monitoring institution, which is obligated to listen to and find out the
dissentient and grievances.
106



(3) Appealing to the Township and the County Land Administration Department
According to the administrative procedure of the local govemment, the discontent and
grievances rising from acquisition and resettlement should first be handled by the land
administration department. In case the land administration department is unable to
resolve the grievances, the apparel may turn to other conduits. These are the conduits
of the land administration departments the apparel may go:
A. the municipal land administration bureau;
B. the county land administration bureau; and
C. the township land administration bureau.
(4) Appealing to the County Govermment
If the discontent can not be resolved in the land administration department, it can be
appealed to the "correspondence and visitation department" of the local governments,
set up by various levels of government organs to handle letters and visits from the
masses.
The appealer may express his discontent orally or in written form to the correspondence
and visitation departments, which may coordinate departnents concemed to have the
matter resolved.  If again the discontent can not be resolved in this way, the
correspondence and visitation departments will report the matter to the leaders of the
local govermment
(5) Legal Action
If discontent and grievances can not be resolved through the above 4 conduits, the
appealer may resort to legal action by bringing the case to court
107



a Monitoring and Evaluation
8.1 Goals of Monitoring
Monitoring on resettlement refers to the collection and provision of data concerning the
resettlement activities and the resettlement consequences. Evaluation means the
analysis and appraisal of data gathered in monitoring by referring to the comparable
indexes (such as the plans, the former conditions before removal, and the conditions of
non-displaced population).
The World Bank has warned that every project is bound to be faced with a lot of
particular problems in its execution. Some of these problems are unforeseeable. The
purposes of monitoring and examining are, firstly, to ensure a punctual execution of the
plan as scheduled; secondly, to find out problems and have them resolved then and there;
and thirdly, to have the collected data fed back to the designing, executing and
managing work of the project.
The evaluation on displaced population resettlement is expected to examine and decide
whether the production and livelihood of displaced population are appropriately
resettled in sociological and anthropological perspectives. Monitoring and evaluation
are not the ends in themselves; the conclusions drawn from monitoring and evaluation
are expected to feed back to the execution and management of the project so that any
inappropriateness can be redressed promptly, or some alternation can be made to the
executive plan, or the existing problems can be solved.
After the loan to Wu-Guang Project enters into force, regular supervision will be
organized by the World Bank annually, with the relevant parties examining
implementation progress. If it appears that RAP terms themselves are inappropriate for
effective implementation, a resettlement mid-term review may be scheduled to allow
the relevant parties to devise new approaches or revise the RAP.
Resettlement monitoring falls into two kinds: internal and external monitoring.
108



Intemal monitoring is carried out by the population resettlement office with the purpose
of keeping the institutions of the resettlement network in good operation following the
schedule and the principles of RAP. A report of internal monitoring is submitted every
quarter of or half a year.
External independent monitoring is to be conducted by an independent social agency to
chasing-up investigation on the implementation of land acquisition, resettlement and
rehabilitation and evaluate the whole process from an impartial, comprehensive and
long-term point of view so as to secure the benefit of the displaced population. The
general task of extemal independent monitoring is to provide all sorts of information
and foresight, based on chasing-up investigation and data collection, to the project
resettlement office and the project administration institution in order that any problems
concerning population displacement and resettlement can be solved promptly. Two
reports on external monitoring will be submitted annually in the first two years; and
beginning from the third year, one report annually.
8.2 Internal Monitoring
The internal monitoring on this project is conducted by the Land Acquisition and
Housing Demolition Sections of Zhuzhou Engineering Headquarters and Wuhan
Engineering Headquarters.
The following are the steps of the procedure for internal monitoring:
(1) The Land Acquisition and Housing Demolition Offices design and establish
the information flow patterns and data bank systems;
(2) The Land Acquisition and Housing Demolition Offices store up investigation
data and the socioeconomic data of the affected area;
(3) During the project implementation, the Acquisition and Demolition Offices
copy down the relevant background information of individuals, households
and units from the city, county and township according to the prescribed
patterns;
(4) The Acquisition and Demolition Offices make periodic sampling on
109



townships and villages to check the copied data and progress.
Internal monitoring has its focus on:
(1)     the progress of land acquisition;
(2)     the progress of housing demolition;
(3)     the progress of enterprises relocation;
(4)     the measures conceming housing reconstruction;
(5)     the resettlement measures for surplus labourers;
(6)     the forms of mass participation;
(7)     the disbursement of compensation fees;
(8)      the choice and training of staff members for resettlement institutions
8.3 External Monitoring
The Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilization of SWJU has been invited to
undertake the external independent monitoring of this project. Southwest Jiaotong
University, one of the key universities in China, enjoys a high reputation both at home
and abroad. Its Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilization, a professional
research institute at the study of the resettlement of displaced population, has a staff
consisting of specialists and technical personnel in sociology, anthropology, managerial
science, economics, evaluation technology, information processing, system analysis, etc.
The institute has rich experience in monitoring population displacement and
resettlement and that under the Work Bank loaned projects. Listed in the following is
only part of the work it has done under either the Bank loaned projects or non-Bank
loaned projects:
(1) The monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement of displaced population in the 6t
World Bank financed Chinese railway projects;
(2) The monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement of displaced population in the
World Bank Financed Yunnan environmental protection projects;
(3) directing the drawing up of RAP for the World Bank financed Sichuan electricity
power transmission project;
110



(4) The making of the aid plan for the later stage of resettlement implementation for
Sichuan Tongjiezi Power Station.
The extemal monitoring of this project has the following four stages as its procedure:
(1) the preparatory stage, to decide on the target persons and scope of investigation and
draw up the outline and forms for the investigation;
(2) The investigation stage, to investigate on the target persons at all levels and gather
information and material;
(3) The information feedback stage, to feed the information collected in the
investigation back to the construction headquarters and the MOR and consult with
them to have the problems found out in the investigation resolved;
(4) the report drawing-up stage, to draw evaluation conclusions and work out M&E
reports, based on the sorting out and diagnosis of the collected data and material.
These are the norms for external independent M&E to go by:
(1) Operation Guide 4.30 of the World Bank's Operation Directive concerning
involuntary resettlement;
(2) Relevant polices and legal corrosions regarding acquisition and resettlement of
both the state and localities;
(3)the action plan of acquisition and resettlement for this project.
(4) The security of a better or at least the maintenance of the former income and living
standards for the displaced population.
The investigation methods of the external M&E of this project involve sample
investigation, typical case investigation, focus investigation, group interviews,
interviews with important persons in the know, close-up interviews, observing and
learning, looking up literature documents, information checking in data bank, etc.
Extemal M&E has its main interest in the consequences of resettlement, the economic
income and the living standards of the displaced population. The following are the
main aspects for the external M&E of this project:
111



(1) analysis of the impacts resulting from the land acquisition and housing demolition;
(2) appraisal of the compensation standards;
(3) supervision over the allocation and utilization of compensation fees, including
collective land compensation;
(4) monitoring on the housing resettlement of the displaced population;
(5) monitoring on the production;
(6) monitoring on enterprises relocation;
(7) monitoring on the living standards of the displaced population;
(8) monitoring on the community rehabilitation;
(9) monitoring on the grievance appealing of the displaced population;
(10) monitoring on the operational efficiency of the resettlement network.
8.4 Report Submission
Monitoring reports for this project fall into reports of the implementation progress of
resettlement (intemal monitoring reports) and external monitoring reports on
resettlement
The implementation progress reports are written and submitted by Zhuzhou Engineering
Headquarters and Wuhan Engineering Headquarters while the extemal monitoring
reports are written by the Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilization of SWJU.
An implementation progress report will have to be written and submitted once every
half a year and an external monitoring report, once a year (or twice a year in the busiest
period of land acquisition).
The external monitoring reports, according to the procedure, will by submitted by the
Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilization of SWJU to the Land Acquisition
Section of Foreign Capital Utilization Office of the MOR who will forward them to the
World Bank.
