Socioeconomic Conditions of
the Affected Areas
I General Situation
(1) The railway linking Wuhan and Guangzhou spans over 10 cities in Hubei, Hunan
and Guangdong provinces economically developed with a combined area of 120
thousand square km that includes a population of 37350 thousand.
(2) Technical renovation in each station along the line will be minimized during the
implementation of the project according to the principle of "electrification based on the
current status", which will result in only slight impact on the small stations. Impacts
will by and lange concentrate on Wuhan railway pivot, Changsha area, Zhuzhou railway
pivot and Gangzhou railway pivot. The following is a brief introduction of the
socioeconomic status of the above-mentioned 4 areas.
