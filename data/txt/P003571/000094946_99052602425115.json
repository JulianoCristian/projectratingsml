These measures stipulate that: 1) the\n            agricultural population resettlement should be dependent on\n            land compensation transfers, thus minimizing resettlement\n            risks, allowing for irrigation improvements, soil\n            amelioration, and a sustainable animal and crop production.\n            Further, as a potential to alter the rural setup,\n            consideration should be given to industrial development; 2)\n            appropriate training should be provided as needed whenever\n            job transfers are considered; 3) urban housing compensation\n            standards are to be determined according to the\n            reconstruction price; 4) enterprises' resettlement\n            compensation is also to be determined according to the\n            reconstruction price, with no depreciation value.
