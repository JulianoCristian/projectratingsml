To achieve\n            these objectives, MOR formulated a series of components on\n            policy reform and institutional development (PID),\n            investments, and studies. PID components include: 1) railway\n            enterprise reform; 2) railway tariff reform; and 3) labor\n            productivity enhancement. Investments include: 1) expanding\n            corridor capacity; 2) modernizing information systems; 3)\n            upgrading telecommunications systems; 4) commercializing\n            container transport; 5) enhancing environmental protection;\n            and 6) expanding system capacity. The studies include\n            components that will provide MOR with the technical\n            assistance and software needed to prepare future railway\n            projects or to develop and apply new railway technologies\n            and management techniques."}, "docdt": "1995-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
