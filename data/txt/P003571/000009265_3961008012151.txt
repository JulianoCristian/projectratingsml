MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent of $400 million
to help finance a Seventh Railway Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The
proceeds of the Bank loan would be allocated to the Ministry of Railways (MOR) on the
same terms, with MOR bearing the foreign exchange risk.
2.          Country/Sector Background. Although China's transport system is a
comprehensive network of railways, highways, waterways and airways, it is still unable
to meet the needs of the rapidly growing economy. Since the beginning of the open-door
policy in the late 1970s, the enhanced demand for transport has greatly outstripped
increases in the nation's supply of transport services, with average annual growth rates of
freight and passenger traffic of about 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively. During this
period China underinvested in its transport infrastructure (an annual average of 1.4 percent
of GNP in 1981 to 1993, which is about half the comparable figures for Brazil and India),
resulting in at least a 1 percent loss of real GDP growth annually. The limited supply of
transport capacity continues to pose serious problems, and to alleviate these conditions, the
country will need to invest heavily in transport infrastructure and equipment.
3.          The railway is the dominant transport mode. It is administered by some
1,000 MOR employees, and comprises 54,000 route-kilometers (route-km) and 3.4 million
staff, of whom 51 percent work in transport and 49 percent in transport-related and
nontransport activities. For organizational reasons, the railway is divided into 12 regional
administrations. It is relatively well managed, has a disciplined workforce, and has one
of the world's highest track and equipment utilization rates. Although the railway's share
of overall freight traffic has declined slightly (from 59 percent in 1988 to 55 percent in
1993), it accounts for nearly three times as many ton-kilometers (tkm) as its closest modal
rival, domestic waterway transport. With regard to passenger travel, the drop in railway
market share has been greater; yet in 1993 the railway still handled 44 percent of total
passenger-kilometers (pkm) (compared with 52 percent in 1988). In the foreseeable future,
the railway is expected to continue to play a vital role, especially in long-distance bulk and
semibulk freight transport as well as in long-distance passenger transport, although it will
increasingly face competition from road, water, and air transport as the output of the
economy continues to shift to services and manufactured goods.
4.          To improve its operations, the railway must first alleviate its severe capacity
constraints-bottlenecks in at least one direction reach 95 percent of design capacity on
nearly 40 percent of the system. As part of the massive investment program launched by
the Government in 1992, the railway plans to build about 16,000 route-km of new lines



by the year 2000, adding nearly a third to the size of the system. Further, it plans to
upgrade track and equipment, and to double-track several existing lines.
5.          Along with addressing physical capacity constraints, the railway recognizes
that it must undertake reforms so as to operate in a market economy. MOR formulated
its own vision of changes in a 30-point Action Statement for Railway Reform, which was
endorsed by the State Council in April 1994. This Statement is consistent with the
Government's 1993 50-point Agenda of Nationwide Economic Reform, intended to
intensify the market orientation of China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that still largely
operate outside market forces, even though price reforms were introduced several years
ago. It is consistent with recommendations in "China's Railway Strategy," prepared by
the Bank in close cooperation with MOR (Report No. 10592-CHA). MOR's proposed
Railway Reform Program is well structured and defined. In summary, it covers:
(a)   Government-Railway Relationships and Railway Regulations.  It
proposes to:  (i) separate the roles of the Government and railway
enterprises-with the Government limited to macro regulations;
(ii) introduce compensation for public service obligations; and (iii) create an
enabling environment in which modern railway enterprises can develop.
(b)   Organization and Management. It proposes to: (i) increase the autonomy
of the 12 railway administrations and their subunits; (ii) form for-profit
transport enterprises (for example, container companies) organized along
lines of business that will be allowed to interact through arms' length
commercial relationships, such as operating and leasing agreements; (iii)
regroup equipment manufacturing companies to achieve competition and
economies of specialization; (iv) introduce international competitive bidding
to railway construction companies; (v) rationalize its nontransport
companies; (vi) divest itself of social welfare responsibilities; and (vii)
improve staff compensation and manpower planning systems.
(c)   Transport Capacity Investments and Financial Management. It proposes
to: (i) employ modern investment and financial planning tools; (ii) adopt
more cost-effective technologies; (iii) attract private sector funds to railway
enterprises through both debt and equity financing; and (iv) improve pricing.
(d)   Technology, Operations and Services. It proposes to: (i) upgrade railway
track and equipment; (ii) develop a more dynamic wagon distribution
system; (iii) adopt modern management practices to improve the use of track
and equipment and the productivity of labor; and (iv) install modern
management information systems to improve customer services.
6.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. The proposed project
would build on the experience gained through Railways I to VI, and through railway
projects in other developed and developing countries.
7.          Railway I to V (of which I and II are closed) were mainly loans for physical
investments, which were or are being satisfactorily implemented. These loans assisted



- 3 -
MOR conduct several studies that involved developing plans to modernize the railway's
information systems and its track and equipment. Some of their recommendations will be
implemented under Railways VII (para. 15). Railways VI was a transition project and
established a foundation for policy reform through studies and the preparation of analytical
tools. The railway management and economic studies (such as on the relationship between
the Government and MOR, the restructuring of MOR, the development and rationalization
of railway staff, and the mobilization of resources) are nearly completed, the tariff and
accounting studies are already completed, a railway investment model and a costing model
have been developed, and a pilot program to modernize rail container transport has been
initiated. Railways VII will build on these efforts to restructure the railways, reform
tariffs, improve labor productivity, strengthen MOR's investment decisions and financing,
and commercialize container transport.
8.          Bankwide experience shows that railway reform throughout the world has
been slowed by the railway's lack of authority to set rates, the absence of a sufficiently
commercial approach to transport markets, and resistance to change in both the railway and
other government institutions. Further, the process of railway reform in China is expected
to be difficult, lengthy and uneven because of: (a) the size and complexity of the railway
system; and (b) the ramifications to the entire economy of major changes to the railway's
structure, staffing and pricing. For these reasons, the Government and MOR are following
a cautious, gradual approach in testing reforms in pilot experiments, which the Bank
considers appropriate. Examples of pilots are: experimental programs of enterprise
reform in the Fuzhou Subadministration, the Guangzhou Railway Group Corporation and
the container companies; application of the costing model in the Fuzhou Subadministration
and in container companies; contract pricing in container companies and for oversized and
extraheavy freight loads; passenger congestion pricing in selected provinces; a passenger
reservation system in one administration; and environmental protection activities to
acquaint MOR with up-to-date technologies and practices.
9.          Bankwide experience also suggests that excessive reliance on loan covenants
to achieve reforms is unrealistic. Thus, the Bank's intense and very productive dialogue
with MOR will be continued under the proposed project, with the aim of further assisting
and spurring the reform process. Operationally, the Bank has learned the usefulness of
early preparation (optimally before loan effectiveness) of bidding documents for physical
investments, terms of reference (TORs), invitations for consultancy services, and a
procurement monitoring system. Because of the complexity of procurement in previous
railway projects, arrangements began early for the current project.
10.         The reform program of the railway is broadly consistent with lessons learned
from railway reform in developed market economies (World Bank Discussion Paper No.
269). First, there should be a clear separation between the Government's role and that
of the railway, and between market-driven and public-service activities. Second, railways
should be organized along lines of business, with clear financial goals (rather than physical
output targets), adequate compensation for public services and sufficient authority to set
tariffs. Third, major barriers such as redundant labor and employee welfare obligations
should be removed.  These lessons are reflected in the project's policy reform and
institutional development (PID) initiatives.

11.         Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy, to be discussed at the Board in May 1995 in conjunction
with this project, as it addresses three of the Bank's key objectives. These are to assist
China in:  (a) alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks; (b) reforming SOEs; and
(c) safeguarding the environment. It is further consistent with China's national and railway
sector reform agenda (para. 5). While the pace of change will be uneven (para. 8), the
Bank's involvement in the railway reform  dialogue is propitious because:  (a) the
Government adopted measures to reorient sectors toward the market economy since the
Bank's Board approved Railways VI; and (b) the dialogue builds on the foundation for
reform being established under Railways VI (para. 7). With its extensive experience in
railway reform in other countries, the Bank is well equipped to assist China in a similar
effort.
12.         Project Objectives. The project would address key issues in railway reform
and critical constraints in railway capacity, particularly by helping to: (a) redefine the
relationship between the Government and the railway with a view to pursuing market-
oriented policies in railway operations; (b) reshape the railway's organization and
strengthen its internal management; (c) expand transport capacity; and (d) modernize
technologies and bolster the efficiency of railway operations and services.
13.         Project Description. The project would finance equipment and technical
assistance (TA) to help MOR undertake: (a) policy reform and institutional development
(PID) initiatives; (b) physical investments and (c) studies.
14.         PID initiatives would provide MOR with TA to further the process of:
(a) enterprise reform that would help MOR transform the national railway system into a
group of market-oriented specialized transport service companies; (b) railway tariff reform
that would help MOR justify adjustments on a cost-recovery basis, pilot-test contract
pricing and expand the experiment with congestion pricing for passenger traffic; and
(c) increase labor productivity enhancements that would then help MOR control the size
of its railway staff and raise its productivity in general.
15.         Physical investments would entail: (a) expanding corridor capacity through
the electrification and upgrading of the 1,044 km Wuhan-Guangzhou line; (b) modernizing
information systems by introducing computer hardware and software; (c) upgrading
telecommunications systems by installing fiber-optic cables and digital microwave
equipment; (d) commercializing container transport by providing TA, computer software,
and container transport and handling equipment; (e) protecting the environment by pilot-
testing environmental programs and upgrading MOR's environmental management system;
and (f) expanding system capacity by importing fully assembled, three-phase electric
locomotives.
16.         Study components would provide the TA, training, computer software, and
equipment needed to: (a) undertake a feasibility study for a new dedicated passenger rail
line in the Beijing-Shanghai corridor; (b) apply a system developed under the completed
Railway Investment Study to boost the efficiency of investment decisions; (c) conduct
studies to expand the scope of the Transport Management Information System; (d) review
telecommunications network management and optimization; (e) design a high-efficiency,



- 5 -
high-power, low-emissions diesel engine for heavy-haul freight operations and high-speed
passenger services; (f) bolster MOR's treasury functions; and (g) develop an action plan
for restructuring the railway's manufacturing sector.
17.         Project Cost and Financing. The project is estimated to cost $1.75 billion,
with a foreign exchange component of $619.9 million (35 percent). The proposed Bank
loan of $400 million would cover almost 65 percent of the foreign exchange costs, and
about 23 percent of total project cost. MOR would cover the remaining costs. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
18.         Project Implementation. MOR would be the executing agency responsible
for implementing the project; its Foreign Capital and Technical Import Office would be
MOR's counterpart office to the Bank. Goods purchased under the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement dated May 1992 would be handled by tendering companies appointed by
MOR. The acquisition of TA, training, computer software, and equipment for research
and development would be handled by MOR with consultants' help as needed. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the estimated disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in the People's Republic of China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (IBRD 26327) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
13795-CHA, dated April 14, 1995, is being distributed separately.
19.         Project Sustainability. The long-term sustainability of the physical assets
under this project raises no doubt. The railway has a long history of implementing
physical project components satisfactorily, and of operating and maintaining these assets
properly. Further, the proposed project provides for the training of MOR staff in the use
of modem, unfamiliar technologies. Long-term sustainability of the reform component will
depend on the railway adapting an organizational structure, and managerial, financial and
operating skills, systems and tools needed to operate in a socialist market economy. TA
to be procured under the proposed project will focus on these necessary changes, and is
expected to lead to measures to sustain the railway sector in the long term.
20.         Agreed Actions. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower,
through MOR, will: (a) carry out the PID initiatives in accordance with acceptable action
plans; (b) retain consultants to assist it in the preparation of contractual leasing and
operating agreements between MOR and the selected container transport companies;
(c) complete the studies in accordance with an acceptable action plan, and, in consultation
with the Bank, take appropriate steps to implement the studies' recommendations;
(d) conduct, jointly with the Bank, a mid-term review of project implementation by
November 30, 1998; (e) carry out the project according to acceptable environmental
standards and carry out the resettlement of people affected by the corridor expansion
component according to an acceptable resettlement plan; and (f) generate funds from
internal sources equaling at least 50 percent of a rolling three-year capital investment
average (i.e., average of investments in the current, previous and following year) in 1995
and 1996, and 55 percent from 1997 onward.
21.         Environmental Aspects. This is a Category B project. None of the
investment components will significantly harm the environment, and a resettlement plan,



-6 -
satisfactory to the Bank, will compensate the 13,200 individuals (including 4,300 losing
housing) to be affected by the proposed Wuhan-Guangzhou electrification and upgrading.
Electrification of this line would have positive environmental impacts as it would reduce
air pollution and soil contamination by diesel fuel and lube oil. The pilot-testing of
environmental programs and the upgrading of MOR's environmental management system
under the investment component would acquaint it with up-to-date technologies and
practices, and thereby help it develop a comprehensive environmental action strategy for
the railway.
22.         Project Benefits. The most important benefit to this project is that it would
support the Ministry of Railway's own reform program, which provides for its
restructuring and modernization, and the definition of the relationship between the
Government and the railway operator. The physical investments will increase capacity in
a critical section of China's railway network and provide for the introduction of new
technologies to improve management information services, container transport,
communications and locomotive design. These investments will increase the quality and
efficiency of railway services, and in particular will reduce the cost of transport services,
generate time savings for the railway's customer, and create savings in capital investment
outlays. On the basis of the quantifiable benefits, the overall economic rate of return for
the project is estimated at 27 percent.
23.         Risks. The physical investments in the proposed project pose minimal risks
in view of the railway's past experience in implementing such components. The risks
relate to the policy reform component because of MOR's lack of familiarity with reform
and its dependence on endorsement from core government agencies in undertaking reform
initiatives. However, the Government and MOR are committed to reform, and are clearly
moving in the right direction. The risk would be reduced by a continuous dialogue among
MOR, other Government agencies, and the Bank on the substance and timing of reforms,
by funding TA and training for sector policy reform, and by intense Bank supervision of
the project.
24.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

(a) As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
originaL principaL credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fuLLy disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
