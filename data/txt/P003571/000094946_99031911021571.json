This\n            report covers the environmental assessment of the Wuchang -\n            Guangzhou railway capacity extension, expected to have an\n            increased passenger and freight turnover along the\n            Guangdong, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. The main\n            environmental impacts during construction relate to harmful\n            effects on the soil, namely vegetation and farmland, water\n            and air pollution, and noise related interference, such as\n            blast vibrations. Furthermore, following construction, noise\n            disturbance is expected to affect the nearby population,\n            which includes affected schools and hospitals. The impact on\n            population reallocation will be treated separately in the\n            resettlement action plan. Mitigation measures to curb the\n            environmental impacts will be controlled by the\n            environmental protection personnel, according to local\n            protection regulations, and include: clearing domestic\n            refuse and waste water, as well as standard maintenance\n            discharge control on air pollutants; alleviating noise\n            through vibration-reducing mounts and boundary noise limits;\n            regulation on electromagnetic radiation; and, schools and\n            hospitals along the line will require enclosed corridor\n            windows for noise reduction, as well as installation of air\n            conditioning and ventilation facilities."}, "docdt": "1998-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
