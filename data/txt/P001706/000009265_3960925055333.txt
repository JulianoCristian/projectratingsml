ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT - CREDIT 1104-MLI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Road
Maintenance Project, for which Credit 1104-MLI in the amount of US$17.0
million was approved on March 3, 1981. The credit was closed on
December 30, 1986, two and a half years behind schedule. On July 17, 1987,
the last disbursement took place and the small remaining credit balance
(US$32,000) was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Sahelian Department, of the Africa Regional Office and is based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit and Project Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower and
internal Bank memoranda.
The PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and the Swiss Development
Corporation, the cofinancier of the project, on March 14, 1989, for
comments by April 26, 1989, but none were received.

REPUBLIC OF MALI
ROAD MAINTFNANCE PROJECT (Credit 1104-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
The main objective of the project was to ensure that road
maintenance would be continued by providing a contribution to recurrent
costs and the foreign exchange needed for imported products (para 2.15).
To this end, the project included (a) a 30-month routine maintenance
program covering 6600 km of roads and a periodic maintenance progrzrv ef 900
km of roads. In addition, the project included a program of axle-lvs.
control and assistance to ONT (Office National de Transports) in setting up
a transport data collection unit (para 2.16).
Implementation Experience
Initial progress was slow because of the poor condition of
existing equipment, lack of spare parts ,ad cumbersome and time consuming
procurement procedures.  The latt3r resulted in delays of up to one year
from initial preparation of procurement documents to contract award (para
3.01.)
By April 1982, the project was progressing satisfactorily. It was
assisted by US$l million from the Second Highway Project used for the
purchase of additional equipment.  The illiquidity nf the Road Fund,
however, remained a problem (para 3.03).
As in previous projects, the performance of the Public Works
Equipment Service (PWES) was poor, in spite of increased technical
assistance inputs. To compensate for this, the Government agreed to
increase the share of periodic maintenance works to be executed by contract
as opposed to force account (para 3.06).
Results
By the end of 1986, with a three-year time extension of the
project, some 90 percent of the appraisal targets for routine maintenance
were being achieved as well as 116 per cent of the target for periodic
maintenance of gravel roads, while only about 60 per cent of the target fox
force account maintenance of paved roads was reached. The training center
had fully met its agreed target, and a basic data collection capacity had
been established at ONT (para 3.08).



- vi -
By early 1987, contracts for periodic maintenance of paved roads
had been completed, thus raising the final output considerably above the 60
percent referred to in the previous paragraph. The last of the weigh-
stations had been installed. Despite the consultants' assistance, PWES
never succeeded in adequately maintaining NDPW equipment because of
unqualified and poorly paid personnel, and poor management practices. Some
equipment was turned over to local dealers for repairs (para 3.09).
The reestimated rate of return is 30 percent compared with 50
percent at appraisal. This -omewhat lower reestimated rate of return
reflects an actual traffic growth somewhat below the appraisal expectation
plus unit vehicle operating cost savings somewhat lower than estimated at
appraisal (para 4.01).
Sustainability
The project is likely to be sustainable. The Government addressed
the liquidity problem of the Road Fund (para 5.07) increasing the
likelihood of a stronger financial basis for road maintenance in the
future. Moreover, the Bank continued its involvement in road maintenance
under the follow-up project, Highways V, (para 7.09) and is likely to
continue to be involved in the sector.
Findings and Lessons Learned
PWES has received almost continuous technical assistance under
four highway projects since 1970. Yet, despite such extensive assistance,
one of the last supervision missions concluded that the performance of PWES
was still unsatisfactory (para 3.09). The obvious problems were political
patronage, incompetent management, poorly qualified personnel, and low pay.
While more road works and major equipment overhaul should be contracted out
to reduce the volume of work assigned to Government workshops, it would
seem appropriate that some capacity to maintain public works equipment
remain available. One possibility might be to contract out the management
of the workshops on a long-term basis. The problems of PWES seem the same
as those of other public works maintenance organizations in West Africa.
The issue needs to be studied, perhaps on a wider basis than Mali, as to
why the problems of such agencies are so intractable, whether thtv can be
solved and if not, what alternatives can be identified. In the meantime,
the problem is being addressed under the Fifth Highway Project (para 5.02).
Mali's willingness to put some periodic maintenance out te
contract is commendable, but an even larger share should be assigned to
contractors in future. Effort should be made to resolve Mali's cumbersome
procurement procedures, particularly_as regards the award of road
maintenance contracts (para 7.04).



REPUBLIC OF MALI
ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(Credit 1104-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    Over the past two decades improving road maintenance has been one of
the Association's main goals in Mali, Under the first three road
projects, the road maintenance organization was strengthened, but physical
targets of road maintenance were only partially achieved due to the chronic
lack of local funds and rising costs.
1.02    The main objectives of the First Highway Project (Credit 187-MLI,
US$7.7 million, June 1970) was to strengthen and re-equip the National
Directorate of Public works (NDPW) and its Equipment Service (PWES). The
project provided two technical assistance teams involving over 40
man-months of consulting services. The technical assistance teams were
extended under the Second Highway Project (Credit 383-MLI, US$17.8 million,
May 1973). The Project Completion Report for the First Highway Project
concluded that both technical assistance teams performed well and that in
view of the vastness of the tasks, the work was accomplished in a
remarkably short period.
1.03    The maintenance element of the First and Second Highway Projects
concentrated mainly on routine and periodic maintenance of gravel roads.
The Third Highway Project (Credit 599-MLI, US$10.0 million, January 1976)
shifted emphasis to maintenance of bituminous roads. It contained a 3-year
program to eliminate the backlog of periodic maintenance on about 950 km of
paved roads. The Project Completion Reports for the Second and Third
Projects concluded that the initial institution building objectives
(reorganization of NDPW and reactivation of the Road Fund) were mostly
achieved, although training outputs under the Third Project were only about
half those estimated at appraisal.
1.04    During the last decade, the Road Fund, which draws most of its
revenues from fuel taxes paid in the form of postal checks, ceased to
function properly whenever the Postal Checking System (PCS) became
illiquid. Furthermore, Road Fund revenues were used first to finance the
Government's contribution to road investments, and only residually for road
maintenance. To ensure that the local share of recurrent costs for road
maintenance would be met before funds for investment were allocated, it was
agreed under the present project that an appropriate share of the Road Fund
revenue would be allocated each year to routine road maintenance. The Road
Maintenance Project, the Fourth IDA credit for roads, was conceived as an
interim operation to ensure that essential maintenance would continue to be
carried out and that the institution building results of the three earlier
projects would not be wasted. It was expected that during the project
execution period, the Government would, in connection with the Association
and the IMF, implement a plan for the rehabilitation of the PCS, and enable
the Road Fund to operate normally again.

1.05    The overall responsibility fir the project was entrusted to the
Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPW) through its National
Directorate of Ptublic Works (NDPW).
1.06    This report is based on information in Bank filos, including
consultants' reports and IDA supervision reports; and _n interviews with
Bank staff assigned to the project.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01    The project, as originally identified, included the reconstruction
of the Bamako-Bougouni road (1.60 km), construction of feeder roads by
labor-intensive methods, and a continuation of training and road
maintenance initiated under earlier projects, at a total cost of US$45
million. In view of the large size of the proposed project, IDA sought
cofinancing from several agencies, and asked RMWA to assist in preparing
the feeder road component. The feeder road component was dropped when it
became possible to carry out these works under the on-going Third Highway
Project.
2.02    A 1978 study financed under the Third Highway project confirmed the
need to improve the efficiency of the Public Works Equipment Service
(PWES), and identified the following major factors as contributing to its
unsatisfactory functioning: (i) poor management, (ii 'ack of funds, and
(iii) inadequately trained personnel. It concluded that' after several
years of unsatisfactory performance of the former Director of the PWES,
technical assistance had to be reintroduced to retrain PWES management and
personnel, and to eliminate the substantial backlog of equipment which
needed repair. Previous IDA missions had taken up the matter with the NDPW
but because of strong political backing, the replacement of the PWES
Director was impossible. Only when both the Minister and Director of
Public Works changed in late 1978, did the opportunity to improve the PWES
materialize.
Preparation
2.03    The preparation mission concluded that the design standards
proposed for the urban section of the Bama'ko-Bougouni road were too high
and that urban planning and land use issues ineeded to be studied. These
issues were eventually studied und!r a Bank Group urban project for Bamako
then under preparation. The mission further concluded that the main issues
to be resolved were to come up with: (i) an acceptable minimum road
maintenLance program, the local costs of which could be financed from the
Government's own resources; (ii) a proposal for its financing through
earmarked taxes; and (iii) the preparation of a program for the
reorganization of the PWES which had been the main bottleneck in the three
previour highway projects.



-3-
Appraisal
2.04    The project was appraised in October, 1978 by an IDA mission
assisted by two consultants. The mission proposed a project similar in
content to the project identified earlier (para 2.01), at a total cost c;
about US$54 million including taxes. The mission found that the revised
standards proposed for the Bamako-Bougouni road were adequate. It
reexamined the possible advantages of increased labor intensive road
maintenance operations but concluded there were none because of the
sparsely distributed population, and its full occupation in agriculture.
2.05    The main issue identified by the mission was the size of the
pioject and how to finance it.  In view of Mali's limited budgetary
resources, it recommended a minimum routine road maintenance program
covering 6500 km or about half the road network. This target reflected the
fact that budgetary limitations were compounded by liquidity problems of
the Road Fund wh,se revenues from the fuel taxes, was still unable to use
all of its revenues: fuel taxes were partly paid in checks drawn on the PCS
which was becoming increasingly illiquid.
2.06    Another issue was the need to eliminate the backlog of periodic
maintenance of paved roads. Many of these had not received periodic
maintenarce since their construction 10-15 years ago, and their rate of
deterioration was accelerating rapidly, to the point where lack of
intervention might cause failure in a relatively short period of time.
2.07    A recently completed Trucking Industry Study raised the issue as to
whether it would be more advantageous to improve and strengthen the Office
National des Transports (ONT) or to establish a transport planning unit at
the ministerial level in the MTPW. The appraisal mission recommended a
small amount of technical assistance to ONT.
2.08    The Decision Meeting of December 20, 1978 confirmed that the main
focus of road projects in Mali should be on maintenance. It agreed with
the appraisal mission's approach of defining a minimum routine road
maintenance program, in addition to continued reduction of the backlog in
periodic maintenance. It noted that successful implementation of these
objectives faced two constraints: institutional and financial. The meeting
recommended that satisfactory solutions to both should be a condition of
Board Presentation, i.e., the introduction of adequate measures to improve
performance of the PWES, and the preparation of the necessary measures for
setting up a Road Maintenance Fund. Ratification of such legislation would
be a condition of effectiveness.
2.09    The meeting further recommended that the reconstruction of the
Bamako-Bougouni road should not be included in the project because of the
higher priority accorded to achieving an adequate level of road
maintenance, and insufficient IDA funds to cover the whole project. This
decision reduced overall project costs to US$22 million.
2.10    In response to the Decision Memorandum, the Bank's senior
management expressed concern over the tendency to increasinglv finance



-4-
recurrent costs in projects in West Africa, including Mali. The question
was also raised as to 'qhether compliance with credit covenants under the
on-going Third Highway Project should not be a condition of negotiations
for the Fourth Project. In view of the Government's inability to maintain
the present network, it was also questioned whether reconstruction of the
Bamako-Bougouni road should not be included in the project. This component
eventually had to be dropped from the project, but only after IDA made
further efforts to interest possible cofinanciers, on behalf of the
Government.
2.11    It took five follow-up missions over the next 15 months to find
acceptable solutions to the institutional and financial problems referred
to in para 2.08. A financial analyst carried out a full analysis of the
revenues and expenditures of the Road Fund and proposed additional taxes
from road users. Only after considerable delay and pressure on the part o.E
IDA did the Government respond by increasing Road Fund revenues and
resolving the problem of its liquidity. Thus during much of 1979 and 1980,
project processing was virtually suspended as IDA was reluctant to schedule
negotiations pending resolution of the above issues, recognized as a
difficult and lengthy process.
2.12    In the meantime, the Swiss Development Corporation (SDC) indicated
an interest in possible cofinancing of the Project. Following a visit to
Mali by the RVP in September 1979, the newly elected Government said it
would take steps to resolve the outstanding issues. However, it was not
until more than a year later that IDA and the Government agreed to
negotiate a s,_aled-down interim project. This would enable vital road
maintenance work to proceed while long-term solutions to Mali's worsening
financial situation were being worked out with the Assistance of the IMF
and the Bank. The Government was informed that thL the Bamako-Bougouni
road, which it wanted to include in the project, would be financed under a
future IDA project to which it agreed.
2.13    The project was negotiated in December 1980.  The main changes were
the addition of some technical assistance, the inclusion of additional
project items for maintenance, and a modification of the arrangements for
the Road Fund. The two-year delay in negotiating the project after
appraisal was attributed to "an extended discussion of the conditionality,
fulfillment of which entailed Government actions to increase fuel taxes, to
make budgetary changes and to reestablish the liquidity of the Road Fund".
The illiquidity of the PCS, which caused the problems of the Road Fund, was
linked to a large unfinanced budget deficit, which the Government had asked
the IMF and the Bank to study in the light of its overall macro-economic
problems. In view of the foregoing problems, IDA decided to proceed with
the project scaled down from 4 years to 2-1/2 years.
2.14    The Government made one further effort to persuade IDA to include
the reconstruction of the Bamako-Bougouni road in the project, and
indicated that it might approach the The Swiss DevelopmentL Corporation
(SDC) for financing. The SDC informed IDA that it was not interested in
financing reconstruction when so much remained to be done on maintenance.
IDA did agree, however, to include further studies of the road in the
project.



-5-
Project Objectives and Description
2.15    The main objective was to ensure that road maintenance would be
continued by providing a contribution to tecurrent costs, and the foreign
exchange needed for imported goods.
2.16    To attain its objectives, the project included:
(a)    a two and a half year (July 1981-December 1983) program of
routine maintenance covering about 6,600 km of natioial,
regional and feeder roads, including strengthening PWES and
the Training Center (CPTP) to consolidate efforts initiated
under previous highway projects;
(b)    periodic maintenance on about 680 km of paved roads and 220
km of gravel roads by force account and contractor;
(c)    a program of vehicle axle-load control; and
(d)    assistance to ONT ia setting up a transport data collection
unit.
2.17    To implement the project, IDA and SDC assisted in financing the
following items:
(a)    road maintenance and workshop equipment, spare parts, and
minor improvements to PWES central workshop;
(b)    expansion of CPTP's facilities, purchase of training
equipment, and travel expenditures for instructors;
(c)    operating costs for periodic maintenance by force account;
(d)    periodic maintenance by contract;
(e)    recurrent costs of routine maintenance;
(f)    fellowships for PWES and road maintenance personnel;
(g)    mobile weighing scales; and
(h)    consulting services for:
(i)    technical assistance to PWES and ONT
(ii)   auditing under (c), (e), and the Road Fund
expenditures for road maintenance; a:ud
(iii)  updating the engineering and economic studies of the
Bamako-Bougouni road (160 km).



2.18    The project, including capital and recurrent costs, was estimated
to cost US$39.5 million, net of taxes, of which IDA put up US$17.0 million,
the SDC US$10.0 million and the Government US$12.5 million.  IDA and SDC
were to finance 100 percent of the capital cost of the project and one
third of the recurrent cost. The IDA Board approved the project in March
1981 and the SDC approved its contribution shortly thereafter. IDA was to
act as the administrator of SDC funds which were to be disbursed by SDC on
a pro rata basis with IDA funds--one of the rare instances of bilateral
donor contribution to maintenance rather than new construction. The
project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1983.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01    By the end of 1981, the project, which included the continuation of
miintenance works and services started under earlier projects, was
underway. Initial progresc was slow because of the poor condition of
existing equipment, lack of spare parts, and cumbersome and time consuming
procurement procedures. The latter resulted in delays of up to one year
from initial preparation of procurement documents to contract award. To
expedite matters, the first supervision mission approved the direct
purchase of the most urgently needed spare parts, and recommended IDA
assistance to the Government to simplify procurement procedures which were
a countrywide problem.
3.02.   To speed up repairs, IDA agreed to increase technical assistance of
mechanics. Technical assistance concentrated on continuing the repair of
equipment and retraining staff started under the Third Highway Project. In
the meantime, some force account operations had to be shut down because of
insufficient operable equipment.
3.03    By April 1982, the project was progressing satisfactorily, after a
delay of about six months. All equipment contracts had been awarded, most
of the existing equipment had been repaired, and force account operations
on resealing and regravelling had been restarted. The project was also
assisted by a Bank decision to use $1 million which was about to be
cancelled from the Second Highway Project account, for the purchase of
additional equipment.The main problem continued to be the illiquidity of
the Road Fund despite the fact that the funds in the PCS were partially
unfrozen and despite an allocation of FM 500 million to the Fund by
Government.
3.04    By the end of 1982, good progre s was being made on routine
maintenance, but delays had occurred on periodic maintenance by force
account because of lack of equipment. PWES was not as efficient as
foreseen in rehabilitating existing equipment from other projects, and was
only managing to keep up with emergency repairs. Shortly thereafter, a
large contract was awarded for the resurfacing of priority paved roads,
while another contract for regravelling was behind schedule.



-7 -
3.05    The Road Fund continued to be under-financed because of economic
difficulties in Mali. As a result, IDA and SDC agreed to increase their
disbursement rates for routine maintenance expenditures. IDA estimated
this would exhatlt funds for that component by the end of 1984.  A contract
for the update of the Bamako-Bougouni road study was awarded.
3.06    Despite delays in the availability of Road Fund moneys the pace of
work gradually picked up during 1983. This was attributable to the
increase in IDA and SDC disbursement rates and better use of the Special
Accounts.  By January 1984, project implementation was reported
satisfactory on all components except for PWES inefficiencies in
overhauling and repairing equipment, despite increased technical assistance
inputs. To compensate for this, Government agreed to increase the share of
periodic maintenance works to be executed by contract as opposed to force
account. The project was expected to be completed by June 1885, 18 months
behind the approved schedule.
3.07    By mid-1985, project implementation continued to be satisfactory,
except for poor performance of the PWES. The Government had proviled
additional funds for the Road Fund, and agreed to provide further funds on
effectiveness of tLe Fifth Highway Project, which included both
reconstruction of the Bamako-Bougouni road and the continuation of
maintenance. While the Credit funds for maintenance ran out in mid-1985,
except for some contract works still underway and other commitments, it was
agreed to further extend the Closing Date of the project to permit
disbursements of remaining fundt for continued technical assistance to the
MTPW for preparatory work for the Fifth Highway Project.
3.08    By the end of 1986, and with a three-year time extension of the
project, some 90 percent of the SAR targets for routine maintenance were
being achieved as well as 116 percent of the SAR target for periodic
maintenance of gravel roads, while only about 60 percent of the target for
force account maintenance of paved roads was reached. The training center
had fully met its agreed target, and a basic data collection capacity had
been established at ONT. The engineering study for the Bamako-Bougouni
road had been completed.
3.09    By early 1987, contracts for periodic maintenance of paved roads
had been completed, thus raising the final output considerably above the
60 percent referred to in para 3.08. The last of the weigh-stations had
been installed. Despite the consultants' assistance, PWES never succeeded
in adequately maintaining NDPW equipment because of unqualified and poorly
paid personnel, and poor management practices. Some equipment was turned
over to local dealers for repairs.
3.10    The project consisted essentially of a 2-1/2 year program of
routine maintenance covering about 6,600 km of national, regional and
feeder roads. To limit the recurrent expenditures, routine maintenance
operations were set at minimum standards compatible with the type of road
and level of services. Spot regravelling and emergency repairs were to be
carried out as required to ensure road serviceability. Because of careful



use of the funds and the strengthened dollar to the CFAF, the project
provided periodic maintenance of 680 km of paved roads and 220 km of gravel
roads by force account and by contract, as well as routine maintenance over
a 5-year period. This was two and a half years beyond the original period
as defined at appraisal.
3.11    In 1986, NDPW had made arrangements for a private firm to operate
its crushing plant, purchased in 1983 with project funds, but this
arrangement, unfortunately, did not work out as the contractor was
inexperienced. Another contractor is using the plant for the
Bamako-Bougouni road works, after which it will be taken over by a Malian
contractor with trained operators.
3.12    Disbursements of the IDA Credit were slower than the appraisal
estimate but once the project got underway in 1983, they continued at a
good rate until project completion at the end of 1986. A small amount
(US$32,500 equivalent) was cancelled on July 17, 1987 after final payments
on project accounts. The delays necessitated three extensions of the
Closing Date. Apart from implementation delays, disbursements were slowed
by: (i) IDA's decision to use remaining funds from the Second Highway
Project to pay for equipment that had been ordered under the Road
Maintenance Project, thereby increasing resources for that project; and
(ii) the favorable rate of the dollar to other currencies. Disbursements
of SDCs contribution was completed on January 9, 1987.
IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
4.01    As the report indicates, the project achieved most of its
objectives. The economic re-evaluation showed an overall economic rate of
return of 30 percent, compared to 50 percent at appraisal. This is due
mainly to lower than expected traffic growth, estimated at appraisal at 6
percent for paved roads and 5 percent unpaved roads from 1976 onwards. In
fact, traffic declined between 1981 and 1983 and regained 1976 levels in
1983 when severe drought resulted in heavy grain imports. For the economic
re-evaluation, the traffic growth from 1983 onwards was estimated at 2.5
percent (Table 1), based on available traffic count and fuel consumption
data. Traffic counts for selected gravel roads, on which periodic
maintenance was carried out, show two- to three-fold increases in traffic
following completion of works; for the economic re-evaluation, estimated
traffic growth from 1987 onwards is expected to be in line with overall
forecasts. It also appears that appraisal vehicle operating cost (VOC)
savings, based on an earlier version of the Highway Design and Maintenance
Model (HDM) were high (Table 2). The appraisal ERR was estimated to remain
above 12 percent with cost increases of 48 percent or benefit decreases of
46 percent.
4.02    The economic re-evaluation followed the methodology adopted for the
project appraisal. Thus, the only benefits taken into account were the VOC
savings stemming from the improvement in the road maintenance. These VOC



- 9 -
savings were derived from the HOil VOC Prediction sub-model (recently
developed at the Bank). The actual project cost in January 1988 prices,
amountel to about US$39.5 million and, for the purpose of economic
re-evaluation, was distributed over time in proportion to the
disbursements. The stream of benefits and costs covers a 10-year period,
as compared to seven at appraisal, because the project provided maintenance
for five years instead of 2-1/2 years, as explained earlier. With a
traffic growth of zero percent, the ERR would fall to 25 percent. VOC
savings computed for the economic re-evaluation are based on conservative
assumptions; an increase or decrease of 20 percent in these savings would
lead to ERRs of 50 percent and 14 percent respectively. Table 3 compares
current cost and ERR estimates to appraisal estimates for the project as a
whole, as well as for selected components, and presents related sensitivity
analysis results.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01    The Government complied with most Credit covenants.  Compliance
with the due diligence clause was reasonable given Mali's economic
problems. The Government was slow in furnishing the programs for periodic
road maintenance, but it did provide a detailed completion report at the
end of the project. The annual audit was not done, but an audit for the
entire period of the project was carried out and submitted in 1987. The
audit indicated that in general, the accounts were properly maintained.
The most significant shortcoming was Government's inability to adequately
maintain its road equirment, which held up progress on routine and periodic
maintenance by departmental forces throughout the life of the project.
5.02    The PWES has received almost continuous technical assistance under
four highway projects since 1970. Yet, despite such extensive assistance,
one of the last supervision missions concluded that the performance of PWES
was still unsatisfactory (para 3.09). The obvious problems were political
patronage, incompetent management, poorly qualified personnel, and low pay.
While more road works and major equipment overhaul should be contracted out
to reduce the volume of work assigned to Government workshops, it would
seem appropriate that some capacity to maintain public works equipment
remain available. One possibility might be to contract out the management
of the workshops on a long-term basis. The problems of PWES seem the sami-
as those of other public works maintenance organizations in West Africa.
The issue needs to be studied, perhaps on a wider basis than Mali, as to
why the problems of such agencies are so intractable, whether they can be
solved and if not, what alternatives can be identified. In the meantime,
the problem is being addressed under the Fifth Highway Project.
5.03    The Government's willingness to put periodic maintenance out to
contract after IDA prodding is commendable, but undoubtedly more
maintenance works could have been done by this means if the MTPW was not so
slow in calling for bids and awarding contracts. The award of a contract
in Mali called for 12 signatures before it became valid. The recognition
by the Government that contracting is a sound alternative to force account



- 10 -
operations indicates promise for the future. However, some way must be
found to shortcut cumbersome procurement procedures which lead to such
interminable delays.
5.04    The Government made a strong effort to support the Road Fund,
despite its economic woes which caused a drop in traffic and thus reduced
road user revenues. Also, at one stage, the Government cut back on other
work in order to provide the funds to keep the project going. The
generally good physical results achieved under the project are credited to
these measures.
5.05    Teams of consultants were employed under the project for: (i) the
studies of the Bamako-Bougouni road; (ii) establishing a data collection
capacity in ONT; (iii) strengthening CPTP; (iv) management assistance to
the NDPW- and (v) technical assistance to the PWES. While the consultants
performed reasonably satisfactorily under the circumstances, it would have
been more appropriate to have assigned responsibility for the five tasks to
a single consultancy firm or a joint venture of two firms. Such an
arrangement would have provided a more coordinated program of technical
assistance and reduced the overall cost of supporting several separate
consultants.
5.06    The MTPW and particularly the NDPW was strengthened under the
project and its organization was rated satisfactory during the appraisal of
the Fifth Highway Project. The SAR for that project noted that generally
engineers were adequately trained, but many lower echelon technicians were
not. More structured training courses and better coordination between
training results and career development of NDPW employees is being
supported under the Fifth Highway Project.
5.07    The shortfall in Road Fund revenues (paragraph 3.05) was compounded
by the fact that most of the revenues received in the form of postal checks
were illiquid. Mali's Postal Checking Service (PCS) had not been liquid
for many years, that is to say, post offices do not have cash to honor
postal mandates or checks. Since they cannot be cashed, postal checks are
usually refused by banks and merchants although they remain legal tender.
This problem resulted largely from Government's holding of PCS deposits at
the Treasury which, given its own liquidity problems, used them to settle
its liabilities. Since Government has, among others, also been paying a
major portion of its fuel bill with postal checks, it has had to accept, in
turn, that suppliers use them to settle their tax bills, thus spreading the
liquidity problem to the Road Fund. The Government cut all links between
the Treasury and PCS in 1985 and has engaged a consultant under Credit
1200-MLI (Second Telecommunications Project) -o recommend an action plan
for putting the postal service on a sound financial footing, including
measures to liquify the PCS. At negotiations for the Fifth Highway
Project, Government agreed to make the adoption of a plan of action
satisfactory to the Association a condition of effectiveness for the
project. It also agreed to increase tax revenues directly and make them
automatically available to the Road Fund to ensure that the Road Fund's
revenues cover debt service and maintenance requirements in the highway
sector.

VI. THE ASSOCIATION'S PERFORMANCE
6.01    IDA was confronted with unusual difficulties in resolving project
issues leading up to and following negotiations. Considerable staff effort
went into project preparation and post-appraisal discussions with a view to
firmly establishing the financial basis of the project.  Five IDA missions
were sent out after appraisal to resolve the issues surrounding the
operation of the Road Fund and the PCS, and the IMF was called in to
assist. IDA is to be commended for its persistence in getting the project
off to a good start. During project execution, IDA was constructive in
proposing changes, such as ways for expediting procurement, increasing its
disbursements percentage; and enlarging the Special Account to assist the
Borrower through a difficult period.
6.02    The only caveat to the above is the indecision IDA displayed
regarding the reconstruction or resurfacing of the Bamako-Bougouni r3ad.
The appraisal mission indicated concern over the size of the project in
view of Mali's financial constraints, and the Decision Meeting concluded
that the road should be dropped. Senior management questioned whether the
road should be included in the project at all, in view of Mali's inability
to maintain the existing network. Yet, for the next two years, this road
was alternatively added to the proposed project and dr.pped. A more
decisive approach to this issue would have been appropriate. The road was
eventually rebuilt under the Fifth Highway Project.
6.03    IDA and SDC funds were disbursed on a pro rata basis, as previously
agreed. SDC disbursed its share following instructions from IDA. The
result was that two payments from the two agencies in different locations
had to be made on each disbursement application. The files indicate
considerable confusion on the part of suppliers to this arrangement. In
making future cofinancing arrangements in which IDA is given responsibility
for the administration of the cofinancier's funds, IDA should also be
appointed as the sole disbursing agent, so that only one payment for each
application would need to be made. Another solution would be for the
cofinancing agencies to finance separate components.
6.04    IDA's supervision of the project was thorough.  It closely followed
the financial aspects of the project with its own staff and sometimes
employed outside consultants to assist. It also insisted on the audit
being carried out. Undoubtedly, this close attention to the financial
performance of the Government enabled IDA to anticipate and sometimes
forestall difficulties, which would have further delayed project execution.
While the supervision reports covered executing problems in detail, it is
difficult to ascertain from most of them the physical progress of the
projects, and the amount of work actually completed at the end of the
project.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01    Protracted discussions were needed between the Government and IDA
after project appraisal to resolve the financial issues before the credit
could be made effective. As a result of IDA's effort, the financial basis
of the project was well established and most of the physical objectives of
the project were attained, despite the severe economic problems and
financial constraints facing the Government. However, progress on
institution building was mixed. Good results were obtained in some areas
but little was accomplished in improving the operation of the PWES, despite
intensive efforts during project execution.
7.02    The generally reasonable results achieved in project execution
under difficult financial circumstances are credited to a close working
relation which developed between IDA and the Government. IDA's supervision
was thorough. Missions made ccnstrictive recommendations to resolve
problems which developed during project execution; these were promptly
acted upon at headquarters.
7.03    A better disbursement procedure should be included in future
cofinancing arrangements. This would avoid the need for each agency to pay
its share separately and thus eliminate two payments on each application.
7.04    Mali's willingness to put some periodic maintenance out to contract
is commendable, but an even larger share should be assigned to contractors
in future. Effort should be made to resolve Mali's cumbersome procurement
procedures, particularly as regards the award of road maintenance
contracts.
7.05    Better coordination of technical assistance would have been
achieved if the work had been assigned to a single consulting firm or a
joint venture, rather than splitting the work among several different
consultants. The NDPW was strengthened under the project and its
organization was noted as satisfactory during the appraisal of the Fifth
Highway Project. Further training for lower echelon staff is being
continued under the Fifth Project, as well as strengthening of equipment
maintenance.
7.06    The ERR of the re-evaluated project is 30 percent, reflecting lower
traffic growtn than anticipated at appraisal. This is an acceptable ERR
well above the opportunity cost of capital and indicates that the project
as carried out was well justifiLd.
7.07    The project included the preparation work which was the basis for
the follow up Fifth Highway Project appraised in May 1984, as the Road
Maintenance Project funds were almost fully committed. The Fifth Highway
Project provides for the reconstruction of the Bamako-Bougouni road, as
well as for the continuation of periodic and routine maintenance programs
initiated under earlier projects.
