project would consist of: (i) a two\n            and a half year program of routine maintenance of 6,600 km\n            of national, regional and feeder roads including\n            strengthening of the Equipment Service and Training Center\n            of the Ministry of Transport and Public Works; (ii) periodic\n            maintenance of 680 km of paved roads; and of 220 km of\n            gravel roads by force account and contractor; (iii) vehicle\n            axle-load control; and (iv) assistance to the Ministry of\n            Transport and Public Works in setting up a transport data\n            collection unit. The project is aimed at protecting the\n            small but significant institutional gains made to date in\n            the sector, as well as preventing deterioration in\n            maintenance equipment and the road network itself, while\n            discussions between the Government, the IMF and the\n            Association proceed on a request for assistance in preparing\n            an overall plan for reform of the economy, including\n            financing of road maintenance. The main project risk would\n            be the failure of the financial arrangements concerning the\n            Road Fund. Should sufficient funds not be forthcoming, road\n            maintenance operations would have to be reduced, either in\n            extent or in duration."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
