The\n            Irrigation Improvement Project consists of the improvement\n            and completion of irrigation systems covering 42,000 ha\n            served by existing reservoirs and main canals, the\n            strengthening of agricultural extension services, and the\n            preparation of related future irrigation projects. The\n            Rainfed Rice Pioneer Project is designed to identify, test\n            and promote techniques for attaining higher rice yields\n            under rainfed conditions in the Northeast region. The\n            project would reorient the work of six government rice\n            stations to respond more directly to the needs of the region\n            and link the stations more closely to the extension service\n            and to farmers in the surrounding areas. The third component\n            consists of consultants' services for assistance in the\n            preparation of the rural roads and village water supply\n            components of a rural infrastructure project."}, "docdt": "1974-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
