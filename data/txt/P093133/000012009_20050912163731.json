development strategy to\n            accelerate broad based and equitable economic growth and to\n            contribute to the Government's objectives of (1)\n            reigniting growth, particularly through increased private\n            investment and trade; (2) reinforcing macroeconomic\n            stability and strengthening fiscal sustainability; and (3)\n            increasing the efficiency and transparency of public sector\n            management. The first area includes policies to expand trade\n            opportunities and improve the investment climate. The second\n            area highlights measures related to expanding tax revenues,\n            reducing the fiscal burden of pension reform and\n            strengthening the financial sector. The third area supports\n            public sector modernization efforts, with emphasis on the\n            areas of procurement, e-government and public financial management."}, "docdt": "2005-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
