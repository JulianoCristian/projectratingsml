This operation was correctly focused\n            on the initial building blocks: (a) fiscal measures to meet\n            the challenges of stemming growth of debt and preserving\n            space for key growth-related and social investments; and (b)\n            growth, with special emphasis on measures related to\n            widening trade opportunities as well as continuing public\n            sector modernization efforts. The subsequent DPLs are\n            intended to support the broader development agenda of\n            private sector development, institutional\n            development/capacity building, and infrastructure\n            development. This DPL and the three planned additional\n            operations are intended to contribute to the\n            government's objectives of re-igniting growth,\n            particularly through increased trade and investment,\n            reinforcing macroeconomic stability and strengthening fiscal\n            sustainability, and increasing the efficiency and\n            transparency of public sector management. This operation\n            will help El Salvador meet its fiscal needs, supporting the\n            government's goals of fiscal stabilization and\n            efficiency in spending, endorse sound policies, become the\n            vehicle for securing overall continuity of the Bank's\n            policy dialogue with El Salvador, and strengthen the\n            Bank's reputation as a reliable development partner."}, "docdt": "2005-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
