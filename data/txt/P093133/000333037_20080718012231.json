the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            highly satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The\n            government's strong ownership of the program was\n            critical for a successful outcome. The satisfactory outcome\n            of the DPL I and the completion of the DPL II actions were\n            to a large extent a consequence of the government commitment\n            to achieve the medium-term targets and to present to the\n            National Assembly the legal reforms necessary for its\n            successful implementation. The latter were achieved through\n            a consensus-building process with the Opposition at the\n            beginning of the new administration. As this Implementation,\n            Completion and Results Report (ICR) review has demonstrated,\n            the government has made substantial progress toward\n            achieving the medium-term objectives established for the\n            programmatic series of four DPL despite the fact that only\n            one of them was approved and executed. The Bank should\n            examine the possibility, when the risk of a political\n            gridlock is high, to approve the total amount of the DPL\n            series which will be activated and disbursed gradually once\n            compliance of the relevant medium term triggers occur. This\n            policy will facilitate negotiations between the Executive\n            and Legislative branches of Government, when the opposition\n            has control over the latter, avoiding lengthy and costly\n            negotiations every year."}, "docdt": "2008-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
