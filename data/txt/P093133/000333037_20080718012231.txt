1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Political Context. Since the signing of the Peace Accords in 1991, following a 12 year
civil war, El Salvador made substantial progress in consolidating peace and democracy
through three electoral cycles. On March 2004, El Salvador conducted its third
presidential election. The election took place with the full participation of all political
forces, including the former guerilla movement, which had then transformed itself into a
legal party, Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN). The 38 year
old entrepreneur, Antonio Saca, representing the National Republic Alliance (ARENA)
defeated his nearest rival with solid margin of 57.7percent to 35.7percent, and took office
on June 1, 2004. The new President assumed office with considerable legitimacy, since
he was elected with a record turnout of around 60 percent.

The political party ARENA had maintained control of the Executive Branch of
government ever since the signing of Peace Agreements, but in the 1997 congressional
elections it lost the absolute majority in the legislature. In 2000, ARENA lost its position
as the largest party in Congress, as well as several of the most important municipal
governments to the FMLN. The political evolution of El Salvador, and the resulting
division of power between the FMLN and ARENA, increased the transaction costs of
reform for the Executive Branch, introducing some degree of uncertainty and slowing
down the reform process.

President Saca's Administration came to power with a comprehensive development
program that addressed growth, fiscal consolidation and public sector modernization. The
plan denominated "Safe Country 2004-2009" featured an agenda of policies and
investments aimed at restoring growth, generating employment and alleviating poverty,
together with efforts to deepen improvements in public financial management. The plan
was supported by the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and by lending and
non-lending     activities,  which   comprised     a   programmatic    DPL   series.   This
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) evaluates the implementation of the first DPL
and its contribution to the objectives of the government's plan.

Macroeconomic Context. El Salvador is a middle-income country with a strong policy
track record. On the economic front, progress has been rapid and wide ranging. Starting
in the early 1990s, successive governments have tackled reforms in a host of key areas
including trade liberalization, tax reform, strengthening of the financial sector, and
promotion of private participation in telecoms, energy, and pensions. Since the early
1990s, the country has also invested in schooling, health and other basic services, which,
together with the economic reforms, have contributed to rising per capita incomes and a
notable reduction in poverty. More recently, a decision to dollarize the economy in 2001
has resulted in lower inflation and interest rates and reduced business uncertainty. As a
result of these sustained reform efforts, El Salvador stands out as a leader in reforms in
LAC, along with Chile. In recognition of this record, El Salvador has obtained stable and

low-cost access to external financing since the late 1990s, maintaining high credit ratings.
As of December 2007, El Salvador, along with Chile and Mexico were the only countries
in Latin America to boast investment grade ratings by Moody's.

Despite impressive progress in structural reforms and sound macroeconomic
management, El Salvador's growth levels have been relatively low since the second half
of the 1990s, and decelerated further during the period 2000-2003 as a result of
exogenous shocks. The coffee crisis, the devastating 2001 earthquakes and the global
recession explain to a large extent the sluggish growth of the period. Due to these factors,
growth during the period 2000-2003 averaged only 2.1 percent annually, barely enough
to keep per capita incomes constant. Inflation during the period 2000-2003 averaged 2.7
percent annually and in 2000 reached a peak of 4.3 percent. At the end of 2003 year-to-
year inflation closed at 2.5 percent (Table 1)

Non-financial public sector deficits and debt levels have increased since 2000, as a result
of low growth and some expenditure pressures. El Salvador's non-financial public sector
deficit reached a peak of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2002 mainly due to the fiscal
cost of the pension reform. In 2003 NFPS deficit including pensions was reduced to 3.8
percent of GDP of which the reduction in the fiscal cost of the 1996 pension reform
accounted for 1.7 percent of GDP. Debt levels increased by 12.9 percent of GDP in the
period 2000-2003, taking the overall NFPS debt level to 42.1 percent of GDP by the end
of 2003. Much of this increase in public debt can be attributed additional expenditures in
response to the emergency reconstruction challenges of the 2001 earthquakes and the
financing of the transition costs of the 1996 pension reform. The pension reform was
adopted by El Salvador in 1996 replacing the existing pay-as-you-go system with a

system of individual retirement accounts. The reform was aimed at improving long-term
fiscal sustainability by replacing a system that was projected to yield large and growing
deficits in the future with an individual capitalization system for younger Salvadorans,
implying transitional costs as social contributions moved to private accounts while the
state remained obligated to pay out pensions for older generations.

El Salvador has made significant progress in reducing poverty since the beginning of the
1990s. The share of the population whose income falls below the poverty line declined by
27 percentage points (from 64.4 percent in 1991 to 37.2 percent in 2002), while the
fraction living in extreme poverty declined by almost 16 percentage points (from 31.25
percent to 15.4 percent) during the period. Poverty fell rapidly during the first half of the
decade and slowed considerably after 2000, in the face of the coffee crisis, the
earthquakes of 2001, and the slowdowns in the global and domestic economies. Since
2000, extreme poverty has barely changed, and income inequality has increased slightly
since the mid-1990s.

On June 2004, the 38-year-old entrepreneur, Antonio Saca assumed office as the new
President of El Salvador. His plan "Safe Country 2004-2009", adopted during the
campaign, focuses on sound macro-fiscal management, foreign investment promotion,
free trade, private sector-led development and a business environment free of exchange
risk. The Saca's plan views reigniting broad-based growth as its ultimate challenge, as
this holds the key to creating jobs, raising incomes, generating government revenue,
lowering the debt burden and driving poverty further down.. The plan also contemplates
continuing the modernization of the public sector aimed at improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the limited fiscal resources. Finally, the plan contemplates the control
and reduction of crime and violence.

The Saca's Administration expressed strong interest in collaborating with the World
Bank. It was in this context that the Bank and the Government of El Salvador agreed on
the Bank Group's strategic lending program in which the central component would be a
series of four programmatic Development Policy Loans that would support the
government's development strategy over the four-year period covered by the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY2005-2008. The CAS and the lending and non-lending
program involved was aimed at supporting the main three pillars of the government's
development plan: (i) to accelerate broad-based, equitable economic growth and increase
employment; (ii) to improve equity through building human capital and expanding access
to socioeconomic infrastructure, assets and markets; and (iii) to enhance security and
reduce vulnerability.

Table 2 below summarizes the three pillars of the Government "Safe Country 2004-
2009" development plan: growth, equity and security. The underlined priorities are those
supported by the programmatic DPL series.

The assistance strategy was developed in close partnership with the Government of El
Salvador based on the five core diagnostic reports conducted by the Bank during 2003-
2004: a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), a Poverty Assessment, a Public
Expenditure Review, a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA); and a
Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR).                        The CFAA and the CPAR were both
completed as joint documents with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Other
major AAA activity included a follow up of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) through technical assistance and capacity building to the Central Bank.

The decision to pursue a series of DPL operations arose from a CAS workshop held in
October 2004, with the participation of a broad range of stakeholders including Members
of Congress, civil society, think-tanks, private sector representatives and members of the
international development community. There was general support for DPLs as an
appropriate way for the Bank to support the country's development strategy and
priorities. In this context, most participants welcomed the proposed Development Policy
Lending approach as a way to lower the costs of external financing. The DPLs, four in
total, would provide quick-disbursing budget support in line with policy performance that
would be synchronized with the government's annual budget and would allow the
government to reduce its external financing costs by partially replacing higher cost bonds
issued in the international markets.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The first development policy loan and the other three planned operations were intended
to contribute to the Government's objectives of (i) reigniting growth, particularly through
increased trade and investment, (ii) reinforcing macroeconomic stability and
strengthening fiscal sustainability, and (iii) increasing the efficiency and transparency of
public sector management. The first DPL supported actions in each area. The first area
included policies to expand trade opportunities and improve the investment climate. The
second area highlighted measures related to expanding tax revenues and reducing the
fiscal burden of the pension reform. The third area supported public sector modernization
efforts, with emphasis in the areas of procurement, e-government and public financial
management.

The design of this lending approach took into account the lessons learned from past
operations in El Salvador and the latest thinking on Development Policy Lending for
good performing countries such as El Salvador. Instead of ex-post conditionality this
operation is based on upfront actions. Therefore, the DPL loans series have been
triggered by the Government's commitment to build on the country's strong record of
reforms and policy performance aimed at consolidating fiscal accounts and restoring
broad-based growth and by specific and significant policy actions toward those ends. The
DPLs have supported the reform program in general, without specific conditionality, and
the lack of reform progress in a specific area has been compensated with actions in other
areas, while the overall reform program remained on track. Each DPL operation has been
aligned with the budgetary cycle with the intention of becoming a predictable cost of
financing for the government.

First Development Policy Loan. This Loan was approved by the Bank on February 22,
2005, and its goals were consistent with the content of the Government Letter of
Development Policy dated January 21, 2005, describing a program of actions and policies
to promote growth, equity, and improve governance. The Loan Agreement was signed on
May 12, 2005, ratified by the National Assembly on August 18, 2005, and the funds
(US$100 million) were disbursed on September 28, 2005. The focus of this first loan is
on the fiscal measures to be taken to meet the challenges of a growing debt and
preserving the fiscal space for key social investments. It also devotes attention to the
growth agenda, with special emphasis on measures related to widening trade
opportunities, as well as to continuing public sector modernization efforts. Annex 2 of the
first broad-based growth (DPL I) program identified a set of objectives for the operation,
linking the supported actions with the Government's program and the objectives of the
Country Assistance Strategy. Medium-term objectives were also identified, although their
attainment was expected to require further policy actions under the other three DPLs. The
objectives and indicators, organized by reform area, are listed in Table 3.

Additionally the original program comprised actions and outcome indicators for the
Public Financial Management (PFM) intended to: (i) Enhance quality of budget
formulation and reporting, (ii) Upgrade coverage and technological platform, (iii)
Increase transparency of municipal finances and (iv) Enhance scope and coverage of
external audits. Based on previous accomplishments such as the fact that many good
practices from the "Fiscal Transparency Code" were in place, that the financial and
payroll management systems were operational in central government entities(SAFI and
SIRH); that around 50% of municipalities report regularly budget execution; and that an
independent external audit function was guaranteed by law, indicative medium term
milestones were established. Those outcomes include the need to fill the gaps in the
implementation of good practices from the "Fiscal Transparency Code"; the upgrading of
the technological platform of SAFI and SIRH; the increase in the number of
municipalities that make their budget documentation publicly available; and increase in
the coverage ratio of entity financial audits performed by the Court of Accounts.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by Program

This DPL is part of a programmatic approach that supports three areas: (i) reigniting
growth, (ii) macro stability and fiscal consolidation, and (iii) public sector modernization.
The government of El Salvador recognizes that the three areas are crucial to the success
of the Government Plan "Safe Country 2004-2009". The first area policy objectives are to
promote trade expansion; improve the investment climate; improve market performance;
and increase provision of infrastructure. The second area aims to reduce government
debt; increase tax revenues and strengthen the financial sector. The third area
contemplates the implementation of policy reforms to improve the transparency and
efficiency of the government. The designed set of key prior actions, triggers and
indicators (listed in Annex 1) are underpinned by a substantial body of analytic work
carried out by the Bank in partnership with the government of El Salvador over the last
few years, including the five core diagnostic reports.

The key measures highlighted as prior actions and the outcomes for this DPL are:

Reigniting Growth

(1) Responding to the need to reignite growth the Salvadoran Assembly ratified DR-
CAFTA in December 2004, making El Salvador the first country to ratify this treaty. The
CAFTA is a comprehensive agreement that commits partner countries to eliminate
virtually all trade tariffs and to enforce and improve transparency in areas of regulation
such as investment protection, intellectual property rights and procurement. The "DR-
CAFTA Challenges and Opportunities for Central America" Report (2005) concluded
that the agreement would improve growth levels across Central America, due to the
expected positive effects on trade and investment levels. Once the treaty was approved,
the government launched a program for its dissemination.


                                              13

(2) In December 2004, the Government obtained approval of a Competition Law which
would bolster efforts to improve the functioning of markets and reduce the incidence of
monopolistic practices. The Government enacted the Competition Law issuing the
Legislative Decree No 528, dated December 22, 2004.

(3) In order to make important progress in improving business registration procedures
and reducing the time and cost of doing business for small and medium enterprises in El
Salvador, the Government created the "Centro de Trámites Empresariales" (CTE). This is
a single registration window for SMEs, in collaboration with the SME support agency
(CONAMYPE).

Macroeconomic and Fiscal Consolidation

(1) In order to bring down fiscal imbalances to end further debt accumulation, the
Government obtained from the National Assembly at end 2004 the approval of reforms
based on a combination of improved tax collection efforts, broadening of tax bases,
elimination of loopholes, increased excise tax rates and a fiscal amnesty.

(2) The Government enacted the Legislative Decree No 347 dated June 15, 2004, to
eliminate early retirement provisions from its public pension rule.

Public Sector Modernization

(1) A major reform of Government procurement processes was launched with approval of
the Law on Public Sector Procurement and Contracting (LACAP) in May 2000. The
Procurement Policy Office (UNAC) was established by the Law within the Ministry of
Finance to exercise effective leadership in policy development and oversight of the
Public Procurement System. The Government issued the operational directives for the
procurement unit (UNAC) and a four-year program for the implementation of the public
procurement system.

(2) The Government launched an e-government strategy ("E-Pais"), including online
payment of taxes and customs duties, aimed at increasing transparency and reducing
transaction costs of accessing public services. The "E-Pais" strategy builds upon existing
e-Government initiatives implemented over the years.

(3) To continue strengthening the public financial management (PFM) modernization
process, the Government issued a decree adopting public sector internal control norms
consistent with international standards, following the recommendations of the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), carried out jointly by the Bank and the
IDB that identified opportunities for improvement.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance

As stated at the outset of this document, the central component of the Bank's assistance
strategy in El Salvador is a programmatic series of Development Policy Loans (DPL) to
support the Saca Government's medium-term development strategy to accelerate broad
based and equitable economic growth. The DPL series is intended to contribute to the
Government's objectives of (i) reigniting growth, particularly through increased private
investment and trade, (ii) reinforcing macroeconomic stability and strengthening fiscal
sustainability, and (iii) increasing the efficiency and transparency of public sector
management. Following the medium term framework laid out in DPL I, underpinned by
the substantial body of analytic work carried out by the Bank in partnership with the
Government of El Salvador, the design of key prior actions and indicators under the
program are the following:

2.2 Major factors affecting implementation

The strategic choice of a series of DPLs to support the Government plan "Safe Country
2004-2009" was based on a sequence approach whereby every single DPL had to be
negotiated with the Government and presented to the National Assembly for approval.
The preparation of the first DPL began in September 2004 and it was approved by the
Board five months later (February 22, 2005). This DPL was approved by the National
Assembly in August 18, 2005 after intense negotiations between the Government and the
Assembly. Once all prior actions were met, the loan was disbursed in September 2005.

The Government commitment to his own reform program and hence the DPL was very
strong. Due to the strong political mandate, the Saca's Administration was able to initiate
and implement broad-based reforms at an early stage of the presidential term. Strong
analytical underpinnings and related policy dialogue helped guide the design and focus of
this lending instrument. Finally, the results framework of the operation was very well
focused with prior actions spanning an appropriate range of three different policy areas.

Risk Assessment. The risks identified at appraisal and effectiveness were relevant. These
risks were: fiscal (El Salvador NFPS debt burden of 40% of GDP increased the
vulnerability to potential shocks); political (despite the strong electoral mandate of
President Saca a divided Assembly could become an obstacle to certain reforms);
external (sustained high oil prices or a international recession could negatively affect El
Salvador's economy); and natural disaster ( the country has proven vulnerable to
earthquakes and hurricanes that could hurt the performance of the economy). In countries
were Congress has to approve every single new Government's external debt with a
qualified majority, and the Opposition holds that majority, the strategic choice of a
sequence of programmatic loans risks the termination of the financing program in case
the Government does not reach an agreement with the Opposition. That was the case for
the second DPL, which was not approved by the National Assembly in spite the fact that
all policy actions agreed under the program were met. Therefore, the other two remaining
DPLs were terminated affecting the financial support envisioned for El Salvador to
support the Government plan "Safe Country 2004-2009".

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. During preparation, the government of El Salvador and the Bank
established a set of indicators to monitor progress with regard to the PDOs. (see section
1.2). These indicators were selected in agreement with the government counterparts,
considering the availability of data at the appraisal stage, its relevance to represent the
trends in the different areas and policy issues included in the operation. The medium-term
outcome targets (for 2008) rely on a combination of quantifiable indicators (reigniting
growth and macroeconomic stability) and qualitative indicators (fiscal transparency and
public expenditure management). The medium-term objectives established in this DPL
are part of three additional DPLs to support the Government "Safe Country 2004-2009"



                                             16

development goals. Therefore, all the tracking indicators were retained for the follow-up
DPLs.

The Government of El Salvador and the Bank agreed to conduct semi-annual reviews
aimed at identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses and possible assistance needed to
maintain momentum toward the government's planned medium-term outcomes and
address possible downside risks. A mid-term review was made in February 27, 2006
(ISR) to evaluate the achievement of the indicative targets established by end 2005. The
quantitative targets established in the program document related to the development goal
to reignite growth were achieved. By the same token, the indicative targets established to
assess the advancement of macroeconomic indicators to increase tax revenues and reduce
the NFPS deficit were both met. The only indicative target that was not met was the
launching of one infrastructure concession project.

M&E implementation. Data availability for all indicators was adequate to evaluate
progress. The Technical Secretariat of the Presidency was the counterpart agency in
charge of the M&E of the loan and for collecting the appropriate data necessary to assess
implementation progress. Other agencies playing an important role in this process are the
Central Bank (for financial sector issues), the Ministry of Economy (for trade and
investment climate issues), and the Ministry of Finance (for fiscal and macroeconomic
issues). Assessment of public financial management and procurement performance was
compiled by accessing the Procurement Policy Office (UNAC) established by the Law on
Public Sector Procurement and Contracting (LACAP) within the Ministry of Finance to
exercise effective leadership in policy development and oversight of the Public
Procurement System .

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up operation

Originally, a second DPL operation was planned to continue supporting the
Government's medium-term development strategy to accelerate broad based and
equitable economic growth. The DPL II was designed based on the successful first
operation and its focus was on addressing fiscal issues and on strengthening the
international trade and business environment. Likewise, the DPL II continued to
emphasize transparency and efficiency in public spending by including follow up actions
on public financial management and procurement regulations. The DPL II was supported
by extensive work done by the Bank and findings set forth in the CEM, PER, DR-
CAFTA studies, as well as the Investment Climate Assessment.

On December 13, 2005, the DPL II was approved by the Board and the Loan Agreement
was signed on March 15, 2007. The Loan was presented and discussed by the National
Assembly of El Salvador. Unfortunately, the loan was not ratified. As a result, the
conditions of effectiveness were not met within 90 days of Loan Agreement signature
and likewise eighteen months of Board Approval. Therefore, the Loan Agreement was
terminated on June 29, 2007. Political gridlock seriously hindered the lending program
envisioned for El Salvador. Accordingly, despite the impressive advances made in the




                                             17

implementation of the Government plan "Safe Country 2004-2009", only one DPL
operation was actually implemented.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Through regular policy discussions with the Bank, the Government advanced the
implementation of all policy actions agreed under the first and second DPL operations.
The ultimate objectives listed in section 1.2, promote trade expansion, improve
investment climate and improve market performance continue to be highly relevant to the
Government and to the Bank. Macroeconomic stability, always a critical precondition for
growth and development, was not a real concern at the time of this ICR, due to the fiscal
policy pursued by the government which the DPL supported. Finally, the objective of
improving the transparency and efficiency of government remains relevant to the current
country assistance strategy progress report (January 2008)

A Quality Assurance Review (QAR) rated this DPL as "highly satisfactory", noting that
the program responded to the Government's policy agenda, that tasks were timely and
took into account the political cycle, and the work focused on key issues and brought
analytical depth that was highly respected by the Government authorities and other
stakeholders. The loan objectives were consistent with those of the Bank as articulated in
the 2005 CAS (January 2005), which emphasized the support to the government's
medium term development strategy aimed at accelerating broad based and equitable
economic growth.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Reigniting Growth

The Government of El Salvador maintained a sound macroeconomic framework since the
new government took office, which included improving fiscal sustainability and
stabilizing public debt while fostering trade openness and increasing non-traditional
exports. Advances in the investment climate were also evident through significant
improvements in Doing Business indicators, including a reduction in the cost and days
needed to start business. This loan contributed positively to these outcomes by supporting
the 2004 fiscal reform package, the implementation of DR-CAFTA, and the investment
climate agenda. Likewise this DPL contributed to the approval of crucial legislation to
improve the market performance climate and to modernize the public sector.

The Government's growth agenda is anchored around the implementation of the US-
Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) to reinforce
its outward-development strategy, along with the complementary agenda of policy and
institutional reforms to ensure that El Salvador can fully benefit from the opportunities of
trade and greater integration into the world economy. After three years of implementation
of the Government "Safe Country 2004-2009" development plan the economy is showing
strong signs of recovery, inflation has been reduced despite increases in oil and



                                             18

commodity prices, the fiscal deficit has been reduced, and the public debt is in a
downward path. To put the latter on a downward trend a sustained primary surplus would
be needed, as shown by debt sustainability analysis performed by the Bank and the IMF.
In 2005 the primary balance was -.08 of GDP and at the end of 2007 the primary balance
was positive, at 0.2 percent of GDP. (Table 5)

The Salvadoran Assembly ratified DR-CAFTA in December 2004, making El Salvador
the first country to ratify this landmark agreement. DR-CAFTA is a comprehensive
agreement that commits partner countries to eliminate virtually all trade tariffs and to
enforce and improve transparency in areas of regulation such as investment protection,
intellectual property rights and procurement. The U.S. Congress ratified the DR-CAFTA
in July 2005. In early 2006, the National Assembly approved a package of legal
amendments required to ensure consistency with DR-CAFTA provisions. The ratification
of DR-CAFTA by the Legislatives of El Salvador and U.S.A constitutes a landmark
agreement that will impact positively on El Salvador's medium-term growth.

To promote trade expansion the program, from a base line of 8.0 percent of GDP in 2004
of non maquila exports (excluding coffee) established a medium-term target of 9 percent
of GDP to be reached by end 2008. By end 2007 the actual outcome was 9.9 percent of


                                               19

GDP exceeding the medium-term target. Non traditional exports offset the sluggish
performance of maquila exports which now faces intense competition from Asian
economies following the termination in 2005 of the Multi-Fiber Agreement. Non
traditional products increased its participation of total exports from 33 percent in 2000 to
47 percent in 2006, exceeding maquila exports for the first time. This shift in El
Salvador's export portfolio diminishes the economy's overall volatility as exports are no
longer concentrated in products that are exposed to price fluctuations in international
markets, or are dependent of special tax incentives and trade preferences to survive.
These results have been very impressive, implying a highly satisfactory outcome.

To improve the investment climate, the Government of El Salvador in December 2004
obtained approval by the National Assembly of the Competition Law to improve the
functioning of markets and reduce the incidence of monopolistic practices. In August
2005, new legislation was approved to modernize and streamline procedures in the area
of consumer protection, which aims to allow the Government to strengthen the Consumer
Protection Agency to enforce legislation. A target was established to improve the country
score in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitive Index from a baseline index
of 3.8 in 2003 to 4.8 by end 2008. Progress has been registered as the index reached 4.1
by the end of 2007. According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2007-2008, World
Economic Forum, El Salvador stands among the five most competitive countries in LAC.

A target of at least 1.5 percent of GDP (average) in Foreign Direct Investment was
established for the period 2005-2008. At end 2005, FDI reached 2.3 percent of GDP
exceeding the Government's planned medium-term outcome, however at end 2006, FDI
flows were just on target registering 1.5 percent of GDP. At end 2007 foreign investment
flows reached 5.2 percent of GDP mainly due to a one time operation consisting of
foreign investment in three of the major Salvadoran Banks.

Finally, the program established medium-term targets to reduce the time and cost of
doing business in El Salvador. According to "Doing Business" to start a business in El
Salvador took 115 days in 2004. The medium ­term target was set to 70 days by end
2008. At the end of 2006 the time of starting a business in El Salvador was reduced to 26
days, exceeding by wide margin the target established in the DPL I. Regarding costs
related to start a business in El Salvador, the target was to reduce it from 128 percent of
income per capita as published by the Doing Business report to 60.4 percent by end 2008.
In December 2007, the cost of doing business in El Salvador declined to 73.1 percent of
income per capita. These outcomes are in great part a result of the opening in early 2005
of a single registration window, the "Centro de Trámites Empresariales" for SMEs, which
was a policy action supported by this loan. Due to the outcomes to improve the
investment climate this component is rated as highly satisfactory.

Macroeconomic Stability and Fiscal Consolidation

The Government of El Salvador according with the targets established in this loan has
taken important fiscal steps in 2004 and 2005 intended to reduce public sector deficits
and stabilize public debt levels. In 2004, the Government obtained approval by the



                                              20

National Assembly of a package of fiscal reforms to improve tax collections efforts to
increase tax revenues. The approved fiscal package includes reforms to twelve different
laws in a broad range of areas (e.g., tax code, penal code, financial sector, customs). The
reforms include a significant broadening of the tax base of the value added and income
tax, eliminating banking secrecy laws for the purpose of tax audits and the introduction of
prison terms for tax evaders. In December 2004 the National Assembly approved
increases in excise taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, beer, guns, ammunitions and
explosives.

As illustrated in Table 5, with the approval of the fiscal reform tax revenues (net of VAT
returns) were projected to increase from a base line of 11.5 percent of GDP in 2003, to a
minimum target of 14.5 percent of GDP by end of 2008. At end of 2007, tax revenues
reached 13.5 percent of GDP, an increase of 2 percentage points in four years. The VAT
tax base increased 7.7 percent from 2004 to 2007 and the income tax base in 10.5 percent
for the same period, incorporating a total of 138.000 new tax payers. Another target was
established to reduce the NFPS deficit from an average of 4.2 percent of GDP in 2000-
2003 to a downward trajectory in the period 2005-08. At the end of 2005 and 2006 the
NFPS deficit was 3 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. As of December 2007 the
NFPS deficit declined for third consecutive year registering 2.2 percent of GDP.
Regarding the public debt, a minimum target of 40 percent of GDP was established by
end 2008 from 42 .1 percent in 2003. At end 2007 the index of public debt to GDP was
40.8 percent, an indicator that the public debt is in a downward path and that the medium
term target established in the DPL will be reached. The fiscal performance of the
Government of El Salvador to increase tax revenues, reduce the fiscal deficit and stabilize
the external debt merits a satisfactory rating.

Public Sector Modernization

This loan provided support to the governance and fiscal transparency agendas through
selected policy actions. The CFAA and CPAR studies provided technical
recommendations to improve public financial management and the procurement system.
To improve public financial management the government expanded the Integrated
Financial Management System (SAFI) to all government institutions, and steps have been
taken to implement a modern e-procurement system (COMPRASAL). In this regard, this
loan established that Government procurement has to follow best practices, as measure
by the share of procurement processes that use the new public dissemination module.
From 0 percent in 2004, a target of 100 percent was established by end 2008. The share
of procurement processes that follow best practices was 78 percent by end 2006. The
advance in the implementation of e-government, the procurement system COMPRASAL,
and the modernization of the public financial management, merits a satisfactory rating.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Not Negligible

Since the preparation and design of the programmatic DPLs various risks were identified
which could affect the long-tern success of the development outcomes. Recognizing that
some of those risks are beyond the control of the Government, the risks identified in the
CAS are still valid and amplified by uncertain outcomes of current political situation.
Among the risks identified were the following:

4.1 Fiscal Risk. El Salvador's NFPS debt burden of about 41 percent of GDP at end 2007
represents a vulnerability to potential shocks. Given this debt level, an increase in
international interest rates poses moderate risks of unexpected additional financing cost.
The government plan "Safe Country 2004-2009" with the support of the DPLs was
planning to deal with this vulnerability. The tax reform approved by the Assembly aims
at continuing increasing the tax revenues to reduce the overall fiscal deficit.

4.2 Political Risk. On the political front, a divided Assembly continues to be a source of
risk for proposed government initiatives. The initial government approach to consensus-
building bears fruit, as witnessed by the approval of fiscal reforms, DR-CAFTA
ratification and other significant legislation. The outcome of Congress elections in March
2006, consolidated a divided Assembly with a even stronger opposition that now has veto
power over decisions requiring a two-thirds qualified majority, which has created
unexpected political gridlock in Congress. To mitigate the political risk, the government
managed to build a coalition to reach simple majority but fell short reaching the qualified
majority (2/3) needed to ratify new lending.

4.3 External Risk. Sustained high oil prices, rising food prices and/or a new international
recession could negatively affect El Salvador's economy. El Salvador maintains a sound
macroeconomic framework and has some room to maneuver. Tax collection rose to 14
percent of GDP in 2007 from 11.5 percent of GDP in 2004, putting public debt on a firm
downward path and raising revenue to address social and other needs. On the external
front, the current account deficit widened in 2007 to 5.9 percent of GDP from 4.7 percent
of GDP in 2006 and is expected to remain at that level in 2008. No financing problem is
anticipated at this stage although there are a number of risks associated to the evolution
of remittances, the main source of external financing.

4.4 Natural Disaster Risk. El Salvador remains vulnerable to natural disasters (e.g.,
earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and floods) which can hurt the performance
of the economy and the soundness of the financial system in the short-term, and may
require    significant  unanticipated    expenditures   for  emergency      assistance and
reconstruction. Following Hurricane Stan in 2006, the government is working to develop
medium-term mitigation strategies.

4.5 Crime and Violence Risk. Continuing problems with crime and violence in El
Salvador could also pose a risk to the achievement of the reform objectives tarnishing the
investment climate and weakening institutions and the social confidence. Enhancing



                                              23

security is a key pillar of the government's overall development plan "Safe Country
2004-2009". Accordingly, the Government is currently implementing a multi-pronged
strategy to reduce crime and violence.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Despite the impressive advances made by the government to achieve the program
objectives, political gridlock seriously hindered the lending program envisioned to El
Salvador to support the Government "Safe Country 2004-2009" development plan. The
Bank in close partnership with the government prepared and delivered a total of two DPL
operations, but only this Loan for US$100 million became effective. To implement
programs that were originally supported by the Bank loans, the Government mobilized
alternative funding sources that did not required approval of a qualified majority in the
National Assembly. In 2006 the Government issued local bonds through the recently
created Pension Trust to replace DPL borrowing and in mid-2007 created the Education
and Security Trust (FINEP) to fund the Secondary Education project. Through regular
policy discussions with the Bank the Government advanced the implementation of policy
actions agreed under this Loan.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Supervision arrangements were implicitly depending upon the design of the second DPL
operation. The successful development of this last operation gave the Bank the
opportunity to take stock of progress made since the appraisal and effectiveness of the
first DPL. This included the areas of growth, macroeconomic stability, and efficiency
and transparency of the public sector.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The Government strong ownership with the design and outcomes of the plan "Safe
Country 2004-2009" lead to the early compliance of several Key Indicators established
for the different objectives putting in evidence the satisfactory performance of the
Borrower as well as its commitment to achieve the medium term development goals.

(b) Implementing Agency
   Rating: Satisfactory

The Government performance through the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency, our
main counterpart, as well as the performance of the Ministry of Economy (promotion of



                                           24

trade and investment climate); and the Ministry of Finance (reduction of debt and
increase in revenues) was satisfactory. Finally the performance of the Procurement Policy
Office (UNAC) is rated satisfactory as it has been highly responsive in implementing the
procurement reform.

6. Lessons Learned

The central component of the Bank's assistance strategy for El Salvador to support the
government "Safe Country 2004-2009" development plan was a programmatic series of
four DPLs. In the program documents, the Bank recognizes that it had no experience with
adjustment lending to El Salvador and that the biggest obstacle to implementation of the
lending programs envisioned in the last two CAS for El Salvador, discussed at Board in
November 2002 and January 2005, was the difficulty faced by the Executive in obtaining
Assembly support for ratification of external loans. At the time of the DPL program's
preparation the new government believed that incorporating DPLs within the budget
presented to the Assembly would give it greater leverage as this would call attention to
the lower cost of borrowing Bank resources as compared to other financing alternatives.
The reality proved these assumptions wrong, and the National Assembly did not approve
the second DPL, disrupting the whole financial program proposed in the context of the
CAS 2005-2009. Under these circumstances and in order to meet its financing needs, the
Government issued domestic bonds through the recently created Pension Trust Fund
(FOP) and the Education and Security Trust Fund (FINEP). These sources of financing
were used as alternatives.

The government's strong ownership of the program was critical for a successful outcome.
The satisfactory outcome of the DPL I and the completion of the DPL II actions were to a
large extend a consequence of the government commitment to achieve the medium-term
targets and to present to the National Assembly the legal reforms necessary for its
successful implementation. The latter were achieved through a consensus building
process with the Opposition at the beginning of the new administration. As this ICR
review has demonstrated, the government has made substantial progress toward
achieving the medium-term objectives established for the programmatic series of four
DPLs despite the fact that only one of them was approved and executed.

Even though, in the design of the lending strategy the Bank decided to take into account
the lessons learned from past operations in El Salvador and to incorporate the latest
thinking on Development Policy Lending for well performing middle-income countries
(World Bank Programmatic Adjustment lending retrospective, and World Bank 2004:
Good Practice) political gridlock derailed the lending program envisioned for El Salvador
in support of the "Safe Country 2004-2009" development plan. With that experience at
hand the Bank should examine the possibility, when the risk of a political gridlock is
high, to approve the total amount of the DPL series which would be activated and
disbursed gradually once compliance of the relevant medium term triggers occur. This
policy would facilitate negotiations between the Executive and Legislative branches of
Government, when the opposition has control over the latter, avoiding lengthy and costly
negotiations every year. Therefore, this is by far one of the most important lesson learned



                                             25

during these three years and one that must be taken into serious consideration if the Bank
wants to be successful in future operations.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Pursuant to the request by the Manager of IBRD loan No. 7275-ES, known as loan DPL1,
the borrower has prepared the present evaluation report, which contains the following: (i)
evaluation of objectives, design, and implementation; (ii) assessment of the performance
of the Bank or other parties involved in the design; and (iii) possible adjustments
proposed. This report is brief and complementary, since the Bank has prepared its final
report on the implementation of the above-mentioned loan and has also available the
report prepared by the Court of Accounts of the Republic, which evaluates compliance
with the financial and management section of the loan agreement and the main
accomplishments and achievements hereunder.

Evaluation of objectives, design, and implementation

Purpose of the loan:
The Bank's main purpose was to support, with the strategic assistance of a series of
programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs) to El Salvador, the Government's
medium-term development strategy to accelerate broad-based and equitable economic
growth.

The reason for considering this purpose to be the key component of the programmatic
loan is that it is fully in line and compatible with the strategic purposes and interests of
the Bank and the Government of El Salvador, under the administration of President
Antonio Saca. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for El Salvador for the period
2005-2008, prepared by the Bank, lays out the following objectives: (i) to accelerate
broad-based, equitable economic growth and increased employment; (ii) to improve
equity through building human capital and expanding access to socioeconomic
infrastructure, assets, and markets; and (iii) to enhance security and reduce vulnerability.

It also explicitly provides that, through a series of DPLs, the program should seek to
support and contribute to the achievement of the Government's objectives of (i) reigniting
growth, particularly through increased private investment and trade, (ii) reinforcing
macroeconomic stability and strengthening fiscal sustainability; and (iii) increasing the
transparency and efficiency of public sector management.             Accordingly, the first
programmatic loan (DPL1) set forth actions for each one of these objectives.

Thus, the definition of the purpose of the programmatic loan is well-suited to the
harmonious combining of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) with the Government's
objectives in its strategy to accelerate economic growth.




                                              30

Objective/result: (i) Reigniting growth, particularly through increased private
investment and trade.

The country's economic performance has been outstanding, surpassing the expectations
of the baseline and alternative scenarios, both of which are described in the IMF article
IV consultation report and the World Bank's Public Expenditure Report, as shown in the
following table:

                           Real GDP scenarios and performance
                                    2004      2005    2006     2007      2008
          Baseline scenario         1.8       3.0     3.0      3.0       3.0
          Alternative scenario      1.8       3.0     3.5      4.0       4.0
          Performance               1.8       3.1     4.2      4.7       4-4.5

This performance took place in an internationally adverse situation, as predicted in the
risk section of the programmatic loan, owing to the high prices of oil and its derivatives,
together with the fact that China's share of international trade has largely displaced that
of the developing economies. Fortunately, the Salvadoran economy took advantage of
the trade opening provided by free-trade agreements such as DR-CAFTA, as was
reflected in the dynamic behavior and diversification of its nontraditional exports.
Moreover, private investment has been a key factor in accelerating economic growth, and
sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and industry have recovered as a result of
appropriate policies and the actions taken under DPL1.

On the other hand, the Government of El Salvador did not receive the financial support
expected under the package of DPLs, since only US$100 million of a total of US$400
million were approved and disbursed in the first operation. This was also foreseen as
being one of the risks of this type of programmatic loan.

Fortunately, the Government of El Salvador put in place its own financing mechanisms in
the domestic market, through two trust fund operations, one for pensions and the other for
education and security. It also reformed the legal framework to enable autonomous
institutions to contract financial obligations backed by its income flows. This applied
only the responsible entities of the National Registration Center (CNR) and the Road
Maintenance Fund (FOVIAL).

Thus, the Bank's support under the DPL series partially contributed to the achievement of
the objectives designed and developed by the Government. The Bank provided financial
assistance, but only in the initial phase of the Government program, and for only 25% of
the amount contemplated in the package of programmatic loans.

The priority actions contemplated under DPL1 and designed to promote the objective of
reigniting economic growth were effectively carried out as follows:




                                              31

1. Signing of DR-CAFTA and launch of dissemination program

El Salvador was the first country to ratify DR-CAFTA, and it came into force in March
2006. It has been used to promote trade in many economic sectors. It was to be included
in DPL2, which it has been, although it was originally planned for the later phases of the
loan operation DPL1.

Fortunately, all sizes of enterprises were included, especially the full participation of
small enterprises, in the trade and investment derived from DR-CAFTA, which has
enhanced the way its benefits are viewed. In fact, the success of DR-CAFTA has been
impressive, to the extent that those who opposed this treaty in the current presidential
campaign, particularly FMLN, now feel that the treaty should be retained, and their
position on dollarization has changed: they now favor maintaining it. This is a positive
step for the agreement because the discussion will now focus on the best way of taking
advantage of it.

The topic of how to take advantage of the benefits of DR-CAFTA is covered under DPL3
and DPL4 in the matrix of results of the series of programmatic loans.1 Small-business
owners have fortunately achieved this very quickly during the first two years in which the
treaty has been in force

2. Approval of Competition Law.

The Competition Law was adopted on November 26, 2004, and its entry into force in
January 2006 was provided for in the same Act. This was done so that the
Superintendency of Competition could be established in 2005.               This action was
completed, and in its first two years of operation, the Superintendency completed the
process of investigation and settlement of various cases, among these being the
determination of unfair practices in two distributors of petroleum products, two cases of
energy distributors being charged with creating barriers to the entry of new operators, and
a case of collusion in the fixing of commissions in an agricultural commodity exchange.

3. Reduction of costs and time in business registration and operation for SMEs
through creation of the "Centro de Tramites Empresariales" [Business Transaction
Center].

As provided for in the loan operation, the Business Transaction Center was created. Also
created was the Comprehensive Services Window for those registering a new business in
the National Registration Center (CNR), and a Single Window for Imports. The Center
provides services relating to the filing of tax returns and payment of taxes, issue and
control of driver's licenses and registration of vehicles, birth certificates in the cities of
Sonsonate and San Salvador, certified copies from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
passport services ­ both domestic and consular ­ and services of the Consumer Protection
Office.

With regard to reduction of time and costs for businesses, progress has indeed been made.
There has been an estimated reduction of 75% in the average time devoted by businesses
to formalities compared to the time required prior to the Government's actions and
reforms. Moreover, the monetary costs for these operations have been cut by about 50%.
The impact of these reforms has been reflected in the World Bank report entitled "Doing
Business 2008;" the country advanced six places, from 75th to 69th, in the sample of 187
countries in the report. In addition, the 2007 "Doing Business" report notes that "El
Salvador led the reforms in Latin America for the second year in a row."2 The package of
actions and reforms promoted by the Government has reduced the number of formalities
required for starting a business from 12 to 9, the number of days from 40 to 26, and the
cost from 118% to 73.1% of per capita income. Moreover, the number of days required
for arranging imports was cut from 30 to 18. At governmental level, it is estimated that
pre-import formalities that used to take 20 days now take only 1 day. Thus, the
Government has made significant efforts to provide more efficient services (in time and
cost) to businesses, as recognized in the "Doing Business" report.

It is important to note that the Government has carried out the actions provided for in the
package of programmatic loans DPL 2, DPL3, and DPL4, including: (i) presentation and
adoption of the Consumer Protection Law; (ii) presentation and adoption of the
Securitization Law; and (iii) expansion of participation in benefits. Nonetheless, these
loan operations were not approved and/or ratified. This demonstrates the Government's
commitment to carry out its program, despite the lack of support and resources from
these programmatic loans.

The envisaged actions to promote economic growth through the programmatic operations
of DPL3 or DPL4 by improving provision of infrastructure consistent with REDI
recommendations have not had the anticipated results, especially in the water, energy,
telecommunications, and transport sectors. The limited progress in this field is
attributable not only to the Government's financial constraints, management of priorities,
and an overburdened agenda, but also to the technical and political complexity of some of
the REDI reforms. The report is useful, however, for its identification of key areas for
future cooperation with the Bank.

Objective/result: (ii) Reinforcing macroeconomic stability and strengthening fiscal
sustainability.

It was thought that this objective could be achieved by actions to increase tax revenues,
reduce the Government's debt, and strengthen the financial system. Thus, actions under
DPL1 included: (i) approval of the package of fiscal reforms; and (ii) elimination of early
retirement provisions.

The Government intended both reforms to strengthen public finances. As one of its first
actions, begun in June 2004, it instituted the elimination of early retirement, which meant
modifying the Pension Savings System Law in order to eliminate automatic retirement

Corporation, p. 10.

after 30 years of service. What remained was a system that combined age and number of
years on the job: a minimum of 25 years' accumulated service and the reaching of
retirement age, namely, 55 for women and 60 for men. This eliminated the possibility of
early retirement; for example, prior to the reform, a worker who began to work at age 18
could retire with 30 years of service at the age of 48. This was not reasonable because he
or she was not old, and the pension was intended for older persons. This reform therefore
generated a savings of expenditures that would have been incurred for early retirements.

The fiscal reforms implemented in November 2004 to increase tax revenues included: (i)
facilities for compliance with pending tax obligations; (ii) reform of the tax code; (iii)
amendments to the income tax law; (iv) reform of the law on nonbanking financial
intermediaries; (v) reform of the banking law; (vi) reform of the customs law; (vii)
amendments to the Penal Code; (viii) amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedures;
(ix) reform of the law on taxation of the transfer of goods and services (value added tax),
known as the VAT Law; and other legal frameworks.               3



Thus, the Government has complied with the conditions required for disbursement under
DPL1. The fiscal reform focused on increasing tax revenues by expanding the tax base,
reducing opportunities for tax evasion and circumvention. This made it possible to
increase in gross tax burden from 12.2% in 2004 to 14.2% in 2007, which is very close to
the target of 14.5% set for 2008.4 The net tax burden coefficient rose from 11.5% in 2004
to 13.5% in 2007.

Non-financial public sector debt stabilized at less than 40% of GDP and is heading
downward, in accordance with the targets, for the package of programmatic loans.5 The
country has managed to maintain its risk rating, thanks to the greater growth of the
economy, the improvement in fiscal accounts and the expansion of nontraditional
exports, against a backdrop of higher petroleum and petroleum product prices, plus the
negative impact of China on the maquila industry and other products, and the difficulties
encountered in the absence of support from the Legislative Assembly for new loan
operations.

The financial system has been strengthened through: (i) regulation of credit risk and
constitution of reserve assets to minimize risk, in accordance with international best
practices; and (ii) internationalization of the most important private banks in the country,
with the sale of Banco Cuscatlán to the financial group Bancolombia, Banco Agrícola to
the financial group Citibank, and Banco Salvadoreño to HSBC; these were the three main
financial groups in the country. As a result, these banks assumed the international risk
rating of the buyer groups, which are more solvent and have greater capital backing.

The Government of El Salvador has not yet presented to the Assembly the draft law on
the integration of superintendency, which would make it possible to have comprehensive

and consolidated supervision of the operations of financial groups and strengthen the
supervisory body. It is unlikely that this draft will be approved by the current Assembly,
largely because the time for reform is running short as a result of the political cycle.
Nevertheless, this commitment to strengthen the supervisory body is being fulfilled by
means of a loan operation (No. 1173 and ATN6400) with the Inter-American
Development Bank. This objective will thus be achieved, as provided for in a loan
operation under DPL2.

The redesign of the financial structure of the pension system having a fiscal impact was
implemented with reforms to the Pension Savings System Law in September 2006 and
the creation of a pension obligations trust fund (FOP), by which the Government
achieved: (i) domestic financing of pension expenditures; (ii) extension of the average
term of pension obligations covered by taxes; and (iii) reduction of the cost of servicing
these obligations. This had been envisaged for an operation under DPL3 or DPL4.

It must be recognized that the Government has not made an effort to incorporate the
informal sector as part of a specific tax reform; however, in the reforms it carried out in
2004, it expanded the base through a system of control and supervision of the
implementation and enforcement of tax obligations. This was set to be part of an
operation under DPL3 or DPL4, and it could therefore be considered an area for future
joint efforts between the Bank and the Government.

Objective/result: (iii) Increasing the transparency and efficiency of public sector
management.

The Government carried out the actions for the disbursement of DPL1 with regard to: (i)
implementation of the public procurement system under the direction of the Procurement
Policy Office (UNAC); (ii) launch of the electronic government strategy; and (iii)
adoption of internal controls consistent with international best practices for public
financial management.

Since the enactment of the Law on Public Sector Procurement and Contracting (LACAP),
the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency (CPMSP) has guided and promoted its
implementation as part of the financial cooperation of the Bank under loan 4082. This
LACAP project has made it possible to unify the public procurement system in the
country and has provided a legal framework that supports the operations of the
administration. UNAC, as monitoring body overseeing compliance with the Law and
proponent of guidelines and procedures for its enforcement, has actively participated in
coordination with the Technical Secretariat in areas relating to: (i) training and advanced
training of Institutional Procurement Units (UACI); (ii) training of private enterprises that
provide or participate in public procurement; (iii) developing guidelines for good
practices in model operations; (iv) providing advisory assistance to the 262 municipalities
on the subject of LACAP; (v) forming alliances with business associations to improve
their knowledge of laws and procedures covered by LACAP; (vi) developing an online
information system on public procurement: compr@sal (www.comprasal.gov.sv).




                                             35

With regard to the Integrated Financial Management System, an online system has been
developed for the use of public institutions to help them achieve greater transparency,
uniformity, and efficiency in their management.
As for international indicators of transparency, the corruption perceptions index (CPI),
which evaluates general corruption in the public and political sector as perceived by
business leaders and researchers in the country, reports a stabilizing trend in El Salvador
between 2005 and 2006, and the country stands in 67th place out of 180 countries for
2007. In 2006 it was in 57th place, but out of a smaller sample of only 163 countries, as
can be seen in the following table:6

At the regional level in 2007, El Salvador reported the fourth best performance for the
indicator, surpassed only by Chile, Costa Rica, and Cuba. Nevertheless, in the area of
transparency and corruption control, there is always room for improvement with regard to
institutional matters, accounting practices, and other topics covered under the heading of
transparency. If a target is simply set of matching the performance indicators of the
country scoring the highest in Latin America, currently Chile, a medium- and long-term
strategy will have to be designed, including actions to reach the targets within a certain
period. The following table shows a comparison of the indicator at the regional level.

Meeting this goal, as provided for in a DPL3 or DPL 4 programmatic operation, will
require a program of public sector modernization, which will need to be defined for
future operations; unfortunately, it was not achieved through this series of DPLs,
although the Government has made every effort with limited resources and a crowded
agenda of priorities. No doubt a medium- and long-term financial commitment of this
type with the Bank, together with a program built around relevant actions, would have led
to progress in this area.

Assessment of the performance of the Bank or other parties involved in the design

The Bank team and its authorities who participated in the design and implementation of
this operation performed their functions in accordance with their competencies and roles.
Their assistance and support to the Government was diligent, appropriate, and
professional. The risks envisioned in the package of programmatic loans with regard to
the political support that would be required for the approval of the loans by the

                                                 36

Legislative Assembly proved to be the principal obstacle; the Government therefore will
need the Bank's support and all that is implied by its participation in a medium-term
operation.
Although it has completed a high proportion of the actions encompassed in the whole
series of programmatic DPL loans, and has completely fulfilled those under DPL1, the
Government has incurred costs because it did not have available the Bank loan operations
under DPL2, DPL3, and DPL4, a situation which can be summarized as follows: (i) it did
not have the support of an external partner with the Government that shared a priority
agenda to promote progress in the country and enforce compliance; (ii) it did not have the
technical support ­ an important asset of the Bank ­to provide advisory assistance in the
conduct of reforms and processes; (iii) it did not have the follow-up and rendering of
accounts for the actions and fulfillment of the objectives of a reform program; (iv) some
actions provided for in DPL2, DPL3, or DPL4 suffered delays in their execution; and (v)
the financing source used was more costly and the time-weighted average of the debt was
shorter than if the Bank's resources had been used.

Possible proposed adjustments

The experience of the Government of El Salvador with this programmatic loan operation
suggests that a package of DPLs (in our case, DPL1 to DPL4) should be approved by the
Bank and the Legislative Assembly as a single operation, rather than individually for
each DPL, when they are part of a comprehensive medium-term programmatic operation.
The agenda or areas of action should be in line and in synchrony with the Bank's CAS
and the Government's current five-year strategy. Thus, the Bank would be able to have
an input into medium-term development policies. Moreover, once the Government is
elected, it should work with the political forces in the Legislative Assembly to seek their
support. The latter would require the assistance of a team of experts in the management
of political forces (which the Bank probably does not have), in view of the special nature
of these stakeholders in the country; alternatively, appropriate interlocutors should be
found in order to seek consensus on the Government's medium-term strategy and the
actions provided for in the Bank's CAS. This would involve modifying the management
of fees for non-disbursement to prevent any impact on the country, or deferring the dates
on which these charges would apply, in accordance with the programming of each DPL
