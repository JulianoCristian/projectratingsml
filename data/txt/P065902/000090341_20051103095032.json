Lessons learned\n            from the project: For Bolivia's economic development,\n            it is essential to explore and develop its oil and gas\n            resources. The project had a good vision with innovative\n            ideas. It is important for Ministry of Hydrocarbons (VMEH)\n            to improve its communication and coordination with the\n            Ministry of Sustainable Development. The project\n            demonstrated that with proper support, it is possible to\n            create appropriate mechanisms for environmental management.\n            The project helped to identify important issues in the\n            hydrocarbon sector. Good coordination and active involvement\n            among the participants are very important for a project such\n            as this, where several stakeholders were involved. This\n            Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) project, although rated\n            unsatisfactory for its implementation, is leaving very\n            important lessons for the government, stakeholders, and the Bank."}, "docdt": "2005-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
