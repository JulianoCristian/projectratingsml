{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Recovery under Global\n            Uncertainty Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for Jordan\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was high, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: key lesson learned from the 2009 DPL is that the\n            realism of the reform agenda in terms of content and risks\n            has to be assessed carefully in the preparation of the\n            operation. For instance, the 2009 DPL was based on\n            objectives that were spelled out on the 2006 Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the Country Assistance\n            Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) results matrix. These\n            objectives did not sufficiently take into account\n            Jordan's frequent change in government that delays the\n            execution of the reform program. While the matrix continued\n            to be broadly relevant throughout the time period of the\n            CAS, certain milestones could have been more realistic.\n            Furthermore, in the design of a new DPL, it is important to\n            take into account Jordan's high exposure to exogenous\n            shocks, which may offset the expected impact of particular\n            reforms. The political economy of structural reform in\n            Jordan is very complicated and induced delays and the\n            legislative process can take longer time that hindered\n            serious efforts to structural reforms. This was evident in\n            some of the prior actions that required laws and regulations\n            to some certain sectors. Therefore, for future DPL program,\n            in any attempt to design and implement prior conditions,\n            technical discussions ought to be at advanced stage on all\n            measures selected for inclusion in the DPL. It is also\n            necessary to call for the approval by the Council of\n            Ministers as a crucial step that signals concrete change,\n            even though Parliament approval is required for draft laws\n            to become laws. Donor coordination plays a major role in\n            program success, and the Bank should make great efforts to\n            preserve a unified dialogue within donors. This will benefit\n            Jordan by building credibility for the reforms, but also by\n            focusing the attention and expertise from multilateral\n            donors on a complex program of reform. For the Bank and\n            donors it might help to mitigate the risk of this type of\n            reform and reduce the supervisory burden on each donor."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
