developed and implemented by the\n            Ethiopian and Djibouti governments with assistance from the\n            European Union. The project consists of eleven components.\n            They can be separated into two implementation phases: in the\n            initial phase, quick rehabilitation and repairs of road\n            between the Arta turnoff and Galaif, on the Ethiopia border\n            over a period of about one year; and a second three-year\n            phase covering road maintenance, construction of axle load\n            control stations, and technical assistance to support\n            institutional development. Phase I would have the following\n            components: 1) civil works between Dikhil and Galafi, 2)\n            civil works between Arta and Dikhil, and 3) rehabilitation\n            of Roads Department's equipment pool. Phase II will\n            have the following components: 4) routine maintenance of the\n            entire Arta-spur to Galafi; 5) axle load control station; 6)\n            project implementation unit; 7) construction management\n            consultant and supervision of the works; 8) offices,\n            vehicles and laboratory equipment for supervising engineer,\n            construction manager, and Project Implementation Unit; 9)\n            institutional development support,10) studies on HIV/AIDS\n            and road safety, and 11) study on development of\n            trade-related services."}, "docdt": "2000-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
