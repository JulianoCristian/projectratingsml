health, and safety improvements, although potential adverse\n            environmental impacts during construction, will occur. These\n            will be effectively addressed through engineering design,\n            low cost mitigation measures, and construction monitoring,\n            which will include specific environmental provisions for\n            contractors. This Environmental Management Plan supports\n            specific measures to mitigate construction, and operational\n            impacts, as follows: 1) construction impacts will be reduced\n            through detailed engineering design, and specific\n            procurement requirements for handling management waste,\n            including oil spills, and fuel, and lubricant leakage,\n            mainly in the Port of Djibouti; 2) operational management\n            will support road maintenance programs, during a three year\n            period, to avoid deterioration, and ensure safety\n            regulations. Further measures include adequate waste\n            disposal, and adoption of health, and safety controls; 3)\n            final designs for the road rehabilitation program will take\n            into account storm water, and sediment management\n            requirements for crossings, and culverts; 4) field\n            investigations on archaeological sites will be conducted, to\n            protect these, and burial sites from earth works; and, 5)\n            support for HIV/AIDS education, and outreach programs is\n            included in the plan."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
