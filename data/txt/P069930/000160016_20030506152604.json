It is\n            crucial to complete the rehabilitation of the road which\n            connects the Port of Djibouti with neighboring Ethiopia,\n            which fully depends on the Djibouti port for all foreign\n            maritime trade, and for the massive and recurrent shipments\n            of food aid to millions of Ethiopians. The supplementary\n            financing is needed to cover higher than expected costs for\n            physical road rehabilitation works, and ultimately to allow\n            the existing International Road Corridor Rehabilitation\n            Project to reach its original development objectives.
