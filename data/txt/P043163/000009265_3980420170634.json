growth on the federal road network and to reduce\n            road transport system costs; and to improve the\n            institutional capacity to manage the road network. The\n            project, designed to finance a time slice (1998 to 2002) of\n            the FRMP, consists of: (1) civil works to increase the\n            capacity and traffic safety of the federal network,\n            including providing additional lanes on some road sections,\n            building climbing lanes on others, improving horizontal and\n            vertical alignments, providing adequate road shoulders and\n            curbs and removing hazardous spots; (2) institutional\n            strengthening directed at the Secretariat for Communications\n            and Transport (SCT) and selected state highway organizations\n            for improving management systems and procedures, training\n            staff and reviewing the role and needs of the SCT centers in\n            the states; and (3) further support to SCT to implement\n            actions on road sector financing, to improve multi-modal\n            transport operations, and to continue improving road safety\n            and environmental impact assessment and mitigation measures\n            in the planning, construction, and operation of transport facilities."}, "docdt": "1997-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
