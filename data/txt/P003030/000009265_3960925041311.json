Overall, project results\n            were disappointing. The project was unable to achieve its\n            objective of increasing maize production on a sustainable\n            basis and thus increase farmer's incomes. No adequate\n            extension package for this purpose was developed; extension\n            activities concentrated on encouraging the use of improved\n            seeds and fertilizer while inadequate supplies of either\n            were available. Incomplete data shows that maize production\n            increases were mainly due to an increase in area planted and\n            that actual yields for maize fell during project\n            implementation. In the absence of a suitable production\n            package, the envisaged modification of farming systems and\n            the introduction of mixed cropping was given insufficient\n            attention. Farmer's incomes are not likely to have\n            improved as a result of the project. Despite agreements\n            reached with the Borrower, the practice of forced cotton\n            planting continued throughout the project, albeit at reduced\n            levels. This had a negative impact on maize production,\n            because the farmer was unable to spend sufficient time on\n            his maize fields. The experiments with animal traction had\n            limited success and were finally handed over to local non\n            governmental organizations (NGOs). The project was\n            successful in its rehabilitation and construction of manual\n            drinking water supply systems, which besides providing labor\n            savings, also had a public health impact. The extent and\n            impact of the roads component is unknown."}, "docdt": "1992-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
