of the Rice Productivity\n            Improvement Project for Lao People's Democratic\n            Republic (Lao PDR) is to increase rice productivity and\n            overall volume of rice production among smallholders in\n            selected provinces, thereby increasing incomes and improving\n            food security for small farm households. This will result in\n            reducing the seasonal and disaster related shortages of rice\n            in the short run, as well as reducing the impacts of rising\n            food prices. Lao PDR faces serious challenges in addressing\n            food security, with parts of the population also facing the\n            compounded effects of food and agricultural input price\n            surges, and the recent flood disaster. In order to assist\n            Lao PDR to respond rapidly to its food security challenges,\n            the World Bank proposes to provide emergency support for:\n            (i) a rapid improvement in agricultural productivity to\n            increase food security at the household and village levels;\n            and (ii) a nutritional improvement project to complement\n            existing financing of the Lao PDR Health Improvement Project."}, "docdt": "2008-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
