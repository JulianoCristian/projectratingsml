satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: seed\n            production is suitable for more advanced farmers. Lessons\n            learned from the project show that significantly longer\n            capacity building support than just two cropping seasons is\n            required to establish strong seed producer groups. It is\n            therefore suggested that seed multiplication activities be\n            combined with parallel extension scale-up support for larger\n            numbers of farmers, using some small seed packages produced\n            under the project. This approach is now being piloted under\n            Lao Upland Food Security Improvement Project (LUFSIP). It is\n            necessary to avoid ambiguity in the central objectives of an\n            'emergency operation' to be supported by the\n            Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) or any other Bank\n            window, to ensure the most efficient design and\n            implementation arrangements. If focus is strictly on one-off\n            short-term measures of an emergency nature, project design\n            should avoid activities whose efficiency may be negatively\n            affected by broader structural institutional and policy\n            issues, and the most efficient existing implementation and\n            delivery mechanisms should be used."}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
