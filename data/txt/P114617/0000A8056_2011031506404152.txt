                         The main development objective would be to increase rice productivity and overall volume of rice production among smallholders in four selected provinces,
                         thereby substantially increasing incomes and improving food security for small farm households.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward meeting the PDO is moderately unsatisfactory. The project has fallen substantially behind schedule due to weak capacity in terms of procurement, financial
                         management and monitoring and evaluation. Only in the past few months were baseline surveys done and M&E Framework established, which has limited measuring the progress in
                         the Results Framework. Nevertheless some progress is being made particularly with regard to support to farmer groups. About 59 farmers groups have been established and
                         farmers are receiving improved seeds. Demonstrations to improve production practices and to promote the use of higher quality agricultural inputs have been provided. Under the
                         "support to seed stations" component, once the necessary procurement of equipment for seed separation and storage is completed, the project will be able to advance on production
