The project was\n            approved on January 13, 2009 and was processed under the\n            Global Food Crisis Response Program in the amount of US$3\n            million. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to\n            increase rice productivity and overall volume of rice\n            production among smallholders in selected provinces, thereby\n            increasing incomes and improving food security for small\n            farm households. After initial implementation difficulties,\n            the current progress towards achievement of PDO and\n            implementation progress are being upgraded to Marginally\n            Satisfactory following the implementation support mission\n            held in November 2011. The project has produced significant\n            amounts of seed, and the use of good seed has contributed\n            significantly to increasing rice yields and the total\n            production volume of rice. The availability of improved seed\n            is helping farmers increase rice productivity and the\n            overall volume of production. The project objectives remain\n            relevant and achievable. The changes have no impact on the\n            PDO, results/ indicators, scope of project components,\n            project institutional arrangements, safeguards, disbursement\n            and fiduciary arrangements. The borrower has prepared an\n            action plan satisfactory to the Bank to complete the project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
