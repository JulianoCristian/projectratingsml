7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The main development objective would be to increase rice productivity and overall volume of rice
production among smallholders in four selected provinces, thereby substantially increasing incomes and
improving food security for small farm households. This would result in a very rapid reduction of seasonal
and disaster related shortages of rice in the project areas, as well as reducing the impacts of rising food
prices and population increases in the longer term.
