                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main development objective would be to increase rice productivity and overall volume of rice production among smallholders in four selected provinces,
                         thereby substantially increasing incomes and improving food security for small farm households.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Component 1 activities geared toward supporting the Rice Research and Seed Multiplication Centers are quite behind schedule, particularly construction of critical infrastructure and
                         procurement of seed processing and farm equipment to produce clean, dry, weed-free, high quality seed for later multiplication. Sluggish implementation with regard to these
                         activities does not prevented the project to move towards achieving its PDO, which is to increase rice productivity and rice production among smallholders in four selected provinces,
                         and associated increase of incomes and food security. The seed producer groups under Component 2 have multiplied some 5,500 tons of R2 and R3 seed over the four cropping
                         seasons since 2009, which is the majority of seed available in project provinces. This availability of improved seed is helping farmers increase rice productivity and the overall volume

                         household incomes through increased yields and surplus rice produced, and has decreased rice shortages. These positive changes were driven by the use of improved rice varietals

                         and good seeds, provision of fertilizer, and extensive training on rice production methodologies. A majority of farmers also experienced additional positive income effects from the
                         sale of seed to seed stations and to adjacent villages, where the improved seed fetched higher prices than paddy. However, in order to sustain and increase these seed production
                         levels it is critical that project fully implement activities under Component 1.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI) at central level needs to provide more strategic guidance for provincial seed stations in planning their seed
                         production activities for the upcoming season in order to ensure efficient use of project funds. There is also a need to improve the data collection and analysis on project inputs and
                         outputs by NAFRI. NAFRI also needs to complete procurement and installation of key seed storage and multiplication infrastructure as per revised Procurement Monitoring Report.
