                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main development objective would be to increase rice productivity and overall volume of rice production among smallholders in four selected provinces,
                         thereby substantially increasing incomes and improving food security for small farm households.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall progress toward meeting the PDO improved to moderately satisfactory in the latter half of 2011. The project has produced significant amounts of seed, and the use of good
                         seed has contributed significantly to increasing rice yields and the total production volume of rice. The availability of improved seed is helping farmers increase rice productivity and
                         the overall volume of production. The project has helped raise household incomes through increased yields and marketable rice surpluses. These positive changes were driven by:
                         (a) the shift from traditional rice varieties and old seed to improved varieties and high quality seed; (b) improved and more efficient use of fertilizer; and (c) the provision of extensive
                         training on rice production methodologies by District Agriculture and Forestry Office extension officers and junior consultants. Ongoing installation of seed storage units, and cold

                         production yields and thus farmer incomes.

                         The project has savings of about US$303,000 and an extension is under consideration to use those funds for additional seed production activities to farmers who have suffered from

                         flood damages, which were caused by two typhoons that struck the project provinces in the summer of 2011, including some repeat seed producers who lost their seed production
                         during 2011 wet season. The proposed extension by six months would allow ample time for delivery of improved seed and training benefits to the farmers impacted by the floods.
