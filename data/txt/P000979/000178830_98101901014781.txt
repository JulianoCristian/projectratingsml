BISSAU PORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Guinea-Bissau is a small (36,125 km2) wedge of land fringed with
islands, between Senegal and Guinea-Conakry. Its population is about 810,000
(1982 estimate) of which some 100,000 live in Bissau. During the 1970-79
decade the population grew at a rate of 2.1% per annum. The language of the
country is Portuguese and the currency, the Guinean Peso, is non-convertible.
An important geographic feature of the country is the deep penetration of
seven navigable estuary complexes in the western and southwestern part of the
country.  The rest of the country is flat to undulating.
1.02     With a per capita GDP of about US$170 (1979 estimate), Guinea-Bissau
is -the seventh poorest country in the world and the third poorest in Africa.
GDP growth in the past five years was 3% per annum, but this figure must be
qualified as most of the increase was attributable to increasing foreign aid
for domestic consumption. Actually, the development of domestic production
was negligible: the output of rice and staple food, employing 90% of the work
force, was constant. The primary sector depends on the Government for inputs
and product marketing.
1.03     The Government's main priority is food self-sufficiency.  However,
the country suffers from its erratic sahelian climate and from inadequate
communications between agricultural production and demand areas. It has an
important fishing potential, sizeable forestry resources, both hardly ex-
ploited, and identified mineral resources, (oil, bauxite reserves, and phos-
phate). Still, economic development prospects for the next decade are
limited.
1.04     Transportation is particularly important because: (a) the country's
economy is highly dependent on imports and on international food aid which
must be dispatched to local consumption centers, (b) rice and vegetables are
grown in the south and groundnuts in the north, with significant interregional
movements required. It is also unusually difficult, due to the large numbers
of rivers and estuaries.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
2.01     Most domestic and international traffic flows through the city of
Bissau and its harbor terminal (Map IBRD 16156), although minor quantities are
transported by land to and from bordering Senegal. River transport is very
important, accounting in 1979 for 52% of tonnage, mainly in the south, while
road transport accounted for the remaining 48% predominantly in the north and
east. Again, both these networks center on Bissau. Except for international
passenger traffic, air transport is negligible. The distribution among modes
of transport is appropriate, given Guinea Bissau's current state of develop-
ment.
Road System
2.02     Guinea-Bissau is road transport infrastructure is adequate although
rundown. It comprises 2,240 km of road, of which 427 km are paved. The
density of the road network (0.064 km/k,2) is comparable with the figure for
other African countries with a similar level of development. The extent and
localization of the roads is adequate, but their maintenance is insufficient.
2.03     The organization of the road network depends on regional geographical
characteristics. In the north and east of the country, it comprises trunk
roads with traffic limited to 30 vehicLes per day, and feeder roads for local
utilization. In the south and west the roads serve mainly as feeders to the
river ports, and bear very little traffic (less than 10 vehicles per day).
2.04     The first priority in the road sector is the rehabilitation of the
existing network and the reorganization of the currently inadequate ferry boat
system.  This is being addressed under the First Highway project, and will be
continued under the Second Highway project under preparation; the ramps for
the main ferries will be rehabilitated under the proposed project (para.
4.05).
2.05     Road traffic radiates to and from Bissau.  Estimates for road trans-
portation in 1979 indicate that total -tonnage transported was about 35,000
tons of which 82% were to or from Bissau. In 1978, the fleet of registered
motor vehicles numbered approximately 1,600 light vehicles, 550 trucks and
less than 100 buses, most of them belonging to the public sector. The esti-
mated traffic figures indicate that except on the main east-west route
(Bissau-Bafata-Guinean border) where the traffic is 40 to 100 vehicles per
day, the roads carry only 10 to 30 veh:Lcles per day. There is little scope
for an important increase in road transport activity over the next decade.
Road transportation efficiency can be :Lmproved, however, by allowing private
trucking to develop and compete with the public sector on a fair basis (paras.
2.11, 2.17, 2.18, and Action Plan for Sector Institution Building, Annex 1).
Coastal and River Transport
2.06     Coastal shipping and river navigation traditionally play an important
role in transportation, since 85% of the population lives near a navigable



- 3 -
waterway, and distances on the major domestic trade routes are frequently
shorter by river than by road. Total river and coastal traffic represented
about 39,000 t in 1979, of which two-thirds were agricultural products.
2.07     There are about 17 coastal or river ports regularly served by barges
(Annex 3). Bissau port as well as most of the other coastal and river ports
are in poor shape because of inadequate maintenance provided by the Junta
Autonoma dos Portos da Guin6-Bissau (JAPG). The proposed project includes
rehabilitation of four ports, mainly in the south (para. 4.05). These ports
play a major role in marketing of agricultural inputs, in supplying Bissau
wi-th staple food from the south, and in supplying the provinces with products
sent from Bissau.
2.08     River transport also plays an important role in passenger traffic.
It is the only reliable means of transportation in the southern part of the
country during the rainy season, when most of the roads are impassable.
Air Transportation
2.09     Guinea-Bissau has 17 landing strips, in addition to Bissalanca inter-
national airport in Bissau, of which only ten are well-maintained. Domestic
traffic, 8,000 arrivals and depatures in 1979, is not expected to expand in
the future. International traffic uses Bissalanca airport, which has a 2,800m
runway and necessary support facilities. International traffic registered
28,000 arrivals and departures in 1979.
2.10     Guinea-Bissau has a national airline, Linheas Aereas de Guine-Bissau
(LIA), which carries all domestic traffic but less than 25% of international
traffic. The development of the national company is impeded by maintenance
and telecommunications problems.
B. Transport Institutions
2.11     Difficulties have arisen both in the delivery of international food
relief and in the transportation of agricultural products between the north
and south. The causes lie in the weakness of the Ministry of Transport and
Tourism (MTT) which is responsible for planning and coordinating transport,
and in the lack of a private transport industry which might compete with
existing state trading companies currently having a monopoly on virtually all
aspects of transportation. The proposed project addresses these issues
(paras. 2.14, 2.17, 2.18 and Annex 1).
MTT
2.12     MTT currently exercises little control over the transport sector.  It
charges no taxes on river transport, exerts virtually no control over state
transport companies and has produced no national plan for transport. Nor is
there much coordination with the Ministry of Public Works for road planning
and construction.



- 4 -
2.13     KTT's organizational problems are compounded by its extremely weak
staff. The current work force numbers less than 40 employees, few of which
have professional experience or training.
2.14     The Action Plan for Sector Institution Building (Annex 1) calls for
preparation of a new charter for MTT, which would strengthen its role in: (i)
transportation planning and coordination; (ii) transport industry regulation;
and (iii) control over state firms, through creation of two departments by
June 30, 1984, to be responsible for these general areas. The proposed project
provides technical assistance for both new departments, and requires the
appointment of counterparts for each by June 30, 1984. Agreement was reached
with the Government during negotiations that it will carry out the above
steps, according to the time table set in Annex 1, para. 4.
Taxation
2.15     Road user taxes cover only about 152% of road infrastructure mainte-
nance cost, and distort competition in favor of road transport and the public
sector. An agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations that
it will, prior to June 30, 1984, improve the taxation system by undertaking a
study on the adequate level of taxation, to cover road costs. Conclusions of
the study should be discussed with the Association, and will be followed up
under the Second Highway Project under preparation. The Government confirmed
during negotiations that vehicle imports for public firms were now submitted
to the same import tax as private vehicles. It was also confirmed that diesel
oil is now submitted to a GP 6 per liter tax.
Transport Association
2.16     One of the impediments to the development of a cadre of private
transport entrepreneurs is the current restriction on access to foreign ex-
change needed to purchase fuel and spare parts. The Action Plan for Sector
Institution Building calls for the establishment of a transport association,
under the control of MTT, to advise the Government and maintain a dialogue on
transport regulation and policy, and facilitate individual transport opera-
tors' access to foreign exchange. This institution would include representa-
tives of the Government, as well as of public and private transport operators
(Annex 1, para. 5). An agreement was reached with the Government during
negotiations that it will issue a decree creating a transport association by
June 30, 1984.
C.  The Transport Companies
2.17     River and road transportation are presently subsidiary activities of
the two public trading companies, Armazens do Povo and SOCOMI. These companies
share a monopoly on the importation and distribution of consumer goods and
agricultural inputs and the collection of agricultural products in the vil-
lage. They provide road and river transportation for all imported and ex-
ported products and are de facto the only transporter for private commodities.
The two trading companies own most of the existing transport means and have a
monopoly on the operation of scheduled inter-city connections. Both companies



- 5 -
have major management and operation problems with only a 40% rate of availabi-
lity of equipment and a 20% rate of capacity utilization. The service they
provide is poor and expensive, and is one of the limiting factors for the
development of fruit and vegetable production in the south.
2.18     The Action Plan for Sector Institution Building (Annex 1) includes a
provision for removing from the public trading companies responsibility for
transport and creating instead a new national transport company. The goal
would be to give producers a choice between this company and independent
transporters. The Government has agreed in principle to the plan. A study
for this reorganization is currently being financed by AfDB and is scheduled
for completion by March 1983. Initially, the new company will need technical
assistance for its organization and operation. The proposed project will
finance five experts in key positions: Director General, Director of Road
Transport, Director of River Transport, Director of Finance, each for three
years, and Administration Director (for two years), as well as training for
their counterparts (Annex 1, para. 6). Disbursement on this component of the
proposed project will be subjected to the Government presenting an organiza-
tion plan for the new company acceptable to the Association.
2.19     There are two other national transportation companies, both reasona-
bly well run. River passenger transportation is provided by a national river
transport company, GUINEMAR, which recently received four new Finnish boats.
Road passenger transportation is provided by a national bus company, SILO
DIATA, which is fairly reliable during the dry season, and competes with
private taxis.
D. IDA Involvement in the Sector
2.20     IDA strategy in Guinea-Bissau is mainly to help create the conditions
necessary for long-term agricultural development. In the realm of transport,
this involves improving sector planning, cost recovery and taxation systems,
maintaining the present balance between road and river transport, improving
the efficacy and cost effectiveness of domestic transport, of Bissau port, and
of river ports and keeping the existing international port in operation.
IDA's first road project financed 614 km of priority road rehabilitation,
created road maintenance brigades, and provided equipment and training. A
second road project under preparation would address road maintenance cost
recovery, rehabilitation and reorganization of the national ferry system, and
rehabilitation of 500 km of roads. The proposed project would complement the
road projects by building up MTT planning and coordination capacity, reorga-
nizing the river and road transportation industry, rehabilitating major river
ports and reconstructing the international port at Bissau.
III. THE PORT SUBSECTOR
A. Statute and Organization
3.01     JAPG is currently under the tutelage of the MTT.  It is operating as
a de facto entity, without legal statute or internal organization. The



- 6 -
proposed project will provide JAPG with modern organization and management
systems. During project appraisal, it was agreed with the Government that
JAPG's statute should be updated and that it should be given managerial and
financial autonomy. The draft of a new statute and by-laws, prepared by
consultants financed under a Project Preparation Facility, in consultation
with the Association, is acceptable to the Association.
3.02     JAPG is in charge of Bissau port, the only deep-water port in the
country, as well as some twenty river ports. It is responsible for all port
operations, cargo handling, equipment and infrastructure maintenance and
repair, and investment for port facilities. Futher information on Bissau port
and river ports is given in Annex 3.
3-03     JAPG's organization chart is given in Annex 4.  Port operations are
run in an informal and inefficient manner.  Staff are not trained for their
jobs and there is virtually no management information system. As a result,
problems abound. Port and cargo operations are not tightly controlled; ship
movement is not clearly separated from cargo handling. Due to an acute short-
age of qualified staff, personnel administration, finances, and supplies and
store control are insufficiently developed, and technical studies, as well as
maintenance are non-existent. An agreement was reached with the Government
and JAPG during negotiations that a new organization for JAPG will be prepared
by June 30, 1985, in consultation with the Association, with the assistance of
experts financed under the proposed project.
3.04     The national shortage of manager-Lal and technical talents cannot be
resolved in the short-run. However, the -port's technical and managerial
problems must be resolved without delay. Therefore, the Government has pre-
pared a plan to improve the situation in the short run, and prepare a progres-
sive take-over by nationals, after adequa-te training. The plan calls for the
appointment of five expatriates to the key positions of Director General (also
in charge of port operations), Director of Finance, Director of Cargo Handling
and Storage, Director of Workshops, and Administrative Director. These ex-
perts will be appointed under contracts assigning them management objectives.
During their first year, they will be fulLy in charge of managing the port and
designing its new organization and management system, while national counter-
parts are trained abroad. At the end of *the first year, the counterparts will
return and receive complementary on-the-job training from the expatriates. In
a second stage, the counterparts will be appointed to the positions of Direc-
tors, and the expatriates will remain for an additional year as advisors. The
proposed project would finance three years of technical assistance for the
corresponding experts (two years for the expert in Administration) and train-
ing abroad for the national counterparts -by October 31,1984, as detailed in
the Action Plan for JAPG's Reorganization agreed upon during negotitions
(Annex 2). The nomination of counterparts acceptable to the Association is a
condition of disbursement on this componeint. As a result of training, tech-
nical assistance, and JAPG's reorganization, the port productivity should
increase significantly. Improvement in this respect will be monitored through
a set of productivity indicators agreed upon with JAPG, and defined as fol-
lows: ship waiting time should decline to close to zero by FY1987; tonnage per
day should be 200t in FY1985, up to 280 in FY1986, and 550 in FY1987; tonnage
per gang-hour should be 3.5 in FY1985; 5 in FY1986, and 7 tons in FY1987;



- 7 -
average staying time of merchandise in port should be less than 15 days in
FY1985, and less than 12 days from FY1986 onward; and the availability rate of
cargo handling equipment should be at least 50% in FY1985, 60% in FY1986, and
70% in FY1987.
B. Management Information System
3.05     There is no personnel management system or systematic statistical
data collection for port operations and cargo handling. The accounting system
is on a cash basis without asset inventory, so it cannot be used for calcul-
ating the cost of operations or for preparing a budget or corporate plan. It
is also not suitable for external auditing.
3.06     The experts provided under the proposed project will also be respon-
sible for designing and implementing management information systems needed in
their sectors of activity. JAPG should establish a complete, but simple,
management information system, as follows:
(a)   a commercial accounting system, to be effective starting
January 1, 1985, and to be audited annually by independent
auditors on terms acceptable to the Association, starting
FY1985. The proposed project would finance the foreign cur-
rency component of auditing for the first four years of the
project;
(b)   a statistical system for port operations and cargo handling,
based on UNCTAD recommendations, to be effective starting
September 30, 1985;
(c)   a system for personnel administration, supplies and store
control, to be effective starting September 30, 1985;
(d)   a cost accounting and budgeting system starting FY1985; and
(e)   a three-year corporate plan including manpower, investment, and
financial plans, to be updated and agreed upon with the Asso-
ciation annually, from January 1, 1985 onward.
For the implementation of points (a) to (e) above, JAPG will receive techni-
cal assistance financed under the proposed project (para. 3.05 and Annex 2,
para. 4).
C. Staffing and Training
3.07     Considering the low level of total annual traffic (about 120,000t),
JAPG is overstaffed. Its work force is approximately 535 permanent employees
(40 in the administrative sector, 430 for port operations and cargo handling
and 65 for maintenance), plus about 500 temporary workers. Most staff are not
qualified for their jobs; there are no engineers or managers with graduate



- 8 -
level degrees. Productivity is low and staffing costs are unacceptably high,
making JAPG financially non-viable (para. 7.04).
3.G0     Port productivity, as measured by tonnage per employee, is as low as
84t per annum. Under present conditions, it could be raised to at least 124t,
and even more after the completion of the project. The number of employees
and workers should thus be reduced to a total of about 700. This reduction
could, however, raise major social problems in view of the unemployment situa-
tion in Bissau. On the other hand, the presence of redundant labor force has
a negative effect on staff motivation and productivity. Hence, the Government
should transfer redundant staff (about 300) to other Government controlled
institutions where they could be used more efficiently. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that JAPG will present by January 1, 1985 a staff reduc-
tion plan acceptable to the Association, and implement it by December 31,
1985.
3.09     Training, both formal and on-the-job, will be needed for all levels
of JAPG's employees. A formal training program was set up with MTT during
project appraisal, comprising:
(a)   For higher level national staff listed in para. 3.05: one year
formal training abroad for the future Director General and
Director of Port Operations, the Director of Finance, the
Director of Cargo Handling and Storage, and the Director of
Workshops; and two years on-the-job training for the above four
plus the Director of Administration, all working with experts
to be financed under the proposed project. Foreign costs would
be financed under the proposed project (Annex 2, para. 5).
(b)   For intermediate level staff: an electrician, a mechanic and an
accountant have been sent by the Government to Portugal for two
years, an engineer to Cuba, an accountant to East Germany, and
an additional mechanic to Brazil for six months. It was con-
firmed during negotiations that they will be appointed to
positions in JAPG when they return by the end of 1983 (Annex 2,
para. 5). Additional intermediate level staff will be re-
cruited, as needed, after graduation from Bissau vocational
school.
(c)   For laborers: a modular training program will be set up in JAPG
by consultants to be financed under the proposed project to
particularly address cargo handling, storage, workshop special-
ties, and clerical work (Annex 2, para. 5).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Port Development Program
4.01     Studies for the construction of e new port at Bissau were performed
in 1977 by an Italian consulting firm under Kuwait Fund financing. At the
Government's request, the Association reviewed the consultants' proposals and



- 9 -
advised Guinea-Bissau that the construction of a new port was not justified by
foreseeable traffic levels. The Association suggested that: (a) the rehabili-
tation and expansion of the existing port facilities was preferable; and (b) a
feasibility study for a more modest project, including economic justification,
financial analysis and project design was needed. The Government agreed. In
November 1980 the Association approved a US$800,000 advance from the Project
Preparation Facility under which Consultants (NEDECO) were retained to perform
this feasibility study. Their main recommendation was the construction of a
new 260m general cargo berth estimated to cost about $28 million, rehabili-
tation of the existing commercial berth and four river ports, and provision of
cargo handling equipment and navigation aids.
4.02      The project was appraised in February 1982 by the Association, as
well as by the Kuwait Fund and BADEA. It was agreed during appraisal that the
Arab donors would jointly finance the 250 meter berth and the cargo handling
equipment. Later, the Association advised the Government that scaling down
the size of the general cargo berth to 130m would reduce its cost to about
US$21 million and consequently result in a higher rate of return on this
component. Nevertheless, the Government and the Arab donors decided to pro-
ceed with the 260m berth as designed by the consultants. It was then agreed
that the overall project would be considered a two-part Port Development
Program. Part A would include the rehabilitation of the existing commercial
berth, four river ports and four ferry ramps, the provision of navigation
aids, and institutional support to the MTT and JAPG through technical assist-
ance for organization, planning, management, port operations and training.
Part B would be the construction of a new 260m deep-water berth for general
cargo, and the provision of cargo-handling equipment. The consultants pre-
pared tender documents for civil works for both Parts A and B. Contractors
for civil works were prequalified in August 1982 in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines. Part A is estimated to cost US$16.4 million equivalent and Part B
about US$32.5 million equivalent. Part A will be financed by the Association
and Part B jointly by the Kuwait Fund (US$10.0 million), BADEA (US$10.0 mil-
lion), the Saudi Fund (US$8.5 million) and the OPEC Special Fund (US$3.0
mi llion).  The proposed project is for Part A of the Development Program and
for supervision of the construction of the new berth under Part B; however,
the total cost of the Program as a whole has been taken into account in asses-
sing JAPG's future financial position. The financing plan for the Development
Program would be as follows:

B. Project CObjectives
4.03     The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)   to increase the efficiency of port operations and management by
providing technical assistance and training to JAPG;
(b)   to improve MTT's ability in transport sector planning and in
supervising state transport companies by providing technical
assistance and training;
(c)   to establish an autonomous transport company to improve access
to rural areas by providing technical assistance and training;
(d)   to alleviate the acute shortage of housing for technical assis-
tance and training experts by constructing an apartment build-
ing;
(e)   to ensure the ability of Bissau port to continue handlin
traffic by rehabilitating its rapidly deteriorating 5m J deep
commercial berth and providing necessary navigation aids; and
(f)   to ensure the efficiency of handling river traffic by rehabili-
tating four river ports and providing river navigation aids.
4.04     The project components have been prepared on the basis of detailed
analysis of existing facilities and operations and immediate future require-
ments. The proposed technical assistance and training programs, together with
the rehabilitated facilities, will increase the efficiency of port operations.
The existing 5m deep berth will be used mainly for fishing and coastal traffic
whereas the new deep-water berth (Part B of the Development Program) will be
used for general cargo traffic.
C. Project Description
4.05     The proposed project includes:
(a)   technical assistance to JAPG for project preparation, supervi-
sion of the investment program (207 man-months), technical
assistance for port operations and management (168 man-months),
(Annex 2, para. 4);
(b)   technical assistance for organizing JAPG's training program for
workers (7 man-months), (Annex 2, para. 5);

and Cadique;
(i)   rehabilitation of four ferry ramps at Enxude, Sao Vincente,
Farim, and Joao Landim; and
(j)   provision of navigation aids, including a buoyage vessel.
Details of technical assistance and training to JAPG are given in Annex 2,
paras. 4 and 5, and details of technical assistance and training in the sector
and to MTT are given in Annex 1, paras. 4 and 6. Details of civil works are
in the project file.
4.06     During appraisal, project components were discussed and agreed upon
with the Government. This was confirmed during negotiations.
D. Project Cost Estimate
4.07     The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.36 million equi-
valent of which US$16.00 million (92%) is in foreign currency. Project cost
estimate is given below.

- 13 -
4.08     During appraisal, the above cost estimate was discussed and agreed
upon with the Government. It was confirmed during negotiations.
4.09     The project as proposed is the least cost solution.  Cost estimates
for civil works and equipment reflect June 1983 prices and are based on inter-
national prices for similar works and equipment as well as recently executed
projects in West Africa. No customs duties will be levied on imported mate-
rials or equipment; this was confirmed during negotiations. Estimates for
technical assistance are based on an average of US$8,000 per man-month.
Physical contingencies are 10% on civil works and 5% on navigation aids.
Price contingencies are: (a) 12% annually on local expenditure; and (b) 8%,
7.5%, 7%, 6% and 6% for 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 respectively on fo-
reign expenditure.
E. Project Financing and Disbursement
4.10      IDA's contribution of US$16.00 million equivalent will cover the
foreign exchange cost of the proposed project (92%) of which US$11 million
will be relent to JAPG (para. 7.15). Local contribution of US$1.36 million
equivalent will cover the local cost (8%) of which US$0.69 million will be
covered by JAPG's own funds in its separate accounts, and included in its
financial plan, and US$0.67 by MTT's budget. An agreement was reached with
the Government during negotiations that MTT's budget will comprise the corres-
ponding funds under a separate budget item.
4.11     Disbursement of funds from the Credit will be fully documented and
made as follows:
(a)   94% of total expenditures for civil works (US$7.7 million
equivalent);
(b)   100% of total expenditures for navigation aids (US$2.8 million
equivalent);
(c)   88% of total expenditures for supervision and technical assist-
ance (US$4.6 million equivalent); and
(d)   amounts due under the Project Preparation Facility.
4.12     Disbursement on the following items will be subject to preliminary
fulfillment of specific conditions: (a) technical assistance and training to
the new national transport company (para. 2.18) will be subject to the Asso-
ciation's agreement on the organization scheme to be prepared by the Govern-
ment not later than December 31, 1984, and on the appointment of suitable
counterparts and conditions for training by June 30, 1984; and (b) technical
assistance and training in JAPG will be subject to the appointment of counter-
parts acceptable to the Association (para. 3.05).
4.13     An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 1.  The
proposed schedule differs slightly from the profile for past port projects in



- 14 -
West Africa mainly because an advance payment of 20% of civil works' cost
will be paid to the contractor upon contract signature.
F. Project Implementation
4.14     The project was prepared by the consultants NEDECO (Netherlands)
financed by an advance of US$800,000 from the Project Preparation Facility.
Final tender documents have been prepared by the consultants, and agreed upon
by the Association. Tendering is scheduled for May 1983.
4.15     JAPG is responsible for project implementation, except as regards
technical assistance for MTT and provision of navigation aids, for which MTT
will be the implementing agency. Agreement was reached during negotiations
that all civil works construction and equipment procurerent under the project
will be supervised by independent consultants acceptable to the Association,
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. The Government
intends to have the consultants report to a Project Management Unit chaired by
the Minister of Transport and Tourism and composed of the Directors General of
the Ministries of Transport and Tourist, Public Works, and Economy and Fi-
nance, the State Secretariat for Planning and International Cooperation, and
the Director General of JAPG.
4.16     All civil works included in the project will be awarded to the same
contractor under international competitive bidding. Bidding procedures and
contract award will be in accordance with the Association's Guidelines for
Procurement. This was confirmed during negotiations.
4.17     Construction is expected to start in early 1984 and be completed by
late 1987. The critical path program for project implementation has been
discussed with the Government during negotiations. Barring any unforeseen
difficulty, the project implementation schedule would be as shown in Annex 5.
4.18     The Association will help the Government prepare terms of reference
for consultants for technical assistance and training provided under the
project (paras. 2.14, 2.18, 3.05, 3.07, 3.10 and 4.15). Agreement was reached
during negotiations that JAPG will employ on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Association: (i) an expert in port operations and management for three
years; (ii) an expert in port administration and statistics for two years;
(iii) an expert in port finance and costing for three years; (iv) an expert in
cargo handling for three years; and (v) an expert in maintenance and workshops
for three years.
G. Impact on Environment and Employment
4.19     No significant environmental impact is expected in the city of Bissau
or adjacent water areas as a result of the project since all proposed improve-
ments are confined to changes in existing facilities that have operated in the
same location for several years.



- 15 -
4.20     Some 300 skilled and unskilled workers will be required during the
implementation of the civil works. Training will improve skills and enhance
job satisfaction of about 400 shore-handling labor and stevedores and of
management, operating and accounting staff. The transfer of some 300 em-
ployees and workers from JAPG to other Government controlled activities (para.
3.09) does not result from the project itself, but from the necessity to
improve port management and conditions of operations.
V. TRAFFIC
A. Introduction
5.01     Most of the components of the proposed project deal with domestic
river traffic (navigation aids, river ports and rehabilitation of the old
commercial quay for domestic traffic). Only the signalization of the channel
is related to international traffic. Therefore, separate traffic projections
were prepared for domestic and international traffic.
5.02     To address the past decline in agriculture the Government has pre-
pared a stabilization program and is preparing a Four-Year Economic Develop-
ment Plan (1983-1987). The plan focusses on rural development, and action is
being taken to encourage production through economic incentives, improved
marketing facilities, and privatization of distribution channels. In view of
the acute shortage of qualified local staff and the weak institutional frame-
work, economic recovery will be slow and the country's economy, largely domi-
nated by agriculture, will remain sensitive to erratic climatic conditions.
However, future overall development in agriculture is not likely to drastic-
ally affect total international trade, as strong growth would stimulate ex-
ports and limit rice imports, while slow growth would limit exports and sti-
mulate rice imports. Still, domestic traffic will be strongly affected by
agricultural sector growth.
B. River Traffic
5.03     River and road transport are largely complementary modes (para. 2.03
and 2.06), roads being predominant in the North and river transport in the
South and with the islands. Most of the country's rice-growing potential is
located in the South, in the Tombali region. Hence, future river traffic will
depend closely on the performance of agriculture in this region, both for
exports to Bissau, and imports of consumer and intermediate products purchased
w:Lth export-generated income.
5.04     Almost all traffic is between Bissau port and the country's 17 river
ports. River traffic declined from about 60,000 t in 1975 to about 25,000 t
in 1979. Since then, it has increased to 47,000 t in 1981. This trend re-
f:Lects the decrease in staple food production in recent years,1/ and the
offsetting effect in 1981 of rice shipments offered by foreign aid, following
the exceptionally poor crop of 1980. Actual and forecast coastal traffic are
given in Tables 3 and 4 and summarized below.

54.8         35.4    32  38       45
5.05     Above traffic forecasts assume a continued slight decrease in traffic
during the 1982-1985 period. A modest growth estimated at about 4% p.a. is
expected after 1985 as a result of the development of traffic with the islands
and the rice growing areas of southern Tombali where little road competition
will take place, and taking into consideration that roads will successfully
compete with river transport in the North, in the Rio Cacheu, and in the rio
Geba regions. There may be also some occasional increase in barge traffic
resulting from possible food relief programs.
C. International Traffic
5.06     The chronic balance of payments deficit has limited the country's
import capacity. Inflationary pressures, currency overvaluation and export
controls have stimulated the growth of parallel markets with neighboring
countries and consequently the decline of official exports of agricultural
products, mainly groundnuts.
5.07      International general cargo traffic2/ through Bissau port increased
only 2% p.a. between 1975 and 1981 when it reached a total of 87,000 tons.
The growth was mainly due to cereal imports resulting from a decline in rice
production during the 1977-1981 period. Exports, mainly groundnuts, however,
decreased due to the 1978-1981 drought and the breakdown of the Government-
controlled marketing system.
5.08     Actual and forecast traffic are detailed in Table 2 and summarized
below.
1/ Paddy production amounted only to 25,000 tons in 1980 as opposed to
101,000 t in 1975 and 108,000 t in 1976.
2/ Oil imports, 25,000t in 1981, are handled at a buoy-berth located
outside the port area.

5.(9     The above forecast is based on the following assumptions:
(a)   Agricultural production will increase slowly; during the 1983-
1990 period the increase will be felt mainly in export crop
production (groundnuts and palm kernels), where the production
capacity already exists. From 1990 onward, the increase will
shift to the staple food producing sector (mainly rice), while
the increase in the exporting sector will be smaller, as a
result of the Government's self-sufficiency policy;
(b)   Cement imports will increase significantly and reach 16,000 t
by 1990, equivalent to 18 kg/inhabitant, a realistic figure for
a rural West African country with a per capita GDP of about
US$200;
(c)   Fish exports will increase to 4,000 t in 1990, but will remain
very small compared to the fishing potential of 300,000 t per
year, due to the weak incentives for the fishing companies to
export in significant quantities: total catch landed is ex-
pected to increase only up to 8,000 t in 1990;
(d)   Timber and wood products exports will increase up to about
10,000 t in 1990, a very conservative figure, much below the
potential of the country; and
(e)   Potential bauxite, petroleum and phosphate exports are dis-
regarded as presently too uncertain to be included in the
forecasts.

VI. ECONOMIIC EVALUATION
6.01     The proposed project includes three components which can be subjected
to economic evaluation: the rehabilitation of the existing commercial berth,
the rehabilitation of four river ports, and the improvement of navigation
aids. The benefits of these three components will accrue from: (i) improved
river transportation; (ii) safer movement for international traffic; and (iii)
improved productivity and capacity for the fishing industry. All three compo-
nents are closely interdependent. Therefore the economic evaluation has been
made for the complete system, without trying to artificially separate the
components.
A. River Transport
Benefits attributable to specific components
6.02     The turnaround time of barges will be improved by (i) the avail-
ability of part of the rehabilitated commercial quay for river traffic; (ii)
the improvement of loading/unloading conditions in the river ports, with safer
cargo handling; and (iii) by improved navigation conditions in the rivers.
6.03     The rehabilitation will make it possible to raise domestic cargo
handling productivity in Bissau from 80t/day to lOOt/day by providing access
regardless of tidal conditions (Bolola quay is currently accessible only at
high tide). Barge waiting time for berthing will also be reduced. The cor-
responding time savings for barge operations, with a load of 18t from Bissau,
and 90t to Bissau, will be 0.22 days through improved productivity, and 0.3
days through reduced barge waiting time, for a total savings of US$172 per
trip, or approximately US$1.6 per ton, for total river traffic to and from
Bissau.
6.04     The rehabilitation of the four river ports, three of them in the
Tombali region, will improve cargo handling conditions in these ports where
products are presently loaded/unloaded manually from barges to canoes and from
the canoes to shore. Productivity increases attributable to the direct berth-
age of barges to the quay and utilization of cargo handling equipment is
estimated as at least 10 tons/day (from 40t/day to 50t/day), allowing a time
savings per trip of 0.6 days. Barge waiting time will be reduced at some of
the river ports where the old infrastructure has completely collapsed and
canoes can presently land only at high tide. The corresponding time saving
will be 0.4 days per trip. Altogether, the reconstruction of the four river
ports will allow a one-day reduction in turnaround time, or US$330 per trip,
or US$3.05 per ton of traffic to and from the Tombali region. In addition,
improved berthing conditions in the river ports will reduce cargo losses due
to mishandling by at least 2%. The average value of cargo being approximately
US$600 per ton, the corresponding benefit will be US$12 per ton.
6.05     The improvement of navigation aids in estuaries will permit an aver-
age daily increase in sailing time froma seven hours to about ten hours, as a
result of better marking of the channeLs at low tide. The resulting savings



- 19 -
on an average trip of about 370 km at a speed of 10 km/h will be 1.4 days per
round trip, or US$4.28 per ton of total river traffic.
Benefits common to several components
6.06     After completion of the project the cost of river transport, in-
cluding US$13 per ton for cargo handling charges but excluding cargo losses,
will be about US$42.9 per ton, as compared to a trucking cost per ton, in-
cluding US$12 per ton for ferry and handling, of about US$56.4.
6.07     The US$ 13.5 cost difference can be further broken down as US$8.9 per
ton of cost savings on river transport described in
paras. 6.02-6.05 and already taken into consideration, and US$ 4.6 per ton of
benefit corresponding to the present economic cost difference between road and
river transports to and from the Tombali region, which cannot be attributed to
a specific component of the project. The US$13.5 cost difference in favor of
river transport will prevent the diversion of part of the Tombali region
traffic to the road, as indicated in the table below:

6 ,. 08  The proposed improvement in the waterway system will help to avoid
the construction of about 30 km of laterite roads, at a unit cost of about
US$20,000/km, for connecting villages in the Tombali region to the major trunk
roads, and associated recurrent costs for routine maintenance (about US$1000/
kmn/year) and periodic maintenance (about US$4000 per kilometer every 5 years).
6.09     The benefits of the river transport component of the projects are
summarized in Table 5. They will remain entirely in Guinea Bissau. The cost
of this component of the project includes the purchase cost and the operating
cost of the buoyage vessel. As this craft will be used 50% of the time for
hydrographic studies, only 50% of its cost was taken into consideration in the
cost-benefit analysis. The cost of the navigation aids has been included for
its total of US$1.06 million.
B. International Traffic
6.10     The marking of the Geba River Channel will eliminate the average six
hour delay when an ocean going vessel enters the Channel or leaves the port.
With the actual ship time cost of US$9,400 per day (average of ship costs in
port and at sea), ship-waiting cost savings will reach US$273,000 in 1986 and
increase to US$364,000 in 2000. Savings will be recovered by Guinea Bissau as
most vessels calling in Bissau are tramp steamers transporting imports. The



- 20 -
benefit will accrue to JAPG through increases in port charges on ships (paras.
7.19 and 7.20).
6.11      If the proposed US$3.4 million rehabilitation of the existing commer-
cial quay is not carried out, the old structure will most likely collapse
within a few years. The debris would create a major hindrance and unaccept-
able risks for the port. To avoid this risk for ocean-going vessels, it will
be necessary for the government to either remove the debris after the collapse
at an estimated cost of US$5.0 million, or more economically, prevent the
collapse of the structure at a minimum cost of US$2.8 million to be spent most
likely in 1986. Hence, the economic choice is either to invest US$3.4 million
in 1985, and have a quay usable for domestic and fishing traffic, or to invest
about US$2.8 million in 1986 for minimal strengthening of an unusable quay.
The US$3.4 million investment allows the avoidance of a US$2.8 million invest-
ment which is therefore a cost-avoidance) benefit for the project.
C. Fishing
6.12      Rehabilitating the commercial berth and partly allocating it to the
fishing fleet will result in reducing the time needed in port by trawlers for
fish landing, clearing the hatches, supplying ice, bunkering, and routine boat
maintenance. The estimated decrease is about one day per trip (from four to
three days in harbor), thus reducing the number of trawlers necessary for
catching a given tonnage of fish. As the necessary number of trawlers will be
reduced, the corresponding economic cos-t will be lesser and the profit of the
fishing industry will be higher. This :Lncrease in the profit of fishing
companies, for catch up to the capacity of the existing quay, is a benefit of
the project. The berthing capacity constraint of the existing infrastructure,
with a 0.75 occupancy rate, limits catch to a maximum of 5000 t of fish landed
annually. Without berthing capacity constraints, catch landed in Bissau can
be reasonably expected to increase up to about 6000t in 1987, and 8,000t in
1990 and after. At this level, catch landed would represent only 2.6% of
fishing potential and about 8% of catch in Guinean waters. The allocation of
the old commercial berth to fishing will remove a capacity constraint from
1987 onward. The corresponding benefits for the fishing companies will be,
from 1987 onward, the profit increase resulting from the difference between
profit with catch limited to 5000t (with three days spent in harbor), and the
profit with a catch increasing to 8,000t in 1990 and thereafter (also with
three days spent in harbor).
6.13      Since existing fishing companies are joint ventures between Guinea
Bissau and foreign partners, it was assumed that 70% of the benefits will be
transfered abroad, and therefore, only 30% will accrue to Guinea Bissau.
6.14      The extension of fish landing potential from 5,000t to 8,000t, which
corresponds to the estimated potential demand of the market, (50% of the catch
being exported) will increase the level of activity of Bissau's fish process-
ing plant for shrimp, demersale species exported to Europe, and other demer-
sale species. The pre-tax profit margin of the fish processing plant is about
US$1,210 per ton for frozen shrimp, US$268 per ton for demersale species
exported to Europe, and US$199 for other demersale species. On this basis, the



- 21 -
economic benefit from additional catch being processed in Bissau is the in-
crease in the pre-tax profit of the processing plant. This firm is also a
joint venture with foreign partners, so it was assumed that only 30% of the
profit from fish processing will remain in Guinea-Bissau.
D. Rates of Return
6.15     The economic rate of return of the proposed project under the pessi-
mistic assumption that only 30% of benefits from fishing and fish processing
accrue to Guinea-Bissau, is a satisfactory 21%. The main project risks are
higher-than-expected capital investment costs, and international cargo traffic
failing to increase as forecast. With capital investment costs 15% higher
than in the base case, the economic rate of return is still an acceptable 18%;
with a zero increase in international traffic the economic rate of return is
still 21%. With both events combined, the economic rate of return of the
project drops to 18%, which is still satisfactory. Detailed calculations are
available in the project file.
VII. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Past and Present Situation
7.01     JAPG is currently being operated at a considerable loss (44% of
revenue in FY1981). One reason is its high working expenses which result
mainly from overstaffing. A second is that tariffs, while high, have not been
designed to recover all operating costs, but only cash outlays for operations,
excluding depreciation. Most funds for capital investment have been provided
as subsidies from the Government. Presently, JAPG has no ability to repay its
debts or to borrow further funds. However, thanks to the moratory agreement
between the Government and the port on debt repayment, JAPG's cash reserves
are adequate. Financial statements for the FY1977-FY1981 period are given in
Tables 6, 7 and 8 and the Summary Accounts for FY1978-81 are given below.

- 23 -
Tariffs
7.02      As of December 1982, JAPG's average tariff was about US$16 per ton,
including cargo handling costs. It is comparable to other ports in the region
(U';$15 in Conakry, US$12 in Cotonou, and US$14 in Cape Verde), but these ports
cover all their operational expenses, while in Bissau, revenues cover only
working expenditures.
7.03      The tariff structure is inadequate: (i) it overcharges international
traffic (US$16.5 per ton), undercharges local traffic (US$.01 per ton) and
does not charge fishing; and (ii) it overcharges stevedoring (US$4.6 per ton)
and undercharges ship movement and utilization of equipment (US$.63 per ton
and US$.37 per ton). This situation is due in part to the absence of commer-
cial and cost accounting, but will be amended by FY1985, when costing elements
wi:Ll be available (paras. 3.07).
Working Expenditures
7.04      JAPG's working expenditures are unusually high, amounting to about
US$9.0 per ton, as compared to about US$6.0 in comparable ports of the region.
Due to over-staffing, as much as 87% of working expenditures are staff costs,
despite a three-year salary freeze.
Borrowing Capacity
7.05      As of FY1981, JAPG is unable to service any debt, past or future,
as indicated by its low cash flow for FY1980, turning negative in FY1981
(GP 11.761 million and minus GP 3.0 million respectively). Actually, it does
not service its small GP 51 million long-term debt to the Government: arrears
amount to about GP 23.6 million, dating back to 1975, when JAPG unilaterally
interrupted repayments to the Government, and the Ministry of Finance omitted
claiming overdues. Presently, JAPG is not in a position to pay its arrears,
as they far exceed available liquidities. However, its debt leverage, as
measured by the 20/80 debt/equity ratio for FY1981, is low and indicates that
the borrowing capacity issue results from the insufficient cash flow rather
than from excessive past borrowing.
Capitalization
7.06      JAPG's fixed assets in Bissau and the secondary ports were estimated
for FY1980 on the basis of their present state and replacement value. Secon-
dary ports which represent about 2% of gross fixed assets are very run down
and have a negligible residual value. Among Bissau port's GP 1,512 million
gross fixed assets, 77% are infrastructure and buildings. Unless rehabili-
tated, about 50% of the fixed assets will be out of service and should be
entirely written off within four years. These run-down fixed assets comprise
the commercial quay, traffic area, and storage area, to be reconstructed under
JAPG's investment plan (Table 9).  However, the Navy jetty, the Bolola quay,
and workshop building, which are in good condition, were included at a net
value in excess of two-thirds of their gross value. Equipment and floating
craft, which have been replaced recently, represent about 22% of gross fixed
assets and are in good working condition.



- 24 -
7.07     Capital investment since FY1978 has amounted to GP 106 million, all
for equipment purchases, and was financed through Government subsidies. Since
JAPG generated some cash internally and interrupted the service of most of its
debt, its long-term sources of funds exceeded long-term applications by GP 29
million.
Working Capital and Liquidity
7.03     JAPG's working capital was high in FY1977 (GP 20 million or 7 months
of revenue), and has continued to increase to GP 40 million in FY1980 (9.2
months of revenue). Commercial receivables are high, amounting to 9 months of
revenue. 40% are from ministries (energ;y and fishing), and 50% from public
and para-public firms. Since in the past, JAPG received long-term funds
exceeding capital investment requirements, it was not encouraged to follow a
dynamic collection policy. The absence of a Commercial Department and the
lack of qualified staff in the Finance Department further contributed to the
accumulation of high receivables. With the future commercial accounting
system and technical assistance provided under the proposed project, this
situation should improve in the future (para. 7.13).
7.09     JAPG's cash situation is acceptable (1.8 months of revenue), but only
under the assumption that overdue long-term debt will be re-scheduled (para.
7.15)-
B. Future Situation
7.10     JAPG's financial future depends mainly on the policy to be adopted in
the future. The basic principles of this policy, to which the Government
agreed during project appraisal, should be: (a) JAPG must be a financially
self-supporting entity; (b) since the country depends closely on imports of
consumer goods, their access must be ensured under the most efficient condi-
tions but at a socially acceptable cost; and (c) JAPG must reduce its depen-
dence on subsidies, and must be able to borrow funds to finance its recons-
truction and modernization. However, in view of the exceptionally high cons-
truction cost of the new general cargo berth (para. 4.01), and the resulting
burden on JAPG, the port cannot be expected to recuperate from users the
entire cost of services, as considerable depreciation annuity would push
tariffs to levels such that traffic diversion to neighboring ports would
become a serious risk. For the same reason, JAPG cannot be expected to pro-
duce a significant rate of return on net fixed assets.
7.11     Therefore, the objectives of JAPG's financial policy will be: (a) to
maintain in the long run an acceptable cash situa-tion, although it may coexist
with a persistent negative net result on operations; (b) to keep port tariffs
at an acceptable level; and (c) to estab:lish Its borrowing capacity. Proj-
ected financial statements are given in Tables 11 to 13, in current Guinea-
Bissau Pesos.



- 25-
Cash Outlays for Port Operations
7.12      Working expenses must be reduced, to approach normal requirements for
port operation, from their $15.8 per ton level for FY1982, to less than $10.8
per ton by FY1987 at constant prices. This involves mainly reducing staff
cost per ton from its FY1982 level of US$13.5 per ton, to about US$8.7 per ton
in FY1987, at 1982 prices, which is the minimum feasible in the local context.
The above target can be achieved through staff number planning and control of
salary increases. Although a physical reduction in staff number by 300
employees/workers is necessary (para. 3.09), it is likely that JAPG will
continue to bear most of the financial cost of redundant labor force. Hence,
staff number on the payroll is likely to decrease slightly from 1,059 in
FY1982 to about 890 in FY1987. Annual salary increases are expected to be
2.5% lower than local price increases, because of strict government salary
policy. Therefore, total staff costs in current pesos will still increase by
an average of 8.3% per annum, from GP 47.755 million in FY1982, to GP 71.213
million in FY1987. To ensure that staff costs increase are consistent with
the objective of port financial viability, JAPG agreed during negotiation that
staff cost per GP of revenues will decline from GP 0.96 in FY1982 to 0.50 in
FY1984, GP 0.32 in FY1985, and 0.25 from FY1986 onward. In order to ensure
that cost reduction is not achieved at the expense of adequate maintenance of
the new port, JAPG agreed during negotiations to present to the Association
for consultation by December 31 of each year, a maintenance program, including
a inaintenance budget. The construction of the 260 meter berth instead of the
130 meter berth has no measurable effect on the cost of port operations. The
es-timated cost for maintenance of the additional 130 meters is GP 4.2 million,
or 2% of FY1987 annual revenue.
Working Capital Requirements
7.13      Working capital is presently too high, due to excessive commercial
receivables. With the establishment of a commercial accounting system, and of
a full directorate of finance, JAPG will be capable of improving commercial
collection, which should be reduced to three months of revenue at the end of
FY1984, and 2.5 months of revenue from FY1986 onward. These targets were
agreed upon during negotiations.
Investment Policy and Borrowing Capacity
7.14      JAPG's investment plan over the FY1982-1987 period amounts to GP
1,603 million, at 1982 prices (Table 9). This amount is considerable, as
compared to JAPG's annual revenue on operations, of about GP 120 million in
FY1984. Therefore, JAPG agreed during negotiations not to undertake any
investment of more than the equivalent of US$100,000 not included in the
Development Program (para. 4.01), without prior consultation with the
Association.
7.15      JAPG's investment financing policy must be carefully designed to: (i)
avoid excessive increase of debt service; and (ii) avoid excessive indebtness
as compared to equity. The financial mix prepared by JAPG for covering its
investment plan takes into consideration these constraints and includes con-
cessionary financing, while adhering to the principle that JAPG must not



- 26 -
repudiate any of its past financial commiLtments, and must remunerate borrowed
funds at a reasonable rate. The financial mix is as follows:
(a)   overdue debts to the Government will be rescheduled and repaid
over four years without penalty interest, from FY1984 on, for
GP 5.9 million annually. This was agreed upon during negotia-
tions;
(b)   the US$11 million of the credit from the Association will be
on-lent by the Government to JAPG at an annual rate of 11%,
over 20 years, with five years grace, the foreign exchange risk
being borne by JAPG. This was agreed with the Government and
JAPG during negotiations. The execution of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement will be a condition of Credit effectiveness;
(c)   the US$10 million equivalent to be borrowed from BADEA to
implement Part B of the Development Program (para. 4.01) will
be transfered to JAPG as equity;
(d)   the US$10.0 million equivalent to be borrowed by the Government
at a 2% rate over 25 years with 5 years grace, from Kuwait Fund
will be transferred to JAPG as equity;
(e)   the OPEC Fund will provide US$3 million equivalent, 50% of
which as grant to the Government transfered to JAPG as equity,
and 50% of which as a loan at a 1.5% annual rate, over 25
years, of which 5 years grace; these funds will be transfered
to JAPG as equity; and
(f)   the US$8.5 million to be borrowed from the Saudi Fund at 1% per
annum, over 25 years, of which 5 years grace, will be trans-
fered to JAPG as equity.
The resulting average cost of borrowed funds will increase from 0.4% in FY1984
to 5.2% in FY1986, and a still reasonable 6.6% in FY1987. Total cash outlays
for servicing the debt will increase considerably, despite the mild lending
conditions, from GP 7.4 million in FY1984 to GP 72.5 million in FY1986, and
GP 106.9 million in FY1987. In order to restore JAPG's borrowing capacity, by
ensuring that it can adequately service its debt, it was agreed during nego-
tiations that JAPG's debt service coverage ratio will be at least 5.5 in
FY1984 when the bulk of the investment program starts, 4.0 in FY1985, 2.3 in
FY1986, and 2.0 in FY1987. In order to avoid the risks of excessive indebt-
ness, and to maintain a reasonable balance between borrowed funds and JAPG's
equity, the Government agreed that JAPG's capital and equity will be ade-
quately increased to maintain a debt/equity ratio of less than 42/58 in
FY1984, less than 42/58 in FY1985 less than 47/53, and less than 52/48 from
FY1987 onward.
7.16      Taking into consideration lending terms of Arab donors and the Asso-
ciation to the Government, and re-lending conditions to JAPG, the effect of
the port development program, including the proposed project, on government
finances will be a positive inflow of funds for GP 37.6 million in FY1986,



- 27 -
GP 66.1 million in FY1988, and GP 97.4 million in FY1989. If the new
commercial berth was only 130m long rather than 260m long, these amounts would
increase by GP 9 million per year.
7.17     With the investment plan as presented in Table 9, and the financial
mix described in para. 7.15 above, JAPG's contribution to investment with its
own funds will increase from 4.8% in FY1984 to 9.3% in FY1987.

Overall Cash Situation
7.18     JAPG's financial viability depends essentially on its capacity to
cover, in the longer run, all cash outlay requirements. They can be summa-
rized as follows:
FY1982     FY1984      FY1986      FY1987
Working expenditure               56,185     71,039      80,716      88,590

Total cash outlays                66,920    111,021    145,733    188,118
Tariff adjustments will have to be implemented accordingly.
Tariff Policy
7.19     In order to fulfill the objectives stated in para. 7.11, and under
the financial policy outlined above, the approximate tariff increases needed
will be as follows:



Approximate Future Tariff Increases, FY1982 - FY1987
Average Annual
1982    1984      1986       1987     Increase 1987/82
Average tariff per ton
in current GP               557   1,193    2,323       2,788             33.0%
Average tariff per ton
in 1982 US$                 16.34   21.29    32.19       35.12           20.2%
Average tariff on ship
in 1982 US$ per ton          1.19    3.65      6.32      6.81            41.7%
Average tariff on merchandise
in 1982 US$ per ton         10.67   15.05    22.35      24.58            18.1%
Average tariff on rentals
and warehousing
in 1982 US$ per ton          1.31    1.96      2.91       3.14           19.1%
7.20     The necessary tariff increase will average 20.2% per annum in cons-
tant terms, from FY1982 to FY1987, or an annual 38% in nominal terms, in local
currency. The corresponding tariff per ton will increase from about US$13.9
per ton in FY1982, to US$35.1 per ton in FY1987 at FY1982 prices. This tariff
level will still generate a negative net result on operations of GP 63.4
million in FY1987. However, this level can hardly be exceeded, by comparison
with the normal US$15 - 18 level in the region, without serious risk of traf-
fic diversion to neighboring ports of Dakar, Banjul and Conakry. The Govern-
ment agreed during negotiations to increase tariffs by about 65% in FY1985 and
25% in FY1986, in addition to the latest increase which raised the average
tariff to US$21.5 per ton.
7.21     The tariff structure by service supplied should be modified, taking
into consideration actual cost. The actual cost of services will be known
with reasonable precision only from FY1985 onward, when the cost accounting
system will be effective (para. 3.04). However, it was agreed during negotia-
tions that in the meantime JAPG will selectively raise tariffs on ship move-
ment, merchandise and rentals (including warehousing) so that from FY1986
onward, tariffs on each service will cover at least the corresponding operat-
ing costs, defined as costs specific to each service, plus the cost of support
activities directly included for the supply of this service.
7.22     In the future, port traffic will comprise international traffic
(about 90,000 t on the average), domestic traffic (about 30,000 t on the
average), and fishing (about 6,000 t on the average). JAPG agreed during
negotiations that each type of traffic, and in particular domestic traffic and
fishing, will cover at least its operating cost from January 1st, 1986 on.
This measure is particularly important for the success of the efforts devel-
oped under highway projects, for road use charges to cover road costs, and in
order to allow the future transport company to operate under economically
efficient conditions from a national viewpoint.

Summary of JAPG's Accounts on a Cash Basis
7-23     JAPG's liquidity situation will depend on its revenues, cash outlays
for operations, working capital needs and capital investment policy. It can
be summarized as follows:
Summary Accounts on a Cash Basis, FY1982-FY1987

17 Net of non-operational expenses.
7.24     The above table indicates that with the previously envisaged tariff
increases, JAPG can attain a sustainable cash situation by FY1985, and from
then onward, maintain sufficient cash for its operations. The Government
confirmed during negotiations that JAPG cannot by law incur any bank over-
draft.
Profitability
7.25     Under the financial policy outlined above, JAPG will nevertheless be
unable to produce a positive net result on operations until FY1990. The
impossibility of producing a positive result earlier is due to the consider-
able annual depreciation to be taken into account, as a consequence of JAPG's



- 30 -
capital investment policy, which aims at satisfying, through the envisaged
capacity extension, long-term requirements. JAPG's rate of return on net
revalued fixed assets will improve, as compared to its FY1982 level minus 20%,
will become positive from FY1986 onward, and will reach 2.2% in FY1989.
7.26     The construction of a new 130m commercial berth, instead of the
envisaged 260m berth (para 4.02) would reduce capital investment by the equi-
valent of US$7 million. However, the extension has no sizeable effect on
JAPG's cash situation due to the concessionary terms of funding, and therefore
it does not effect the required tariff adjustments for JAPG's financial viabi-
lity.
Sensitivity Analysis
7.27     The main project risk is that tariff increases may be implemented too
late, or may be insufficient to reach agreed financial objectives. A tariff
increase 15% below that envisaged in para. 7.19 would make JAPG's cash situa-
tion untenable; it would be unable to meet its financial commitments to the
Government. However, the Government has recently implemented tariff increases
exceeding 100%, and no difficulties with tariff increases planned for 1985 and
1986 are expected.
VIII. AGREEMENT REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
8.01     Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations:

GUINEA-BISSAU
BISSAU PORT PROJECT
ACTION PLAN FOR SECTOR INSTITUTION BUILDING
1.       The institutions in the transport sector are inherited from pre-
independence and from short-term needs of post-independence national recons-
truction. The needs, however, have progressively changed, and the emphasis
should be now on transportation coordination and planning, management of
national companies, and, overall, domestic transport efficiency.
Objectives
2.       The objectives of the Action Plan are to:
(a)   Improve MTT's capacity in transport investment planning and
transport service coordination;
(b)   Open a dialogue between the Government and the representatives
of transport service industry on transport issues;
(c)   Stimulate local entrepreneurship in small business, in trans-
portation and in agriculture by:
(i) allowing private and cooperative road or river trans-
porters to compete on an equal basis with state trans-
port firms; and
(ii) facilitating the movement of fruit and vegetable from
the individual farms to the final demand centers.
(d)   Provide producers with access to a variety of competitive
transporters; and
(e)   Improve the quality of transport service.
Means
3.       The above objectives will be met by:
(a)   Giving to MTT responsibility for transportation investment
planning, supervision of public firms involved in transporta-
tion, and regulation of the transport industry (objective (a))
(para. 2.14).
(b)   Supporting the development of an independent transport indus-
try through creation of a transport association under the
authority of MTT. This association would include Government
representatives, representatives of private and cooperative



- 34 .-                     ANNEX 1
Page 2
transportation enterprises, and of the public transport com-
pany. The purpose of this association would be to facilitate
member's access to foreign exchange for spare parts and fuel,
and to provide MTT with a qualified interlocutor for improving
transport regulation (objectives (b) and (c)).
(c)   Separating transport activity from trading activity in public
sector firms, and creating a separate national transport compa-
ny competing with private transporters. This would permit
competition between alternative transporters to develop objec-
tive (c) and (d), and would improve transport efficiency (ob-
jective (e)) (para. 2.18).
(d)   Providing technical assistance to the new transport company and
training to its staff, so that it can provide an economically
and technically efficient service to the users (objectives (a)
and (e)).
Implementation
4.       (a)   Giving MTT the responsibility for transportation planning and
coordination
The Government will:
(i)  Prepare a new charter for MTT, in consultation with the
Association, giving it full responsibility for trans-
portation planning and coordination, transportation
regulation, and tutelage of para-statal firms of the
sector, by June 30, 1984;
(ii)  Prepare terms of reference acceptable to the Associa-
tion for the technical assistance to be financed by the
Association;
(iii)  Reorganize MTT, create a department of transportation
planning and a department for para-statal firms super-
vision; prepare terms of reference acceptable to the
Association for these two departments, by June 30,
1984; and
(iv) Provide adequate conterparts for the technical assis-
tance to be financed by the Association, by June 30,
1984.
The Association will:
(i) Finance technical assistance by a high. level transport
economist for 36 man-months in MTT, for transportation
planning and cocrdination; and

(ii)  Finance 36 man-months technical assistance in MTT, for
the supervision in the five para-statal firms of the
transportation sector.
5.        (b)  Creation of a Transport Association
The Government will:
(i) Prepare and issue, by June 30, 1984, a decree creating
a transport association under the control of MTT, with
representatives of the Government and the private and
public transporters. The decree will define the role
of this association for procurement abroad, consulta-
tion on transport regulation, etc.
6.        (c)   Establishment of a transport company for road
and river transport
The Government will:
(i) Send to the Association for comments, by June 30, 1983,
the study financed by AfDB on the organization of the
new company;

(v) Provide acceptable counterparts for the key positions
in the new company, of Director General, Director of
River Transport, Director of Road Transport, Director
of Finance, and Administrative Director, by June 30,
1984.
The Association will:
(i) Finance 12 months of training abroad for the Director
of Finance. The other upper level staff being taken
from the existing transport activities in the trading
companies, will not need initial training;

GUINEA--BISSAU
BISSAU PORtT PROJECT
Existing Port Facilities
A. Bissau Port
1.       The port of Bissau, located on the northern shore of the estuary of
the Geba River about 80 km from the ocean, is reached by a channel passing
through numerous shoals. A large number of islands, reefs and banks protect
the entrance of the Bissau estuary against ocean waves and swell approaching
from the directions between south and west. The channel, which has suffered
only minor siltation, has a minimum dep-th of 10m below low-water level. The
port has a sheltered harbor, with good aLnchorage ground, loca-ted between the
town of Bissau and Ilheu do Rei islet. Its 1Om contour line encloses an
elongated area 2,000m long and 375 to 450m wide.
2.       The port facilities comprise:
(a)   a T-shaped commercial wharf providing a single berth 130m long
and 25m wide for ocean-going vessels of 5-10,000 dwt. Because
of siltation through the years, it now has a minimum depth of
about 5.0m alongside at low water. Smaller ships (500-2,000
dwt) are able to berth inside the T-head depending on length
and draft.  The wharf, built in 1952, is of reinforced concrete
deck supported by reinforced concrete beams, diagonals and
piles. The deck is in fairly good condition, although about
120 beams need repair and diagonal members are severely da-
maged, with extensive cracks and considerable corrosion of the
reinforcing steel. The fender system is either severely da-
maged or completely gone, and ship berthing must be carried out
very carefully. The original water and lighting systems are
out of order. Currently, mobile lights are used on the pier
during night operations;
(b)   a second T-shaped pier, of lesser depth known ELS the Navy jetty
is used mainly by the fishing fleet and small passenger ves-
sels. The jetty, a reinforced concrete structure supported by
tubular steel piles, is connected to the shore by a solid wall
causeway, known as Pijiguiti quay, which is occasionnally used
by barges;
(c)   a coastal shipping quay wall (Bolola quay), 132m long and 9.4m
wide, is of reinforced concrete deck supported by steel tubular
piles. The quay is used for unloading fish and cargo from
barges; it is, however, unaccessable at low water when barges
rest on the bed; and

(d)   a terminal for importing petroleum products, known as DICOL
wharf, located about 2.5 km west of the commercial wharf, has
recently collapsed. Products are presently imported through a
buoy berth. This wharf was the only facility suitable for
bunkering of ships.
B. River Ports
3.       Guinea Bissau has an extensive river system that makes water trans-
port inherently attractive. As a consequence of poor maintenance, however,
many of the river ports, which generally consist of a single small wooden or
concrete pier, are severely damaged.
4.       Following is a list of main river ports and their location.

5.       The proposed project includes rehabilitation of four river ports at
Cacine, Cadique, Binta and Caboxanque as well as rehabilitation of four ferry
ramps at Enxude, Sao Vincente, Joao Landim, and Farim. All berthing facili-
t:Les at these location are in bad condition and in need of urgent improvement
to ensure the adequate flow of river and road traffic.

1/  Almost all domestic waterborne traffic is between Bissau and regional
river ports. Traffic flows between regional river ports are negligible.
2/ The increase observed in 1981 results from occasional shipments of
food relief supply (mainly rice/maize) to the regions. (Rice production
fell from 108,000 tons in 1976 to only 25,000 tons in 1980).
