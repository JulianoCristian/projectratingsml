    INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
               PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
           FIRST EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                  TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO

Borrower                  Kingdom of Morocco

Implementing Agency       Ministry of Education (MOE)

Financing Data            IBRD Variable-Spread Loan with 25 years maturity including a 5-
                          year grace period in an amount of EUR 44.2 million (US$60 million
                          equivalent)

Operation Type            Programmatic operation: First in a series of two operations
                          Number of tranches: One
                          Deferred Drawdown Option: No
                          Special Development Policy Lending: No
                          Crisis and Post-Conflict Situation: No

Main Policy Areas         I. Achieve universal compulsory basic education
                          11. Improve system performance (teaching, management and
                          stewardship)
                          111. Mobilize and utilize resources (financing, partnership,
                          communication, social mobilization and involvement of the private
                          sector)

Key Outcome               Improve physical and financial accessibility, and equity of basic
Indicators                education to all school-aged children;
                          Improve education quality at all levels through foundation systems
                          and strengthen capacity and empowerment at the school levels, in
                          conjunction with an enhanced evaluation culture;
                          Improve institutional effectiveness and efficiency of public
                          expenditures to improve the sustainability of the education sector.

Program Development       The proposed program aims to support the implementation of the
Objective and             Government?s ?Education Emergency Program 2009-20 12? to
Contribution to Country   improve the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery and
Partnership Strategy      educational outcomes. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
                          comprises three pillars: encouraging growth, competitiveness and
                          employment; improving the quality of service delivery to citizens;
                          and promoting sustainable development within the context of climate
                          change. The proposed program would contribute to the second pillar
                          by improving equity, access and quality of education service
                          delivery.



                                           iii
Risks and Risk   The reform program may face resistance from unions, including
Mitigation       teacher resistance to the efficiency measures and the move
                 toward greater accountability. The Government will engage in a
                 broader and more consistent dialogue with teacher unions and
                 teachers, and will create a buy-in to the reform program through
                 participation and decision-making.
                 Attainment of the Emergency Education Program (EEP)
                 objectives could be constrained by financing mobilization. The
                 Bank and other donors will pursue the discussions with the MOE
                 to further prioritize their expenditure programs so as to better
                 align them both with the country?s financial capacity and existing
                 absorptive capacity.
                 Ensuring adequate institutional capacity to support reform
                 implementation remains a key challenge. A wide range of
                 measures and actions have been identified, including the
                 implementation of alternative approaches such as outsourcing and
                 partnerships with qualified NGOs and associations in service
                 delivery. In addition, coordinated efforts have been deployed by
                 the main donors to mobilize sizeable resources to support

                PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
            FIRST EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                   TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO

I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      Investing in human capital through quality education is a priority in Morocco's current
development process. The Government has overseen an impressive political, economic and
social transformation, with a marked acceleration of structural reforms in recent years. Sound
macroeconomic management has produced solid foundations, and the country is on a strong
recovery path from the stagnation of the 1990s due to sustained growth of nonagricultural
output. While economic indicators have improved, inequality and poverty persist. Social
indicators remain relatively low in comparison with other countries in the region. Analytical
work has underscored the low level of education and skills of the workforce as being among
the main factors which constrain the country's economic growth and long-term
competitiveness. The labor market is imbalanced with notable mismatch between job
demands and graduation qualifications and skills.

2. , Improving the quality of outcomes in the education sector has become a key priority
for the Moroccan Government. To overcome the challenges faced by the education sector,
the Government embarked on a comprehensive reform of the education and training system,
with the promulgation of the 1999 National Education and Training Charter (CNEF).' The
CNEF, with strong national consensus, declared 2000-2009 the decade for education and
training, and established education and training as a national priority, second only to territorial
integrity. The reform program, as laid out by the CNEF, also received strong support from
the donor community. Nevertheless, during the course of implementation, the reform
program encountered delays.

3.     At the request of the Government's highest authorities, a bold Education Emergency
Program (EEP)2 was drawn up to accelerate this decade-long reform process. The EEP,
spanning the period 2009-12, draws on the lessons learned during the last decade. In this
context, the Government requested five major donors (European Commission [EC], European
Investment Bank [EIB], Agence franqaise de developpement [AFD], African Development
Bank [AfDB] and World Bank) to assist the implementation of the EEP reform agenda
through the progressive application of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

4.      The Bank has had a long and active dialogue with the Government in the education
sector. A Basic Education Reform Support Project (PARSEM) - a sector-wide approach
(SWAP) operation - supported the implementation of program reforms during the past four
years, closing in June 2009. In response to the Government's request for support to EEP, the
Bank team has been working on the preparation of a programmatic series of development
policy loans (DPL) to support the refinement and implementation of the EEP reform agenda,
in close collaboration with the other donors mentioned above. The DPL instrument will
support essential policy measures and actions while reinforcing results-based approaches.

5.      Through 2008 and 2009, joint technical and preparation missions were carried out by
the five donors, known as the Technical and Financial Partners (TFP) Group. In the course of
these missions, the TFP Group engaged in an active and coordinated dialogue with the
Government on the new strategic framework. More specifically, the TFP Group and the
Government discussed the various actions proposed to remedy the structural problems that
were contributing to low education performance, especially at the basic and secondary
education levels. This on-going dialogue led to the joint identification of priority reform areas
and the definition of main results/outcome indicators, along with monitoring and evaluation
arrangements.

11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

6.      Over the past decade, Morocco carried out sound macroeconomic policies and
continued to sustain momentum of structural reforms. As a result, the growth pattern shifted
to a higher level averaging 5.1 percent over 2001 -08, almost double of the average rate of the
1990s (2.8 percent). The good growth performance allowed income per capita to almost
double over the last decade to reach US$ 2,850 in 2008. Furthermore, sound fiscal policies
led to the consolidation of public finances, allowing the budget to run surpluses in 2007 and
2008 (averaging 0.3 percent of GDP). The Government adopted a prudent debt strategy and
central government debt steadily declined to 47.2 percent of GDP in 2008 from 62 percent in
2005. In addition, the Government pursued appropriate monetary policy geared toward
maintaining low and stable inflation (an average 2.5 percent since 2005) and enhanced
financial sector supervision. Furthermore, it sought to deepen its integration into the world
economy through the signing of many free-trade agreements culminating with the 2008
"Advanced Status" awarded by the European Union. Overall, these efforts have led to a
stable macroeconomic stance, stronger public finances, and a sound financial sector. On the
basis of these achievements Morocco gained investment grade rating in 2007 from one rating
agency, which further reinforced the confidence of investors, both domestic and foreign.

of 8 percent over the last five years) also contributed to reinforce gross investment. These

          improved the employment situation with the number of jobless shrinking to 9.6 percent in
          2008, down from a high of 14 percent in the late 1990s, although questions remain over the
          quality of the jobs currently available to large segments of the population.

          8.       Reforms triggered positive changes in the Moroccan economic structure but
          manufacturing is losing momentum. The structure of production changed in favor of services
          with both primary and secondary sectors' shares in GDP declining over time. The shrinking of
          the secondary sector's share is mainly due to manufacturing which has declined over the last
          two decades, denoting a weakness of the productive tissue that reduces its productive capacity
          and hinders its long term growth and development. This weakness stems from the slow
          structural transformation in the manufacturing sector, which also explains the modest results
          of Moroccan exports. The latter continue to be concentrated around relatively undiversified,
          low knowledge, low value-added, traditional products. As a consequence, exports do not
          fully benefit from trade dynamics of Morocco's trade partners and thus have been unable to
          fulfill their potential for contributing to growth and job creation.

     Recent economic developments in Morocco

     9.    In light of the global economic crisis, growth performance in Morocco has been good.
     Economic growth in 2008 reached 5.6 percent compared with 6.8 percent expected in the
     2008 Budget Law, but better than the low 2.7 percent of the previous year. This performance

                                                                         4
is mainly due to a good agricultural output, which gained 16.3 percent, benefiting from
favorable rain conditions compared to a drop of 20.8 percent of the previous drought-stricken
year. This shows that agricultural variations due to weather conditions still affect GDP
growth, albeit with less intensity than in the past. The non-agricultural sector remained
robust, but less than projected as the negative impact of the global crisis started to infiltrate
progressively the Moroccan real economy. Growth of non-agricultural output edged down to
4.2 percent over 2008 compared to 6 percent registered the previous year. This growth
performance was mostly driven by activities of non-traded goods and services that largely
depend on domestic demand.

10.      Data for 2009 show that the economy has suffered only moderately from the effects of
the global economic slowdown that started in late 2008. Growth edged down to 3.7 percent in
the first quarter of 2009 but has rebounded to 5.4 percent in the second quarter and further to
5.6 percent in the third quarter. Overall, growth is estimated at 5 percent for the whole year. This
momentum is mainly due to a very good harvest, a firming of domestic demand, and, to a
lesser extent, slight recovery of external demand for some manufactured products and
tourism.

 11.    The Government has implemented a stimulus package to support the income of the
population and help the most affected sectors (Box 1). The income support package is mostly
benefiting the low income employees. It includes an increase of 10 percent in the wages of
civil servants at the lower end of the salary scale and the Minimum Wage for private sector
employees. The wage revalorization was implemented in two steps, the first increase of 5
percent in July 2008 and the second one in July 2009. In addition, effective January 2009, the
marginal income tax was cut from 42 percent to 40 percent and will be cut further to 38
percent in January 2010 as envisaged in the draft Budget Law 2010. At the same time, the
upper end of the exempt income bracket was extended. Direct support measures for affected
firms included financial relief (guarantees on loans; rescheduling of debt; help with export
insurance) as well as subsidies for training and marketing. Economic stimulus was also
provided through some monetary easing. The total budgetary gross cost of the stimulus
package has been estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP (over the 2008-2010 period), and as such
does not pose a risk to the medium term sustainability of public finances.

Box 1. Fiscal Stimulus packages and Outcomes

The Government has implemented several measures to help affected firms cope with the decline of
external demand. Early in 2009, the Government set up a high level Council for Strategic Monitoring,
comprising concerned ministers as well as representatives of the business community and banking
sector, to follow developments related to the ongoing global crisis. The Council targeted the export
sector for support through the following measures that would expire at the end of 201 0 (and amount to
budgetary cost of 0.2% of GDP):
0  Provide guarantees for up to 65 percent for working capital loans;
0  Finance up to 80 percent of costs of promotion campaigns and market surveys;
0  Extend insurance risk coverage for exports;
0  Facilitate rescheduling the repayment of long term debt;
   Ease regulations affecting imports covered by the temporary admission scheme;
0  Provide training and logistics in partnership with business associations; and
   Ease regulations pertaining to the payment of social insurance by employers in eligible cases
(applying to firms that have had a 20 percent loss but continue to retain employees).

Subsequently specific support programs have been designed for tourism and remittances and
investment of Moroccan workers residing abroad.

Data as of mid-December 2009 show that 59 percent of the demand for support concerned social
insurance relief and was requested by 421 firms, of which 379 are operating in the textiles sector and
34 in automotive equipment. At the same time, 115 firms benefited from loan guarantees (of which
107 are textiles firms), and 134 firms benefited from training, of which 11 1 are from the textiles sector
and 20 from automotive equipment.

Measures to help low income households were already started in 2008 and included in the 2009 and
2010 Budget Laws. For the most part, they consisted of tax relief and wage increases for selected
groups as well as an increase in social expenditures by relevant government departments. These
measures kept domestic demand high as reflected in the rising credit to consumption, equipment and
real estate (see below). Specific measures included the following:
0   The marginal income tax was cut from 42 percent to 38 percent, and the upper limit of the tax-
exempt bracket was increased by 25 percent;
0   Salaries of civil servants at the lower end of the pay scale were increased by 10 percent ( 5 percent
in July 2008 and 5 percent in July 2009);
0   For private sector employees, the minimum wage was raised by 10 percent (5 percent in July 2008
and 5 percent in July 2009);
0 Minimum pension payments were increased by 20 percent and family allowances by 33 percent.



Economic stimulus was also provided through monetary easing. Reserve requirements for banks were
cut in steps from 15 percent to 10 percent by July 2009 and then to 8 percent in October 2009. The
Central Bank also cut its policy rate by 25 basis-points in March 2009 translating into a policy rate of
3.25 percent.


 12.    Public finances continue to be well managed globally despite the impact of the global
crisis on the budget. The steady reform efforts of expenditure and tax management and sound
debt management over the last few years have been critical in maintaining public finances on
a sustainable path. These reforms translated into better control of the Government's
consumption, enhanced tax collection, and declining public debt. In this context, Public
Finances were in slight surplus in 2007 (0.2 percent of GDP) and in 2008 (0.4 percent of
GDP),4 which is outstanding given the impact of high subsidies5 because of the food and fuel
crisis. Recent data on budget executions show that the budget deficit has been limited to
around 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009 despite falling revenues impacted by the global crisis and
the introduction of the stimulus package to respond to the crisis. This outcome is mainly
explained by large savings on subsidies- which have plummeted by 59.3 percent - and
controlled government expenditures, including the wage bill in spite of wage revalorization.
Nevertheless, subsidies still represent a heavy burden on the budget and thus constitute a
potential risk factor for its sustainability in case of exogenous shocks such as higher world
prices of fuels and food and severe drought. The launch of a medium term scheme to reform
the subsidy system through better targeted social programs would gradually mitigate this risk.

13.   Steady implementation of the Public Administration Reform Support Program
(PARAP) resulted in subdued recurrent expenditures, including a continued decline in the
wage bill relative to GDP. The main measure to control the wage bill consisted of the

 Public finances data do not include Hassan I1 Fund expenditures.
 Consumer subsidies are applied to the following items: liquid petroleum products, butane gas, soft wheat flour and sugar.

successful voluntary early retirement program started in 2005 and subsequent measures to
limit hiring to the actual needs, mostly targeted to the education and health sectors. Although
the size of the central government personnel has now reached its pre-reform level, its skills
mix, its geographic and sector coverage, and its age structure improved significantly, thus
leading over time to improved efficiency. Without the early retirement program, these
achievements would not have been possible. The combined effect of these measures
translated into a declining wage bill, which in 2008 edged down to 10.2 percent of GDP
compared to 10.7 percent the previous year (and 11.7 percent in 2005). In 2009, it would
virtually stay at the same level as in 2008 (10.3 percent of GDP), despite wage revalorization
for low-income civil servants as part of the fiscal stimulus package to alleviate the effects of
the global crisis.

14.    The sound fiscal management contributed to further reduce the central government's
debt. Reflecting the good performance of public finances and sound active debt management,
the debt stock of the central government declined to 47.2 percent of GDP in 2008, down by
more than 6.3 percentage points relative to 2007. Most of the decline is explained by the
important drop in domestic debt, which fell by 5.5 percentage points to reach 37.3 percent of
GDP, while foreign debt was reduced by 0.7 percentage points to 9.9 percent of GDP.

15.     The Government and the Central Bank showed continued commitment to fight
inflation. Domestic inflation stood at 3.7 percent in 2008 as compared to 2 percent registered
in 2007. The rapid acceleration of prices of food in 2008-which account for almost 42
percent of household consumption-explains most of the inflation that year, whereas non-food
prices moved relatively slowly thanks to partial pass-through of the high imported fuels
prices. In effect, food inflation reached an average of 7.1 percent over 2008, an
unprecedented rate since 1995. However, helped by declining world prices and ample
domestic food supply, inflation subsequently declined to only 1 percent in 2009.

16.     The external position remains solid despite the sudden deterioration of the current
account due to the impact of the global crisis. For the first time since the 1980s, the current
account ran large deficits in 2008 (5.2 percent of GDP) and over the first three quarters of
2009 (5 percent of GDP). This follows comfortable surpluses over the period 2001-06
(average surplus of 2.8 percent of GDP) and a quasi-balance in 2007 (a deficit of 0.1 percent
of GDP). The worsening of the current account is principally explained by the impact of the
global crisis on workers' remittances and tourism receipts that before had been compensating
for the rising trade deficits. Consequently, net foreign reserves declined by US$ 2.69 billion
(or down 10 percent) at end 2008 to edge down to US$ 24.3 billion, representing 6.6 months
of imports, down from 8.8 months in 2007. However, the decline significantly slowed down
in 2009 as net foreign reserves amounted to US$ 24.1 billion at the end of the year. Owing to
declining imports, net reserves improved to a comfortable level of 7.4 months of imports of
goods and non-factor services.

17.    The on-going global crisis revealed once again the weaknesses embodied in the
Moroccan trade structure. The trade deficit deteriorated to 24.7 percent of GDP in 2008, up
from 22.3 percent of GDP in 2007 (and only 11 percent in 2000). It improved in 2009 as
imports declined by more than exports in nominal terms; but it is still high (20.8 percent of
GDP). The high trade deficit is mainly a volume effect rather than a price effect because
Morocco actually benefited from positive terms of trade; while the price of oil and food
imports increased, so did the price of key Moroccan exports such as phosphate products and
                                            7
agri-food. The weak performance of exports reflects their low diversification and lack of
competitiveness. This explains largely why Moroccan exports were not able to benefit fully
from the many free-trade agreements the Government signed over the last decade such as
those with the European Union, the United States and Turkey.

18.     Monetary and exchange rate policies remained appropriate. In 2008, the Central Bank
resorted to raising the cost of money (plus 25 basis points in September 2008) to contain
soaring credit and inflation, while it relaxed its policy to enhance liquidity in the face of the
global crisis. As liquidity tightened and inflationary pressures started to ease over the second
half of 2008 through 2009, the Central Bank relaxed gradually the money reserve rate
reducing it from 15 to 12 percent January 2009, and then to 10 percent July 2009. Recently,
the Central Bank decided to further cut the money reserve rate to 8 percent in October 2009 to
ease the pressure on liquidity. It has also cut its policy rate by 25 basis points in March 2009
to reach 3.25 percent. Despite these relaxed policies, money supply slowed to 5.6 percent by
end 2009, compared to 10.8 percent in 2008. Although credit to equipment soared at 29
percent, total credit to the private sector slowed down driven by slower pace of credit to
consumption (up 18.8 percent), and construction (up 12.8 percent), and declining credit for
businesses' treasuries (down 1 percent). At the same time, the stock of non-performing loans
declined slightly by 0.6 percent. In recent years the exchange rate remained in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals with no signs of misalignment.

Macroeconomic outlook and debt sustainability

19.     Sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies, as well as efforts to improve sector
productivity and competitiveness, put Morocco in a better position to maneuver with less
damage through the moderate effects of the global crisis, while being in a position to benefit
from the recovery of the world economy (Table 2). The decision of the Government to
continue its reform efforts and revamp its sector strategies along the targeted and short term
sector fiscal stimulus should allow the Moroccan economy to expect good prospects over the

                                                                      8
medium term. Meanwhile, economic growth is estimated to be around 5 percent in 2009
mostly owing to the outstanding agricultural output and a moderate contribution from the
dynamic non-agricultural activities such as construction, finance services, telecommunication,
and tourism.

20.      Growth prospects in the medium term are good. It is assumed that the Government
will sustain the reform momentum of the last few years, achieve the ambitious public
investment programs it devised, and continue to implement the main sector strategies it
launched, thus consolidating further economic diversification, growth potential, and domestic
demand, and it is also assumed that the world economy will slowly recover from the current
crisis to allow the on-going export promotion strategies to achieve their targets and contribute
to growth. Under these conditions, growth rates will improve from the low 3 percent
projected for 20106 to around 5.2 percent in 2013. Should the underlying sources of growth
assumed above be slow to materialize, growth prospects would have to be adjusted
downward. Moreover, there is a reasonable risk that even pre-crisis growth levels might not
be sustainable over the medium term if internal demand remains the key driver of growth.

2 1.    Sound macroeconomic policies would help contain inflation at low levels. Inflation
edged down to 1 percent only in 2009, mainly driven by declining prices of imported food
items, and should remain subdued at around 2 percent thereafter. As Morocco is mainly an
exporter of food items, its inflation rate is only slightly impacted by international food price
fluctuations. In addition, subsidies for key food and energy prices - while clearly having an
impact on the budget - contribute to a stable inflation rate.

22.     After a temporary higher deficit in 2010, the fiscal stance should remain sound over
the medium term, with fiscal deficits under the targeted threshold of 3 percent of GDP,
benefiting from the ongoing fiscal reform and more targeted social programs, as well as a
better-controlled wage bill. The budget deficit is expected to edge up to 4.5 percent of GDP
in 2010 before gradually dropping to around 2.3 percent by 2013. Reaching this outcome
implies maintaining momentum of the ongoing tax reform to broaden the tax base, improve


  The low growth in 20 10 is mainly explained by normal agricultural output translating into a negative growth
rate for agriculture after an outstanding growth in 2009.

the efficiency of the VAT, strengthen tax administration, and remove unproductive tax
exemptions in order to reduce the high tax expenditures. These measures would offset the
negativezimpact of the reduced top rates on corporate and personal income taxes. Under these
assumptions, revenues are projected to stabilize at around 25 percent of GDP. On the
expenditure side, the consolidation of public finances relies on four critical measures:
deepening of fiscal reform, achievement of oil and food subsidies reform, continued tight
control of the wage bill evolution, and an active debt management. Under these conditions,
public debt will increase slightly in 2010 to 48.4 percent of GDP before following a
downward trend to decline to less than 45 percent of GDP in 201 3.

23.     The financing needs stemming from the higher budget deficit in 2010 and declining
deficits over the medium term are easily financed through the domestic market as well as
from increased drawings on external loans (Table 3). In this context, domestic financing
would remain the main source, although external financing would improve its contribution.
Indeed, since 2006, net external financing reversed its long negative trend to turn positive,
reflecting the government's strategy to slightly change the debt composition in favor of
external borrowing. This financing strategy would ease the pressure on domestic financial
markets and prevent any crowding out of the private sector's investment now that the money
market is less liquid than over the last years. At the same time it is consistent with the
intention to maintain a comfortable level of foreign reserves.

24.     The Government's debt strategy is to diversify financing sources and take on a greater
proportion of external financing. Three main factors underpin the Government's decision to
reinforce its external sources, especially multilateral and concessional. The first is linked to
Morocco's public debt maturity structure. The maturity of public debt has fallen in recent
years and will fall further given that the central government mostly financed its needs through
issuing T-bills of up to 1 year in the domestic market. The main reason behind this choice is
to avoid affecting long-term floating rates for Banks' domestic lending to the private sector,
especially housing credit, as they are indexed to primary market rates on long-term securities
(10- and 15-year bonds). The second relates to the higher balance of payments needs
although the level of foreign reserves remains relatively comfortable. The third is due to the
current higher borrowing requirements of the Budget, in a context of tightening liquidity of
the domestic financial markets after a long period of an over-liquid money market.
Consequently, additional external lending is consistent with prudent debt management which
fosters improved terms of debt, while maintaining a comfortable level of foreign reserves and
at the same time avoids pressure on domestic financial markets.

25.     A comprehensive public debt sustainability analysis shows that the fiscal framework is
robust to downside risk in the medium term. Public debt under the two main shocks proved
sustainable over the medium term.' Under alternative scenarios, six other shocks to the
baseline scenario are simulated, and public debt sustainability is preserved in all of them.
Under these shocks, public debt would slightly increase in 2010 and, for a few shocks, in
201 1 as well, before steadily declining over the medium term.

26.     The external position is expected to remain sustainable over the medium term. The
current account is expected to slightly deteriorate in 2009 (5.6 percent of GDP) before
following a slight downward trend over the medium term to edge down to 2.5 percent of GDP
in 2013, as the impact of reforms and sector strategies take hold. Indeed, the balance of
payments is expected to progressively improve, with lower trade and current account deficits,
which would benefit from improved export potentials and a recovery of tourism activities and
workers' remittances. This scenario assumes that Morocco would reap the fruits of its
continued reform efforts, its sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies, and targeted sector
strategies that entail higher public investments, which would translate into higher private
investments, including foreign direct investment (FDI), and progressive gains in
competitiveness of its exports, including tourism. In this context, external debt is expected to
follow an inverted U path edging up to 25.7 percent of GDP in 2010 from 24.7 percent of
GDP in 2009 before steadily dropping to 23.4 percent by 2013 while net foreign reserves will
stay at an average of 6.0 months of imports.

27.     Balance of payments financing requirements do not constitute a serious concern given
the sound economic fundamentals, the country's low external debt stock, and the ample
foreign reserves. As the current account deficits are projected to steadily improve in the
medium term, there are no constraints on financing them through multilateral and bilateral
credit lines along other private capital flows, including FDI. The latter is expected to
gradually improve, attracted by an improved business environment and the opportunities
offered by important structural projects and the devised privatization program of the country.

28.     In sum, Morocco's macroeconomic framework remains adequate and sustainable in
the medium term. The moderate effects of the global crisis on the Moroccan economy have
been muted by the good economic fundamentals resulting from sound macroeconomic
policies carried out over the last years and by the response of the government through the
stimulus package to mitigate these effects on the population and businesses alike. The
stimulus package has allowed supporting investors' confidence and domestic demand while
reducing risks. The Government's commitment to maintain momentum of reform effort
supports robust prospects of investment, growth, and employment.

Poverty, social and human development

29.    After the largely lost decade of the 1990s, the country achieved unprecedented rates of
poverty reduction between 2001 and 2007. Absolute poverty decreased from 15.3 percent to
roughly 9 percent. The fall has been more marked in rural areas (1 0.6 percentage points) than
in urban areas (2.8 percentage points). Part of this evolution is explained by the effect of

'The two main shocks are AI : Key variables are at their historical averages; and A2: No policy change (constant primary
balance).

                                                         11
sustained growth on unemployment, which stands at a 30 - year low (9.6 percent in 2008).
The recent progress in poverty reduction made a decisive break with past performance, as for
the first time since the 1980s the absolute number of the poor is clearly falling.

30.     Although absolute poverty has decreased, economic vulnerability (near-poverty)
remains widespread. Based on official figures, 17.5 percent of the population has
consumption levels just above the poverty line. The combined number of poor and vulnerable
or near poor in Morocco is 26.5 percent, meaning that a quarter of population - 8 million
people - remains either in absolute poverty or under constant threat of poverty. The
importance of looking at near poverty (vulnerability) in addition to absolute poverty results
from three factors. First, poverty in Morocco is measured by using a frugal poverty basket
picking up only the very poor using a poverty line (MAD 10 per person per day) well below
that used by countries at similar GDP levels. Second, the period under review was preceded
by a decade of increasing poverty (from 1991 to 2001) during which many near poor were
pushed into poverty. Resumed growth and economic stability helped these transient poor to
move back to near-poverty from poverty, while core chronic poverty remained untouched.
Lastly, the recent fall in poverty in rural areas is not unprecedented. A similar episode of
falling rural poverty was observed between 1985 and 1991, and it was followed by a decade-
long deterioration. The see-saw evolution of poverty across the intermittent surveys in the
1990s reflects the vulnerability of the economy to shocks, and the large number of people
who hover just above the poverty line.

3 1.    Despite being broad-based, recent progress in poverty reduction was accompanied by
increasing disparities. The partial closure of the rural-urban gap has not cancelled entrenched
disparities: 70 percent of poverty in Morocco is still rural. In 2007, the urban poverty rate
was 4.8 percent compared to 14.5 percent in rural areas. Even though all groups among the
poor - the extreme poor, the poor, and the near poor - gained from growth, the pattern of
growth was not unambiguously pro-poor and it was not equally shared. As inequality
increased in both urban and rural areas to reach unprecedented levels, growth for the poor was
slower than the average growth and it was still below the levels needed to reduce poverty by
half in 20 years. Regional differences are substantial, but practically all regions contain
pockets of severe poverty in slum areas or in villages.

32.     The overall decrease in unemployment rates has led to a reduction in poverty
incidence, but being employed does not necessarily guarantee protection from poverty. An
absolute majority among the poor are working poor. The informal sector, primarily in
agriculture, which employs 70 percent of Morocco's labor force, is characterized by low pay,
insecurity of job tenure, and lack of safety standards. Almost 70 percent of Morocco's poor
are employed in just two sectors (agriculture and construction) which are characterized by
informality. Formal sector workers, especially those employed by the public sector, are well
protected, and enjoy a significant wage premium. The poor, predominantly without
education, or with only basic education, cannot compete for such jobs.

33.     Lack of affordable access to quality services explains why the poor are not benefiting
from the expansion of services. The poor gained from improvements in all social sectors, but
not enough to make a decisive break with their condition, partly because of limited access to
services in sectors such as education, maternal health, and housing. For example, survey data
show that only half of the population uses health services for illness, and this share is only 40
percent for the rural poor. Services are underused because of financial, social, and geographic
                                             12
barriers. Low education outcomes of the poor are related to problems of progression through
the system and low quality of education. The main barriers for the poor in accessing better
health care are high (informal and formal) payments, high transportation costs, and low
quality of service. Lack of adequate local health facilities, combined with poor roads and
expensive transport, particularly hurts women.

111.         THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM & PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

Education sector background and key issues

34.     Implementation of the National Charter of Education and Training (CNEF) resulted in
impressive progress in terms of access to education. Efforts to increase the availability of
educational services have led to expanded participation in education at all levels. From
1990/91 to 2008/09, national net enrollment rates increased from 52.4 percent to 90.5 percent
for primary education, and from 17.5 percent to 42.7 percent in middle school. The increased
enrollment in compulsory education has placed pressure on higher levels of education, leading
to substantial increases in student enrollments in upper secondary schools, universities and
other tertiary education institutions.

35.     Progress has been made in ensuring equitable access to education for young children.
While the gap between urban boys and rural girls at the primary education level narrowed to
just three percentage points by 2008/09, the gap at higher levels of the education system
remains large (see Figure 10).

36.    Education completion rates have improved, but meeting the MDGs is still uncertain.
Primary school completion rate has increased from 68.6 percent in 2005/06 to 75.8 percent in
2008/09, with girls now completing the full primary cycle (Grades 1 through 6) at a slightly
higher rate than boys. It is not clear whether, at the current pace, universal primary school
completion can be achieved by 20 15. More than half of students complete the full two cycles
of basic education (Grades 1 through 9), but girls are now outstripping boys quite
substantially (Table 4).

37.         Decentralization of the governance of the education sector is under way, even
though effectiveness of these reforms remains a key challenge. The capacity of the Regional
Academies of Education and Training (AREF), which have been granted some administrative
and financial autonomy, has improved over time. The AREFs have played an important role
in leading the reform program at the regional and sub-regional levels. In higher education,
universities are autonomous institutions led by presidents who report to their respective
boards. Furthermore, the Government recently created an independent evaluation institution
under the Higher Council for Education (CSE) to evaluate system performance and
disseminate its findings and results. The publication of its first report in April 2008 led to a
welcome debate among the various stakeholders on increasing outcome measurements and
accelerating the improvement of the education and training sectors. This new institution is
expected to help the system manage for results and ensure greater accountability.

gaps in favor of girls in Arabic and French (Table 5). In addition, there are considerable
differences between urban and rural areas and between public and private schools (even when
the comparison is between urban public and private settings).

40.     The legacy of poor access to education weighs on the adult population's education
capital. In the past, few Moroccan males and even fewer females had access to schooling,
with only a small proportion reaching secondary and higher education. Literacy rates have as
a result long been low. The effects of the recent increase in school enrollments however can
be seen in the positive trends in literacy over the past two decades (particularly amongst
young adults, who have graduated more recently from the formal school system), with both
overall rates increasing and the gender gaps narrowing substantially (see Figure 12).

41.         Ensuring the financial sustainability of school expansion and strengthening the
overall sector's governance are challenging. Expanding education has exerted tremendous
financial pressure on Morocco's national budget. Public expenditure in the education sector
has been 6 percent of GDP on average over the past three years, which shows higher figures
than those for most countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. This reflects in part
problems with technical and financial efficiency and the relatively high burden of salary
expenditures on the system. This structural element calls for particular attention to be paid to
the quality of management and allocation of human resources within the Moroccan education
system. Figure 13 shows that Morocco's education system is less effective in delivering
education outcomes, for example with respect to completion of primary education, than
education systems in countries such as Lebanon and Egypt.

is substantially higher than that for primary
education, and it is about twice as high per student as in other countries in the region. The
high cost of secondary education is explained by the allocation of human resources, with low
studentheacher ratios compounded by a high ratio of administrative staff (nearly three
administrative workers for every ten teachers).

Government program

43.    As noted above, the Government launched a comprehensive reform of the education
and training system, with the promulgation of the 1999 CNEF and the 2008 EEP. The
impetus to promote education reforms in Morocco is the result in part of the publication of
major sector reports including (i) the World Bank's Flagship Report in 2008 ("The Road Not
Traveled")" and (ii) the CSE's 2008 Annual Report."

44.    The fundamental guiding principle of the EEP places the student at the heart of the
education and training system. The key goal is to provide the student with basic

competencies, by establishing an environment conducive to learning and using qualified
teachers. The EEP, spanning the period of 2009-12, draws on lessons learned during the last
decade. The EEP has a comprehensive and solid strategic and policy framework and a
sizeable expenditure program (MAD 34 billion or US$ 4.1 billion) to significantly improve
outcomes during the coming years (from pre-school to higher education). The EEP has a
program of reforms and actions with four strategic directions that have the following
objectives: (i) achieve universal basic education; (ii) promote initiative and excellence in post-
basic education; (iii) improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship);
and (iv) improve mobilization and utilization of resources. Targets include increasing net
enrollment rates for pre-school, primary and lower secondary education from 48.2 percent,
90.5 percent, and 42.7 percent in 2008/09 to 65.9 percent, 94.6 percent 74.7 percent,
respectively by 201 1/12.

45.     Strategic Direction 1: Achieve universal basic education. The overall objective is to
achieve compulsory education for children aged 6-15, to guarantee a place in school to all
children aged 4 years old, and reduce repetition and drop-out rates. The focus will be placed
on the following areas:
    0   Promote and support me-school development: The objective is to increase public
        provision in order to accelerate the development of a modern and accessible pre-
        school sub-sector. To this end, a suitable and sustainable pre-school model will be
        defined and implemented, while actions are taken to improve the quality of existing
        pre-school services.
        Expand access to compulsory education: On the supply side, the objective is to
        implement a sizeable construction program to consolidate access to primary education
        (with the opening of 2,500 classrooms, including 1,700 in rural areas), and increase
        access to lower secondary education by providing some 6,800 new classrooms (with
        80 percent targeted to rural areas). To this end, measures will be taken to improve
        school location mechanisms, and establish new approaches to school construction.
        Demand-side interventions will be strengthened to increase equity in access and
        retention in primary and lower secondary education. Furthermore, efforts will be
        deployed to give special needs children an education structure that is adapted to their
        needs and help them integrate into the mainstream education stream.
    0   Improve retention and education quality: In order to reduce repetition and dropout
        rates, teachers and principals will be trained in, and responsible for, monitoring each
        child with respect to the learning process and identifying those having learning
        difficulties. In addition, teacher workloads will be re-arranged to allow them to devote
       three to four hours to support students with learning difficulties in primary and lower
        secondary education.
       Focus on knowledge and acquisition of basic competencies and improve the school
       environment: In order to improve the quality of learning and teaching, learning
       evaluation and benchmarking mechanisms will be institutionalized, building on the
       results of the national learning achievement assessments.

46.       Strategic Direction 2: Promote initiative and excellence in post-basic education.
      0   Increase access to upper secondary education and pilot interventions to promote
          excellence: The objective is to increase the supply of upper secondary schools,
          including boarding accommodations, to absorb increased enrollments and achieve a 60
          percent completion rate for the 2009 Grade 1 cohort in 2021. In parallel, a

                                             17
       comprehensive study will be carried out to define a sustainable strategy to provide
       quality upper secondary education which is adapted to the country's long-term
       development needs. A series of policy measures and capacity building actions will be
       implemented to strengthen the on-going higher education reforms with the view to
       respond, in a sustainable manner, to the pressing education demands from Moroccan
       youth, and improve the pertinence of qualifications and skills provided to graduates
       and their entry into the labor market.

47.    Strategic Direction 3: Improve system performance (teaching, management and
stewardship). Strategic Direction 3 will address structural weaknesses that have impeded the
acceleration of the reform program. It deals with a wide-range of issues that cut across the
system:
    0   Strengthen the competencies of the MOE personnel: Enhance institutional capacity,
       especially at the regional and provincial levels, through the development of a
       redeployment plan in conjunction with a competency-based qualification training
       program. With regard to the teaching force, the implementation of the planned reform
       program will help revitalize the pre-service training system (as a higher education
       program) and put in place a more effective in-service training program to increase
       competency and productivity.
    0  Strengthen support for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the teaching corps:
       Part of implementing the new vision is to support teachers in the monitoring and
       evaluation of student outcomes, assist in the remedial process for improved student
       learning, and make teachers more accountable for their students' learning outcomes.
    0  Increase efficiency in human resource management and utilization: In order to
       promote an effective decentralization of human resource management, greater
       responsibilities will be given to the AREF to make decisions regarding staff
       recruitment, deployment and evaluation. In addition, new teaching positions will be on
       a contractual basis, and utilization of the existing teaching force will be optimized for
       teaching time and workload. Furthermore, teachers' mobility will be facilitated by a
       new deployment strategy that will focus on a geographical job location (rather than a
       school), and incentives will be provided to teaching personnel located in remote areas
       or with demanding conditions.
    0  Complete the deconcentration and decentralization process and optimize the
       organization of the MOE: Measures will be taken to enhance on-going actions and
       improve effective implementation of the deconcentration and decentralization process,
       notably the transfer of critical responsibilities to the AREFs. These measures will also
       help promote and progress toward results-based management and improved
       governance practices.
    0  Improve planning, and management of the education system and develop an
       information system. The objective is to establish a solid and reliable structure for
       improved sector strategic planning. In particular, priority capacity building activities
       will be executed at the regional and local levels to allow these structures to effectively
       participate in the bottom-up planning exercises.
    0  Modernize the teaching and learning, of languages: The objective is to modernize the
       language education system to enable students to better master languages. Moreover, a
       coherent language policy between different school levels will be developed.



                                            18
48.    Strategic Direction 4: Mobilize and utilize resources financing, partnership,
communication, social mobilization and implication of the private sector). The EEP has put
forward a number of saving and efficiency measures, Le., reducing repetition rates, deploying
multi-subject teachers in lower secondary education, improving teacher deployment,
decentralizing human resource management, and using contract-based management.
Implementation of these measures will need to be monitored and evaluated. In addition, the
following objectives will be pursued under this fourth strategic direction:
    0  Promote the provision of non-public education: The objective is to increase private
       participation in the supply of education in order to share the burden and improve
       effectiveness. To this end, the Government will develop and implement a coherent
       strategy and an action plan, focusing on the improvement of existing regulatory
       frameworks and on the design and testing of management contracts.
       Mobilize main stakeholders and improve communication about the reform program,
       especially at the school level: An internal and external communication strategy will
       be developed to ensure continued adhesion and ownership of the reform program by
       all actors and stakeholders. In addition, the partnership arrangements will be
       established with stakeholders, particularly those closely involved in the school,
       notably local governments, associations, NGOs, and local communities, with a view to
       engaging these partners in supporting schools and assist in the exploration of
       alternative service delivery options.

Implementation costs

49.     The overall cost of the EEP 2009-2012 is estimated at MAD 34.0 billion (US$ 4.1
billion), averaging MAD 8.5 billion per year. The cost is to be shared between the
Government (around four fifths) and the Technical and Financial Partners (TFPs) (around one
fifth). The Government has backed its commitment to the EEP with a significant boost to its
funding of the education sector. The MOE's school education budget increased by 23.5
percent from MAD 31.06 billion in 2008 to MAD 38.35 billion in 2009; as a result, this
budget rose from 4.68 percent of GDP in 2008 to 5.37 percent of GDP in 2009. This fiscal
effort has focused on non-salary expenditures, with the share of the budget going to
investment and non-salary recurrent items rising from 12.81 percent in 2008 to 22.67 percent
in 2009. This level of financial support is set to continue in 2010.

    Participatory processes

    5 1.     As part of the development of its EEP, the Government engaged in consultations with
    various stakeholders. In the fall of 2007, the King of Morocco instructed the Government to
    develop the EEP to speed up the implementation of the education reform agenda. During the
                                                          im
    first round of program development, the consulting fr hired to provide technical assistance
    to the Government consulted with regional and provincial education officials, focusing on a
    number of pilot sites. In a second round, the MOE met with parliamentarians and teacher
    union representatives to present the draft program and receive feedback. With the third round
    of development, the MOE tested the feasibility of the final draft by consulting with governors,
    as well as regional and provincial education officials, in a series of regional forums, again in
    pilot sites.

    52.     For its part, the World Bank team, in preparing the latest CPS, undertook through May
    and June 2009 a broad series of consultations. These 18 meetings, with NGOs, private sector
    representatives, youth and academics, were organized according to a variety of formats
    (roundtables, broad-based meetings, workshops, and brainstorming). Participation was at
    both local and national levels, and participants came from rural, semi-urban and urban areas
    in different provinces, primarily Rabat-Sale, Fes, Casablanca, Tanger, and Marrakesh.

    53.     In all consultations, the Education sector emerged as being at the heart of development
    challenges in Morocco. From the discussions with the civil society actors, the private sector,
    academics, and public partnerships, the following concerns emerged: (i) the quality of
    education is very low and is still more problematic in the context of current economic changes
    in Morocco; and (ii) despite the Government's relevant assessment and strategic vision,
    effective implementation remains challenged by a number of problems that impede reform.

    54.    Participants provided suggestions for strengthening the Education sector. They
    expressed the view that improvements required: (i) establishment of quality norms and

      EIB's commitment amounts may vary from year to year, within the fixed total amount.

                                                       20
development of an evaluation and monitoring system in the entire education sector; (ii)
strengthening the responsibility and investment in the capacities of teachers; (iii) analysis and
subsequent modernization of teaching manuals and teacher training; (iv) further
decentralization of the education system, with a focus on the budgeting system in the sector as
well as the mechanisms and processes of budget execution; and (v) involvement of all key
actors in the discussions on education reforms through a long-term, yearly dialogue.

IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

Link to the Country Partnership Strategy

55.      The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) comprises three pillars. These pillars are: (i)
encouraging growth, competitiveness and employment; (ii) improving quality service delivery
to citizens; and (iii) promoting sustainable development within the context of climate change.
Other cross cutting themes, such as regional development, governance, public private
partnerships, and regional integration, are also covered.          The proposed Education
Development Policy Program (EDPP) is part of the Bank's support to Pillar (ii) of the CPS
and, as such, will address the issue of quality education service delivery through: (a)
improved management of the sector by way of increased decentralization to, and
accountability of, the AREFs that are responsible for local service delivery; (b) increased
targeting as a means to reach the most vulnerable and improve retention and reduce drop-out
rates; and (c) enhanced accountability of education personnel by means of performance-based
measures.

Collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and other donors

56.      The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund maintain close collaboration in
Morocco. Regular contacts between the Fund and the Bank country teams are customary,
with discussions focused on the respective work programs, country priorities, recent
developments and prospects. Collaboration between the Fund and the Bank in Morocco has
been positive, with a common understanding on the division of labor and a shared assessment
of the critical macroeconomic challenges facing the country. The Fund continues to focus on
critical macroeconomic areas, and in particular exchange rate, monetary, and overall fiscal
policy. The Bank continues to focus on strengthening economic management, improving the
business environment, and sectoral reforms. The Fund participates in Bank project review
meetings where relevant; Bank staff members contribute to the Fund's Article IV consultation
missions to Morocco. The ongoing analytical work being carried out by the Fund team,
which was welcomed by Bank counterparts, focuses on (i) the medium-term outlook for
public finances in Morocco; (ii) an analysis of the real exchange rate; and (iii) the
macroeconomic implementation of the global financial crisis and economic downturn.

57.     The EDPP has been prepared in close consultation and coordination with main donors
active in Morocco's Education sector. The Government, and particularly the MOE's
Department of School Education (DES), demonstrated great interest in the results of the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. As a result, the Government requested the World Bank and
the donor community to support the reform program, using the principles of the aid
effectiveness framework. A non-binding partnership framework has been signed by
Government and a wide group of donor representatives (including the World Bank) with a
view to encouraging donor support in the education sector.
                                            21
58.     The World Bank works closely with other donors. In line with the main principles put
forward by the partnership framework, the World Bank joined with four major sector donors
(European Commission [EC], French Development Agency [AFD], African Development
Bank [AfDB], and European Investment Bank [EIB]) to form a core group - the Technical
and Financial Partners (TFP) - that offers technical and financial support to the Government
as it implements its EEP. This level of harmonization amongst major donors marks an
important advance in donor relations with the Government. EC, AfDB and the World Bank
are providing their funds in the form of budget support, while AFD and EIB (along with the
EC's Neighborhood Investment Facility [NIF]) are providing investment financing. The
Spanish International Cooperation Agency for Development (AECID) has expressed interest
in joining the TFP group and providing financing support to the Government's EEP.

59.     The TFPs worked together with Government to establish a common results framework
and common monitoring and reporting arrangements that underpins each TFP's support of the
EEP. While the overall results framework is common to all TFPs, each TFP has its own
financing operation with prior actions and triggers that differ slightly from one to another. All
TFPs other than the World Bank have signed their respective financing agreements with the
Government, for a total commitment amount of EUR 433.0 million (US$ 579.2 million
equivalent) over four years. To provide a structure for coordinating their parallel financing
operations with the Government's own EEP implementation, the TFPs and Government
developed a memorandum of understanding and an associated operational manual; the
                    '~
m e m ~ r a n d u m has been signed by the Government, AFD, AfDB, EC and EIB, and contains a
provision that enables the World Bank to sign once the proposed operation is approved.

Relationship to other Bank operations

60.     The Bank has a long history with and an active engagement in Morocco's education
and other social sectors. Over the past decade, four relevant projects -- Social Priorities
(Education) Program (4024-MOR)' Alpha Maroc (Adult Literacy) Project (4607-MOR),
Social Development Agency Project (466 1-MOR) and Basic Education Reform Support
Program (PARSEM) (7273-MOR) -- were fully executed. These operations assisted the
Government in: (i) increasing access to basic education, literacy and other social services; and
(ii) improving the quality and effectiveness of service delivery. Overall, these projects were
implemented successfully with respect to the objective of increasing access to basic services
and promoting participatory approaches and partnership arrangements. l 5 The Social Priorities
(Education) Program and the Social Development Agency project results were remarkable in
this regard. Achievements regarding quality of service delivery were less positive. While the
present operation will be the first DPL in the human development sector in Morocco, it has a
strong link with PARSEM, as it continues Bank support to the Government in the
implementation of its education reform agenda. In particular, the design is built on lessons
learned from the implementation of the sector-wide approach as well as the resultsheport-
based disbursement methods.



l 4 The memorandum provides that where there is a conflict between the memorandum and the individual
financing agreements the latter prevail.
I5
    PARSEM closed in June 2009 and the ICR was delivered in December 2009.

                                                  22
61,     The EDPP is being prepared against the background of other sectoral DPLs, especially
those related to public administration reforms. Consistent with these DPLs, attention has been
paid to the need to strengthen the institutional framework and to ensure a proper coherence
and coordination of the reform agenda. In this regard, the MOE was among the first
ministries to engage in the main reforms supported by the Public Administration Reform
Loans, particularly with regard to budgetary and human resource management reforms. The
experiences of counterparts such as the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) team helped
accelerate the mastering of the DPL modalities by MOE colleagues.

Lessons learned

62.    The EDPP design was informed by lessons learned from the above-mentioned projects
and sectoral DPLs in Morocco, as well as from experiences with human development DPLs
implemented in other countries. Main lessons learned are summarized below.

63.     The first lesson is the importance of government ownership and commitment to the
reform program. To ensure success, it is necessary to establish and maintain support within
the administration and to improve communication channels among the various actors (central
and regional level, etc). As mentioned above, the main components of the EDPP are derived
from the EEP, which is fully ,owned by the Government and supported by the highest
authorities in the country. The Government's program contains a strong communication
component, but it will be important to ensure its effectiveness during the implementation
period.

64.     Second, the effective implementation of some reforms requires time, especially in the
human development sectors, as shown in PARSEM. It is important to take into consideration
the time required to build up executing agencies' capacity when preparing the reform
implementation plan, especially when the agencies are at the developmental stages. The point
has been discussed at length with the authorities and led to some prioritization of the reform
program, geared by the principle of selectivity and realism. Alternate implementation
arrangements are also considered by the Government in some areas. However, the MOE is
required to scale up program implementation in a short timeframe, which leaves limited space
for integrating the results of impact evaluation work. The team will discuss this issue further
with the authorities during supervision missions.

65.     Third, success in reform implementation, especially in the human development
sectors, depends to a great extent on the existing institutional capacity and sustained
consensus among the main stakeholders. Addressing these key challenges requires a fully
fledged medium-term strategy and good coordination. The Government is aware of these
issues and lays out a range of measures and activities in this direction. In addition, the
ongoing coordination among donors providing direct investment and budgetary support offers
the opportunity to meaningfully respond to the critical capacity building needs.




                                           23
Analytical underpinnings

66.      Substantial analytical work underpinned the preparation of the EEP and the EDPP.
First, the Bank analytic program led to the production of an education sector policy note,I6 a
                                                                         and
report on school absenteeism and time-on-task in the c l a ~ s r o o m , ~ ~ a report on skills
development and employment,I8 whose findings shaped the sectoral dialogue. Second, the
CSE's 2008 Annual Report'' provided a comprehensive and frank diagnosis of the state and
performance of the education sector and laid out recommendations for improving the
country's education outcomes. The CSE recommended inter alia: (i) improved learning
achievement assessments; (ii) a more open policy concerning the recognition of language as a
quality improvement mechanism; and (iii) the promotion of the private sector in improving
access and quality. Third, the World Bank's Flagship Report in 2008 ("The Road Not
Traveled")20 contributed to a public debate on the level of education sector outcomes and the
need to improve design and accountability measures in the sector. Though achievements have
been made in expanding access through construction in both urban and rural areas, increased
teacher training and revision to the curricula, there has been less attention to management of
the sector, incentives, and accountability. The proposed DPL program will focus on these
three issues which respond to the CPS's overall emphasis on governance strengthening and on
service delivery improvement. In addition, the preparation work builds on results of a range
of technical studies that were carried out under the Bank-financed PARSEM or were financed
by other donors such as the EC.

67.     Additional analytical and advisory assistance will be required to facilitate the
implementation of the proposed reforms. The scope of the reform agenda calls for the
execution of a programmatic AAA program to inform implementation and ensure adequate
knowledge transfer. This was recognized by the Government and sector donors and led to the
identification of a preliminary list of core studies which will be carried out during the
implementation period (see Annex 4). These activities would be partly funded by the EU-
Technical Assistance Fund or by the new Neighborhood Investment Fund (NIF). The World
Bank will complement these activities through an appropriate analytic program that includes a
Public Expenditure Review (PER) and a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) in the
school education sector.

V.       THE PROPOSED EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY PROGRAM

Operation description

68.   The proposed loan would be the first in a programmatic series of two single-tranche
DPLs. The EDPP is designed to provide budget and technical support for the refinement and

    implementation of the national education sector reform program, and has been developed in
    close coordination with the Government to ensure full ownership of the processes, actions and
    outcomes. The Government and the Bank recognize that under Government leadership, the
    Bank can play a critical role in bringing sector knowledge and experience, strengthening
    cross-sectoral policy dialogue between various government entities (especially linking sector
    development outcomes to the country's overall economic framework), and ensuring sustained
    commitment toward effective reform of the sector. The EDPP would help put in place the
    education reform program and accelerate implementation between 20 10 and 20 13. The First
    Education Development Policy Loan (EDPL 1) would support key initial institutional and
    regulatory measures as well as the introduction of new approaches to improve service delivery
    effectiveness and efficiency. The Second Education Development Policy Loan (EDPL2)
    would support deepening institutional reforms and scaling up the program to tackle core
    cross-cutting issues.

    69.      In preparing this operation, the Government and the Bank first constructed a SWAP
    Specific Investment Loan, but later decided to apply a DPL approach to the operation. There
    is now a shared recognition that a programmatic DPL series enables the Bank to support
    critical elements of the Government's reform agenda in a focused manner. At the same time,
    depending on the evolving situation (including decisions taken on the basis of on-going
    analytic work and technical assistance activities), the content and timing of EDPL2 may need
    to be modified. In addition, given the significant needs in terms of capacity building, it will
    be important for the TFPs (including the Bank) to provide analytic support and technical
    assistance to the MOE throughout the period of EEP implementation.

    70.     The objective of the EDPP is to support the implementation of the Government's
    "Education Emergency Program 2009-20 12" to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
    service delivery and educational outcomes. More specifically, the EDPP would support the
    Government in its efforts to improve the accumulation of human capital through the
    implementation of policies and measures designed to: (i) achieve universal basic education;
    (ii) improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship); and (iii) improve
    mobilization and utilization of resources.

    71.     The EEP objectives, EDPLl prior actions, EDPL2 triggers, and intermediate outcomes
    are set out in the Policy Matrix provided in Annex 2. The EDPLl prior actions and EDPL2
    triggers are summarized in Box 2.

I   Box 2. Prior Actions and Triggers for the Education Development Policy Program
                                                                                                             I
    The Government has agreed upon and implemented the following prior actions before the presentation

                Assessment Program;
            0   The MOE receives authorization, pursuant to Royal Decree No. 1.09.100 dated June 29,
                2009, to transfer teacher training colleges to universities, with a view to creating new

                                                  25
            university programs in pre-service teacher education;
        0   The MOE adopts a strategic human resource management action plan 2009-20 12;
        0   Each AREF develops and adopts with the MOE a program-contract for the period 2009-
            2012;
        0   The Government, through AREFs, provides for a discretionary budget for primary schools'
            and colleges' non-staff-related recurrent costs for the school year 2009/10;
        0   The MOE develops a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the schools

As this is a single-tranche operation, there are no subsequent tranche release conditions applicable.

Under the programmatic development policy operation series, the Government has agreed upon the
following triggers for moving to the next operation in the series:
             The MOE develops and adopts new criteria for locating primary schools and colleges, with
             priority given to rural and semi-urban areas;
        0    The MOE pilots, in at least four (4) communes in different AREFs, a global approach to
            providing support adapted to needs and aimed at encouraging demand for schooling in
            rural areas;

            describe its budget commitments and track their use.


Box 3. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership.
The design of this operation has been fully client driven and thus enjoys solid country ownership. The
Government embarked on a comprehensive reform of the education and training system, with the
promulgation of the 1999 National Education and Training Charter (CNEF). The CNEF, developed
with strong national consensus, receives strong support from the donor community, but the
implementation of the reform program has encountered delays. In 2008, an Education Emergency
Program (EEP) was drawn up to accelerate this reform process. The EDPP support the Government in
the implementation of this EEP.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated
accountability framework.
The World Bank's EDPP is prepared in parallel with four other donors' operations. The AFD, the
AfDB, the EIB, the EC and the World Bank worked actively with the Government on the design of
coordinated Dolicv matrices and a common set of Derformance indicators. Donor alignment on the

                                                26
reform program objectives was also achieved through joint missions, informal consultations and regular
updates by staff of respective institutions.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances.
By design, the program fully reflects country's circumstances,priorities and institutional
responsibilities as indicated by the Government. For the more complex policy reforms, the donor
consortium is providing technical assistance to carry out the necessary underpinning analytic work.
The EDPP has also benefited from the lessons learned from the previous education operations and other
DPL operations in Morocco, and benefits from the flexibility embedded in the CPS.


Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement.
Prior actions and benchmarks have been identified through a process of extensive consultations with
the MOE, the MEF, and with the other members of the donor consortium. The jointly agreed policy
matrix uses a limited set of prior actions across the selected policy areas and is aligned with good
practice principles. Conditionality is focused on steps considered critical to achieving results on the
ground and sequenced to support consistent progress towards program objectives.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support.
 Joint progress reviews will take place twice a year, timed so as to allow for a predictable review of
 progress and announcement of support levels at the beginning of the budget year. The results
 framework which includes outcome indicators that are assessed as'part of operation implementation and
 mid-term review is closely linked to the Government's own EEP results measurement system.


Policy areas

72.      The main actions to be envisaged under the three main policy areas that would be
retained for the EDPP -- (i) achieve universal basic education; (ii) improve system
performance (teaching, management and stewardship); and (iii) improve mobilization and
utilization of resources -- are outlined below and are then detailed in the Program Policy
Matrix (Annex 2). These critical actions respond to crucial strategic issues such as the impact
of poverty on schooling (through both supply-side and demand-side actions that target rural
and semi-urban areas), low quality of student achievement (through both national surveys and
regional structures), poor teacher efficiency and accountability (through teacher education and
human resource management), weak implementation capacity at the decentralized level
(through region-level initiatives including financial management improvement in AREFs) and
lack of "voice" for stakeholders (through improved school-parent structures).

I: Achieve universal basic education

73.     Description. The Government aims to achieve compulsory basic education by
rationalizing the use of physical capacities and enhancing measures for greater equity in
school access and retention.

74.     Challenge. The sustainable pre-school strategy is an essential measure of the
Government's program for accelerating progress toward the MDG.                      Preschool is
underdeveloped in Morocco with an average enrollment rate of 48.2 percent in 2008/2009. In
rural areas, the rate is low: 48.2 percent for boys and just 20.4 percent for girls. Preschool is

                                              27
essentially provided by non-public institutions (98 percent), with faith-based schools
providing 80 percent of the services that are geared toward child care rather than pre-school
education. EDPP will assist the Government to develop a new pre-school strategy (including
operational concepts) that will ensure a sustainable expansion of quality pre-school services.

75.     Despite considerable efforts in expanding access to primary and lower secondary
education through an extensive construction program, disparities between urban and rural
areas still exist for girls at the primary level, and for both girls and boys at the lower
secondary level (see Annex 3). Student-classroom ratios also vary widely in the regions, with
some regions accommodating more than 40 students per classroom. To address these issues,
the Government plans to execute a sizeable school construction program and enhance
demand-side interventions that reduce the impact of poverty on schooling. The EDPP will
assist in defining a new criteria to build and implant primary and lower secondary schools,
giving priority to rural and semi-urban areas and involving local administrations
(`communes') in the decision-making process. The EDPP will also help consolidate and
improve the effectiveness of demand-side interventions, including targeting measures and
assess the impact of these measures as well as building on the ongoing experience with the
pilot conditional cash transfer program currently under way. The low quality of student
learning is to be addressed not only through national assessment of student achievement but
also through establishing regional structures to monitor quality.

76.      Government measures. Concrete actions will need to be taken to curtail school
repetition and improve learning assessment to advance the education quality agenda put
forward by the EEP. As mentioned above, grade repetition and dropout rates remain high. In
addition, the low level of student achievements has become a shared concern of the Moroccan
society. In order to address these issues, especially to fight against repetition and dropout, the
Government EEP has identified a range of supply-side and demand-side measures. Among
them, teachers and principals will be trained and will be responsible for closely monitoring
each child with respect to hidher learning process in order to identify those having learning
difficulties. In addition, teacher workload will be re-arranged so as to allow teachers to
devote three to four hours per week to support students in primary and lower secondary
education, respectively. The EDPP will assist in introducing theses changes and will assess
their impact during the implementation period. In addition, the EDPP will establish and
implement a national learning assessment system, built on experiences acquired in executing
the 2008 learning achievement survey.

77.    EDPP prior actions and triggers. The prior actions under the EDPLl "universal basic
education" strand are as follows:
    0  The MOE publishes on its website the "Education Emergency Program 2009-2012"
       for the reform of the education and training sector. In making the EEP available in a
       transparent manner, the Government in general and the MOE in particular commits to
       carrying out the reform package and can thereby expect to be held accountable for the
       results it achieves through its reform actions.
    0  The MOE increases boarding scholarship from 750 to 1,260 MAD per student per
       quarter and extended the duration of the scholarship to cover the full school year.
       Given the gaps in school attendance between urban and rural settings and given the
       incentive that on-site boarding provides to rural families to enroll their children in
       school, the extension of the provision of boarding facilities across the full length of the

                                             28
          school year is likely to make a major contribution to enrollment amongst rural
          children.
      0   The CSE publishes on its website the analysis of the results of the first national
          student learning survey, organized jointly by the CSE and the MOE under the National
          Learning Assessment Program.           While Morocco has already participated in
          international studies of student learning achievement, this is the first student learning
          survey to be designed and carried out at a national level (in core subjects in Grades 4,
          6, 8 and 9). As such, it constitutes a major advance in providing decision-making with
          the ability to monitor learning outcomes across the school system and therefore to take
          policy decisions based on objective measures of results.

78.       The EDPL2 triggers under this strand are:
      0   The MOE develops and adopts new criteria for locating primary schools and colleges,
          with priority given to rural and semi-urban areas. Where demand for new school
          capacity outstrips available financial resources, the rationing mechanism needs to
          ensure that decisions on infrastructure investment in general, and location of new
                                                                                                         '
          schools in particular, are taken at the local level on the basis of objective and
          transparent criteria that correspond to the Government's stated aim of narrowing the
          gap in enrollments between urban and ruralhemi-urban areas.
      0   The MOE pilots, in at least four (4) communes in different AREFs, a global approach
          to providing support adapted to needs and aimed at encouraging demand for schooling
          in rural areas. At present, the provision of support is managed on a component-by-
          component basis (boarding facilities, school feeding programs, school transport
          facilities, and conditional cash transfer programs), rather than in an integrated manner
          that uses the commune as the unit of planning. By testing such a global approach, the
          MOE will be able to develop methodologies for determining the optimal mix of
          support for a given commune.
      0   The MOE carries out, in collaboration with AREFs, regional student learning
          assessment activities. Even as the MOE develops its capacity at a national level to
          assess student learning as a tool for decision-makers at all levels, it is critical that the
          country also have the capacity to carry out assessment activities at the regional level.
          Regional-level activities, involving AREFs, will: (i) support implementation of
          national assessment activities at the local level; (ii) carry out assessment activities
          corresponding to specific local needs (e.g., examine further factors of school
          performance highlighted in national surveys); and (iii) provide technical support to
          province-, commune- and school-level assessment activities.

79.      Comulementary actions. The program results framework (Annex 2) contains a
number of complementary actions. While these actions serve to signal progress in
implementing the EEP, they do not constitute additional conditions for disbursement. Under
the first strand, complementary actions already undertaken include:
    0    The MOE develops an outline for competency guidelines for modernizing pre-school
         education.
    0    The MOE and AREFs increase, from 2008/09 to 2009/10, the number of students
         benefitting from school canteens, by 15 percent in primary education and 24 percent in
         lower secondary education.
    0    The MOE issues and delivers to schools a circular on individual student monitoring
         (Le., integrating educational monitoring and individual school record booklet).

                                                29
      0   The MOE holds a national event to report to AREFs on its analysis of results of the
          first national student learning assessment survey, organized jointly by the CSE and the
          MOE.

80.       The planned complementary actions under this strand include:
      0   The MOE adopts intervention strategies for pre-school education in disadvantaged
          rural and semi-urban areas, developed on the basis of the new competency guidelines,
          and AREFs implement these strategies in line with an action plan agreed with the
          MOE.
      0   The MOE evaluates the results of the first year of implementation of individual
          student monitoring and remedial student support.
      0   The MOE organizes jointly with the CSE the second national student learning
          assessment survey, and participates in the international surveys TIMSS 20 1 1
          (mathematics and science) and PIRLS 201 11 (reading and literacy).

II: Improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship)

8 1.   Description. The Government aims to strengthen MOE staff competencies especially
those of teachers as a critical impetus for moving forward with the EEP goals.

82.     Challenge. In 2008/09, there were about 245,000 personnel working in the schools
sector, of which 90 percent were teachers. Analytical work has underscored the mismatch
between staff competencies and job requirements which continues to impede sector
performance. There is moreover evidence of weaknesses in the management and deployment
of human resources, which result in low efficiency of public education sector expenditures
and considerable pressure on the national budget. According to the CSE report (2008), only
37.5 percent of lower-secondary education teachers worked the full legal hours (24 hours per
week) in 2007.

83.     Government measures. The EEP intends to address this cross-cutting issue through a
series of measures and actions. Institutional capacity, especially at regional and provincial
levels, will be strengthened through a redeployment plan alongside an appropriate
qualification training program, using a job-competency-based approach. In order to promote
an effective decentralization of human resource management, the Government intends to give
greater responsibilities to the AREF to make decisions regarding staff recruitment,
deployment and evaluation. In addition, job positions for the new teaching personnel will be
provided on a contractual basis. Finally, the Government program includes key on-going
actions that will lead to a more effective implementation of the deconcentration and
decentralization process, notably the transfer of other critical responsibilities to the AREFs.

84.    EDPP prior actions and triggers. The prior actions under the EDPLl "system
performance" strand are:
    0  The MOE receives authorization, pursuant to Royal Decree No. 1.09.100 dated June 29,
       2009, to transfer teacher training colleges to universities, with a view to creating new
       university programs in pre-service teacher education. Transferring teacher training
       colleges to universities is the first step in setting up pre-service teaching training, for
       all levels of the schools sectors from pre-school to upper secondary education, as a
       two-stage program that consists of a university qualification (either bachelor's or

                                              30
master's degree) followed by a professional qualification delivered by regional
training centers. The overall aim of this change is to improve the quality of new
teachers entering the school system by ensuring a good mix of subject knowledge and
professional skills.
The MOE adopts a strategic human resource management action plan 2009-2012.
Human resource management reform - for both teaching and administrative staff -
must be at the heart of the EEP. The action plan sets out a road map that covers: (i)
decentralization of human resource management functions to AREFs; (ii)
strengthening of human resource management tools, procedures and methodologies;
and (iii) building of capacity, including in the area of communications, amongst
human resource managers.
Each AREF develops and adopts with the MOE a program-contract for the period
2009-201 2. The Government is applying a contracting approach to decentralization in
a number of sectors, including education. In the schools sector, each AREF has for
the first time drawn up a "Regional EEP 2009-2012" and a more detailed "Regional
Mid-Term Action Plan" that indicate what activities it will carry out to meet its own
EEP goals. These documents were presented to the AREF Boards during their July
2009 session and will form the basis of an agreement with the MOE during 2010.
The Government, through AREFs, provides for a discretionary budget for primary
schools' and colleges' non-staff-related recurrent costs for the school year 2009/10.
As part of the on-going decentralization of responsibilities to more local levels of
administration, the Government, for the 2009/10 school year, has provided for a
transfer of funds right out to schools themselves. Each school, or rather an association
set up for the purpose of receiving the funds for each school, is allocated up to MAD
50,000 for the school year. This budget can be used at the discretion of the
association, which is headed by the school principal. In this first year of operation, the
MOE is providing guidelines to assist each association in allocating the budget across
a number of different expenditure categories. The total amount allocated for transfer
to these school associations accounts for 11 percent of the non-staff-related recurrent
budget allocated in the 201 0 budget to AREFs for school education.

The EDPL2 triggers under this strand are:
The MOE develops and adopts competency guidelines for pre-service teacher
education (pre-school/primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education). As
noted above, the MOE aims to improve the quality of new teachers by establishing a
new pre-service teacher training system (university degree plus professional
qualification). The guidelines will describe the competencies that all new teachers
must master as they graduate from this two-stage training system.
The MOE develops and adopts a mechanism for rationalizing human resource
allocation in the schools sector (covering teacher redeployment, mobility and
retention). At present, there are a multitude of transactions that occur in the area of
human resource allocation at the national, regional and provincial levels, which makes
for an inefficient distribution of teachers and administrators across the schools sector.
The MOE aims to streamline procedures - both in enabling mobility and encouraging
retention as required by local circumstances - particularly with a view to increasing
AREFs' authority in this domain.
The MOE transfers to AREFs the responsibility for human resource management
decisions that are not subject to the MEF's prior review. As a further step in

                                     51
       devolving human resource management, AREFs will be able to take decisions that
       have hitherto been taken only at the central level, provided that those decisions are not
       subject to MEF's prior review. At a later stage, it is envisaged that even the decisions
       that are subject to MEF's prior review will be handed on to AREFs.
       The MOE evaluates the results of, and draws lessons from, the first year of
       implementation of school charters and their funding, on the basis of a representative
       sample of schools. Having encouraged schools to adopt their own charters and having
       provided for a transfer of a discretionary budget directly to school associations, the
       MOE will consider the effects of this new approach and adapt the mechanism in
       response to the findings.

86.    Complementary actions. Under the second strand, complementary actions already
undertaken include:
       The MOE, through AREFs, implements at least 70 percent of its 2009 in-service
       teacher training program.
       The MOE develops and adopts competency guidelines in administration for schools sector
       managers.
       The MOE establishes, in collaboration with a private operator, an internet-based
       platform enabling communication between teaching and administrative staff.

       The planned complementary actions under this strand include:
       The regional training centers enroll the first cohort of university graduates in a pre-
       service training program that delivers a professional qualification, on the basis of
       quantitative and qualitative needs expressed by AREFs.
       The MOE establishes a system of in-service training that leads to certification, and
       puts in place appropriate training management tools.
       The MOE establishes a multi-year plan for pre-service and in-service training for
       school principals, based on the competency guidelines.
       The MOE establishes a system and structure for assessing school principals'
       performance (linking assessment to promotion).
       The MOE establishes a planning system for matching staff, positions and profiles in
       the schools sector.
       At least 80 percent of primary and lower secondary schools establish a school
       management committee.

1 1 Mobilize and utilize resources financing, partnership, communication, social
 1:
mobilization and implication of the private sector)

88.     Description. The Government aims to mobilize and better use resources through a
strategy that involves working both with central government partners as well as with school
communities and private sector partners.

89.     Challenge. The execution of the EEP will require sizeable financing - about MAD 34
billion (US$ 4.1 billion) over a four-year period (2009-12) - which represents a significant
increase of public sector financing over the implementation period. While the provision of
private education has expanded over time, the private sector's contribution to total enrollment
in the sector remains relatively low (about 7.7 percent for primary and secondary education
and 5.6 percent for tertiary education).

                                            32
90.     Government measures. The EEP identified a series of saving and efficiency measures,
whose implementation would contribute to greater sustainability in the long run. These
include the reduction of repetition rates, the introduction of multi-subject teachers in lower
secondary education, teacher deployment and utilization measures, and contract-based
management. The EEP aims also to manage budgeting systems in a more effective manner,
developing better planning tools and strengthening AFCEFs ability to plan and execute
regional budgets. The move to have AREFs finalize their budgets at the start of the fiscal
year is a major step forward, since up until now their budgets have not been ready until the
middle of the year, resulting in uneven and inefficient spending. In addition, stakeholder
"voice" is to be strengthened through a more formal arrangement between schools and parent
associations.

91.     EDPP prior actions and triggers. The prior actions under the EDPLl "resources"
strand are:
    0   The MOE develops a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the schools
        sector for the period 2010-2012. An important innovation for the MOE in improving
        the predictability of its budget allocations, the MTEF is also critical in integrating the
        EEP projects into the MOE's overall work program.
    0   Each AREF Board adopts its 2010 budget before January 31, 2010. While AREF
        Boards have been charged since their creation in 2000 with preparing and adopting an
        annual budget, this event has in past years typically not occurred until the middle of
        the fiscal year or later. For the first time, AREF budgets were adopted at the very
        beginning of the fiscal year, which provides greater certainty to the officials
        responsible for implementing projects and activities at the regional level and allows
        for a more even implementation rhythm across the entire year.
    0   The MOE issues a ministerial decision No. 134 dated September 23, 2009, setting out a
        Charter on relations between schools and their parent associations. The Charter aims
        to give parents a stronger voice in school affairs and thereby create greater
        "ownership" of the school by its community. The Charter should encourage school
        management and parent associations to engage with each other, by setting out a
        common framework of roles and responsibilities.

92.       The EDPL2 trigger under this strand is:
      0   Each AREF establishes its own commitment accounting information system, enabling
          it to describe its budget commitments and track their use. Despite having been
          established a decade ago, AREFs in general still have weak information systems,
          including weak financial information systems. This weakness not only hampers day-
          to-day management of the schools sector at the regional level but also limits AREFs'
          accountability to the MOE, to Government in general, and to the public at large. A
          first step then is to institute a commitment accounting information system, focusing on
          the tracking of budget commitments and budget use. A later step will be to develop a
          financial and cost accounting system.

93.    Complementary actions. Under the third strand, the complementary action already
undertaken is:



                                              33
      0   The MOE signs a Partnership Framework with the extended donors group, as well as a
          Memorandum of Understanding (with an Operational Manual) with the core donors
          group, on their support for the education sector.

94.       The planned complementary actions under this strand include:
      0   The MOE publishes the results of its "Public Expenditure Review" and "Public
          Expenditure Tracking Survey" for the schools sector.
      0   The MOE carries out a study to develop an action plan for establishing a financial and
          cost accounting system in AREFs.
          The MOE carries out a study to develop an action plan for transferring responsibility
          for asset management to AREFs.
          The MOE adopts and implements its strategic framework for the development of
          private education.

VI.       OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

Poverty and social impact

95.     Policies and interventions to be supported by the proposed EDPP are largely pro-poor
and promote equity. The EDPP aims to improve physical and financial accessibility of basic
education for all school-aged children in an equitable manner. The monitoring framework
ensures that key indicators are tracked both by gender and by urbadrural location. The EDPP
is expected to improve the inclusiveness of the overall country's economic and social
development by providing the poor and the marginalized with the capacity to reap the benefits
of economic opportunities. The execution of supply- and demand-side interventions would be
driven by the need to narrow the gap between lagging and leading geographical regions
(especially between urban, rural and semi-urban areas): (i) piloting of "community" schools in
select remote areas and the provision of a complete schooling environment, including
boarding facilities to primary school-aged children, under partnership arrangements with
qualified NGOs; (ii) enhancement of demand-side actions (including the ongoing pilot CCT
program to improve school retention in disadvantaged areas with a focus on girls), and the
development of a more integrated strategy to ensure equal access to and retention in primary
education; and (iii) focus on improving the learning conditions in existing pre-schools in
rural areas to largely benefit poor households. Negative impacts are likely to be low.
Through evaluation, the effectiveness and impacts of the different interventions being
proposed will be assessed.

96.      One area where the EDPP may generate some adverse social impact relates to the
implementation of the teacher deployment project. According to the results of a beneficiary
assessment survey conducted in 2007-08 by the CSE on a sample of about 2000 teachers of
primary, lower secondary and upper secondary education, only 39 percent of the surveyed
teachers were fully satisfied with their job locations. At the same time, the report found that
utilization of the existing workforce was far from optimal. This pointed to the need to take
some concrete actions to remedy the situation and increase efficiency in human resource
management. These actions are likely to impact lifestyles and generate resentment. The
MOE is aware of the issue and is consulting and discussing with the teachers' unions on ways
to remedy this risk, including addressing the incentive structure.


                                             34
97.     While the EEP's school construction program lies outside the proposed EDPP, it
should be noted that some potentially negative impacts may arise from land acquisitions
connected to this school construction program. The EEP benefits from Morocco's overall
progress on environmental protection, and lessons learned under PARSEM. Accumulation of
arrears in compensations for resettlement with respect to land acquisitions has been a generic
issue in Morocco, even though the Government has deployed some effort to reduce the stock
of these arrears over the past years. In this context, the PARSEM contained clauses in the
Legal Agreement regarding the construction of schools. No schools were to be built on
purchased land. A technical audit was carried out in June 2009 to assess the situation of
arrears and to review the implementation of school construction during the implementation
period of PARSEM with respect to resettlement measures and land acquisition. The technical
audit led to a productive and active dialogue between the Bank and the Government on ways
to strengthen the application of the country's resettlement rules in the future.

98.     The Government is addressing past land acquisition issues and is establishing a
process to accelerate the compensation payment along the following lines: (i) establishment of
a database at the level of the AREFs to provide a status of land parcels on which schools or
education infrastructures have been built, including payment of compensations; (ii)
                                  ,


preparation of a comprehensive report regarding the status of arrears and establishment of a
monitoring system to clear these arrears; and (iii) payment of compensation in the three-
month delay after the taking of land through an amenable contract or after the judicial ruling
is pronounced.

99.     Some structural weaknesses in the practices related to land acquisition were noted in a
recent assessment of the Social and Environmental Management Aspects under EEP. The
assessment, carried out by AFD in the context of a joint donor mission (30 November -
December 3 2009), recommended that the Government pursue its intention to resolve land
acquisition issues accumulated under PARSEM (applying the "Framework Related to Land
Acquisition for School Infrastructure" [Cadre relatifii 1 `acquisition de terrains d`assiette pour
la re`alisation d'inj-astructures scolaires]) and avoid past practices by minimizing and
regularizing land acquisitions. This will need: (i) better coordination between DAGBP, DCP
and AREFs to both avoid past problems of infrastructure maintenance and address unresolved
issues related to the land acquisition process; and (ii) a training program aimed at filling the
capacity gap within the different management units. The assessment also recommended that
an inventory of new future acquisitions be drafted and kept up to date by EEP's coordination
entity.

100. Based on past experiences and cognizant of the potential impact that the
mismanagement of land acquisition issues can have on the effectiveness of the EEP, the
Government is already acting on some of recommendations outlined above. For future land
acquisition, including under the EEP, the MOE has out-sourced the land acquisition due
diligence to a specialized institution (Agence nationale de la proprie`te`fonciire). This agency
can address both coordination and capacity issues constraining the effectiveness and equity of
land acquisition process.

Environmental aspects

101. The EEP's school construction program lies outside the proposed EDPP. The
proposed operation is therefore not likely to have significant negative effects on the
                                             35
environment, forestry and other natural resources. In implementing the Government's EEP,
the MOE intends applying the "Environmental and Social Protection Framework"*'. The
Framework aims to prevent, attenuate or compensate for a range of negative impacts that may
arise from school construction: (i) damage to buildings caused by natural conditions
(flooding, erosion, earthquakes, landslides, etc.); (ii) reduction in the quality of building use
caused by social conditions (lack of hygiene, overcrowding); and (iii) damage caused by poor
design, poor construction or poor usage (excessive felling of surrounding trees, incorrect
management of waste water, etc.). At the same time, the Framework aims to ensure that: (i)
the safety and security of buildings' users are guaranteed; (ii) energy use is as efficient as
possible; (iii) buildings are accessible to disabled users; (iv) sites are managed in ways that
respect users' and neighbors' health and well-being (e.g., efficient water use, waste
management, management of dangerous goods, proper use of safety equipment); and (v) all
land acquired is suitable for school construction. The proper application of the Framework
allows for the timely collection of information, the detection of environmental problems and
the remediation of such problems.

102. Although considered useful, the Framework was not fully implemented under
PARSEM, mainly due to: (i) lack of coordination between the DAGBP, DCP, and the
AREFs; and (ii) capacity constraints affecting the institutions above, particularly the AREFs.
The MOE, through the DAGBP and DCP, will need to put in place a fully operational system
to apply the Framework, in order for AREFs to effectively apply measures to prevent negative
impacts of school construction activities. With a number of AREFs already experiencing
difficulties in managing their school asset base, it will be important that these AREFs are able
to strengthen their capacities in this area in order to be able to take on the additional load
required by EEP implementation. The DCP has responded to this situation by deciding to hire
a firm to manage the EEP construction program (including the related environmental issues),
with the firm having as part of its mandate the requirement to transfer skills to the relevant
AREFs. For their part, the DAGBP and DCP are called on to pool their resources to ensure a
better coordination of environmental management issues, especially in monitoring departures
from the Framework guidelines, determining the cause of these deficiencies and providing
remedies.

 103.       AFD has begun supporting the MOE and AREFs in the strengthening of their
environmental management functions, by including specialized technical assistance in the
joint TFP missions. The donors' joint supervision missions will continue to provide this
technical support throughout the EEP implementation period, under the AFD or NIF financing
mechanisms.

Implementation, monitoring and evaluation

Implementation

104. Under Government leadership, the MOE's Department of School Education (DES)
will be assigned overall responsibility for EEP implementation. Implementation will be
carried out under a matrix organizational structure with a "thematic" dimension and a
"regional" dimension, ensuring coherence in the execution of the reforms. Central and

                                                                                       lEB-4A63-4CD3-

regional steering committees have been established, and these committees will be mirrored by
similar structures also at the provincial and school levels. The Central Steering Committee
(CSC), which is chaired by the Minister, sets overall EEP objectives and priorities, reconciles
decisions, finds solutions to issues and provides a report-back system for decision-making.
The CSC is comprised of key members of the Minister's Office, as well as the Director of
Strategy, Statistics, Strategy and Planning and the Director of Budget. The CSC holds
monthly meetings which are periodically extended to include other central directors, the
national coordinators and/or the AREF directors. The Regional Steering Committee (RSC),
led by the AREF Director, guides the strategic direction of the Emergency Plan at the regional
levels. Specifically, the RSC defines the implementation path of the regional programs,
validates the action plans and monitors their implementation. Finally, the MOE will establish
a Project Management Office, operated and staffed by a consulting firm, to carry out the core
project management functions at the central, regional and provincial levels.

105.    More generally, according to the law22 establishing the network of AREFs, each
AREF is administered by a board comprising inter alia MOE representatives, the regional
council chairperson, the regional governor, the provincial governors, local authority
chairpersons, university rectors and representatives of teachers' groups, parents' groups and
employers' groups. The AREF board meets at least twice a year, and is charged with
deciding on a work program and budget for the year ahead and presenting a report on the
preceding year's work program. The AREF itself is managed by a director, with
responsibility at the regional level for developing education plans (including multi-year
school construction plans), executing school construction activities, supervising teaching and
evaluating learning in schools, carrying out devolved human resource management tasks
(including the organization of teacher professional development activities), licensing private
schools, and promoting relations with regional agencies with a view to improving education.

                                                                                    37
Monitoring and evaluation

106. The EDPP supports the results-based management put forward by the Government's
EEP. The implementation progress will be monitored based on a results-framework which
comprises the results/outcomes indicators highlighted in the policy matrix to measure
progress regarding the three policy areas (see Annex 2), as well as a set of sectoral
performance indicators (see Annex 3). These indicators - net enrollment rates, completion
rates, and learning assessment results - will be disaggregated for gender and urbardrural areas.
These indicators will be closely monitored during supervision and review missions. In
addition, surveys and studies are planned to evaluate the effectiveness and/or the impact of
some key reforms or innovations (see Annex 4).

Fiduciary aspects

107. With the DPL instrument, the MOE and AREFs will use Government procurement
procedures and the Government financial management system in executing the EDPP. At
country level, no major fiduciary issues are expected for the proposed EDPP. The Moroccan
public administration operates in a structured and reliable control environment. It presents
low fiduciary risk, even though efficiency and effectiveness can be enhanced. On
procurement, Morocco has been pre-selected to be part of the Bank's initiative regarding the
use of country systems.

108. Fiduciary risks at the education sector level are considered moderate. MOE, as an
administration, is subject to prior control by the Finance Ministry's Treasury and External
Financing Department. A Ministerial Controller is appointed to each government ministry,
and has qualified personnel in charge of the prior control of commitment (thus procurement)
and payment. The agent is located within the premises of the MOE. Similarly, AREFs, as
public corporations, are subject to prior control by the Finance Ministry's Department of
State-Owned Enterprises and Privatization. Each AREF appoints a Financial Controller who
is in charge of financial and procurement control of a number of public corporations in the
region. The fiduciary assessment work has showed that, while some progress has been made
in improving the existing fiduciary management capacity of the AREFs during the past years,
some weaknesses remain and require further strengthening. These include: (i) the need to
develop a procurement management manual and mechanisms for monitoring complaints at
the AREF levels; (ii) the need to improve the reliability of the financial and accounting data
through a full computerizing of the financial management system; and (ii) the need to further
strengthen the capacity of regional staff in procurement and financial management. The
Bank and other donors have discussed these issues with the MOE and a draft action plan has
been prepared to this end.

109. Morocco has had no safeguard assessment by the Fund. However, over the many
years of working with Government, the Bank has had no major fiduciary issues in relation to
the funds flow. The Government budget is comprehensive, unified and subject to centralized
treasury account. Cash flow and debt are professionally managed by the Finance Ministry's
Treasury and External Financing Department under generally satisfactory conditions. Loan
proceeds are deposited in a government designated account at the Central Bank and
transferred to the Treasury single account for the Government budget.


                                            38
Procurement

110. The 2007 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) and the 2008 CPAR
Update showed that Morocco's procurement procedures, regulations, and standards are
broadly satisfactory. With some improvements in the medium-term, the Government has the
potential to align itself with international practice and standards. This has led to the pre-
selection of Morocco into the Bank's initiative regarding the use of country systems. An in-
depth dialogue is under way between the Bank and the Government in this regard. In the
education sector specifically however, the AREFs show evidence of limited capacity in
managing their budgets in general and in carrying out procurement in particular. The
Program Policy Matrix responds to this by recognizing improvements in AREFs budget
planning and execution (see Annex 2).

Financial management

111. In response to a Government request, the Bank issued a 2007 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) Update, following the 2003 CFAA. The experience
gained by the Bank in Morocco and the key findings of the 2007 CFAA report show that
Moroccan sector fiduciary risk is low. Morocco's public finance system is governed by a
well-developed legal and regulatory framework, and generally provides solid guarantees in
terms of reliability and transparency. This system is predicated on the principle of the strict
separation of the roles of payment authorizer (ordonnateur) and public accountant, who are
financially responsible to the Audit Office, and on the principles governing ex ante
expenditure control and internal and external audits. The rating is due in large part to the
steady and continued Government efforts and major reforms to modernize and improve the
efficiency of the public sector, including the public financial management of the past several
years. These reforms are on-going.

112. The CFAA update recommended improvements in a number of areas; including: (i)
reducing the delays to produce the year-end government financial statements and accounts, as
well as the accounts audited by the Court of Accounts; (ii) further simplification of the a
priori internal controls while continuing strengthen the ex-post controls and internal audit
already under way; and (iii) continuing the progress in the management information system
under way.

1 13. Progress in implementing the Public Administration Reform Program has been
broadly on track, surpassing plans in certain areas while being slow in other areas. Hence, in
the area of budget management, the Government has: (i) introduced budget flexibility norms
that have facilitated transfers among resources in 30 ministries that represent above 90 percent
of non-wage expenditures; (ii) completed aggregate and sector Medium-Term Expenditure
Frameworks (MTEFs) in 12 ministries, with generalization in progress; (iii) introduced
performance budgeting (with explicit performance indicators) in 22 ministries, with
extension to other ministries under way; and (iv) completed a study to reform control of
public expenditure, which has led to the elimination of a priori control and the merging of two
directorates involved, thereby contributing to cutting paperwork time by about half and
making public expenditure processing more efficient.

114. The Government is already engaged in all of the above areas and intends to enhance
budget transparency and anti-corruption policies, while improving accountability in delivering
                                            39
services, through the introduction of e-government and further simplification of procedures.
These are currently under discussion between the Bank and the Government.

Disbursement and auditing

115. To address fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control environment, the Borrower
will maintain a dedicated foreign currency deposit account (DA) for the proceeds of the Loan,
and will report on the funds flow of the dedicated DA. The Government will, if deemed
necessary by IBRD, allow an independent external audit of the dedicated foreign currency
DA.

Disbursement

116. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness.
Loan proceeds will be deposited by IBRD in an account designated by the Borrower at the
Central Bank of Morocco. The Borrower should ensure that upon deposit of the loan
proceeds into said account an equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's budget. The
Borrower will send a letter to the World Bank acknowledging receipt of funds. The loan
proceeds will be administered by the MEF.

Auditing

1 17. Although an audit of the use of the funds may not be required, IBRD reserves the right
to require audits of the DA at any time. Other partners have aligned audit to June 30 each
year.

Risks and risk mitigation

11 8. The reform program may be confronted by resistance from unions, including teacher
resistance to the efficiency measures and the move toward greater accountability. The
Government will engage in a broader and more consistent dialogue with teacher unions, and
will create a buy-in to the reform program through participation and decision-making. In
addition, there will be a need to work more closely with universities to prepare a new
generation of leaders ready to respond to the challenges ahead in a changed environment. In
addition, teachers, as equal partners, must be able to participate in the strategic framework for
increased quality and positive outcomes.

119. Attainment of the EEP objectives could be constrained by financing mobilization.
While the Government has demonstrated its commitment to the EEP by providing adequate
funding under the 2009 and 2010 budgets, it may not be able to stay on this path in the
coming years, if the country's macro-budget framework becomes too stretched due to other
factors. Results of economic and financial analysis show that the EEP execution will lead to
an increase of the share of the sector budget to GDP from 6 to 7 percent during the four year
period, and that this pressure on public finance could only be sustainable if economic growth
remains high (at least 5 percent) and if efficiency measures are effectively applied. The Bank
and other donors will pursue the discussions with the MOE to further prioritize their
expenditure programs so as to better align it both to the country's financial capacity and
existing absorptive capacity.

                                            40
120. Ensuring adequate institutional capacity to support reform implementation remains a
key challenge. The Government is aware of this issue and this is dealt with to some extent in
the EEP. A wide range of measures and actions have been identified, including the
implementation of alternative approaches such as outsourcing in service delivery. In addition,
coordinated efforts have been deployed by the main donors to mobilize sizeable resources to
support capacity building and technical assistance needs.

     Le secteur de l'education a toujours ete une priorite nationale. I1 est a la tete des
preoccupations de toutes les composantes de la societe marocaine.

       Les extraits suivants des discours de SM le Roi Mohammed VI temoignent
solennellement de la place primordiale reservee au secteur de 1'Education et a
l'interet constant qui lui est accorde.

      ((La re'forme judicieuse du systime d'e'ducation et de formation est la voie
essentielle h emprunter pour relever les de'fis du de'veloppement, car il faut bien
reconnaftre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une simple re'forme sectorielle, mais d'un combat
salutaire face h un de'$ d'une grande ampleur:

      Si Nous avons place' l'enseignement en t&te de ces secteurs, c'est parce que
Nous le tenons pour itre un ve'ritable baromitre h l'aune duquel se mesurent la
valeur, la pertinence et l'impact de toute re'forme profonde. Et pour que la re'forme
de notre systime d'e'ducation atteigne sa vitesse de croisiire et prenne le bon cap,
Nous appelons le gouvernement h assurer la mise en euvre ade'quate du Plan
d'Urgence y affe'rent.

        A cet e'gard, Nous veillerons a ce que le Maroc ne manque pas son rendez-
 vous avec cette re'forme cruciale, qui requiert l'adhe'sion forte et re'solue de tous.
 Car, en de'finitive, toutes les conditions de re'ussite sont re'unies, en l'occurrence la
forte de'termination de Notre Majeste', la mobilisation de 1'ensemble des institutions,
 des autorite's et les pouvoirs publics, ainsi que les acteurs et les structures
 organise'es du secteur. Notre objectif commun est de re'habiliter l'e'cole publique
 marocaine et de conforter la confiance dans cette institution qui a pour vocation
 d'instiller dans la collectivite' les valeurs de citoyennete' engage'e et de consacrer le
principe d'e'galite' des chances.

       I1 importe, en premier lieu, de gagner le pari vital de la re'forme, en
profondeur, de l'e'ducation et de la formation, re'forme dont de'pend l'avenir des
ge'ne'rations pre'sentes et h venir.

      A cet e'gard, nous appelons le prochain gouvernement h s'atteler sans tarder h
la mise en place d'un Plan d'Urgence pour consolider ce qui a e'te' re'alise' et
proce'der aux re'ajustements qui s 'imposent, en veillant h une application optimale
des dispositions de la Charte nationale d'e'ducation et de formation. n Extraits des
discours de SM le Roi Mohammed VI

      Aussi, depuis l'annee 2000, le Maroc a entame une reforme de son systeme
educatif dont les leviers et les termes de references sont preconises dans la Charte
nationale d'education et de formation. La strategie adoptee vise d'une part
l'accroissement de l'efficacite des prestations du systbme, l'amelioration de sa
gestion et la repartition equitable de son offre en vue d'instaurer une egalite des
chances entre milieux et genres, tout en accentuant des efforts sur les zones
defavorisees et en ciblant les communautes a besoins specifiques. D'autre part, elle
vise une reactivitk adequate du systbme par rapport aux besoins en ressources
humaines exprimes par les differents secteurs de l'economie et de la societe, ainsi,

                                             43
notre pays aspire desormais a l'atteinte des normes internationales en matiere de
qualite de l'education.

      Cependant, a la fin de la decennie, le bilan des realisations de la reforme reste
mitige malgri les efforts deployes et en depit des avancees constatees dans beaucoup
de domaines, il reste encore du chemin a parcourir.

      Face a ce constat, SM le Roi Mohammed VI, dans son discours prononce a
l'occasion de l'ouverture de la session parlementaire a l'automne 2007, a donne ses
Hautes Instructions pour que soit elabore un Programme d'urgence, visant
l'acceleration de la mise en Oeuvre de la reforme sur les quatre annees 2009-2012.

      Dans l'immediat, une feuille de route a et6 presentee, elle definit de faqon
precise et concrete le programme d'acceleration de l'achevement de la reforme du
secteur telle que preconisee par la Charte. C'est dans ce cadre que le Ministere de
1'Education Nationale, de 1'Enseignement Superieur, de la Formation des Cadres et
de la Recherche Scientifique (MENESFCRS) a elabore un Programme d'Urgence
pour la periode 2009-2012. Au cours de son elaboration, le Programme d'Urgence a
beneficie d'une serie de consultations aupres des differentes parties prenantes, qu'il
s'agisse de gestionnaires des services centraux et deconcentres du Ministere, de
parlementaires, de syndicats ou de representants d'autorites locales. Ce programme
ambitieux qui temoigne d'une approche a la fois novatrice et pragmatique, vise a
donner un nouvel elan aux orientations de la Charte.

      Le Programme d'Urgence s'organise autour des espaces d'intervention
identifies comme prioritaires dans le ((Rapport national sur 1'Ctat de 1'Ecole et ses
perspectives)) elabore en 2008 par le Conseil Superieur de 1'Enseignement (CSE).

      Le principe directeur de ce programme consiste a placer l'apprenant au cceur
du systeme d'education et de formation et mettre tous les leviers de la reforme a son
service.

      Le programme d'action propose par le Programme d'Urgence vise a repondre
a quatre objectifs cles :
  0 Espace 1 : Rendre effective l'obligatoire de la scolarite jusqu'a 1'8ge de 15 ans;

  0 Espace 2: Stimuler l'initiative et l'excellence au lycee et a l'universite;

  0 Espace 3 : Affronter les problematiques transversales du systeme;
  0 Espace 4: Se donner les moyens de le reussir est une condition determinante.

           1.       ESPACE 1 :RENDRE EFFECTIVE L'OBLIGATOIRE DE LA
                     SCOLARITE JUSQU'A L 'AGE DE 15 ANS :

      I1 est en effet essentiel de mettre en application la loi de l'obligation de la
scolarite en vigueur, en adoptant une approche volontariste pour que la quasi totalite
des enfants de 6 ans entrent a l'ecole et y restent jusqu'a l'tige de 15 ans. Tous les

                                          45
leviers tant quantitatifs que qualitatifs seront enclenches a cette fin. I1 s'agit a ce
propos de developper l'offre du prescolaire, d'etendre le reseau des etablissements
scolaires, et leur capacit6 d'accueil, de rehabiliter les ecoles et les colleges en vue
d'offrir aux apprenants des conditions satisfaisantes et favorables pour
l'apprentissage et de renforcer la qualit6 de la vie et de l'environnement scolaire et
garantir aux enfants sant6 et securite. I1 est egalement question de mettre en place
des mesures visant a assurer une egalite des chances pour la scolarisation des ((
exclus )) (filles, enfants a besoins specifiques, enfants ddmunis, enfants des zones
enclavees), de mener une politique efficace de lutte contre le redoublement et le
decrochage scolaire. Cette lutte sera renforcee par la mise en euvre a titre
experimental, dans des sites pilotes, d'une approche integree de soutien pour
l'incitation a la demande de scolarisation en milieu rural.

      I1 est aussi necessaire d'ameliorer la qualite des apprentissages en les
recentrant sur les savoirs et les competences de base et en mettant en euvre une
pedagogie d'integration par le biais d'une rdecriture des curricula. Cette refonte sera
principalement articulee sur l'approche par competence comme choix stratkgique.
En outre, la creation des cellules responsables des activites d'evaluation des acquis
scolaires au niveau regional contribuera egalement A l'amelioration de la qualite des
apprentissages.

     2.      ESPACE 2 :STIMULER L 'INITIATIFE L 'EXCELLENCE AU LYCEE
                                             ET
                           E T A L'UNIVERSITE:

      I1 est egalement important d'encourager et developper la scolarisation au dela
de l'fige de 15 ans, au niveau de l'enseignement secondaire qualifiant puis de
l'enseignement superieur, A cette fin, toutes les mesures necessaires seront prises
pour developper l'offre du secondaire qualifiant et y promouvoir l'excellence,
renforcer l'offre de l'enseignement superieur dans le but d'en faciliter l'acces et
garantir l'employabilite de ses laureats et valoriser d'avantage la recherche
scientifique.

     3.       ESPACE 3: AFFRONTER LES PROBLEM TIQUES TRANSFERSALES
                              DU SYSTEME:

      En effet, pour faire aboutir a bon port la reforme, la resolution des
problematiques transversales du systeme s'impose. I1 s'agit d'une part d'assurer un
engagement et une forte adhesion du personnel de l'enseignement dans la reforme.
Toute mesure d'amelioration devra, imperativement passer par le personnel de
l'education, qui doit &re a meme de l'assimiler et de la mettre en execution. Dans
cette optique, il est necessaire de renforcer les competences, d'assurer un meilleur
encadrement et une formation consistante et de revaloriser le metier de ces acteurs
cles du systeme de l'education, tout en enrichissant la formation initiale par la
creation de nouvelles filieres universitaires des enseignants (prescolaire primaire,
college lycee). I1 est d'autre part impdratif de mettre en place une gouvernance
responsable, garante d'un pilotage efficace du systeme, de son amelioration
continue, et de creer en l'occurrence un dispositif d'optimisation des ressources
humaines de l'enseignement scolaire, qui traitera des operations du redeploiement de
la mobilite et de la sedentarisation.
                                       46
      La creation d'un conseil de gestion pour chaque etablissement permettra une
gestion et une planification ascendante par le biais des projets d'etablissements et
favorisera la remontee de l'information de sa source reelle. Ceci est renforce par la
mise en place des associations d'appui aux etablissements scolaires.

      L'integration des TICE dans nos etablissements scolaires permettra de faire
profiter les eleves des avantages offerts par les nouvelles technologies en matiere du
developpement des apprentissages. L'entree de notre systeme a l'ere du numerique
est donc necessaire et incontournable. Le programme GENIE est dedi6 a cet objectif.

       Le Ministere s'oriente vers la deconcentration et la decentralisation quasi
totale de ses services. Le transfert aux AREF des actes de gestion des ressources
humaines non soumis au contriile de regularite sera une grande avancee dans ce
sens. Le parachevement de la decentralisation est donc prevu a court terme pour
favoriser la mise en place d'une demarche participative et de la gestion axee sur les
resultats, et pour faciliter la clarification et la precision des responsabilites et des
riiles des entites et des individus et la mise en Oeuvre d'outils de pilotage addquats.

      En tant que composante essentielle de la reussite scolaire et de l'integration
professionnelle, la maitrise des langues constitue egalement une probldmatique
transversale cle sur laquelle il est important de se pencher, a travers une
modernisation des methodes d'apprentissages de la langue arabe, la promotion de la
langue amazigh et la maitrise de langues etrangeres. De meme, l'efficacite du
systeme de l'education et de la formation est Cgalement tributaire d'un dispositif
d'orientation performant capable d'euvrer et contribuer efficacement a l'addquation
des outputs du systeme avec les besoins de l'economie nationale en general et du
marche de l'emploi en particulier.

       Le Programme d'Urgence a beneficie d'un consensus general, Le Ministere
organise en permanence des rencontres de concertation avec tous les acteurs
concernes notamment les ONG, les associations des parents d'eleves, et surtout les
syndicats, dans une tentative d'instaurer la paix sociale et de satisfaire dans la
mesure du possible toutes les revendications legitimes et dans un espoir d'atteindre
la satisfaction de toutes les parties prenantes.

      Par ailleurs, compte tenu de l'envergure du systeme Cducatif et de l'etendue
des effectifs, la seule faqon d'assurer une circulation de l'information fluide, rapide
et transparente consiste a doter l'enseignement scolaire d'un systeme d'information
coherent, integre, deploye aux niveaux central, regional, provincial, et local, et
offrant une couverture fonctionnelle satisfaisante pour les cinq domaines cles a
savoir :
           0   Ressources Humaines ;
           0   Pedagogie (eleves, emplois du temps, evaluations) ;
           0   Planification / carte scolaire ;
           0   Decisionnel (statistiques, indicateurs) ; et
               Finances et Patrimoine.


                                        47
      Ceci afin d?optimiser le systeme d?information pour une planification et une
gestion du systeme d?education et de formation efficace.

      Dans ce sens, le Ministere a engage des mesures d?amelioration a court tenne
dans les domaines critiques, notamment en matiere de donnees statistiques, de carte
scolaire, de ressources humaines, de budget et de patrimoine, ainsi que de gestion
des etablissements.

       Ainsi, les ajustements necessaires seront realises pour garantir une
disponibilite quasi-totale de l?infrastructure de telecommunication et le dkploiement
des TICE au niveau central et regional. Les Delegations et les Etablissements
scolaires seront egalement dotes des moyens adequats pour assurer leur connectivitk
et leur permettre ainsi l?acces au systeme d?information.

     Concernant les arrangements institutionnels, la reussite de la mise en aeuvre
des projets du Programme d?Urgence necessite la mise en place d?un design
organisationnel bien adapte aux enjeux actuels. A cette fin, le Ministere a mis en
place un dispositif de pilotage en mode projet mobilisant l?ensemble des
competences necessaires aux niveaux central et regional, ainsi que des instances
d?execution et de reporting aux niveaux provincial et local.

       Ainsi, les projets du Programme d?Urgence s?executent selon une organisation
matricielle permettant la garantie d?une coordination entre les differents projets qui
interferent et un avancement optimise des differents chantiers.

      L?ensemble du Programme est supervise par un Comite de Pilotage au niveau
Central (CPC). Un ou plusieurs projets sont domicilies au sein d?une Direction
centrale et un coordinateur au niveau central en assume la coordination.

      Au niveau de chaque region, un ComitC de Pilotage Regional a ete mis en
place ainsi qu?un Coordinateur Regional (CR) pour la coordination des projets. Les
CR nommes au sein des Academies Regionales d?Education et de Formation
(AREF) sont secondes par les Chefs de P81e et les Chef de projet regionaux. Enfin,
des animateurs provinciaux aides des relais provinciaux completent le dispositif
avec les equipes provinciales et les Chefs d?Etablissement.

     La conception de ce design tient compte du support que doit assurer ce dernier
dans l?optimisation, l?integration et la domiciliation des mesures du Programme
d?Urgence au sein des structures du systeme.

       4.       ESPACE 4: SE DONNER LES MOYENS DE LE REUSSIR EST UNE
                        CONDITION DETERMINANTE :

      Cela passera necessairement par une politique stricte d?optimisation et de
perennisation des ressources financieres. L?ampleur des coots revele la dimension
des defis a relever. En consequence, il sera necessaire de mettre en place un
dispositif ad-hoc pour la realisation des objectifs, afin que la problematique du
financement ne soit pas une entrave ou un facteur de ralentissement de la mise en
ceuvre des projets du Programme d?Urgence.
                                       48
      Par ailleurs, compte tenu de la multiplicite des acteurs et du caractere sensible
des problematiques abordees, le "nouveau souffle' ' de la reforme viendra egalement
de la communication qui accompagnera le Programme d'Urgence et de la
mobilisation qu'il suscitera. L'implication et l'adhesion des differents acteurs de la
reforme constitueront les mots d'ordre pour la conduite de la demarche de mise en
Oeuvre. A cette fin, un dispositif de communication, base sur une strategie intdgrke,
accompagnera l'execution des projets du Programme d'Urgence, par le biais
notamment de skminaires, de presentations, d'actions medias et de contacts directs.
Dans ce cadre, la definition de cercles d'adhesion permettra d'assurer une
mobilisation, une responsabilisation et un engagement progressifs de tous.

      Le cadre des depenses a moyen terne (CDMT) pluriannuel, elabore et valid6
par le Ministere au titre de 1'annCe 2010, a pour but d'assurer une meilleure visibilite
des moyens budgetaires a affecter au Programme d'Urgence. En plus, la mise en
place d'un systeme de comptabilite budgetaire permettra d'assurer le suivi de
l'execution du budget.

     Dans le cadre de la decentralisation et de la regionalisation, chaque Academie
Regionale d'Education et de Formation (AREF) a elabore et valide son Programme
d'Urgence Regional decline en Plan d'Action a Moyen Terme Regional (PAMTR),
couvrant la periode 20 10-2012.

      Par ailleurs, le montant du budget global alloue au Programme d'Urgence, lors
de son lancement en 2009, a ete arrete a 34 milliards de dirhams. Cependant, la mise
en Oeuvre de l'ensemble du Programme, sur la periode 2009-2012 pour le secteur de
l'enseignement scolaire, necessitera des ressources financieres complementaires, vu
que le Programme compte actuellement 25 projets au lieu de 23 fixes initialement.

      UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION:

     The education sector has always been a national priority and is the major concern of all
segments of Moroccan society.

     The following extracts from the speeches of His Majesty King Mohammed VI are a
solemn indication of the exceptional consideration and constant interest accorded to the
education sector.

      "The prudent reform of the education and training system is an essential path to follow
in order to respond to the challenges of development, for it must be recognized that this is not
simply a sectoral reform but rather a worthy struggle in the face of a formidable challenge.

       r f We have made education the priority sector, it is because We consider it truly an
indicator by which to measure the value, the relevance and the impact of any signiJicant
reform. And in order that the reform of Our education system reach its cruising speed and
sail in the right direction, We call on the Government to ensure the adequate implementation
of the related Emergency Plan.

       In this respect, We shall take care that Morocco not miss the opportunity presented by
this crucial reform, which requires each and every person 'srobust and resolute commitment.
For it is clear that all the conditions necessary for success are met, namely Our Majesty's
strong determination, and the mobilization of all institutions, authorities and public powers,
as well as sectoral stakeholders and organizations. Our common goal is to modernize the
Moroccan public school and to strengthen confidence in an institution whose purpose is to
instill in the population the values of engaged citizenship and to guarantee the principle of
equal opportunity.

     It is critical first of all to succeed in the essential challenge of carrying out aprofound
reform of education and training, on which depends the future of today's and tomorrow's
generations.

      In this regard, We call on the next Government to turn its attention without delay to the
implementation of the Emergency Plan, with a view to consolidating what has already been
achieved and carrying out the necessary adjustments, while ensuring the optimal application
of the provisions of the National Education and Training Charter." (Extracts from the
speeches of His Majesty King Mohammed VI)

      In 2000 Morocco launched an education system reform whose themes and actions are
laid down in the National Education and Training Charter. On the supply side, the chosen
strategy aims at increasing the effectiveness of education services, improving their
management and ensuring their equitable distribution, with a view to ensuring equal
opportunity irrespective of gender or background, while focusing efforts on disadvantaged
areas and targeting communities having specific needs. On the demand side, the strategy
aims at developing the system's responsiveness in response to the need for human resources
as expressed by different players within the economy and society. In this way, our nation
aspires henceforth to attain international standards of education quality.


                                            50
      However, by the end of the decade, the results of the reform process were modest, in
spite of the efforts made. Although gains have been noted in many areas, much remains to be
done.

      In light of this situation, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, in a speech delivered on the
occasion of the Fall 2007 parliamentary session, issued royal instructions that an Emergency
Program be developed to accelerate the implementation of the reform over the four-year
period 2009-20 12.

      A road map was immediately presented, setting out in a detailed and practical manner a
program to speed up the completion of the sectoral reform as laid out in the Charter. In this
context, the Ministry of Education (MOE) developed an Emergency Program for the period
2009-2012. As it was being prepared, the Emergency Program benefited from a series of
consultations with various stakeholders, including MOE administrators from both the central
and decentralized levels, representatives of unions and local authorities. This ambitious
program, which adopts an approach that is at once innovative and pragmatic, aims to provide
a new impetus to the Charter's major themes.

     The Emergency Program is organized around priority pillars identified as such in the
"National Report on the Status and Future of Schooling" published in 2008 by the Higher
Council of Education.

      The Program's guiding principle requires that the learner be placed at the heart of the
education and training system and that all aspects of the reform be oriented to serve the
learner.

      The Emergency Program lays out an action plan that aims to respond to four key goals:

0   Strategic Direction 1: Achieve universal basic education;
0   Strategic Direction 2: Promote initiative and excellence in post-basic education;
0   Strategic Direction 3: Improve system performance;
0   Strategic Direction 4: Mobilize and utilize resources.

     With the Emergency Program now in its second year of implementation, the
MOE is committed to overcoming difficulties and responding to challenges. The
MOE is mobilizing available resources and seizing all opportunities to achieve
success in the face of these challenges.

            5.      STRATEGIC DIMENSION 1: ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL BASIC
                                EDUCA TION:

      It is indeed critical to apply the law in effect in respect of compulsory
schooling, using a proactive approach, such that almost all 6-year-olds enter the
education system and remain there until the age of 15. Every available means,
whether quantitative or qualitative, will be used to achieve this goal. This involves
developing the supply of pre-school education, extending the network of schools and
increasing their capacity, upgrading primary and junior high schools with a view of
providing learners with an environment conducive to learning, improving the quality

                                         52
of the school experience and school environment, and ensuring students' health and
safety. In addition, measures will be taken to ensure equity of access to schooling
for the "excluded" (girls, children with specific needs, vulnerable children, and
children living in remote areas), and to implement an effective policy of combating
grade repetition and school drop-out.         This policy will be accompanied by the
piloting, in a number of sites, of an integrated approach to providing support that
encourages the demand for schooling in rural areas.

      It is also necessary to improve the quality of learning by refocusing on basic
knowledge and skills and by putting in place an integrated teaching approach that
requires revised curricula. This strategic revision will be designed in large part
around a skills-based approach.      Moreover, the establishment of regional units
responsible for learning assessment activities will contribute to the improvement of
learning quality.

             6.      STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: PROMOTE INITIATIVE AND
                    EXCELLENCE IN POST-BASIC EDUCATION:

       It is equally important to encourage and develop schooling beyond the age of
15, first in upper secondary and then in higher education. To this end, all necessary
steps will be taken to develop the supply, and improve the quality of, upper
secondary education, to extend the supply of higher education with the aim of
facilitating access and guaranteeing graduate employment, and placing a greater
emphasis on scientific research.

        7.        STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: IMPROVE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE:

      Indeed, in order to ensure the success of the reform, cross-cutting problems in
system performance have to be resolved. On the one hand, this involves ensuring
the commitment and strong support of teaching staff in favor of the reform. All
improvements rely necessarily on the sector's personnel, who must be in a position
to assimilate and then implement the reform. In this context, it is necessary to
strengthen skills, provide better supervision and regular training, and professionalize
the roles of these key players in the education system, while at the same time
enriching pre-service training through the establishment of new university-based
programs for pre-school, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary teachers.
On the other hand, it is imperative to put in place governance arrangements that, by
way of accountability, will guarantee an effective stewardship of the education
system, the continuous improvement of the system, and to establish for this purpose
a mechanism that rationalizes school education human resources by means of
redeployment, mobility and retention tools.

      The establishment of management committees in each school will allow,
through school plans, for bottom-up management and planning, and will enable
information to be transmitted from where it is generated.         This mechanism is
strengthened by the establishment of school support associations.

     The integration of information technologies into our schools will enable
students to benefit from the advantages these tools offer in terms of learning
                                        53
development.     The accession of our school system into the digital age is both
necessary and inevitable. The GENIE program has been set up for just this purpose.

      The MOE is committed to the near-complete devolution and decentralization
of its services.       The transfer of responsibility to AREFs for human resource
management decisions not subject to prior review will constitute a major advance in
this direction. The decentralization process is expected to be completed in the short
term in order to allow for the establishment of a participatory results-based
management approach, to clarify and detail the roles and responsibilities of the
various entities and individuals, and to put in place adequate oversight mechanisms.

      As an essential factor in success at school and entry into the labor market, the
mastery of languages is another key cross-cutting issue that must be addressed,
through the modernization of Arabic language teaching methods, the promotion of
Berber languages and the ability to use foreign languages. Moreover, the efficiency
of the education and training system depends on the existence of a solid student
orientation mechanism that is able to make an effective contribution to ensuring a
match between what the system produces and what the national economy in general
and the labor market in particular require.

      The Emergency Program has benefited from a large consensus.           The MOE
regularly organizes consultation meetings with all affected players, notably NGOs,
parents' associations, and especially unions, in an attempt to build positive relations
and to respond as much as possible to all legitimate claims in the hopes of satisfying
the full range of stakeholders.

      In addition, given the size of the education system and the numbers of staff
and students, the only way to ensure that information flows smoothly, rapidly and
openly is to provide the sector with a coherent and integrated information system
that reaches the central, regional, provincial and local levels, and offers an adequate
functional coverage in five key domains, namely:
            0   Human resources;
            0   Teaching (students, timetables, assessments);
            0   Planning and school mapping;
                Monitoring (statistics, indicators); and
                Financial management and asset management.
      ... with a view to optimizing the information system such that it provides for
an effective planning and management of the education and training system.

      With this in mind, the MOE has taken steps to bring about short-term
improvements in critical areas, namely statistical data, school mapping, human
resources, budget and assets, as well as school management.

      Thus, necessary adjustments will be made to guarantee the near-complete
availability of telecommunications infrastructure and the roll-out of new
technologies at the central and regional levels. Provincial offices and schools will
also be provided with appropriate tools that ensure their connectivity and allows
them to access the information system.

                                        54
      With respect to institutional arrangements, success in implementing the
Emergency Program projects relies on an organizational structure that corresponds
to existing challenges. To this end, the MOE has set up a project-based oversight
mechanism that calls on the full set of skills available at the central and regional
offices, as well as provincial and local implementation and reporting structures.

       Thus, the Emergency Program projects are implemented through a matrix-
based organizational structure that guarantees coordination between the various
inter-related projects and optimizes the rate of implementation at the different
project sites.

     The overall Program is under the supervision of a Central Steering Committee.
One or more projects are assigned to a central MOE directorate, while a National
Coordinator is responsible for overall coordination at the central level.

     Within each region, a Regional Steering Committee and a Regional
Coordinator have been appointed to coordinate projects at this level. The Regional
Coordinators, appointed from within their respective AREFs, are assisted by
Thematic Leaders and Regional Leaders. Finally, Provincial Coordinators, assisted
by Provincial Leaders, complete the organizational structure, along with provincial
teams and school principals.

     This design concept takes account of the support that must be provided for the
optimization, integration and assignment of Emergency Program actions within the
education system?s organizational structure.

      8.      STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: MOBILIZE AND UTILIZE RESOURCES:

      This Strategic Direction relies necessarily on the strict application of a policy
of rational and sustainable use of financial resources. The size of the cost estimates
show just how large these challenges are. As a result, it will be necessary to develop
a short-term response to achieve the Program?s goals, in order that the problems of
financing do not prevent or slow down the implementation of Emergency Program
projects.

       Moreover, given the large number of players and the sensitive nature of the
problems to be addressed, the ?wind of change? that the reform represents will also
be carried by the communications strategy that accompanies the Emergency
Program and by the mobilization of stakeholders that this strategy engenders. To
this end, a communications structure, developed on the basis of an integrated
strategy, will support the implementation of various Emergency Program projects,
notably through seminars, presentations, media actions and direct contact events. In
this context, the establishment of support groups will allow for all stakeholders to
progressively mobilize around, commit to, and take ownership of the Program.

      The multi-year Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, developed and
adopted by the MOE for 2010, aims to ensure greater predictability in the fiscal
resources to be allocated to the Emergency Program. In addition, the establishment
                                        55
of a commitment      accounting system will   allow for budget    execution to be
monitored.

     In the context of decentralization and regionalization, each AREF has
developed and adopted its own Regional Emergency Program, with details set out in
a Regional Mid-Term Action Plan, covering the period 2009-20 12.

      Finally, the overall amount of the budget allocated to the Emergency Program
at the time of its launch in 2009 was set at 34 billion dirhams. However, the
implementation of the entire Program for the school education sub-sector during the
period 2009-2012 will require additional financing in light of the fact that the
Program now includes 25 rather than the initial 23 projects.

ANNEX 5: FUND RELATIONS NOTE

                       MOROCCO - Assessment Letter to the World Bank
                          Macroeconomic Performance and Policies'
                                     April 14,2010

Economic performance in Morocco has remained favorable despite the difficult external
environment. With little financial exposure to international markets, the global crisis affected
Morocco primarily through the real sector and balance of payments. Exports, tourism,
remittances, and foreign direct investment declined starting in late 2008 but signs of recovery
have begun to appear. Real nonagricultural GDP growth fell to about 2 percent in 2009, but
due to an exceptional crop year, overall GDP growth was 5.2 percent. Average inflation
dropped to 1 percent in 2009 as international commodity prices receded. The headline
unemployment rate declined slightly to 9.1 percent in 2009, but youth unemployment remains
high, presenting an important challenge.

Despite the crisis, Morocco's external position was largely unchanged in 2009. The
external current account deficit remained at about 5 percent of GDP in 2009 as the fall in
exports, tourism, and remittances was offset by a decline in imports. Likewise on the capital
account side, a sharp decline in foreign direct investment was largely offset by an increase in
public and other private capital inflows. Gross international reserves increased in 2009 due to
the new SDR allocation and remain strong at 6.7 months of prospective imports.

The authorities relaxed fiscal policy in 2009 in response to the crisis. Following a small
surplus in 2008, the fiscal deficit was 2.2 of GDP in 2009. Revenue fell, primarily reflecting
the slowdown in nonagricultural activity, but also the lowering of certain tax rates, and the
expiration of exceptional factors that boosted revenues in 2008. On the spending side, the
government launched a stimulus package to mitigate the economic downturn-including a
boost in public investment and several specific initiatives targeted at enterprises in affected
sectors-while    subsidies fell due to the lower world commodity prices. Outstanding
government debt is estimated at close to 47 percent of GDP at end-2009. S&P recently
upgraded Morocco's sovereign risk rating to investment grade (BBB-).

In the context of low inflation, and consistent with the exchange rate peg, monetary
policy was eased slightly in 2009. The Central Bank lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis
points to 3.25 percent in 2009 and has since maintained it unchanged. Broad money growth
slowed significantly, increasing by only 4.5 percent in 2009. Moreover, to boost liquidity, the
central bank has been reducing gradually reserve requirements since end-2008 from
15 percent to the current level of 6 percent.

The economic outlook for Morocco should improve this year, but remains dependent on
the external environment. Growth in the euro area, Morocco's main trading partner, is
projected to be slightly positive in 2010. This should contribute to a gradual recovery,
although there are downside risks, notably a slower rebound in tourism and remittances if the

'This assessment reflects the conclusions of the 2009 Article IV Consultation with Morocco, completed in
January 20 10, as well as more recent information provided by the authorities.

                                                   72
recovery in Europe is more prolonged. Coupled with a further fiscal expansion this year,
helping to boost domestic demand, nonagricultural growth should rise to about 4 percent in
2010. However, agriculture output is projected to return to trend levels, pulling down overall
GDP growth to 3-3s percent. Inflation is projected to be around 2 percent, and the current
account deficit is expected to remain stable.

The authorities plan to relax fiscal policy further in 2010 to support the recovery, set
within a strategy to bring down deficits over the medium term. To this end, the 2010
budget envisages a deficit of 4% percent of GDP (excluding privatization receipts). On the
spending side, the stimulus will come primarily from an additional increase of about % a
percent of GDP in capital expenditure. Tax revenues are projected to fall by about 1 percent
of GDP, due both to tax policy changes and automatic stabilizers playing out. While the fiscal
loosening is appropriate given the economic conditions, the crisis is a temporary
phenomenon, and thus the authorities should aim at bringing the deficit under 3 percent of
GDP over the medium term so as to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio.

The direct impact of the global crisis on Morocco's banks has been limited. The global
integration of Morocco's banking system is limited: banks and corporates have limited
external debt, there is no exposure to toxic assets, and the system is effectively non-dollarized.
Moreover, the capital account is only partially open, further shielding the financial system
from the global crisis. NPLs have been declining, but the rapid rise in credit in 2005-08 raises
concerns about future loan deterioration. In this context, banks have tightened lending
standards, and the central bank plans to increase the minimum capital adequacy ratio of some
banks according to their risk profile. Moreover, a real estate price index has been recently
published and a credit bureau has newly become operational, which will further improve
credit monitoring. The authorities also intend to fully implement Base1 I1 recommendations.

The authorities are deepening structural reforms to boost growth, address
competitiveness challenges, and reduce unemployment. The Plan Vert, with the aim of
boosting agriculture productivity, is moving ahead. Similarly, reforms in the education sector
are ongoing to better match skilled labor to the labor market needs. In addition, the authorities
have launched a reform of the justice system and will continue ongoing efforts in the energy,
industrial and tourism sectors. They are also proceeding with a reform of the subsidy system,
whereby universal subsidies would be gradually eliminated in parallel with the introduction of
new targeted assistance to ensure budget neutrality of the reforms.
