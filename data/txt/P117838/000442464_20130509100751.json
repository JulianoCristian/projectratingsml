follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: it is important for development\n            policy loan (DPL) to come with a package of technical\n            support that has the procedural flexibility to allow for\n            just-in-time capacity building and technical assistance.\n            Reform implementers need to be able to request and receive\n            technical and or operational support on an as-needed basis,\n            in addition to the capacity building they already know is\n            required. Governments should consider using national student\n            learning assessments, in addition to international\n            assessments, as a means of assessing the quality of\n            education. Multi-donor operations require some trade-offs\n            from all parties. Set more realistic objectives and target\n            indicators through greater involvement of the reform\n            implementers at the planning stage. Prioritize actions per\n            year of the reform, taking into account the available human\n            and financial resources and limitations, and timing - which\n            is important for the education sector given that results\n            should be achieved at specific times of the year to best,\n            coincide with the school calendar. Activate and strengthen\n            communication channels from the central to the local levels,\n            as well as between the main actors across ministries at the\n            central level. Recognize that school location and atmosphere\n            are important factors for many reform initiatives."}, "docdt": "2013-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
