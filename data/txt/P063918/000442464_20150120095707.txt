Morocco: Speeding Up Public Service                                                                        July 1, 2002
                      Morocco's slow and bureaucratic system has become an impediment to economic growth and equitable
                      development, denying people of an effective judiciary and creating barriers that make access to justice
                      almost impossible for the most vulnerable groups.

                      Aware of these obstacles, the Moroccan government approached the World Bank with a well-designed
                      program focused on modernizing part of its legal framework. The $5.3 million project is not only the first
                      to tackle such reform in Morocco, it is also 100 percent country-owned, with Bank support aimed at
                      helping to translate the government's plans into concrete action.

Although just signed in May 2001, the project has already taken off the ground and modern tools are expediting case
handling. As a result, the Rabat and Casablanca commercial courts now transmit live case proceedings and registries of
commerce procure documents in record time. The project is helping to draft a commercial arbitration code, while judicial
personnel are taught business law, and law school curriculum is being updated.

To make reforms accessible to the people, the government is conducting a mass media campaign, built around radio and
press messages, and local registries of commerce are improving public information delivery. As a first step, each commercial
court is setting up an information booth staffed by a lawyer who will provide free basic advice on judicial and legal commercial
issues once a week.
