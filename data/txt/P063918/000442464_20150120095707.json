Aware of\n            these obstacles, the Moroccan government approached the\n            World Bank with a well-designed program focused on\n            modernizing part of its legal framework. The 5.3 million\n            dollars project with the Bank aimed at helping to translate\n            the government's plans into concrete action. The\n            project is helping to draft a commercial arbitration code,\n            while judicial personnel are taught business law, and law\n            school curriculum is being updated. To make reforms\n            accessible to the people, the government is conducting a\n            mass media campaign, built around radio and press messages,\n            and local registries of commerce are improving public\n            information delivery."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
