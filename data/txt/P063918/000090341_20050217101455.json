The\n            lessons learned indicate that the project confirms the need\n            for the Bank to expand the scope and depth of its\n            multidisciplinary assessment work, as it focuses upon legal\n            and judicial obstacles to poverty reduction and to\n            improvements in the investment climate in North Africa, the\n            Middle East and beyond. As the first Bank project in the\n            highly sensitive justice sector, careful selection of\n            objectives and scope was critical to ensure borrower\n            ownership. During preparation and early implementation, the\n            project was strongly supported by the Minister of Justice\n            and the Project Management Unit team. Avoid overoptimistic\n            legislative reform objectives and attempt to identify stages\n            involved in achieving the reforms. The requirement that\n            international consultants teamed up with local consultants\n            proved to be important to ensure that analysis and\n            especially recommendations were anchored on reality on the\n            ground. The lesson to be drawn from this component is\n            two-fold: (a) the need to have a strong management in place\n            in the institution concerned; and (b) it may take time for a\n            judicial training institution.
