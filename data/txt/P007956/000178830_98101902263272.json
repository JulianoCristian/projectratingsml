{"cdata!": "The project will provide funding for (a)\n            the Cobriza Mine Expansion: This project would expand\n            underground mine production from 0.7 million STPY of ore\n            grading 2.2 percent copper to 3.5 million STPY grading 1.8\n            percent copper. This ore will be treated in a new\n            concentrator, increasing concentrate output from 50,000 STPY\n            to 223,000 STPY containing 25 percent copper and 5.5 oz of\n            silver per ton. Related administrative, industrial and\n            social infrastructure are also included in the project. The\n            existing concentrator will be dismantled, with some of the\n            equipment to be used in the new concentrator, to be\n            constructed on a more stable site. (b) the Cerro de Pasco\n            Mine Water Treatment Plant: This project would improve the\n            economics of copper recovery by replacing an existing\n            cementation plant with a more efficient solvent extraction\n            and electro-winning plant producing refined copper in place\n            of cement copper, and eliminating CENTROMIN's pollution\n            of the San Juan and Mantaro rivers. Production of copper\n            would be 7,000 STPY by 1979."}, "docdt": "1976-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
