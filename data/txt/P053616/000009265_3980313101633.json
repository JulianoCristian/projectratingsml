provide\n            implementation assistance to Thailand in improving the\n            structure, resiliency, and soundness of the financial\n            sector, and to address the immediate need to resolve finance\n            companies which have been suspended during the recent\n            economic crisis. The project's components are two. The\n            first, technical assistance for financial sector\n            restructuring, will (1) strengthen financial institution\n            resolution processes; and (2) improve the capacity to\n            identify future problem financial institutions in an\n            appropriate timeframe and raising supervisory standards. The\n            second, institution building, will focus on ( 1)\n            rationalizing the supervisory regime; (2) strengthening\n            market discipline; (3) improving the bankruptcy and\n            collateral foreclosure processes; and (4) implementing\n            financial infrastructure and institutional changes.
