impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that overall\n            strong support and ownership from the government contributed\n            to the successful completion of the project. Clear ownership\n            from each individual agency helped to carry out the\n            anticipated reforms and ensure the outcome of the activities\n            supported by the project. Close supervision by the\n            Bank's task manager ensured that the project met its\n            objectives and allowed the Bank to be flexible to meet the\n            changing needs of the government through amendments to the\n            loan. The Bank's resident staff greatly facilitated the\n            implementation process while the resident procurement staff\n            contributed to the smooth processing of disbursements. Close\n            coordination and cooperation between the Bank and the\n            Project Implementation Unit (PIU) helped to ensure the\n            project was implemented according to schedule and changes\n            were accommodated on a timely basis. Capacity building and\n            institutional development activities have been sustained\n            with continuing efforts beyond the project life by the\n            agencies and ministries concerned.
