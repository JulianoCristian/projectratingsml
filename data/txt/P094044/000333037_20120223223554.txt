     GEORGIA — SECOND EAST-WEST HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
                        PROJECT NO.: P094044
                 CREDIT NO.: IDA-43730 AND IDA - 45120

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.     The closing date for the Georgia Second East-West Highway Improvement
Project (P094044), Credits IDA-43730 and IDA-45120, will be extended from February
29, 2012 until June 30, 2012 based on the request received from the Ministry of Finance
of Georgia dated January 16, 2012.

2.      The Project, with a total cost of SDR 35.2 million, is financed through two IDA
credits. The first credit, in the amount of SDR 22.4 million, was approved on December
18, 2007. On October 30, 2008, an Additional Financing for the Project in the amount of
SDR 12.8 million was approved. The Project is now coming to the end of its final year of
implementation. While most of the civil works under the Project have been completed
with 100 percent of project funds disbursed, there are activities, to be financed with
project counterpart funds and mostly related to Environmental and Social Safeguards
compliance and road safety improvements, that still need to be completed. Financial
management performance is satisfactory with good internal controls and there are no
overdue audits. The Project Development Objectives continue to be achievable.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that the remaining project
activities, related to the Igoeti-Sveneti Road Construction Section of the E-60 highway,
are completed. The civil works contract for this section was first awarded to Ashtrom
International, Ltd in February 2008. This first contract was terminated by the Roads
Department in July 2010 due to non performance by the contractor. A second civil works
contract was subsequently awarded to New Energy - Al Hamra – Zimo Joint Venture in
June 2011 to complete the remaining civil works comprising: (a) completion of the road
construction; (b) remedial repairs; (c) construction of access and local roads; (d)
construction of additional road safety measures; (e) environmental remediation activities;
and (f) compensatory tree planting to rectify non-compliance with the Environmental
Management Plans (EMP) due to the poor performance of the first contractor.

4.     The performance of the second contractor is satisfactory and most of the civil
works have been satisfactorily completed. However, early winter conditions prevented
the contractor from completing all the works by December 2011, including those required
by the EMP.

5.     In addition to the remaining civil works, the Roads Department also requires
additional time to finalize the remaining land acquisition and resettlement issues.

6.     The Roads Department has agreed to an action plan to ensure that all remaining
works, land acquisition and resettlement issues are completed before the new closing
date.

7.      This will be the first extension of the project that would bring the total extension
period to 4 months. There are no additional costs arising from the extension.
