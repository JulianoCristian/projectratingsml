                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are:
                          (i)     To contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve ease of transit, and safety along the central part of Georgia's East-West
                         corridor, through upgrading a segment of the East-West Highway from Tbilisi to Rikoti; and
                          (ii)    To strengthen the capacity of the government agencies (and particularly RDMED) to develop and implement a traffic safety program.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the main civil works contract has been stopped since early 2010. The Roads Department has now finalized a procurement plan which will allow remaining works to
                         be procured early in 2011, withe the objective to finalize project activities by the closing date of February 2012.

                         These works will also allow the resolution of the environmental issues observed under the project due to the failure of the main civil works contractor to comply with the provisions of
                         the Environmental Management Plan for the project.
