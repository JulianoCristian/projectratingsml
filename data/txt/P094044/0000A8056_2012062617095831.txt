                         The project development objectives are: (i)       To contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve ease of transit, and safety along the central
                         part of Georgia's East-West corridor, through upgrading a segment of the East-West Highway from Tbilisi to Rikoti; and (ii)  To strengthen the capacity of the
                         government agencies (and particularly RDMED) to develop and implement a traffic safety program.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is coming to the end of its final year of implementation. After the stoppage of the main civil works contracts, procurement of outstanding works was finalized in July 2011,
                         and to date most of the outstanding civil works under the Project have been completed. However, early winter conditions prevented the contractor from completing all the works by
                         December 2011, including those required by the EMP. For this reason, and also to allow the Road Department to finalize the remaining land acquisition and resettlement issues, the
                         Ministry of Finance of Georgia requested, and the Bank approved the extension of the closing date of the Project from February 29, 2012 to June 30, 2012.
