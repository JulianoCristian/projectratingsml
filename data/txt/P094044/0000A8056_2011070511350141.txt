                          (i)     To contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve ease of transit, and safety along the central part of Georgia's East-West
                         corridor, through upgrading a segment of the East-West Highway from Tbilisi to Rikoti; and
                          (ii)    To strengthen the capacity of the government agencies (and particularly RDMED) to develop and implement a traffic safety program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has just entered its final year of implementation. After the stoppage of the main civil works contracts, procurement of outstanding works is being finalized, which should
                         allow to finalize project activities by the closing date of February 2012.

                         These works will also allow the resolution of the environmental issues observed under the project due to the failure of the main civil works contractor to comply with the provisions of
                         the Environmental Management Plan for the project.
