                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key objective of the project is to facilitate increased private sector investment by improving the business environment and diversifying sources of growth. This goal
                         will be achieved by reducing the costs of doing business; strengthening the linkages and integration of the Lesotho economy with the regional economy, especially with
                         South Africa; strengthening support for technical and business management skills thereby improving productivity at the firm level, and improving access to finance for
                         MSMEs. These measures will also support the poverty reduction strategy dialogue and implementation of agreed upon policy measures.
