                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key objective of the project is to facilitate increased private sector investment by improving the business environment and diversifying sources of growth. This goal
                         will be achieved by reducing the costs of doing business; strengthening the linkages and integration of the Lesotho economy with the regional economy, especially with
                         South Africa; strengthening support for technical and business management skills thereby improving productivity at the firm level, and improving access to finance for
                         MSMEs. These measures will also support the poverty reduction strategy dialogue and implementation of agreed upon policy measures.

                         PSCED Project in the amount of US$ 8.10 million (Credit: SDR 2.6 Million equivalent US$3.9 million, Grant: SDR 2.8 million equivalent US$4.2 million) was approved on March 21,

                         2007, with the financing agreement signed on April 17, 2007. The Project became effective on October 5, 2007 with an original closing date of June 30, 2013 which was later
                         extended by a year during project restructuring to June 30, 2013.

                         RELEVANCE: The Lesotho Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification Project (PSCEDP) was approved on March 21, 2007, with the twin objectives of increasing

                         private sector competitiveness and economic diversification-both highly relevant objectives for Lesotho at the time with a very small private sector and the textile sector dominating
                         the manufacturing GDP. These twin objectives however remain highly relevant and the project has been nimble in adapting to the demands of the economy. In January 2012, at the
                         request of the Government, the Project was restructured (level two) and project closing date extended by a year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The project restructuring
                         enabled the scaling up of the horticulture component after having demonstrated success in the three pilot sites. Further, it enabled the government to attract a private operator for a
                         PPP for the skills centers. There were new activities that were introduced to improve the capacity of line ministries being supported as well as investment promotion activities by
                         LNDC. The leasing activities were initiated at project restructuring with the leasing regulations finalized and signed- an important initiative to enable greater access to credit by SMEs.
                         Private Sector competitiveness and Economic Diversification continue to be of pivotal importance as expressed in the Government's National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP).
                         The relevance of the project is further demonstrated by the Government's request for a follow up project which is under preparation, with the aim of building on the reforms initiated
                         under this operation.

                         EFFICACY: Based on the April 2013 implementation support mission, the Project made satisfactory progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) as
                         measured by a (i) decrease in the number of days required to start a business from 74 days at project inception to 24 at present and days required to obtain a trading license from
                         35-50 days to less than 7 days (component 1); (iii) setting up a PPP for the skills centers (component 2), (iii) increase in exports and incomes for farmers in the pilot sites (component
                         2) and increase in the sales of supported firms after LEAP support by greater than 10%. The one sub component that did not fare well was that of immigration and passport services,
                         however funds from this slow moving component was reallocated to other well-performing components under component 2 (supporting economic diversification) to maximize impact.

                         FIDUICARY MANAGEMENT:
                         With regard to the Financial Management, the FM rating has been maintained at Satisfactory (S) with an FM risk rating remaining the same as Low (L).

                         PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT:
                         The PMU has been exerting all the efforts for the successful implementation of the planned procurement activities. The PMU has intensified monitoring of implementation progress of
                         all agreed priority actions. It will continue submitting Project Progress Report as per the Financial Agreement in the format that has been agreed upon with the Bank. The Findings of
                         the last Post Procurement Review (PPR) report shows that there were procedural gaps associated with procurement capacity limitations of not having a full time procurement
                         specialist in the PMU and the remedial actions of the findings of the PPR will be implemented by May 31, 2013. The rating of procurement performance has been rated as Moderately
                         Satisfactory (MS).
