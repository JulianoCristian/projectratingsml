Lesotho has faced\n            land degradation and environmental crises of massive\n            proportions for some time. Extreme care has to be taken to\n            avoid the negative impacts that may accompany the\n            implementation of the Project. The potential use of\n            agrochemicals, in particular pesticides, under the\n            prevailing poor management and weak regulatory environment,\n            is fraught with serious environmental including human health\n            dangers. Likewise, use of fertilizers, in particular\n            nitrogenous, under poor field management, entails\n            potentially serious issues of soil and water contamination,\n            primarily through leaching and runoff. Careful attention\n            must be paid to nitrogenous forms. Use of agricultural best\n            management practices should be encouraged through their use,\n            field demonstration, and farmers training to mitigate\n            negative aspects of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-10-02T00:00:00Z"}
