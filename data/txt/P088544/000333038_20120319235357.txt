1.     Proceeds for Lesotho, Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic
Diversification Project (Credit 4275-LSO, Grant H281-LSO), P088544 will be
reallocated as follows:

Category                               Amount of credit allocated  Percentage     of
                                                                   expenditure to be
                                                                   financed

2.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to support the implementation of the
horticulture rollout scheme and the PPP transactions for the two skills centers. It is
expected that the horticulture village rollout scheme will require procurement of
goods such as netting and irrigation materials. Depending on the negotiation with
potential private investors, goods may also need to be procured to support the PPP
transaction for the two skill centers. The reallocation becomes necessary after a
change of procurement plan and re-estimation of the amount of funds required to
finance goods procurement.
