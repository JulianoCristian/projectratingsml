                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key objective of the project is to facilitate increased private sector investment by improving the business environment and diversifying sources of growth. This goal
                         will be achieved by reducing the costs of doing business; strengthening the linkages and integration of the Lesotho economy with the regional economy, especially with
                         South Africa; strengthening support for technical and business management skills thereby improving productivity at the firm level, and improving access to finance for
                         MSMEs. These measures will also support the poverty reduction strategy dialogue and implementation of agreed upon policy measures.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Actions were agreed to address the following two challenges: (I) The success of the pilot phase of the subcomponents of skills centers and the horticulture component needs to be
                         scaled up, which would involve commercialization and PPP transactions. Options and action plans have now been proposed by consultants and endorsed by the Government of
                         Lesotho, but implementation remains a challenge that requires close follow-up. (ii) The reform of the Industrial Licensing Act is critical to achieving project objectives and still requires
                         urgent actions.
