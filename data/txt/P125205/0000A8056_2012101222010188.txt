                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR covers the implementation period from February to August 2012. During the current ISR period, there has been improved progress in project implementation, in particular
                         with regard to the Technical Assistance (TA) activities under Component 2, with procurement processes for several of the TAs having been launched since the last ISR, including: i)
                         Review of the National Disaster Management Plan; ii) Flood Risk Assessment of Dennery, Fond St. Jacques and Soufriere areas; and iii) Geodetic/Gravity Correction Survey. The

                         civil works component has also advanced at a good pace. The health sub-component in particular is progressing well, with retrofitting completed at the Etangs and Jacmel Health
                         Centers, and works nearly finished at the Entrepot health center. Procurement processes are currently ongoing for the designs of most of the schools and for the construction of
                         Cresslands bridge, for which contract awarding is expected by October. Progress in the School sub-component in general has been moving at a slow pace, due to the weak technical
                         capacity within the Ministry of Education and as a result of the need to revise preliminary designs which were prepared with the intention of quick and basic rehabilitation of the school

                         buildings shortly after the passage of Hurricane Tomas. Design revisions for a more comprehensive rehabilitation and retrofitting of the school facilities, and with additional/ancillary
                         works such as external draining and fencing, have been proposed for several of the schools, including the National Skills Development Center, Bocage Combined School, Vieux Fort
                         Campus B and Ave Maria Primary School, leading to implementation delays and cost increase for each of these activities. Despite the delay, all design revisions are expected to be
                         complete no later than November 2012, at which point the bidding process for the additional works will commence. With the launch of these activities, disbursements are expected to
                         pick-up in the next ISR reporting period.

                         Despite overall progress, the team notes challenges associated with keeping the project's implementation plan and disbursements on target, in particular with regard to the new
                         constructions of the Dennery Hospital and the Dennery Infant School as well as the reconstruction of the Bois d'Orange bridge.

                         For the Dennery Hospital and Dennery Infant School, procurement processes for the consultancies in support of the Review of Architectural and Structural Designs and Preparation
                         of Detailed Design and Supervision are currently ongoing. The PCU is currently finalizing the shortlist and the request for proposals to be issued for the consultancies. Following the
                         reviews of the architectural designs and the preparation of the detailed designs, which are are expected to take up to 6 months to finalize, the bidding package for the works will be
                         prepared and the procurement process is expected to be launched in May 2013. In response to the implementation challenges experienced, the Government has established a a
                         technical working group comprising the PCU, and technical staff from the Ministries of Infrastructure, Education and Physical Development, and which meets weekly to closely
                         monitor progress of these 2 activities.

                         The rehabilitation of Bois d'Orange Bridge faced some delays due to design issues, including the lack of a geo-technical investigation (GI) to inform the final design for the
                         reconstruction of the Bridge. The Ministry of Infrastructure has recruited a Firm to carry out the GI, which was completed end of July 2012. The revised design for the reconstruction of
                         Bois D'Orange was expected to be finalized in August 2012, which has been delayed. The review of the new design is expected to be completed by October 2012, at which point the
                         PCU will launch the bidding process for the works, following Bank approval. To provide needed support to the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Bank team successfully collaborated with
                         the Government of Saint Lucia to request support from the US government in the form of free technical assistance from the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct an independent
                         review of the GI and the revised design report, make recommendations on the final design of the Bridge, and provide technical support to the Ministry, as needed.

                         In view of the implementation challenges experienced, four implementation support missions and a series of workshops and training activities have been carried out since the last ISR
                         period. Additionally, Senior Country Management and Procurement representatives from the World Bank met with Government counterparts in May 2012 to discuss steps to improve
                         implementation, at which point it was agreed that the Bank would provide close Procurement support and training to the PCU and the implementation agencies. Capacity building
                         activities undertaken include: Procurement and Safeguards management workshop for the PCU staff and implementing agencies; Procurement training for local consultants,
                         suppliers and building contractors focused on preparation of submissions of bids and proposals; A technical training for local contractors to improve their understanding of the concept
                         of resiliency to climate change in design and construction practices, and a Retreat for the PCU staff.
