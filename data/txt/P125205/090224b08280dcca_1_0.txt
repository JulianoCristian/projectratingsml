                         During the current ISR reporting period (November 2013 - September 2014), the project closing date was extended by six months from March 31, 2014 to September 30, 2014 at the
                         formal request of the Government of Saint Lucia dated March 27, 2014. This was the first closing date extension and was approved to accommodate the completion of: (i) the
                         rehabilitation of Bois d'Orange Bridge; (ii) the flood and hydraulic study for Soufriere, Fond St. Jacques and Dennery; (iii) procurement of select office equipment; (iv) the geodetic

                         While there has been some implementation progress, activities (i) - (iii) above-mentioned remain outstanding at the project closing. These delays are partly resultant from the
