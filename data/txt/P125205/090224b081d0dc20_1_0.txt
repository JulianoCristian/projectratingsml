                         During the current ISR reporting period, an implementation support mission and a mid-term review (MTR) for the project were carried out in November 2012 and May 2013,
                         respectively, to review implementation of all project components, with an emphasis on assessing the project's progress in reaching its goals (as stated in its project development
                         objectives, PDO), including achievement of project indicators (PDO indicators and intermediary level indicators) and assess commitment and disbursement levels.

                         During the November mission, during which the Bank and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) conducted a thorough assessment of ongoing and planned activities under the works
                         component to identify and provide needed support to improve implementation progress, it was noted that there are some shortfalls in funding to finance all activities as originally
                         planned under the project due to cost over-runs. In light of these funding shortfalls, on March 14, 2013, the Government formally requested: i) several activities be transferred under
                         the new disaster vulnerability reduction project DVRP - (P121226) currently under preparation, including - a) rehabilitation of Choc Bridge; (b) construction of new Dennery Polyclinic;
                         (c) construction of new Dennery Infant School; (d) rehabilitation of Dennery Primary School; and (e) rehabilitation of Soufriere Hospital; and ii) an increase in the DVRP loan amount
                         by an additional US$14 million to finance these activities. The Bank has in principle agreed to both requests in a letter dated April 1, 2013.

                         The Mid-term Review concluded that there has been improved progress in project implementation, with an improvement in the disbursement rate and commitments in all
                         components. Current commitments stand at US$ 6.3 million, and disbursements increased by more than US$2 million since the last ISR (August 2012), bringing cumulative
                         disbursements to US$3.85 million as of May 2013 (25.79% of total funds). Despite the initial delays in project implementation and, while the current disbursement rate remains
                         relatively low, this is expected to pick up, with new commitments totaling about US$9.466 million, and US$2.0 million in commitments for partially completed contracts and
                         outstanding expenditures. The Review also concluded that there are no anticipated impediments towards achieving the project's development objectives.

                         Discussions during the week-long MTR mission focused on the following topics:

                         1)         Project Activities: The Mission reviewed the implementation status of each component, and noted an improvement in the disbursement rate and commitments in all
                         activities. The majority of project activities are currently ongoing with successful completion expected by project closing, with some activities already successfully completed. The
                         PCU and the Bank thoroughly reviewed the portfolio of planned/pending activities and remaining project budget in light of the pending closing date and remaining implementation
                         period. The Review confirmed that, other than the activities already identified for transfer to the DVRP, all project activities are scheduled to be completed before the project closing
                         date.

                         2)        Indicators: PDO and intermediate indicators were reviewed to assess project impact per component and review possible changes in targets. The Bank and PCU agreed that
                         changes are necessary for the PDO indicators (end target values) and intermediate indicators for Components 2 and 3 (redefinition of targets) as a result of some activities being
                         canceled and transfered to the DVRP due to funding shortfalls, as mentioned above. The PCU submitted a revised Results Framework and Monitoring table with updated targets to
                         reflect changes in the final outputs of project activities, as follows:
                             - Target values for PDO-Level Indicator One and the related intermediate result indicator (component 3) have been revised to reflect a reduction in the number of infrastructure
                         investments in the Transport, Education and Health Sectors. Specifically: (i) the number of bridges rehabilitated has been reduced from 3 to 2 (Cresslands Bridge and Bois d’Orange
                         Bridge), with revised beneficiaries from 34,562 average daily users to 19,373; (ii) the number of school facilities rehabilitated or rebuilt has been reduced from 27 to 13, with revised
                         beneficiaries from 10,000 yearly students to 9,645; and (iii) the number of health facilities rehabilitated or rebuilt has been reduced from 5 to 4, with revised beneficiaries from 41,000
                         yearly patients to 27,770.
                           - Target values for PDO-Level Indicator Two and the related intermediate result indicator (component 2)have increased from 2 to 4 government-produced policies and plans that

                         integrate hazard risk information, including: (i) Revised National Disaster Management Plan; (ii) Flood Risk Assessment for Soufriere; (iii) Flood Risk Assessment for Fond. St.
                         Jacques; and (iv) Flood Risk Assessment for Dennery.
                           - Target values for Intermediate Result Indicator three (component two) have increased from 314 communication equipment procured to 350.

                         As a result of the changes in the target values, a simple restructuring of the project is being processed, and the Results Framework and Monitoring table will be updated accordingly
                         and reflected in the next ISR.

                         3)       Procurement: The MTR mission carried out a review of Procurement implementation under the Project. The procurement plan was reviewed and discussed item by item and
                         updated according to the revised project scope, as mentioned above. Additionally, the MTR conducted a procurement post review of 2 randomly selected contracts (1 Shopping
                         Goods and 1 NCB Works for a total amount of US$ 207,000) during the mission. Based on the information provided in the BER’s and other documents presented for review, the
                         Mission concluded that procurement under the reviewed contracts was carried out in accordance with the applicable Bank Procurement Guidelines. As a result of this progress, the

                         procurement performance during this ISR period has been upgraded from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory.

                         4)      Financial Management: The MTR reviewed the Financial Management (FM) of the project and concluded that the PCU has an adequate control environment and provides
                         adequate oversight while implementing project activities. The overall project FM arrangements and the FM capacity are both rated Satisfactory, and the FM risk is rated as Moderate.

                         Based on the current review, the FM performance for this ISR has been upgraded from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory.

                         5)       Safeguards: Overall, compliance with both Environmental and Social Safeguards is Satisfactory. The MTR discussed the Environmental and Social Safeguards Screening
                         and Assessment Framework (ESSAF), including the Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). While a GRM has not been prepared for this Project specifically, as per the ESSAF, the
                         PCU indicated that the GRM that was prepared under the Second Disaster Management Project will be used for this project, and agreed to send it to the Bank for review and
                         clearance by July 2013. The Bank agreed to share examples, in the event the existing GRM requires some additional information/updating. Additionally, the Bank and the PCU
                         agreed to organize in-country a refresher training in August 2013 on World Bank Social Safeguards, which would include a session focusing on the Project's ESSAF and GRM.
