                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overview: Saint Lucia’s Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recover Project is financed by a US$15 million Credit (IDA Credit No. 4871-LC). Processed as an Emergency Recovery Loan,
                         the Project was approved by the World Bank Board on March 10, 2011, and the accompanying Financing Agreement between Saint Lucia and the International Development
                         Association was signed on June 3, 2011. The Project has been effective since August 31, 2011. This ISR covers the implementation period from June 2013 to October 2013.

                         Project Restructuring: During the current ISR reporting period, at the request of the Government of Saint Lucia, the project was restructured to facilitate changes to the Project
                         Results Framework and Monitoring, which resulted from the cancellation of some activities and subsequent transfer to the proposed Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (DVRP -
                         currently under preparation) due to funding shortfalls. The restructuring included minor revisions to target values for the project development objective level indicators and related

                         intermediated indicators. A summary of the changes to the Results Framework and Monitoring can be found below:

                         - Target values for PDO-Level Indicator One and the related intermediate result indicator (component 3) have been revised to reflect a reduction in the number of rehabilitated
                         infrastructure and facilities in the Transport, Health and Education sectors. Specifically: (i) the number of bridges rehabilitated has been reduced from 3 to 2 (Cresslands Bridge and
                         Bois d’Orange Bridge), with revised beneficiaries from 34,562 average daily users to 19,373; (ii) the number of school facilities rehabilitated or rebuilt has been reduced from 27 to 10,
                         with revised beneficiaries from 10,000 yearly students to 5,127; and (iii) the number of health facilities rehabilitated or rebuilt has been reduced from 5 to 4, with an accompanying
                         revision in the unit of measure of the target, previously number of average annual patients to the number of average daily patients, resulting in a defined final target value of 145
                         average daily patients;

                         - Target values for PDO-Level Indicator Two and the related intermediate result indicator (component 2) have increased from 2 to 4 government-produced policies and plans that
                         integrate hazard risk information as a result of lower-than anticipated costs per plan. These plans include: (i) Revised National Disaster Management Plan; (ii) Flood Risk
                         Assessment for Soufriere; (iii) Flood Risk Assessment for Fond. St. Jacques; and (iv) Flood Risk Assessment for Dennery; and

                         - Target values for Intermediate Result Indicator three (component two) have decreased from 324 communication equipment procured to 320.

                         The Restructuring involved no change in the Project Development Objective, nor had any impact on the safeguard category or policies triggered under the Project. The
                         implementation arrangements also remained unchanged, and no amendments were made to the Project Financing Agreement.

                         Implementation Progress: Despite overall progress, the team notes challenges associated with keeping the project's implementation plan and disbursements on target. In particular,
                         there is a risk that the activity related to the rehabilitation of the Bois d’Orange bridge, which accounts for close to 25% of the total project amount (US$4.1 million), may not be fully
                         implemented by the project closing date. (In view of this risk, the Bank has granted a conditional clearance to proceed with this activity, provided that the Client will assume full
                         financial responsibility through the use of its own funds or other resources to finance remaining works after the Project closing date, in the event that the works are not complete by
                         then.) A formal letter was received from the Client in this regard.
