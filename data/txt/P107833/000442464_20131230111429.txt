1     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1   Context at Appraisal

1.    Country Background. The Secondary and Local Roads Project (SLRP) was appraised in early
2008, more than 15 years after Albania embarked on a major economic transition. During the transition
period, the country successfully built the foundations of a market-based economy, created democratic
institutions and gradually built capacity in the public administration to cope with political and economic
transformation. These efforts resulted in a track record of macroeconomic stability, as well as
achievement of the fastest rate of GDP growth in South Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, Albania
remained one of the poorest countries in Europe with an income per capita in 2006 estimated at US$
2,960 (Atlas method), widespread poverty, high unemployment, substantial regional disparities, and
weak governance structures.

2. Over half of the Albanian population (57 percent) lived in rural areas, and over one-third (35
percent) of the rural population were estimated to live in poverty. A qualitative survey of both poverty
and its causes noted that after employment and income, many Albanians considered infrastructure
problems to be the main cause of their difficulties and low standard of living. Almost 50 percent of rural
producers stated that a lack of adequate transportation, primarily good roads, was their greatest
marketing problem. Rural inhabitants acknowledged that poor road access made it difficult for farmers
to reach markets, contributed to rural to urban migration and affected the delivery of health and
education services.

3.    Higher level objectives to which the project contributed. The National Strategy for
Development and Integration (NSDI) for 2007-2013 built on the important reforms of the first 15 years
of democracy and advanced the reform agenda by defining a new phase for the country’s development.
The NSDI set the following strategic priorities: (i) integrate the country into the European Union and
NATO; (ii) develop and consolidate the democratic state, based on the fundamental liberties and rights
of individuals; exercise good governance, fight corruption, and guarantee the rule of law; and (iii)
achieve rapid, balanced and sustainable economic, social and human development. The last priority
included goals to improve transport infrastructure, in particular road transport that would enable the
creation of an integrated economic space. About 6,000 km of rural roads were to be rehabilitated by
2013.

4.    The NSDI reflected the main considerations of the Albanian National Transport Plan (ANTP)
(2006) and Transport Sector Strategy (2007), indicating that considerable investments in rehabilitation
and new construction were made, however, the road network was still constrained in both coverage and
quality in comparison with other countries in the region and its condition was unsatisfactory due to the
lack of an efficient system of maintenance. Road network constraints were considered one of the main
reasons for the unequal development of different regions of the country. There was a correlation
between the level of poverty and the quality of road infrastructure in each region. Among other transport
sector strategic priorities, the NSDI called for a major investment in the local road network in
cooperation with the local government units (LGU), improvement of maintenance of the national road
network through a road and bridge asset management system, total privatization of the maintenance
service and doubling of maintenance expenditure.



                                                    1
5.    The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Albania for FY06-FY09 supported the
National Strategy for Socio-Economic Development (NSSED), which preceded the NSDI. The CAS
aimed to support the Government around two core pillars: (i) continued economic growth through
support to private sector development; and (ii) improved public service delivery, particularly in the
social sectors. Improving governance and strengthening accountability mechanisms were the main
objectives and thematic focus of the support program. To this end a ‘Governance Filter’ was developed
to ensure that the Bank consistently took all opportunities to improve governance. The SLRP was
prepared to support the first pillar of the CAS by building the infrastructure necessary for growth. The
Project was specifically defined as the SLRP in the CAS Progress Report 2008.

6.    Sector background. The overall length of Albania’s road network is over 15,000 km, and
includes national, regional, local and urban roads 1 . The Ministry of Public Works, Transport, and
Telecommunications 2 (MPWTT) is responsible for the policy and regulatory framework and technical
standards. The institutional arrangements for administrating and managing national and local road
networks differed depending on the class of roads (see Table 1). The Albanian Development Fund
(ADF) supported the LGUs in the implementation of competitive grant funding from the Government
and a number of other donor financed projects to improve rural infrastructure.

7.    Little of the local road network (combined regional and communal roads) in Albania was paved,
with 0 percent in good condition 4, 5 percent in fair condition, and 95 percent in poor condition 5. This
reflected previous emphasis on the upgrading and expansion of the primary road network (national
roads), with an inadequate emphasis on maintenance and the neglect of the secondary and local road
network 6 , contributing to an inappropriate balance between capital and recurrent expenditures. In
addition, the responsibilities for managing and maintaining the local road network were decentralized to
the 36 administrative districts, communes and municipalities in 1996, but the capacity and resources
necessary to undertake this role were inadequate. There was also growing concern over road safety in

  Urban roads represent about 2,500 km out of total 15,000 km, and are not discussed in this report. It is also important to note that there are
discrepancies over the length of the total road network, with figures varying from 15,000 km to 18,000 km. For consistency purposes, this
report uses figures from the World Bank 2008b report, which was also used for the PAD.

the country. The sector was also characterized by having non-transparent practices for identification and
selection of sub-projects, which in many cases did not reflect NSSED priorities 7.

8.    Rational for Bank assistance. The PAD presented three main rationales for the involvement of
the World Bank in supporting the Secondary and Local Roads sub-sector, including: (a) Responding to
the desire of the client to improve the management, financing, and condition of secondary and local
roads in Albania. In 2006, the authorities established a task force, headed by the Minister of MPWTT, to
act as a steering committee for a program to pave a significant proportion of the network and improve
the management and financing of the network; (b) Supporting the introduction of the private sector in
road maintenance on the secondary and local road network. At the time of appraisal, limited regular
maintenance was undertaken on the secondary and local road network, and the limited maintenance was
undertaken by force account; (c) Acting as a catalyst for other donors in the sector. The Albanian
authorities welcomed the World Bank playing a leading role both in program preparation and attracting
other international financing institutions to contribute, either within or in parallel to the Project.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

9.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve access to essential services and
economic markets, via the provision of all-weather roads, for the resident population in the hinterland of
the project roads, including: (i) the improvement of priority sections of the secondary (regional) road
network across the Recipient’s territory; (ii) the improvement of priority sections of the local road
network across the Recipient’s territory; and (iii) strengthening of the management of the secondary and
local road network 8. Progress towards achievement of the PDO and implementation progress were to be
assessed through the key indicators presented in Box 1.

          Reasons/Justification

10.       The PDO and Key Indicators were not revised during the course of the Project.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

11.       The Project’s primary target beneficiaries included:

      •    Resident population in the hinterland of the project roads with improved access to health and
           educational facilities and regional markets;
      •    Local construction companies that gained employment opportunities from availability of civil
           works contracts for rehabilitation of secondary and local roads;
      •    Privately owned maintenance companies, which benefitted from the availability of maintenance
           contracts for secondary roads at the end of the Project;
      •    Local residents, who benefitted from training activities provided by the Project. These activities
           included training of local communities to: (i) undertake maintenance, and (ii) manage contracts
           and procure consultants;
      •    ADF benefited from institutional capacity building activities, including formal training events,
           and on-the-job training and knowledge transfer; and
      •    Other stakeholders, participating in the Secondary and Local Roads Improvement Program
           (SLRIP 9 ) as parallel financiers, which benefitted from the technical assistance (including
           feasibility study, environmental and social safeguards documents, detailed designs, and
           supervision consultant, provided by the Bank/Government/OFID financed project).

1.5       Original Components (as approved)

 The ICR uses the abbreviation of the SLRIP when the reference is made to the wider Secondary and Local Roads Improvement Program,
while the abbreviation SLRP is used in relation to the Bank financed part of the program.

2.1   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15. Programmatic approach and donor coordination.                  To achieve the NSDI’s goal of
improving/rehabilitating 6,000 km of rural roads by 2013 through a major investment program on
improving the local road network, the GoA requested the World Bank to develop a SLRIP, and to
contribute financially to the program. In response, the Bank prepared the SLRP, to be co-financed by
the GoA, OFID, and the World Bank (in the amount of US$40m), and leveraged financing from five
other development partners through parallel financing of the overall SLRIP. The total program was
envisaged to be in the range of US$200-300m, and was expected to improve/rehabilitate between 1,000
– 1,500 km of secondary and local roads. The Bank was not the leading sector donor in Albania but was
entrusted to play a key role in catalyzing investments, providing knowledge and institution-building, as
indicated in the findings of the Albania Joint Portfolio Performance Review (JPPR), conducted by the
GoA and the World Bank in 2007. In addition to the increased overall funding that a programmatic
approach would bring about, the other essential benefit of this approach was the efficient use of
resources. This included having one implementing agency for all donor projects under the SLRIP, as
well as maximizing the use of technical assistance financed out of the SLRP, but used by other partners
participating in the SLRIP.

16. Government commitment. The SLRIP was considered highly relevant by the Government                  and
enjoyed overarching support from all levels of the Government throughout preparation                   and
implementation. As a result of this sustained commitment, the programmatic design of the SLRIP,        and
coherent donor coordination efforts, the total funding for SLRIP reached US$368m                        for
improvement/rehabilitation of about 1,089 km, financed by the GoA and nearly ten bilateral             and
multilateral development partners.

Box 2: Secondary and Local Roads Improvement Program
 The SLRIP is a positive outcome of a strong Government commitment and coherent donor coordination efforts,
 led by the World Bank. The program is financially supported by the Government of Albania and many
 multilateral and bilateral development partners, including stakeholders of the Western Balkans Investment
 Framework, Islamic Development Bank and OPEC Fund for International Development. In 2013, the total
 financing of the SLRIP reached US$ 368m equivalent. By the completion of the program in 2015, more than
 1000 km of secondary and local roads will be rehabilitated, benefitting more than 1,200,000 people.
 •    GoA: US$ 14m
 •    CEB: EUR 40m
 •    EBRD: EUR 50m
 •    EIB: EUR 50m
 •    EU IPA 2008-2011: EUR 51.3m
 •    IDB/ ISTISNA: US$ 40m
 •    KfW: EUR 15m

 •    OFID (OPEC) I and II: US$ 25m
 •    WBIF: EUR 4 mln
 •    World Bank: US$ 20m


17. Soundness of the background analysis. The preparation of the SLRP was informed by a number
of World Bank reports including: Improving the Management of Secondary and Tertiary Roads in the


                                                    5
South East Europe Countries (World Bank 2008), Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (World
Bank 2006), Institutions, Management, and Financing of Local Roads (World Bank 2007b), and
Albania: Strategic Policies for a More Comprehensive Agricultural Sector (World Bank 2007a). The
project preparation was financed out of a Project Preparation Advance (PPA), and included a team of
international consultants. Some of the notable outputs of this work, which were to be institutionalized
and utilized for the benefit of all government and donor funded projects participating in the SLRIP were:
(i) preparation of a road inventory survey for the core secondary and local roads network comprising
3,500 km; (ii) establishment of a Road Asset/Maintenance Management System; (iii) review of the
functional and administrative classification of the core secondary and local road network and
development of recommendations for a re-classification, as required; (iv) prioritization of investments
and development of a 5-year investment plan for the SLRIP; (v) preparation of an environmental
management framework; and (vi) preparation of detailed engineering designs for 400 km and tender
documents.

18.    Project Design. The project design was simple and was built around three components.

19. The first two Components related to civil works for the improvement of secondary roads
(Component 1) and local roads (Component 2). Project implementation arrangements properly reflected
institutional responsibilities for road management. During the preparation of the Project, and before the
review of functional and administrative classification under the PPA was completed, the Bank discussed
with the Government possible reclassification of some local roads selected for improvement under the
SLRP as secondary roads. However, the functional classification review was not completed before
appraisal, and no reclassification took place. Since secondary and local roads were managed by
different levels of LGUs, separate implementation and maintenance arrangements were developed for
secondary and local roads. These arrangements were found appropriate and were based on the
capacities of the administrative bodies, which were envisaged to take over these assets once the
improvement/rehabilitation works were completed.

20. The Project design included strong provisions for the improvement of road maintenance. The
Financing Agreement stipulated through a dated covenant 10 that all secondary roads were to be
transferred from the Regional Councils back to the General Road Directorate (GRD 11). This reflected
the agreement reached between the Government and the Bank at the time to ensure appropriate
maintenance of the secondary roads. The local roads were to remain with the LGUs. Sustainability
provisions were made in the Project Agreement 12 to have the ADF and GRD/LGUs sign Investment


10
   The Recipient, through its Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Telecommunications, shall prepare a Council of Minister's draft
decision satisfactory to the Association, to be passed not later than December 31, 2008, transferring the rights for the administration and
management of all secondary regional roads from the Regional Councils to the General Road Directorate (Financing Agreement, Schedule
2, Section I.D).
11
   Since the GRD was reformed into Albanian Road Authority (ARA), this ICR refers to GRD for the early part of the project life, and to
ARA for the later part of the project, following the GRD reform process.
12
   Upon the approval of each Sub-project but before the notification of any bidding opportunity, the Project Implementing Entity shall
conclude: (a) at the time the IA is signed, an Operations and Maintenance Agreement (OMA) with each LGU setting forth a commitment
by the LOU to a multi-annual maintenance agreement between the Project Implementing Entity and the LGU and stating: (i) general
principles for maintenance on the defined road; (ii) confirmation that the costs of the required multi-annual maintenance contract shall be
included in the LGU budget for the next five years; and (iii) a draft contract for a private contractor to undertake maintenance for the next
five (5) years; and (b) an Investment Agreement with the General Road Directorate or a LGU, as the case may be, setting forth: (i) the
obligations of each party in the implementation of the Sub-project; (ii) the maintenance commitments of each party upon the completion of




                                                                     6
Agreements and Operation and Maintenance Agreements, setting forth these entities’ commitments to
multi-annual maintenance agreements, including budget provisions and draft maintenance contacts.

21. The third Component was designed to provide for project implementation and institutional support
to improve management of the infrastructure targeted under the Project (Component 3). However, the
scope of institutional support provided under the Project was much broader than that envisaged in the
PAD and the project Results Framework. Technical assistance, funded from the PPA and the
Component 3 budget, included highly relevant and much needed activities and outputs including
consultant’s services for supervision, estimated to cost US$4.7m, aimed at strengthening the
management of the secondary and local road network. This contract was envisaged to supervise the
civil works financed by other development partners participating in the SLRIP, and not only the road
sections financed by the SLRP. Therefore, although this contract represented about 18 percent of the
civil works under the Project, estimated to cost US$26.3m, it represented less than 5 percent of the
overall program estimated at about US$200-300m. This topic is discussed in more detail under the
section on Monitoring and Evaluation Design (para 36 below).

22. Governance filter. To respond to the World Bank commitment 13 to support the Government’s
efforts in implementing Governance and Anticorruption measures across all sectors of the economy, the
Governance filter was integrated into the project design. Taking into account the lessons learnt under
the Road Maintenance Project (closed in 2007), and to implement the governance filter, a transparent
sub-projects selection was designed, with full participation of communities, whereby the initial selection
of sub-projects, based on a clearly defined criteria, were to be made by the LGUs.

2.2    Implementation

23. Implementation arrangements. The implementation arrangements were clearly defined and
adequately reflected the need for a strong coordination between the many project stakeholders, including
two levels of LGUs, communities, multiple development partners, and GRD. During project appraisal,
the selection of the ADF as an Implementing Agency was highly justified for two reasons: (i) the
Government had decided to use existing public bodies as opposed to creating individual project
implementing units to maximize knowledge transfer and capacity building, and (ii) ADF had a
comparative advantage of working with the LGUs and communities. The ADF was and is still a public
entity in charge of implementing Government and donor funded projects in rural areas across all sectors.
With the gradual expansion of the SLRIP, having a strong implementing agency was instrumental in
ensuring the quality and uniformity of works and services across the whole SLRIP and responded to an
increasing need for coordination.

24. Project ratings. The Project was rated Highly Satisfactory on both the Development Objective
(DO) and Implementation Progress (IP) ratings from the beginning of implementation until April 2012.
Both ratings were downgraded to Satisfactory as a result of delays associated with the transfer of
rehabilitated roads from the LGUs to the GRD. This was justified, considering that the delays



the Sub-project pursuant to the provisions of the OMA; and (iii) the respective obligations to carry out the related EIA, EMP and RAP, as
the case may be and where applicable (Project Agreement, Schedule, Section I.5).

   As described in the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for FY06-FY09 (World Bank 2006).




                                                                   7
undermined the prospects for the sustainability of project outcomes.                                                 The Project closed with
Satisfactory DO and IP ratings.

25. Execution of Project Covenants. All project covenants stipulated by the Financing and Project
Agreements were observed. The Financing Agreement covenant regarding the transfer of secondary
roads to GRD and the Project Agreement covenant on contractual arrangements for the operation and
maintenance phases were executed, albeit with deviations and delays.

26. With regards to the transfer of roads to the GRD, as part of the institutional dialogue with the
Government during the project implementation, the legal covenant required the transfer of all secondary
roads to the GRD by December 31, 2008. However, the GoA and the Bank agreed that the roads to be
transferred will only be those secondary roads rehabilitated under the Project after the defect liability
period (DLP) of 12 months was completed. This same interpretation applied to the EIB/EBRD financed
roads (which included a similar covenant), which represented the biggest share of the SLRIP (530 km).
Based on this agreement the Bank team considered the Borrower to be in compliance with the covenant.
The ICR considers this to be a correct interpretation of the approach, taking into account that the initial
covenant was broadly defined and the Government and IFIs had since set out the transfer mechanism;
also GRD had limited capacity and could only accept the rehabilitated secondary roads. By project
completion, 11 rehabilitated road sections were transferred, and two were pending, awaiting the end of

27. However, some of the local roads improved under the Project do not technically or functionally
belong in the category of secondary roads. While the Government and the Bank is credited for ensuring
that all roads rehabilitated under the Project are maintained appropriately through the transfer of
responsibility to the Albanian Road Authority (ARA), especially given the limitations at LGU level, the
re-classification of these small roads as secondary roads, where not justified by function, undermines the
recommendations of the functional classification, as well as maintenance planning and management
practices at LGU level.

28. With regards to the Contractual Agreements for the Operation and Maintenance phase, the ADF
signed the Investment Agreements with the LGUs, however, considering that all road sections
rehabilitated under the Project were re-classified as secondary roads and subsequently transferred to
ARA, the need to sign the Operations and Maintenance Agreement with LGUs became redundant. No
contractual obligations with ARA were signed. Once the transfer of 11 road sections was formalized by


                                                                      8
the Council of Minister’s Decision 14, the ARA tendered maintenance contracts for these road sections to
the private sector, usually as part of larger regional contracts thereby achieving efficiency savings.
Specific post-completion operation and maintenance arrangements are discussed in section 2.5 below.

29. Low capacity of contractors. The capacity of the local contractors used for the SLRIP was
originally relatively low, with many inexperienced in working with FIDIC bidding documents, or IFIs.
About 80 percent of civil works contracts underwent time extensions, and/or increase in the contract
amounts, and one contract was terminated. This was to a significant extent due to contractors’ limited
technical capacity. As a result, the need for supervision increased substantially. Low capacity of
contractors combined with the fact that the number of civil work contracts under the SLRIP was
growing, led to an increased scope of services for the supervision consultant, and four contract
amendments. In total, the contract amount was increased by about 30 percent. This is considered
justified, taking into account that the consultant supervised about 650 km, and contributed to capacity
building of the small contractors. An important consideration is that for some contractors, this was their
first donor funded project contract and the supervision consultant was providing additional instructions
and assistance to help them fulfill their contractual obligations and meet required standards. There is
evidence at the ADF that the quality of works delivered by the same contractors at the later stages of the
program, financed by other development partners, improved compared to their earlier contracts.

30. Project restructurings. The Project had undergone two Level II restructurings, both approved at
the level of Country Director; details of each restructuring are presented in Table 3.

Table 3: Summary of Project Restructurings
                             Date              Type of
           No.                                                                             Changes

 Restructuring 1         05/23/2011        Level II (CD)            Reallocations of credit proceeds as follows:
                                                                     - Category Refund of PPA reduced by SDR519,344;
                                                                     - Category Works reduced by SDR1,230,000;
                                                                     - Category Goods, Consultants’ Services, Training,
                                                                       Study Tours, Conferences and Operational Costs
                                                                       increased by SDR 1,749,344.
                                                                    1) Reallocations of credit proceeds as follows:
                                                                     - Category Goods, Consultants’ Services, Training,
                                                                       Study Tours, Conferences and Operational Costs
 Restructuring 2         11/13/2012        Level II (CD)               reduced by SDR456,000;
                                                                     - Category Works increased by SDR456,000.
                                                                    2) Extension of project closing date by 6 months from
                                                                       December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.

31. The first restructuring, a reallocation of credit proceeds, was required to increase the scope of the
contract for consultant supervision. The supervision consultant was procured under the Project to
supervise contracts for the whole SLRIP financed by the Government and many other parallel financiers.
The increase in scope was necessitated by the success of the Project in leveraging finance from other



14
     Council of Minister’s Decision No.184, dated March 13, 2012.




                                                                      9
donors and the corresponding increase in the number of construction contracts under implementation at
any one time.

32. The second restructuring comprised of a reallocation of credit proceeds and an extension of project
closing date by six months. The reallocation was undertaken to utilize the unused credit proceeds to
improve/rehabilitate additional 9.4 km (two priority road sections) of secondary road network. The
extension of project closing date was necessary to allow enough time for the completion of these
additional civil works contracts.

33. Assessment of risks. At appraisal, the overall project risk was assessed as Moderate, which was
realistic. The following six main risks were identified: (i) governance issues; (ii) inadequate
maintenance on improved roads; (iii) inadequate ownership by the communities; (iv) inadequate
capacity on the part of the implementing agency; (v) risk of guilt by association; and (vi) diminished
commitment to institutional reform in sector. The risks identified were comprehensive and the
suggested mitigation measures were adequate.

34. No new risks were identified during the course of project implementation, including during the
retrofitting of an Overall Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) into project reporting in January 2013.
With the introduction of ORAF, the Bank team rated the overall risk rating as Low. None of the risks
identified during appraisal materialized, however the risks described under inadequate maintenance on
improved roads and diminished commitment to institutional reform, were highly present throughout
most part of the project implementation. This was due to delays with the execution of the Financing
Agreement covenant on the transfer of rehabilitated roads to ARA. The project team rated this
individual risk as Moderate, while keeping the overall project risk rating as Low until the project closure.
Considering the consequences for project sustainability of this risk materializing, a Moderate overall risk
rating would have been more realistic, but the strength of the dialogue between the GoA and the sector
at the time led the team to take the former position.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35. The M&E design, specifically with regards to the project results framework, had a number of
limitations. However, despite these limitations in the design of the results framework, the
implementation and the utilization of the M&E system turned out to be satisfactory. The long-term
efficacy of the program wide M&E framework will be known when ADF undertakes the envisaged
impact assessment of the program.

36. M&E Design. The design of the project M&E system, specifically in relation to the project results
framework was not adequately complete, specific, measurable, or sufficiently accurate. The detailed
analysis of the M&E design, including the PDO statement, PDO-level results indicators, intermediate-
level results indicators, and M&E arrangements is provided below.

-     PDO statement. The PDO statement was formulated around one aspect of the Project, the essence
      of which was to improve access to essential services and economic markets for the resident
      population in the hinterland of the project roads. The rest of the PDO is a restatement of the project
      components. The PDO statement did not provide the same weighing to the institutional dimensions,
      which was to strengthen the management of the secondary and local road network. This aspect was



                                                     10
     presented as one of the three elements of the Project to help improve access to services and markets,
     while it could have also been presented as a second separate aspect of the PDO statement.
 -   PDO-level results indicators 15. The achievement of the PDO was to be assessed through four
     outcome indicators, as presented in Box 1. All four of these outcome indicators measured the
     progress toward the achievement of improving access to essential services and economic markets to
     the resident population. Since the institutional aspects of the Project were not presented separately
     in the PDO, there was no outcome indicator to measure the progress toward the achievement of
     strengthening of the management of the secondary and local road network. PDO indicator 1,
     measured the improved access by the number of communities; however, communities varied in size,
     and had different number of residents. The results would have been captured better if this indicator
     was measured by the number of people. PDO indicators 2, 3, and 4 were not clearly measurable.
     These indicators were expressed in percentage, however, neither numerators nor denominators were
     defined.
-    Intermediate-level results indicators 16. The project’s results framework included six intermediate
     indicators, as presented in Box 1. Many important activities aimed at strengthening the
     management of the secondary and local road network (Component 3), especially those financed out
     of PPA, were not adequately captured by the results framework. The results framework has three
     intermediate indicators related to Component 3. The first one, Management Information System
     (MIS) in place and functioning, was broadly defined, as MIS is a general term which could be
     interpreted in many ways. Perhaps use of Road Asset / Road Maintenance Management System
     would have been a more specific indicator. Also, the broad definition of the indicator did not
     capture if the system was used. This indicator could have been more results-oriented, if it had
     captured the length of roads fed into the management system or the number of investment decisions
     informed by the system. Similarly, the number of people trained in local communities, to undertake
     maintenance (intermediate indicator 4), and to manage contracts and procure consultants
     (intermediate indicator 5), are output oriented indicators, which do not demonstrate if the trainees
     used the acquired knowledge in practice. Intermediate indicator 6 had an issue of attribution.
     Although, undoubtedly, an increase in maintenance budget was highly relevant to the sustainability
     of the PDO, there were no activities under the Project which targeted the budget increase; therefore
     the Project could not be credited for the changes in the increase of budget allocations.
-    M&E arrangements. At appraisal, baseline and supplemental values were not presented for PDO
     indicators 2, 3, and 4, and intermediate indicators 4, 5, and 6. The annual target values for PDO
     indicator 1, 2, 3, and 4 were not linked to the corresponding target values of intermediate indicators
     1 and 2. According to the Results Framework, the number of km of roads improved or rehabilitated
     were planned from year 3 of the Project, while communities were expected to have improved access


15
   PDO Indicator 1: The number of communities that have improved access to markets, social services and administrative centers by project
end; PDO Indicator 2: Proportional increase in traffic volumes one year after project road sections improved or rehabilitated; PDO
Indicator 3: Change in road user perception of road quality; and PDO indicator 4: Proportional reduction in travel time on project roads in
free flowing conditions.
16
   Intermediate Indicator 1: Number of km of secondary roads improved or rehabilitated; Intermediate Indicator 2: Number of km of local
roads improved or rehabilitated; Intermediate Indicator 3: Management Information System in place and functioning; Intermediate
Indicator 4: Number of people trained to undertake maintenance; Intermediate Indicator 5: Number of people in the communes trained to
procure contractors to undertake maintenance; Intermediate Indicator 6: Proportional increase in annual recurrent maintenance budget for:
(i) National roads; (ii) Local roads (6).




                                                                   11
    to markets and services starting from year 1, before the roads are build, etc. Also, it appeared that
    the annual target values for the PDO indicator 1 were supposed to be cumulative, however it was
    unclear, since the year 3 values were set higher than the year 4 values. The annual and the end target
    values for the intermediate indicators 4, 5, and 6 were not defined, which made the assessment of
    progress towards and the achievement of these intermediate outcomes more challenging.
37. M&E Implementation. Despite the limitations in the design of the results framework, the
implementation of the M&E system is considered to be satisfactory.
-   M&E arrangements (results framework): With regards to the PDO indicators, as documented in
    the project reporting, the missing baseline values for PDO indicators 2 and 4 were collected before
    the start of the road improvement works. The end target value for PDO Indicator 1 was corrected.
    Although some of the project reports claimed that the target of providing improved road access to
    50 communities had been exceeded by almost 60 percent, the reason for that was not because the
    Project rehabilitated more km of roads, but because the end target value at appraisal was
    miscalculated. The corrected end target value of 81 communities was exceeded by about 6 percent.
    The ADF also collected data on the number of people residing in these benefitting communities.
    With regards to the intermediate results indicators, no baseline or target values were introduced to
    intermediate indicator 8 and 9. The project team could have taken more proactive actions to adjust
    the results framework during the MTR review or project restructurings.
-   M&E arrangements (data collection): The data was collected by the ADF with support from the
    LGUs and supervision consultant and reported regularly. In addition to regular M&E reporting, the
    ADF commissioned and completed a Beneficiary Assessment Report in 2010, and initiated the
    Impact Evaluation for the SLRIP in late 2012. To date, a Baseline Report of Rural Roads
    Rehabilitation Project in Albania (Household and Community Survey) has been completed, with the
    follow-up Socio-Economic Household and Community Survey expected to start in 2013-2014. The
    surveys will be done gradually, as each individual donor financed project comes to an end. The
    SLRP was the first project to join the SLRIP, and was the first one to have been completed so far.
-   Core Sector Indicators. Following the institution-wide introduction of core sector indicators in
    2009, the project’s results framework was expanded in the Bank’s reporting to include core sector
    indicators, which the Bank team considered relevant to the Project. Box 3 presents the results
    framework as it appeared in the Bank reports following the retrofitting exercise. One noticeable
    change introduced by the Bank team was the substitution of the intermediate indicator 1 and 2
    (number of km of secondary and local roads improved or rehabilitated) with the core sector
    indicator road rehabilitated, non-rural (km). This reflected the fact that all local roads rehabilitated
    under the Project were re-classified as secondary roads. The mandatory core indicator on direct
    project beneficiaries was included, however, did not specify the percentage of female beneficiaries.
    The introduction of the core sector indicators was not formally reflected in the project’s results
    framework, and the Implementing Agency’s reporting did not reflect these changes.

Box 3: PDO and Intermediate Results Indicators following the introduction of core sector
indicators
 PDO Indicators:
 • Number of communities that have improved access to markets, social services and administrative centers
   by project end;
 • Proportional increase in traffic volumes one year after project road sections improved or rehabilitated;
 • Roads in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads (core sector indicator);
 • Size of the total classified network (core sector indicator, supplemental);
 • Share of rural population with access to an all-season road (core sector indicator);
 • Number of rural people with access to an all-season road (core sector indicator, supplemental);
 • Change in road user perception of road quality;
 • Proportional reduction in travel time on project roads in free flowing conditions.
 Intermediate Results Indicators:
 • Roads rehabilitated, non-rural (core sector indicator);
 • Management Information System in place and functioning;
 • Number of people trained to undertake maintenance;
 • Number of people in the communes trained to procure contractors to undertake maintenance;
 • Increase in annual recurrent maintenance budget for: (i) National roads; (ii) Local roads.


38. M&E Utilization. The project M&E system feeds into a wider M&E system for the SRLIP
administered by the ADF. One of the notable M&E achievements under the Project, was the
establishment and use of the road maintenance management system (ROMAPS), which is now
institutionalized and which by project completion contained data on approximately 4,120 km of regional
and local roads, including data on road inventory, road condition, location referencing, traffic video data
collection, and drainage structures. The data generated by ADF using ROMAPS is being used by LGUs
for budgeting purposes, as well as to support investment decisions for selection of roads to be
implemented under the SRLIP, which in total envisages the rehabilitation of 1,089 km of roads financed
by GoA and nearly ten development partners.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39. Safeguard compliance. Overall safeguards compliance with the Bank policy and procedural
requirements is rated Satisfactory. The Project was assigned an Environmental Category A. The Project
triggered the following safeguard policies: Environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01); Natural habitats
(OP/BP 4.04); Physical cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11); Involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); and
Forests (OP/BP 4.36). All required safeguard documents, including Environmental Safeguards
Framework, Environmental Management Plans (EMP), Resettlement Policy Framework, and
Resettlement Action Plans (RAP), were prepared, appropriately disclosed, and consulted upon.

40. Issues arising during implementation, including a complaint from a resident of Hajmel commune
about construction works having a negative effect on a private land, and resettlement and compensation
related to the construction of a new bridge in Berat, were dealt with in accordance with the World Bank
policies in a satisfactory manner. During the improvement of the local road “Ura e Gorices – Fshat
Mbreshtan” in the Berat region, an 18th century bridge was identified, which was listed as a Monument
of Culture in the records of the Albanian Institute of Monuments and Culture (AIMC). In order to
preserve this historic bridge named Velabisht, in consultation with the AIMC, a decision was taken to


                                                    13
close the bridge to traffic, restore it as a pedestrian only bridge, and construct a new bridge nearby for
the diverted traffic. The construction of the new vehicular bridge required preparation and
implementation of site specific EMP and RAP, and expropriation of private land, for which the affected
persons were compensated in accordance with the Albanian Law, and satisfactory to the Bank.
Although finalization of this matter took longer than expected, it was done diligently. The Bank hired a
consultant with expertise on preservation of historic monuments, who advised the Borrower on the
preservation activities. The technical designs for the ancient bridge (now pedestrian) were prepared in
close cooperation with AIMC engineers. The new vehicular bridge was constructed and opened to traffic
in December 2013. With the diversion of traffic from the historic bridge to the new vehicular bridge, the
ancient bridge is now closed to vehicular traffic and the restoration activities are expected to begin
shortly. Works on both bridges are financed by OFID through parallel co-financing of the SLRP, which
was set to close on December 31, 2013. An extension of the closing date of the OFID agreement was
requested by the Borrower, and is currently being considered by OFID. According to ADF, preliminary
discussions with OFID indicated that the extension would be granted.

41. Fiduciary compliance. The Procurement and Financial Management performance by the ADF is
rated Satisfactory. The ADF was adequately staffed, conducted all procurement activities in accordance
with the relevant World Bank procurement guidelines, with no delays. The SLRP was also the first
project in the ECA region to successfully pilot e-procurement. The financial management arrangements
were satisfactory throughout the project implementation, with an adequate accounting system, accurate
maintenance of accounting records and timely preparation and submission of the interim and annual
financial reports. All project audits were conducted in a timely manner and were issued unqualified
opinions. Audits of the ADF’s consolidated financial statements were also satisfactory. Minor
recommendations of the auditors to further strengthen ADF’s systems and controls were addressed in a
timely manner. Since the project closed half way through the financial year of the Borrower, the project
audit for the year ending December 31, 2013 is expected by June 2014. This audit will cover the last six
months of the project implementation.

2.5   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42. Transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation. The World Bank was the first donor to exit the SLRIP. The existing program will continue
until December 31, 2015. There is an indication from the EU that IPA 2014 funds may go towards
financing the SLRIP. Sustaining the road network, rather than expanding it, is one of the Government’s
top priorities in the transport sector. In view of this, the Government requested the World Bank to focus
its next operation in the sector on supporting the improvement of maintenance and safety practices in
relation to the national road network. There is an understanding between the GoA and the Bank that the
road sections rehabilitated under the SLRP and transferred to ARA, will be in the priority list for
maintenance contracts financed under the proposed new IBRD Results-based Road Maintenance and
Safety Project (RRMSP).

43. Operation & Maintenance arrangements. In the meantime, following the completion of the
DLP and the consequent formal transfer of 11 out of 13 roads rehabilitated under the SLRP to ARA,
ARA initiated procurement of the maintenance contracts, to be financed by the state budget. These
maintenance contracts are grouped by regions, and maintenance of the roads rehabilitated under the
SLRP are part of bigger regional maintenance contracts. The remaining two contracts are still under the



                                                   14
DLP and are expected to be transferred following the same mechanism once the DLP is completed.
Most of the contracts have now been signed and will finance maintenance during two years. In Albania
the common practice for maintenance contracts is to award three year contracts, however, in this case,
ARA signed the contracts for two years only, in anticipation of the financing provided by the proposed
RRMSP. The details of the contacts are provided in Annex 2 (Table 2-2).

44. Next phase/follow-up operation. The proposed RRMSP, tentatively in the amount of US$50-
100m, is currently under preparation and is scheduled to be delivered to the Board in FY15. The
proposed RRMSP will finance maintenance activities on selected national roads on a performance basis,
as well as institutional activities to improve national road maintenance planning and management
practices. Improving road safety standards and practices will be another overarching objective of the
proposed project. The proposed project will be implemented by ARA under the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport (MPWT).

3     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45. The project objectives, design, and implementation continues to be relevant to the country, sector,
and World Bank strategy priorities. The SLRP was the first project to be completed under the wider
SLRIP. Since 2008, different development partners have been joining the SLRIP throughout 2011, and
the program continues to be implemented until at least 2015. According to ADF, there is indication from
the EU that IPA 2014 funds may go towards financing of the SLRIP, which is another factor that
demonstrates that the program continues to be relevant.

46. Country priorities. The Government’s NSDI for the period 2007-2013 is coming to an end, and
the preparation of the next NSDI for the period 2014-2020 is well underway. Current road sector
priorities of the draft NSDI 2014-2020 include a strong focus on construction, rehabilitation, and
management of the national road network, while the regional development part of the NSDI recognizes
the importance of improving the secondary and local roads. The draft NSDI identifies Sustained Growth
through Efficient Use of Resources as one of its strategic goals, which identifies a need for improvement,
expansion, and maintenance of the road transport infrastructure in line with EU standards ensuring
environmental protection. While the draft NSDI road sector priorities do not specifically mention the
improvement of the condition and management of the secondary and local road network in a way the
NSDI 2007-2013 did, secondary and local roads appear to be targeted under the Regional Development
part of the draft NSDI, with improvement of infrastructure linking the regions identified as one of the
strategic priorities.

47. Sector priorities. The Project remains highly relevant to the Transport Strategy 2008-2013, which
is the same document that was governing the transport sector at the time of project appraisal. A new
Transport Strategy is being prepared, but has not yet been made public. The Project also remains highly
relevant to the Albanian National Transport Plan 2030 (ANTP2), which was prepared in 2010, when the
SLRP just reached its mid-term point.

48. World Bank strategy priorities. The CPS for the period FY11-FY14 acknowledges that Albania
has been steadily improving its transport infrastructure, including the 1,700 km of secondary and local
roads to be rehabilitated by the completion of the SLRIP, but also recognizes that there is a long way to


                                                   15
go before the road network reaches the average standard for lower middle income countries, and
recognizes the need for greater emphasis on maintenance. The Project remains relevant to the road
sector priorities identified by the CPS. The CPS Progress Report 2013 confirms the relevance of these
priorities but in light of the continued deterioration in the external environment, growing fiscal
constraints and power sector problems, increases the CPS' emphasis on reducing economic, financial
sector and energy sector vulnerabilities and postpones the proposed RRMSP to the next CPS.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49. The achievement of Project Development Objective is assessed as Highly Satisfactory. The Project
objective was to improve access to essential services and economic markets, via the provision of all-
weather roads, for the resident population in the hinterland of the project roads, including: (i) the
improvement of priority sections of the secondary (regional) road network across the Recipient’s
territory; (ii) the improvement of priority sections of the local road network across the Recipient’s
territory; and (iii) strengthening of the management of the secondary and local road network. The
assessment of PDO achievement, including each of the three parts of the PDO, is provided below.

50. The improvement of priority sections of the secondary (regional) road network and local
road network across the Recipient’s territory (i and ii). The achievement of these two parts of the
PDO is assessed as Highly Satisfactory. The assessment is supported by project outcome indicators 1 to
4, which were envisaged in the Results Framework. The end target results for all four indicators have
been exceeded. As a result of improvement / rehabilitation of 118.9 km of secondary and local roads
under the Project, 113,608 people in 86 communities now have improved access to services and markets
(PDO Indicator 1). This includes 28 km of rehabilitated secondary roads (Intermediate Indicator 1),
benefitting 28,933 residents in 23 communities, and 90.9 km of rehabilitated local roads (Intermediate
Indicator 2), benefitting 84,675 residents in 63 communities. The traffic volumes on the improved
secondary and local roads have increased by 21 percent (PDO Indicator 2). The road user perception
rating of road quality has improved by 6 levels, from level 0 to level 6 on the Likert scale, compared to
an expected increase of 2 levels (PDO Indicator 3) 17. Finally, the travel time on project roads in free
flowing conditions was reduced by 60 percent (PDO Indicator 4).

51. Strengthening of the management of the secondary and local road network (iii). The
achievement of this part of the PDO is assessed as Highly Satisfactory. The Results Framework did not
have project outcome indicators to substantiate the achievement of this part of the PDO. The
intermediate results indicators and project outputs associated with Component 3 were used for the
assessment.

52. Prior to the initiation of the SLRP, the Government’s focus in the transport sector was on
expanding the national road network and as a result the secondary and local road network was neglected.
The information about secondary and local roads was fragmented and as a result of decentralization
spread between LGUs. Rehabilitation and maintenance were limited and undertaken without planning
and preparation. The selection of road sections was not supported by socio-economic analysis and was
characterized as nontransparent. The Project is assessed as having addressed these weaknesses and


17
     The Results Framework describes an increase of two levels on a scale of Level 0 to Level 10 as a 20 percent increase.




                                                                      16
contributed to the strengthening of the management of the secondary and local road network in the
following ways:

-   Road asset/maintenance management system. ROMAPS was established and is being used by
    ADF as the main road asset/maintenance management system for the wider SLRIP, including roads
    improved under the SLRP (Intermediate Indicator 3). Data on approximately 4,120 out of total
    9,000 km of regional and local roads was entered into ROMAPS by the closing date of the SLRP.
    This work was initiated within the framework of the PPA, one of the outputs of which was the
    inventory of the 3,500 km of core secondary and local road network, identified by Qarks as lifeline
    roads. The SLRP financed by the Government/Bank/OFID was the first project to close. The wider
    SLRIP financed by the Government and other development partners is on-going and the ADF is
    continuing the work of extending the inventory to include the data on the remaining roads into
    ROMAPS. With the transfer of responsibilities for the maintenance of secondary roads rehabilitated
    under the Project to ARA, ADF has also transferred the software and the data on 118.9 km of all
    roads rehabilitated under the Project. Two ARA employees were trained to use the ROMAPS.
-   Functional re-classification of all roads. As part of the PPA, a review of functional classification
    of all secondary and local roads in the country was conducted. The review was based on the
    inventory of 3,500 km of roads produced earlier, as well as other sources of information made
    available to the consultant. The review produced criteria for the functional reclassification based on
    road functions, as well as a list of all secondary and local roads with the suggested new
    classification. By the end of the Project all 90.9 km of local roads rehabilitated under the Project
    were re-classified as secondary roads, however, it remains unclear if all of these local roads belong
    technically and functionally to the category of secondary roads.
-   Administration and management of secondary roads. As a result of the Project, a decision of the
    Council of Ministers was approved to transfer the rights for the administration and management of
    the secondary roads rehabilitated under the Project from the Regional Councils / MoI to the ARA /
    MPWT. This was a covenant for the SLRP, and is also a covenant for the EBRD/EIB financed
    project. Transferring the rights of the secondary roads to ARA made it possible to ensure necessary
    capacity and budget funds to maintain these roads.
-   Prioritization of investments and development of a five-year investment plan. As part of the
    feasibility study of the core secondary and local road network financed out of the PPA proceeds, the
    consultant developed socio economic criteria for prioritization of road improvement investments
    and prepared a five-year investment plan which provided the foundation for donor investments
    under the SLRIP.
-   Capacity building of communities in maintenance of secondary and local roads. As a result of
    the Project, a nationwide training program on maintenance of roads for 750 residents in 374 LGUs
    forming 12 Qarks was conducted (Intermediate Indicators 4 and 5). The training programs were
    developed based on the needs assessments of LGUs and focused on different aspects of undertaking
    routine maintenance as well as planning and procuring maintenance contractors. Since all local
    roads rehabilitated under the Project were re-classified as secondary roads and transferred to ARA,
    maintenance of these roads will be undertaken by ARA. The initial feedback received from the
    residents of communes was positive, however, the findings of the beneficiary assessment (see
    Annex 5) suggested the residents were skeptical in the longer term. Nevertheless, as a result of these
    trainings, awareness of the commune residents to the importance of road maintenance is thought to
    have increased.


                                                   17
3.3    Efficiency

53.    The Project is assessed to have achieved its objectives efficiently.

54. Economic analysis. The ex-ante economic analysis was done for 11 road sections improved under
the Project using the Roads Economic Decision (RED) model that captures the primary benefits of the
Project, which are the reduction in vehicle operating costs and passenger time costs. The overall ex-ante
ERR of the Project was 16 percent with ERRs ranging from 12 to 28 percent. The ex-post economic
analysis was done for the same road sections also using the RED model and main assumptions of 15
year evaluation period and 12 percent discount rate.

55. The ex-post economic analysis was done considering the actual upgrading costs and the actual
annual traffic growth rate from 2008 to 2010 for each project road. On average the contract costs are 13
percent less than the estimated costs at appraisal and the actual cost are 16 percent higher than the
contract costs. The average traffic of the project roads increased from 207 vehicles per day in 2008 to
250 vehicles per day in 2010, representing an average traffic growth rate of 9.8 percent per year. In
comparison, the traffic growth rate adopted for the ex-ante economic analysis was 8.0 percent per year.
The ex-post overall ERR of the Project is 18.8 percent with ERRs ranging from 5.8 to 51.4 percent. The
ex-post overall ERR is higher than the ex-ante estimate (16 percent) due to the lower actual upgrading
costs and higher annual traffic growth rate found on average on the project roads. The analysis is a
conservative estimate of the project benefits as it did not incorporate the additional long term benefits of
more efficient management of road network, which will result from the institutional development
component.

56.    Other efficiency aspects include:

-     Programmatic design. The programmatic approach allowed for efficient use of resources in
      relation to several aspects, including: a) leveraging US$368m with an IDA credit of US$20m; b)
      use of one implementing agency for nearly ten development partners increasing administrative
      efficiency and avoiding duplication of efforts; c) use of technical assistance outputs produced under
      the Project by other development partners (including road inventory and condition survey for 3,500
      km, designs for 400 km, safeguards documents); d) use of a supervision consultant financed under
      the Project to supervise 650 km of civil works funded by other development partners;
-     Road management system. The data generated by ADF using ROMAPS is being used by LGUs
      for budgeting purposes, as well as to support investment decisions for selection of roads to be
      implemented under the SRLIP. This contributes to a more efficient use of limited budget resources;
-     Capacity building of contractors. Building the capacity of local road construction industry
      through the early contracts of the program contributed to contractors becoming more efficient and
      professional and improved the quality of works at a later stage of the program;
-     Preparation and implementation timeframe and budget. The Project was prepared in seven
      months. The original project implementation period was five years. Although there was a six-
      month extension of the project closing date, this was done in order to utilize savings and rehabilitate
      two additional segments of roads, totaling 9.4 km. Both project preparation and implementation
      were on budget.



                                                      18
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

57. The Project objective, design, and implementation remain relevant to Albania’s current
development priorities and the Bank’s on-going CPS, and highly relevant to sector priorities. The
Project achieved its PDO highly satisfactorily and in an efficient manner. The ex-post overall ERR of
the Project is 18.8 percent with ERRs ranging from 5.8 to 51.4 percent, which is higher than the ex-ante
ERR of 16 percent. The project’s programmatic design and satisfactory implementation also contributed
to enhancing the efficiency of the Project. On balance, based on the evaluation of the project’s relevance,
achievement of PDO, and efficiency, the Overall Outcome Rating is assessed as Highly Satisfactory.

3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58. The limited qualitative analysis conducted by ADF by means of the Beneficiary Assessment
Report, as discussed in section 3.6 below, indicates that improved access to roads had a significant
impact on socio-economic conditions of the beneficiaries. No gender analysis was undertaken as part of
the assessment. To better understand what role the Project played in contributing to rural poverty
alleviation, in 2012 the ADF commissioned a comprehensive nation-wide Household and Community
Survey. The survey will evaluate the impact of the entire SLRIP, which by the end of 2015 is expected
to benefit more than one million people. Among other things, the evaluation will measure the change in
average income in beneficiary communities compared to non-beneficiary communities as well as
evaluate changes in farm and non-farm activities before and after road rehabilitation. It will be
important to wait for the findings of this in-depth survey before any poverty impacts can be attributed to
the Project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59. Institutional strengthening brought about by the Project is discussed in detail in section 3.2 para 51.
The decentralized management of the secondary and local roads at the LGU level faces many challenges,
including inadequate resources, lack of incentives, and limited road sector technical expertise, to name a
few. Against this background, directly involving the LGUs in project implementation was not possible.
ADF, as an implementing agency, has undoubtedly received the most targeted capacity building
activities through the implementation of the Component 3 of the Project. While in the short run, having
an ADF type implementing agency has proved very successful in many World Bank financed projects
across different sectors, longer-term sustainability of such implementation mechanisms in relation to
projects in rural areas remains questionable. Nevertheless, such arrangements can bring institutional
changes, such as the use of ADF generated ROMAPS data by the LGUs for planning and prioritizing the
investments.

3.6   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey

60. A Beneficiary Assessment Survey on “Improvement of Secondary and Local Roads” project was
conducted by ADF in November-December 2010. The objective of the survey was to assess the impact
of the SLRP on the beneficiary communities. The assessment covered a sample of 300 individuals. This



                                                   19
was a representative sample of 96,000 direct project beneficiaries living along the original 11 road
sections financed by the SLRP. All 11 road sections were in different regions of Albania. The
methodology used in the survey included detailed personal interviews and focus group discussions.

61. Overall, the implementation of the SLRP was assessed as very successful. The assessment
reported that the improved roads brought about the following social and economic benefits to over
95,000 residents of beneficiary communities: (i) increase in access to healthcare centers, educational
institutions, and markets; (ii) reduction in travel time; (iii) reduction in agricultural production cost and
increase in the family incomes; (iv) considerable improvement to public transport facilities and to travel
conditions, and reduction in travel cost; (v) increase in employment opportunities and access to job
market; (vi) increase in opportunities for entrepreneurship and establishment of new businesses; (vii)
restriction in rural exodus and the construction of new houses; (viii) strengthening of community
interactions. The details of these findings are presented in Annex 5.

62. However despite the positive results reported as achieved under the Project, the respondents voiced
areas for further improvements. With regards to road design quality, they felt that the roads improved
under the Project might have been better designed to include wider road width, illumination along the
entire road length, construction of sidewalks in residential areas, elimination of sharp road curves, and
provision of road signs. With regards to road operation and maintenance, despite the trainings provided
by the ADF on road operation and maintenance, the interviewed beneficiaries remained skeptical.

4    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

63. Sustaining the improved access to essential services and economic markets for residents of the
benefitted communities will require diligent management and maintenance of the rehabilitated roads.
The Project ensured that adequate arrangements were successfully put in place to sustain the achieved
results through: (a) transfer of all secondary roads rehabilitated under the SLRP to ARA. In accordance
with the Law on Albanian Road Authority 18 and the Council of Minister’s Decision No. 184 19, ARA is
now legally in charge of administration and management of all secondary roads rehabilitated under the
SLRP; (b) contracting out maintenance of all roads rehabilitated under the SLRP to the private sector
(see Table 2-2 of Annex 2); and (c) transfer of ROMAPS data on the project rehabilitated roads to ARA
for future asset management and maintenance, and traning of ARA staff on using ROMAPS. Despite
these positive achievements that increase the likelihood of sustainability of project outcomes, there is a
risk of insufficient budget allocation for maintenance purposes at the state budget level and/or within
ARA’s budget. The probability of this risk materialising is considered to be Moderate.

64. Shifting priorities at the country level. The GoA appreciates the importance of preserving the
country’s road infrastructure on a sustainable basis by shifting expenditures toward maintenance. This
was confirmed by the Government’s request to the World Bank to prepare the RRMSP, which intends to

Republic of Albania”.




                                                             20
continue the institutional reforms on improving the management of road assets. However, country
economic conditions, limited fiscal space and other pressing priorities may require the Government to
shift the focus within the sector and also with respect to other sectors of the economy. This has already
happened once, when the proposed RRMSP was postponed to the upcoming CPS to make space for
other important priorities.

65. Insufficient budget allocation. The Project ensured that maintenance contracts for most of the
project roads were contracted out to the private sector. The Government will be financing these
maintenance contracts out of its own budget for the next two years. However, considering that the
Albanian road sector accumilated a significant amount in outstanding arrears, the budget allocated may
be insufficient. According to the findings of the recent Public Expenditure Review 20, the construction
association claimed that as of 2012 the amount of unpaid bills for completed road works in Albania was
above EUR200m. The World Bank did not receive an official confirmation of the outstanding amount
but understands that as of 2013 this amount has been decreased to EUR50m. Once two-year
maintenance contracts are completed, there is an agreement with the World Bank that maintenance of
these road sections will be suggested to be covered by the proposed RRMSP.

5       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1       Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

66. The project team is credited for responding to the Government’s priorities by utilizing a
programmatic approach for the preparation of the SLRIP. The programmatic approach, which
envisaged preparation of a feasibility study, detailed designs, safeguard documents, and other relevant
documentation for a wider program, was instrumental in allowing the Government and the project team
to leverage financing from many sources. The Project was informed by a solid background analysis.
The design was simple and straight forward. The Project was prepared in seven months and within a
standard preparation budget. A satisfactory rating is considered appropriate taking into account the
limitations of the results framework, and the broad framework provided for the transfer of roads to GRD,
which could have been defined more realistically.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

67.      The Bank’s supervision efforts are considered to be satisfactory. The safeguards and fiduciary
responsibilities were executed and reported in a satisfactory manner. With regards to the restoration
activities for the ancient Velabisht bridge, while the process was handled in full compliance with the
provisions of OP/BP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources, with active involvement of the AIMC, and the
effected community, the process took a long time. These activities are financed out of OFID co-
financing of the SLRP, which has a closing date of December 31, 2013, however, is in the process of

     World Bank. 2013. Public Expenditure Review (unpublished).




                                                                  21
being extended. As of December 2013, the restoration activities have not yet been completed.
Considering that the Velabisht bridge was identified as a monument of culture back in October 2008,
continuous supervision could have possibly speed up the process.

68. Having an on-going dialogue with ARA through the World Bank financed Transport Project
helped ensure the necessary coordination between ARA and other parties involved in secondary road
transfers. The Bank could have provided more support on discussions around re-classification of the
rehabilitated local roads into secondary roads for a consequent transfer to ARA, and document these
discussions. Some of the smaller local roads did not seem to have obvious technical and functional
justification to be classified as secondary roads. Perhaps more appropriate maintenance arrangements for
local roads should have been followed, as oppose to re-classifying them as secondary. With regards to
the limitations of the Results Framework design, the Bank could have improved these during
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

69. Based on the above evaluation of the Bank’s performance at entry and at supervision, the Overall
Bank Performance is assessed as Satisfactory.

5.2   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

70. The GoA provided strong support to the Project from conception, through preparation, and
subsequent implementation both at central and LGUs levels. Despite many pressing development
priorities, the GoA stayed committed to the objectives of the SLRIP and continued to increase the scope
of the Project by attracting more financial support from other development partners. Project
implementation was carried out by the ADF and the GoA did not hamper the project progress through
political intervention. The Project was implemented in line with the provisions of the Financing
Agreement. The Government’s co-financing share was appropriately budgeted and provided on a timely
basis. The Financing Agreement covenant on transfer of secondary roads to ARA for further
maintenance was executed in a satisfactory way, albeit with delays. The ARA signed maintenance
contracts on almost all rehabilitated road sections, and those few pending had to be re-tendered for
reasons outside of ARA’s control. The GoA also increased the annual maintenance budget for national
and local roads, as documented by the Results Framework.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

71. The ADF is an implementing agency for the whole SLRIP. With the gradual expansion of the
program, the ADF ensured good coordination between the central government and two levels of LGUs,
communities, and multiple development partners. To respond to the demands of this large program, the
ADF’s organizational structure underwent positive changes which ensured adequate staffing throughout
the implementation. The ADF carried out project implementation in accordance with the provisions of
the legal documents of the SLRP. All safeguards (including environmental and social) and fiduciary


                                                  22
(including procurement, accounting, auditing, disbursement and financial management) compliances
were observed throughout the implementation. With regards to the completion of restoration activities
for the ancient Velabisht bridge, as discussed in para 67, a more diligent follow up on the side of the
ADF could have possibly speed up the process. The M&E arrangements were satisfactory. The
institutionalization of the ROMAPS, and the use of data generated by ADF for LGU budgeting and
investment prioritization was one of the most important outcomes of the M&E system. All reporting
under the Project was done on time. The advice given and the actions agreed upon in the aide memoires
were followed up in a satisfactory manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

72. Based on the above assessment of Government and Implementing Agency Performance, and
taking into account the overall cooperation between the Borrower and the Bank during the project
execution, the Overall Borrower Performance is assessed as Satisfactory.

6       Lessons Learned

73. The lessons learnt from this Project are presented below. Some of the vital lessons were identified
by the project team and summarized in the Transport Notes No. 41 21. The ICR includes some of these
lessons here as being insightful and informative.

74. Strong political support. To develop and implement a program of this size, strong political
support and commitment from all levels of Government is paramount. The Project received strong
support at the highest levels of the GoA throughout all stages of the project cycle. The advantage of this
high level support by the governing coalition and key partners was that it avoided delays to project
preparation and ensured that implementation issues were dealt with quickly. The disadvantage of this
support could have been that the transparency and objectivity of selection of priority roads may have
been eroded by political considerations during the pre-electoral period. Having transparent selection
criteria and involving communities to the selection process mitigate potential political pressures.

75. Sound strategy and action plan and coherent donor coordination. For a programmatic
approach of this type to be successful, particularly if it is to be attractive to other donors, there must be a
strong strategy and action plan. This should include a robust independent feasibility study that illustrates
technical and social/environmental viability, together with a list of priority investments selected on the
basis of economic efficiency and other broader criteria such as poverty, population, community
preference, and agricultural potential. Coordinated donor efforts are also paramount. The project
benefitted from the coherent coordination within the WBIF stakeholders, which represents the biggest
financial contribution to the SLRIP, and IDB and OFID.

76. Strong and experienced implementing agency. Having a competent implementing agency able
to effectively coordinate between multiple project stakeholders (including more than 25 LGUs, nearly
ten development partners, communities, ARA, etc.) was instrumental in successfully managing the

                                                      23
SLRIP. In light of community and LGU involvement in the Project, the type of implementing agency
was very important. Originally, the Government selected the MPWTT as an implementing agency but
changed it to the ADF during early preparation. This proved to be an excellent decision, especially in
light of ADF’s solid track record of working with the communities and LGUs in implementing
Government and donor funded infrastructure projects as well as capacity building for better governance.

77. Strong supervision. ADF did not have substantial experience in road construction and it was
critical that they were supported by an international consultant with relevant experience with
International Financial Institutions and road supervision. This was complemented by hiring international
consulting engineers to supervise the civil works under the entire SLRIP. The firm provided a mix of
international and local engineers, who transferred their knowledge to regional and technical inspectors
already within ADF. Bank supervision was also important in ensuring the quality works. The
requirement that representatives of the firm and the supervision engineer visit every section frequently
with the Bank team in different weather conditions ensured that defects were addressed.

78. Reimbursable supervision arrangements for co-financiers. Looking into the future one lesson
could be for Bank teams to consider a reimbursable supervision arrangement financed by co-financiers
who may request the Bank to take a lead in supervising the whole project. Under such an arrangement,
for instance, works financed by other IFIs could be supervised under reimbursable arrangements to
cover Bank supervision costs. For this Project such arrangements could have been useful considering
that the Bank financed part of the Project closed on June 30, 2013, six months earlier than the OFID
closing date of December 31, 2013. OFID requested if the Bank can continue to undertake the
supervision of works financed by OFID until December 31, 2013, which was not possible, because no
reimbursable mechanisms for project supervision were immediately available. In the short-term, in the
absence of such mechanisms, all efforts should be made to align the closing dates of co-financing parts
of a project.

79. Include all structures in the project/program. Wherever possible, and if cost permits, include all
structures in the project and program. Originally, structures had been excluded from the Project and
program, except, where absolutely necessary, as it was originally thought that resources would be
insufficient to include these. Initial experiences found this to be a mistake, and subsequently, they were
added to the database, and a reconstruction/rehabilitation program for all bridges and structures on the
core road network was prepared, including rehabilitation of two bridges and construction of one bridge
under the SLRP, to the great satisfaction of communities.

80. Include the EMP in the contract documentation. A number of the contractors had not worked
within an IFI funded project before and had no experience of implementing an EMP. The supervision
consultant, particularly where there were issues of site management, organization, and works quality,
also tended to adopt a laissez faire approach initially. The inclusion of the EMP in the contract
documentation helped to strengthened compliance.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     The ex-ante Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was performed at appraisal for the eleven road
sections improved under the Project covering about 109 km of regional and local roads. The ex-
ante evaluation was done using the Roads Economic Decision (RED) model, which is most
appropriate for the economic evaluation of unpaved roads with relatively low traffic volumes.
RED simulates life cycle conditions and costs and provides economic decision criteria for low
traffic road construction and maintenance activities. RED estimates the net discounted benefits
of each proposed intervention, in terms of the associated reduction in vehicle operating costs,
passenger travel time, and maintenance expenditures.
2.    The primary benefits of Project are the reduction in vehicle operating costs due to reduction
of road roughness and the reduction of passenger time costs due to the increase in travel speeds
brought about by the pavement reconstruction road works implemented with the Project. The ex-
post economic analysis was done for the same eleven road sections using also the RED model,
taking into account actual construction costs and annual traffic growth rates encountered during
the project period. The analysis is a conservative estimate of the project benefits as it did not
incorporate the additional long term benefits of more efficient management of road network,
which will result from the institutional development component.
3.     Secondary benefits, such as increase in economic development in the project area and
increase in land values, were not added to primary benefits in the ex-ante and ex-post evaluations
following cost benefit analysis good practice. The Project had positive indirect impacts on
human health and socio-economic environment through cleaning up of roadside drains; reduced
risk of soil pollution and erosion, and water pollution resulting from rehabilitation of drainage
system, reduced risk of landslides due to slope stabilization, better access to settlements, health
facilities and markets. The table below presents the eleven road sections for which the ex-ante
economic analysis was done at appraisal. The project roads were unpaved roads in poor to very
poor condition with an average width of 3.9 meters and an average traffic in 2008 of 207
vehicles per day.

4.    The ex-ante economic analysis was undertaken by comparing the net economic benefits
from the proposed improvements, the “project scenario”, against a “do minimum scenario”,
which is a continuation of the current maintenance and rehabilitation regime whereby some
routine maintenance is carried annually. The evaluation period was defined at 15 years, which is
best to account for the economic life of the improvement works. A discount rate of 12 percent
was assumed for the analysis. The road works comprised upgrading the roads to paved standard
with an average asphalt concrete surface thickness of 80mm and partial widening bringing the
average road width to 5.5 meters. At appraisal, the road improvement works costs were
estimated, which included the pavement works and off-carriageway works such as shoulders,
footpaths, safety devices, road markings, land acquisition, etc. A summary of the estimated road
works costs at appraisal is given on the following table including the corresponding ex-ante
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) computed for each road section. The overall ex-ante ERR of
the program was 16 percent with ERRs ranging from 12 to 28 percent for the project roads.

5.    The ex-post economic analysis was done considering actual upgrading costs, which are
comprised of the sum of the contract costs and variation orders. The table below shows the
contract costs and actual costs of each project road. On average, the contract costs are 13 percent
less than the estimated costs at appraisal and the actual cost are 16 percent higher than the
contract costs. The average actual upgrading cost is US$200 thousand per km. Most road works
were executed in around one year with the exception of the Kuben – Perroi i Kapsit road (two
years) and the Domaj – Ura e Lapave road (three years). Most road works were completed in
2009 and 2010.

6.     Traffic counts were done in 2008 and 2010 on each of the project roads. The table below
shows the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) in 2008 and 2010, the percent of trucks and
buses in 2010 and the annul traffic growth rate from 2008 to 2010. The average traffic of the
project roads increased from 207 vehicles per day in 2008 to 250 vehicles per day in 2010,
representing an average traffic growth rate of 9.8 percent per year. In comparison, the traffic
growth rate estimated at appraisal for the ex-ante economic analysis was 8 percent per year. The
project roads carry a high percentage of trucks and buses, representing on average 39 percent of
total traffic in 2010. The ex-ante economic evaluation adopted an 8 percent annual traffic growth
rate during the fifteen year evaluation period. The ex-post economic evaluation adopted the
actual observed annual growth rates from 2008 to 2012 for each road and after 2012 an 8 percent
annual traffic growth similar to ex-ante economic evaluation.

                                                       31
ranging from 5.8 to 51.4 percent for the project roads. The ex-post overall ERR is higher than the
ex-ante estimate (16.0 percent) due to the lower actual upgrading costs and higher annual traffic
growth rate found on average on the project roads.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The original Beneficiary Survey Results Report is available in project files. This Annex presents
a summary of main findings.

This survey evaluated the beneficiaries’ opinions concerning:

a)      Perceptions on immediate social outcome for the community:
        •      Improvement of access to schools, hospitals, regional administrative centers, etc;
        •      Reduction in travel time under the conditions of a normal traffic flow;
        •      Satisfaction rate of road users;
        •      Beneficiaries’ perception concerning access and improvement of public transport.

b)      Perceptions on the immediate economic outcome for the community:
        •      Improvement in the access to regional and local markets;
        •      Transportation Cost Reduction for travelers;
        •      Production and Selling Cost Reduction of agricultural and animal products;
        •      Increase in employment possibilities and access to job market;
        •      Changes concerning living cost of the community and its trend;
        •      Promotion of business at local level, establishment of new businesses;
        •      Transport cost reduction;
        •      Cost trends for vehicle servicing and maintenance.

c)      Evaluation on the project implementation including community opinion in relation to:
        •      Information tools and decision-making;
        •      Civil works quality and effectiveness of road reconstruction;
        •      Impact on environment during and after project implementation;
        •      Beneficiaries’ perception on the project sustainability, function and maintenance
               efficiency.

The main findings are as follows:

-    The investments carried out in the framework of the SLIP financed by the GoA, OFID and
     the World Bank, brought about radical changes in the perceptions of the inhabitants in
     relation to the quality of road. The beneficiaries assessed the quality of the road after
     rehabilitation as very good.
-    Frequency of road usage has increased. It was reported that before the roads were
     rehabilitated, 44.3 percent of respondents travelled on average once a month. After the
     project interventions, the amount of people who travel once a month dropped to 7.3 percent.
     This positive development was observed among other categories of road users as well.
-    An increase in the access to regional and local markets. Positive evaluations on this aspect
     were made by 98.7 percent of the interviewed beneficiaries. About 35 percent of the
     interviewees reported that the main reason to travel towards city is to sell farm crops.
-    A significant increase in improved access to healthcare services. This was reported by 98.7
     percent of the interviewed beneficiaries, who asserted that after road rehabilitation, they


                                               35
    have easier and faster access to qualified healthcare services, to regional hospitals, and
    specialized centers.
-   Increase in access to schools and other educational institutions. This is reported by 96.7
    percent of the interviewed beneficiaries.
-   Increased opportunities for local population in opening new businesses. About 77 percent of
    interviewees reported that the SLRP had a positive impact on opening new businesses.
-   Reduction of the average travel time after road rehabilitation by 60 percent compared to the
    period before the project interventions. The average time to traverse the road before the
    roads were improved was 60 minutes, compared to 23 minutes after the roads were
    improved.
-   The positive impact on the production cost reduction is reported by 81.9 percent of the
    beneficiaries. In addition to the reduction in production cost, the new road infrastructure has
    brought about a positive impact on the increase in selling farm crops in the areas where this
    Project was implemented.

-   The Project has had quite a positive impact on the inhabitants’ employment during project
    implementation period and has opened up new perspectives and increased employment
    opportunities by reducing distances to urban areas and job market. 87.6 percent of the
    interviewed beneficiaries reported that the Project contributed positively to increase
    opportunities of employment.

-   The increase in the provision of public transport and improvement of travel conditions are
    two other achievements of this project. 98 percent of the interviewees report that public
    transport is provided in their commune by marking an increase of 12 percent in comparison
    to two previous years.

-   The improved infrastructure has brought about a positive and very significant impact on the
    reduction of daily costs which have to be afforded by inhabitants. 82 percent of the
    interviewees report that the project has had a positive impact on reducing the living costs for
    beneficiary families and communities.

-   With the overall tendency of migrants returning to their places of origin to live and work, the
    survey noted that 81.7 of the interviewees believed that the start of civil works for the
    reconstruction of roads in the framework of this project brought about the construction of
    new houses in their village or community.

-   The survey noted that the SLRP had a positive impact on community participation in the
    social life and strengthening of relationships among people. A positive impact was reported
    by 71.5 percent of the community. 53 percent of the interviewees have responded that the
    main reason they travel to city is to visit family. Strengthening human relationships not only
    within community but also outside it is another achievement of this project.

Assessment of Project Development Objective, Project Components, and Governance Filter

The Improvement of Secondary and Local Roads” Project started in 2008 and was finalized in
June 2013. The Project was implemented over a five year period. During this period the Project
goals were largely met and even surpassed concerning the adherence to time schedules, the
number and length of financed roads and beneficiary communities.

The Improvement of Secondary and Local Roads Project was estimated to reach a financing cost
of 200-300 million USD. As of June 2013 the project has a total cost of 368 million USD and is
co-financed by the World Bank, Government of Albania and 11 other financial institutions.

Component 1: The Civil Works Associated with Improvement of Priority Sections of the
Secondary (Regional) Road Network

At the time of project preparation, eleven road schemes were identified for improvement, of
which three were categorized as Secondary or ‘Regional’ roads (refer to Table 3). All three
priority secondary road sections have now been completed and fully rehabilitated, as reported
below.
Korça Region: Lapidar (Kryqezim Pogorie) – Korite (Contract CWC/ICB/2008/WL–Rec 07).
The actual contract road length is recorded as 10.5 km. The Works Contract commenced on 14th
April 2009 and the improvement works were completed on 13th February 2010. Due to the
Works Contractor not completing the necessary defect repairs during the Defects Liability Period,
the Employer terminated the Works Contract on 3rd November 2010, with the approval of the
World Bank. The repair works were carried out within a new contract (Contract
CWC/S/2011/WL–Rec 07-2), procured by the “Shopping” procedure, and subsequently
completed in August 2011. The costs for the repair works were deducted from the Retention
Money to be returned to the original Contractor. Following satisfactory completion of the
Defects Liability Period for the repair works, the Project Manager issued the Defects Liability
Certificate at the end of August 2012 and the Works Contract was finished.
Tirana Region: Ura e Farkes – Qender Fshat (Contract CWC/ICB/2008/WL–Rec 10). The
actual contract road length is recorded as 6.6 km. The Works Contract commenced on 25th
November 2008 and the improvement works were completed on 30th November 2009. Following
satisfactory completion of the Defects Liability Period, the Project Manager issued the Defects
Liability Certificate at the end of July 2012 and the Works Contract was finished.
Vlore Region: Xarre (Cuke) – Fshati Pllake (Contract CWC/ICB/2008/WL–Rec 11). The
actual contract road length is recorded as 10.9 km. The Works Contract commenced on 15th
April 2009 and the improvement works were completed on 30th July 2010. Following
satisfactory completion of the Defects Liability Period, the Project Manager issued the Defects
Liability Certificate at the end of August 2012 and the Works Contract was finished.

Component 1 - Achievement of Outcome Objective

Taking into account the status of the original four Works Contracts, described above, then all the
roads are now improved with a total length of 28 km. This exceeds the total target of 24 km and
so it can be stated that Component 1 has successfully achieved the Outcome Objective. Also,
as identified above, three other works contracts have been added to the Project due to cost
savings made. Two additional works contracts were financed by World Bank and one financed
by OFID.

Component 2: The Civil Works Associated with Improvement of Priority Sections of the
Local (Commune) Road Network

As stated above, eleven road schemes were identified for improvement at the project preparation
stage. Of this total, eight road schemes were categorized as Local roads. All eleven priority local
road sections have now been completed and fully rehabilitated, as reported below.

necessary asphalt repair works etc. the Defects Liability Period was extended. Therefore the
Project Manager issued the Defects Liability Certificate on 15th August 2012 and the Works
Contract was finished.
The following additional Works Contracts have also been included in the Project.
Lezha Region: Dajç – Dragushe (Contract CWC/NCB/2012/WL–Rec 114). This was an
additional Works Contract that was introduced with the approval of the World Bank, in order to
use some of the cost savings made within the project. The actual contract road length is recorded
as 4.9 km. The Works Contract commenced on 7th May 2013 and was financed by IDA. The
improvement works were completed on 30th June 2013. The Works Contractor has provided a
bank guarantee to allow for the release of all the retention money and to cover the twelve months
Defects Liability Period.
Durres Region: Rruga Shetaj – Kisha e Skenderbeut: Asphalt Repair Works (Contract
CWC/NCB/2013/WL–Rec 139). This additional Works Contract was financed by IDA, in order
to use some of the cost savings made within the project. The actual contract road length repaired
is recorded as 4.5 km. The Works Contract was signed on 13th June 2013 and commenced
immediately. The asphalt repair works were completed on 30th June 2013. The Works Contractor
has provided a bank guarantee to allow for the release of all the retention money and to cover the
twelve months Defects Liability Period.

Component 2 - Achievement of Outcome Objective
Taking into account the status of the ten Works contracts, described above then all eight roads
are now improved with a total length of 90.9 km. This exceeds the target of 78 km and so it can
be stated that Component 2 has successfully achieved the Outcome Objective.
Also as identified above, three other works contract for the replacement of Velabisht Bridge, has
been added to the Project due to cost savings made. The additional works contract will be
financed by OFID.

Bridges

Tirana Region: Ura e Farkes – Qender Fshat, Reconstruction of Ura e Baldushkut at km
3+500 (Contract CWC/ICB/2008/WL–Rec 10-2). This was an additional Works Contract that
had to be introduced, with the approval of the World Bank, and is financed by OFID. The
existing Baldushk bridge at km 3+500 within the road section for the above-mentioned Works
Contract CWC/ICB/2008/WL–Rec 10 was showing evidence of collapsing. Since the initial
contract did not allow for repairs of the structure, the World Bank agreed to the replacement of
the bridge with a box culvert utilizing money saved from within the Bank/OFID-financed project.
The bridge replacement contract commenced on 22nd May 2012 and the works were completed


                                               40
on 26th November 2012. Therefore the twelve-month Defects Liability Period ends on 25th
November 2013.
Berat Region: Ura e Velabishtit, Replacement of the Ancient Velabisht Bridge (Contract
CWC/NCB/2013/WL–Rec 01-3). During the improvement of the local road ‘Ura e Gorices –
Fshat Mbreshtan’ in the Berat Region, an old road bridge was identified which is designated as a
Monument of Culture by the Albanian Institute of Monuments and Culture. In order to prevent
further deterioration of the historic Velabisht Bridge, the ADF determined that the bridge needed
to be closed to traffic and therefore a new replacement bridge should be constructed close by.
ADF prepared the necessary documentation to comply with the World Bank’s Social and
Environmental Safeguard policies to enable the land and properties, which occupy the route of
the road diversion and new bridge location, to be expropriated.
Following on from this, the additional Works Contract has been prepared and the bidding
process completed. The Works will be financed through OFID funding. The Contract for
construction of the replacement bridge has been awarded to “Salillari” sh.p.k. on 17th June 2013
after completion of the land and property expropriation procedures. Once the new bridge and
road diversion are completed, traffic will diverted onto the new alignment and the historic bridge
will be closed and a programme of restoration will be implemented.

Additional Works Contract - (Replacement and Restoration of Velabisht Bridge)

During the improvement of the local road ‘Ura e Gorices – Fshat Mbreshtan’ in the Berat Region,
an old road bridge was identified which is designated as a Monument of Culture by the Albanian
Institute of Monuments and Culture. In order to prevent further deterioration of the historic
Velabisht Bridge, the ADF determined that the bridge needed to be closed to traffic and therefore
a new replacement bridge should be constructed close by. ADF has prepared the necessary
documentation to comply with the World Bank’s Social and Environmental Safeguard policies to
enable the land and properties, which occupy the route of the road diversion and new bridge
location, to be expropriated.
Following on from this, the additional Works Contract has been prepared and the bidding
process completed. The Works will be financed through OFID funding. The Contract for
construction of the replacement bridge was delayed until the expropriation monies had been paid.
However the Contract was finally awarded to “Salillari” sh.p.k. on 17th June 2013. Once the new
bridge and road diversion are completed, traffic will diverted onto the new alignment and the
historic bridge will be closed and a programme of restoration will be implemented.


Component 3: Implementation and Institutional Support

This component financed the provision of technical support, goods, training, study tours,
conferences and the financing of Operational Costs to assist the ADF in the implementation of the
Project, specifically for the following:
   (i)   the selection and employment of consultants’ services to supervise the civil works and
         improve the design for the duration of the Project;




                                               41
   (ii) the selection and employment of a technical assistant with a strong background in highway
        engineering for the duration of the Project;
   (iii) training of the Project Implementing Entity staff responsible for Project implementation;
   (iv) the carrying out of a review of the functional classification for all levels of roads;
   (v) an inventory of the core secondary and local road network;
   (vi) the preparation of a strategy and action plan for the development of the secondary and
        local road network;
   (vii) capacity building in the communities to contract and undertake maintenance;
   (viii) the establishment of an Asset Management System for secondary (regional) and local
          roads; and
   (ix) the preparation of design and bidding documents for the first and second year of Project
        implementation.
The provision of technical support, purchase of goods (including vehicles, office equipment),
training and financing of Operational Costs is as follows:
The selection and employment of consultants’ services to supervise the civil works and improve
the design for the duration of the Project – A contract, for a period of 54 months, was signed with
Louis Berger on 12th November 2008, which initially was due to expire on 12th April 2013. The
Contract had four tranches: an initial tranche of 18 months; followed by two further tranches of 15
months; and then a final period of 6 months, for services that may occur during the defects liability
period.
However initially the World Bank Credit was due to close on 31st December 2012 and so the
Supervision Consultant’s contract was also required to be finished on the same date. Eventually the
Credit closing date was extended until 30th June 2013, which was fortunate because there was a
delay in procuring the follow-on Supervision Consultant. So the World Bank-funded supervision
contract was extended for two months until the end of February 2013 to allow for a one month
handing over period with the newly appointed supervision consultant. Therefore this part of
Component 3 was completed on 28th February 2013.
The selection and employment of a technical assistant with a strong background in highway
engineering for the duration of the Project – A contract for an input of 29 months was awarded to
an individual Consultant on 23rd March 2010. The Technical Assistant was based within the ADF
offices and provided technical, contractual and procurement assistance until 11th December 2012.
Therefore this part of Component 3 was completed on 11th December 2012.
Training of the Project Implementing Entity staff responsible for Project implementation – By
the end of the project, 78 Project Implementing Entity (ADF) staff have attended a total of
fifteen (15) training courses. A list of those courses is provided below. The total of ADF staff
attending training courses can be broken down to indicate which ADF Units have benefited from
the training programme. Therefore the following units/departments have been represented:
Procurement Unit (5 staff); Financial Unit (5 staff); Environmental Unit (3 staff); Monitoring
and Evaluation unit (2 staff); Regional Development 3 staff); and Department and Infrastructure
Department (25 engineering staff),
Training exercises which have been completed are as follows:

   •   Training for regional development.

The carrying out of a review of the functional classification for all levels of roads – In the
framework of the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), Roughton International (RI) prepared a study
on the functional reclassification. The criteria for the reclassification were discussed in several
meetings and were revised by RI based on the comments from ADF and the World Bank. As a final
product, ADF had the criteria for the functional reclassification based on the function of the roads
and the list of the entire rural road network with a proposed reclassification. The list was produced
as a desk study based on the detailed inventory for the 3,500 km and also based on the knowledge of
the rest of network from the consultant and ADF staff.
The proposed reclassification had three types of roads: R (Regional, the most important links
connecting Qark to Qark or Qark to district, connecting three communes or more important tourism
or business sites; these roads should be transferred to ARA for maintenance); L1 (Local 1, typically
the most important communal roads linking the centre of a commune to the national network, or a
group of villages; this type of road could be maintained by the commune, but if the road passes
through more than one commune, it needs to be discussed on a case by case basis); and L2 (Local 2,
other communal roads linking villages to the centre of a commune or villages to villages).
An inventory of the core secondary and local road network – An inventory for 3,500 km was
prepared in the framework of the PPF contract by RI. Out of 9,792 km, the total length of the rural
road network as per the inventory of the Qarks, 3,500 km were selected by the Qarks themselves as
the most important or core network of rural roads. A stylized inventory was prepared that includes
Road Inventory; Road Condition; Location Referencing; Traffic Video Data Collection and
Drainage Structures.
The preparation of a strategy and action plan for the development of the secondary and local
road network – As part of the PPF, a feasibility study was prepared on the core network of the roads.
For each of the road segments in the core network, based on the data gathered, the consultant made
a calculation of the EIRR as well as other social criteria such as poverty, distance and population.
Each road segment had a score as a result of the calculations made. Based on the scoring of the road
segments and a budget division per Qark based on some criteria, a five-year investment plan was


                                                 43
prepared. This plan served as a basis for submitting the investment lists to all the donors financing
the programme.
Capacity building in the communities to contract and undertake maintenance – RI, based on a
needs assessment on the local government units, prepared a schedule of training of trainers for ADF
staff regarding maintenance issues for local roads. This schedule of training contained modules on
technical knowledge on routine maintenance, budget preparation and preparation of tender
documents for issuing contracts for road maintenance. Based on this, and as part of a drive to
support the maintenance of regional and communal roads in Albania, in accordance with the Project
Agreement between ADF and IDA, the ADF has undertaken a nationwide training programme for
commune staff concerning road maintenance. The general objective of the training programme was
that upon completion of the training, staff at the commune would be able to effectively plan and
deliver road maintenance for their roads.
ADF organized the training as a dialogue with the attendants in order to give them the correct idea
and knowledge. Topics were demonstrated using pictures related to the problems such as drainage,
earthworks, shoulders, dust control, road signs and overgrown vegetation, that a road can have and
how to maintain it. ADF considers that the level of attention and interest during the training was
very high. ADF also delivered the following materials: a pocket book for Road Maintenance and a
promotion book for the Importance of Road Maintenance. These two books were considered as very
effective by the Participants.
Participation in the training programme has included 374 LGU or the total number of communes &
municipalities. The total number of persons trained is 750. Twelve Qarks have been represented in
the training programme. Annex 5.
The establishment of an Asset Management System for secondary (regional) and local roads –
Roughton International’s Maintenance Planning System (ROMAPS) has been selected as the
road management system application software. Functions include: collecting inventory,
condition and resource data, using customized look-up tables to estimate workloads, repair times
and maintenance costs, utilizing the repair estimates to prepare detailed budget estimates,
activities according to policy-generated priorities, calculating affordable task repair times based
on task repair allocations and resource costs.
The system being implemented at the ADF has been populated with data for approximately
4,120 km of regional and local roads selected for the study. Around eight ADF staff have been
trained on using ROMAPS and two people have benefited from in-depth training in order to
update the data and maintain the system. ADF is now working to extend the inventory to the
remainder of the secondary and local road networks, which is still important to the communities.
Part of the data will be transferred to the GRD/ARA (for regional roads) and the other part (for local
roads) will be kept in ADF. The data will provide an annual submission of information to the Local
Government Units, which is needed for assessing the maintenance budget requirements.
The preparation of design and bidding documents for the first and second year of Project
implementation – A Consultant was procured and a contract signed with Roughton International in
January 2008. The Consultant undertook the preparation of the designs and bidding documents for
the first and second year of the project and the contract was completed in October 2009. Therefore
this technical assistance has been fully completed.




                                                 44
Procurement of an additional technical assistance contract was required for a consultant to assist
ADF with preparation of a profound EIA for the new replacement Velabisht Bridge and road
diversion.
Procurement of all the required Goods, (including vehicles, computers, printers, scanners and
office furniture) was completed between September 2008 and June 2013. However the purchase
of a new generator was cancelled and this contract was replaced with procurement of spare parts
and repair costs for the existing generator. Details of the procured goods contracts can be located in
the final Procurement Plan provided in Annex 4.

Component 3 - Achievement of Outcome Objectives

Based on the above monitoring and reviews, the ADF considers that Component 3 of the Project
has achieved the final outcome objectives.

Implementation of the Governance Filter

As can be seen from the monitoring reviews in other sections of this report, the required
measures to be implemented under the project to reflect the four principles of the Governance
Filter have been substantially achieved.
In order to facilitate the first principle of seeking greater transparency in the use of public
resources, the project, during the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) undertaken by Roughton
International (RI), included a study updating the functional categorization, and a condition survey,
of 3,500 km of the rural road network. This was supplemented by the introduction of Roughton
International’s Maintenance Planning System (ROMAPS) which was selected as the road asset
management system for the rural road sector.
Additionally, in order to prepare for the introduction of private contracting for maintenance on
secondary and local roads and the ending of the use of ‘force account’, ADF has undertaken
extensive training of the local governmental units (Qarks, Municipalities and Communes) in
order to create capacity building in the communities to contract and undertake maintenance.
Initially, as a part of the PPF, Roughton International carried out a process of training the trainers
(ADF staff) including modules on technical knowledge on routine maintenance, budget preparation
and preparation of tender documents for issuing contracts for road maintenance. ADF has invited
374 municipalities and communes to participate in the training exercise. Out of those invited 374 of
them have attended. The total number of persons trained is 750.
In support of the second principle, which is to support increased autonomy and de-politicization of
key public sector counterpart organizations, the project has, as previously stated, established an
asset management system (ROMAPS), which will in future be used to assist with the formulating of
recurrent and capital expenditure investment decisions for the local road network. Additionally
during the PPF, RI prepared a multi-year investment plan.
The third principle of the Governance Filter is to support decentralization by strengthening the
capacity of the communes to procure and manage private contractors to maintain the local roads
under their responsibility, together with the introduction of multi-year maintenance contracts for
maintenance of local roads. To this end, the project has provided for training of 750 personnel from
the local governmental units. All of the communes and municipalities have participated in training


                                                 45
undertaken by ADF staff and the majority of the personnel attending the training courses have been
from the 309 communes, which have participated.
At the present time, the introduction of multi-year maintenance contracts, utilizing private
contractors, has not yet been necessary. The reason for this is that all eleven of the road contracts
which have been completed under the WB and OFID-financed programme have now been
classified as Secondary (Regional) roads. Therefore eleven of those roads have been included
amongst the twenty-seven (27) completed regional road schemes that have been transferred to ARA.
ARA already has considerable experience in contracting out maintenance to private contractors and
now has the responsibility for maintenance of the reconstructed roads. The two last road sections
Dajc – Dragushe and Shetaj - Kisha e Skenderbeut, are under guaranty period.

Sustainability

Sustainability of the project is likely. This is because of the GoA’s ongoing commitment to
improving and maintaining the Country’s rural road network. This is demonstrated by the
present co-financing of the Secondary and Local Roads Project. Also the fact that the World
Bank is now undertaking project preparation for a further Road Maintenance Project for
maintenance of the national and secondary road networks. This forthcoming project will provide
maintenance for the secondary roads which have been reconstructed within the World Bank
financed project. The works contracts will also provide business and employment opportunities
for Albanian construction companies. In summary, continued co-operation between the Bank,
other International Financing Institutions and development organisations, the Albanian
government and private sector organisations is necessary for continued sustainability.

Transition Arrangements to Regular Operation

It will take several more years yet before transition to regular operation and maintenance is
complete. In part this is because of the organisation’s lack of maintenance skills and experience
in a market economy, and also because Albania lacks a permanent civil service. The recent
transformation of the General Roads Directorate into the Albanian Roads Authority should begin
to have an effect on the periodic and routine maintenance of the national and secondary road
networks, through contracting-out to private contractors with longer-term maintenance contracts.
Such contracts will ensure greater accountability and responsibility by the contractors for
maintenance of their road sections.

Borrower and Bank Performance

The Borrower and the Beneficiaries have performed satisfactorily throughout the Project. The
Borrower has ensured that counterpart financing has been made available on time and that
payments to the Works Contractor’s has been made in a timely manner. The Beneficiaries of the
various components have cooperated fully during the implementation of the project. The
personnel from ADF have assisted the Works Contractors to ensure that contracts have been
successfully completed, whenever required to do so.
The Borrower considers that the Bank performed well throughout the period of the Project. The
MPWT, and ADF are very appreciative of the help, work and advice given to them by the



                                                46
Bank’s staff during the implementation of the Project. The contribution and work of the
previous Task Managers, Mr. Martin Humphreys and Mr. Baher El-Hifnawi and the current Task
Manager Mr. Artan Guxho, together with their supervision missions, have contributed greatly to
the final success and achievements of the Project.

Lessons Learned

The first and main lesson was learned early in the project. Due to the large number of works
contracts, because of additional co-financing and their spread throughout all the Regions of
Albania, meant that the initial supervision team lacked sufficient capacity to be able to supervise
the works contracts adequately. Accordingly an early addendum was prepared for the
Supervision Contract to increase the number of Site Supervision Engineers to ensure that the
works sites were visited at least twice per week.

Another lesson learned quite early in the project was that within the Contract requirements, the
Works Contractors were responsible for monitoring and policing their own quality of work. The
reason for this requirement was established during the project preparation. At that stage it was
realised that, in order to control the supervision costs, a limited supervision presence would have
to be established. This would mean that the site supervision engineers would visit each Works
contract regularly rather than having a full-time presence on each site. However this self-
monitoring was a new concept to the local contractors and they soon began to ignore the
requirement.
To counteract this, and in order to provide adequate quality control, a Quality Control Expert
(QCE) was introduced into the supervision team in early 2010. Furthermore, a second QCE was
added to the team as the number of Works contracts being supervised increased. The QCEs were
responsible for ensuring that the Works Contractors carried out the required testing and then
checked that the quality results conformed to the requirements of the Standard Specifications.

Annex 7. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

OFID (Co-Financier)

The OFID Loan (Ref. OFID No 1215P Secondary and Local Roads Project) was approved on
June 18, 2008 in the total amount of US$ 15.00 million in support of the first phase of the
Secondary and Local Roads rehabilitation program in Albania. Loan completion was planned
originally for December 31, 2012. The Government of Albania requested an extension of the
Loan Closing Date which was granted in January 2013, until December 31, 2013. A second Loan
of US$ 10.0 million (OFID Ref 1334P Secondary and Local Roads Project – Phase II/OFID )
was also approved in June 2010, in support of the National Strategy for Development and
Integration (NSDI 2007-2013) and the National Transport Sector Strategy.

On December 9, 2013, the Government requested a 2nd extension of closing date of Loan 1215P,
to complete activities related to retention money payments (approx. US$ 430,000.00), for 10
contracts which are still within the contractual Defect Notification Period (DNP). Additionally
the Government requested to use a Loan remaining balance (approximately US$ 280,000.00) for
financing the reconstruction of three (3) small bridges; two of them historical bridges (Velabishti
bridge and Gorica bridge) in the Berat Region and one bridge in very bad condition in Lezha city.

i) Restoration of the Velabishti Historic Bridge: The Bridge dates back to the middle of the 18th
century. It is located near Berati’s town and connects Velabisht, Sinje and Mbreshtan’s villages
with the town. It was built with lime stones, composed of three arches, two discharging
windows, with the central vault 11 m span. The bridge’s span is 41.5 long and 3.5 m wide.
Restoration includes works in the abutments damaged by the erosion, cleaning of remaining
concrete blocks, rehabilitation of decking, lightning, dusting of its facades with sand, etc. The
estimated cost for this contract is approximately US$ 52,000.00. The restoration period will be 2
months.

ii) Restoration of Gorica’s Historic Bridge: This Bridge connects two parts of Berat city, was
originally built from wood in 1780 and was rebuilt with stone in the 1920s. The seven-arch
bridge is 127 meters long and 5.3 meters wide and is built about 10 meters above the average
water level. Main works will include river’s bed excavation and transportation of earth, decking
reparation works with stones, shifting of existing water supply pipes and electricity line,
lightning, electronic automatic road barriers. The estimated cost for this contract is
approximately US$ 106,000.00. The restoration period will be 4 months.

iii) Reconstruction Skenderbeg Quarter Bridge, in Lezha Municipality. This bridge was firstly
built in 1925, connecting the Koder Marlekaj Quarter with the town center. The bridge links the
town with the highway Lezhe – Shkoder. The works on this bridge (68 m long and 5 m wide)
includes dismantling and removal of existing wooden and metallic bridge material and supply
and place of metallic construction for bridge elements. The estimated cost for this contract is
approximately US$ 80,000.00. The restoration period will be 2 months.

For all the above contracts, the Executing Agency (Albanian Development Fund, ADF) is
proposing to use the same local shopping procurement currently in use in line with OFID’s



                                               48
procurement guidelines. After the relevant tender processes, it is estimated that the contracts will
be signed within a month (February 2014). The implementation of works for all projects will be
6 to 8 months. Therefore, disbursements are anticipated to be completed by October 2014 with at
least two more months to cover the defect notification period, justifying the project’s extension
of Closing Date to December 31, 2014.

Loan 1334P (Phase II), is still on-going with total disbursements of US$ 6.7 million (to date,
December 2013) and Closing Date planned for June 2014.

IDB (Parallel Financier)

IDB’s main comment is on the Lessons Learnt (which is derived from our experience under
IDB's financed portion) of the program which could help the project further improve.

1) Under para 79, it was stated that all road structures (e.g. bridges) should be included in the
design- we found it to be true too. While the roads that were constructed under IDB's scope were
of good quality, we noticed that there were no road safety structures (e.g. mirrors, speed limit
reminders, humps, etc.). This is very important as most of the roads that were constructed under
IDB's scope are on mountainous areas.

2) The project underwent some delays due to changes in the scope. The number of km of roads
to be built was changed twice (under IDB financing) due to poor cost estimates. Changes in the
scope required approvals from Bank management and hence caused delays which could have
been avoided.

3) ARA's capacity and funding for road maintenance is still uncertain. While we note what was
written in para 43, we would suggest that this is followed up by the Appraisal Team of the
proposed RRMSP.
