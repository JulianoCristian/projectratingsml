The requested reallocation\n            is required to pay for an extension to the scope of the\n            contract for consultant supervision, in terms of the number\n            of road sections being reconstructed, within the program of\n            reconstruction of secondary and local roads. This has been\n            necessitated by the success of the project in leveraging in\n            finance from other donors, and the corresponding increase in\n            the number of construction contracts under implementation at\n            any one time. The funds are available for reallocation as\n            the work of the consultants procured with the project\n            preparation advance was delayed, with some of the work\n            taking place after effectiveness of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
