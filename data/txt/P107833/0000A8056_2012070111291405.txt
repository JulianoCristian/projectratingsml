                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Secondary and Local Roads Project is continuing to progress very well. The works are either complete, or substantially complete, on all eleven road
                         sections within the project. In addition, all year 5 project monitoring indicators, and the outstanding covenant on transferring the project roads to Albanian Road Authority,have been
                         met.
