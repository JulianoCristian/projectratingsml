                                        ANNEX 1:
                                     Proposed Changes:

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project’s development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

      There are no changes to the project’s development objectives, outcomes, design,
      and/or scope. The proposed change, requested by Albania in a letter signed by the
      Minister of Finance, dated May 5, 2010, is a reallocation of funds across the following
      categories in the disbursement table in the Financing Agreement (IDA 44590).

              i. Category of Refund of Project Preparation Advance (3) to be reduced by
                   SDR 519,344.44;
              ii. Category of Works (2) to be reduced by SDR 1,230,000.00; and
              iii. Category of Goods, Consultants’ Services, Training, Study Tours,
                   Conferences and Operational Costs (1) to be increased by SDR
                   1,749,344.44.

      The proposed reallocation of funds will result in the following allocation changes by
      Categories in the table in paragraph 2. of Section IV.A. of Schedule 2 to the Financing
      Agreement. The change will be effected by the Association’s outgoing notification
      letter to the Recipient:

Category                            Before reallocation SDR        After reallocation SDR
(1) Goods, Consultants’                  6,600,000                      8,349,344.44
Services, Training, Study
Tours, Conferences and
Operational Costs
(2) Works                                 5,000,000                     3,770,000.00

(3)      Refund of                          600,000                       80,655.56
         Project
         Preparation
         Advance
          Total                           12,200,000                   12,200,000.00


The requested reallocation is required to pay for an extension to the scope of the contract
for consultant supervision, in terms of the number of road sections being reconstructed,
within the program of reconstruction of secondary and local roads. This has been
necessitated by the success of the project in leveraging in finance from other donors, and
the corresponding increase in the number of construction contracts under implementation
at any one time.

The funds are available for reallocation as the work of the consultants procured with the
project preparation advance was delayed, with some of the work taking place after
                                               5
effectiveness of the project. The required payment for services from this contract was
then made from the first category, Goods, Services, Consultancy, Trainings, Study visits,
Conferences and Operational costs.
The amount in Category 2, the works contract is an unallocated residual which is not now
needed for civil works, reflecting the efficient progress in construction on all eleven
sections in the project. The works are either complete, or substantially complete, on ten
of the eleven road sections within the project. The remaining section is due to be
completed early in the 2011 construction season. In addition, all year 5 project
monitoring indicators have been met.
