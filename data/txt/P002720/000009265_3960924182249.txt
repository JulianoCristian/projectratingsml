SIXTH EDUCATION PROJECT (IDA CREDIT 861-TA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion report (PCR) for the Sixth Education
Project in Tanzania, financed by IDA Credit No. 861-TA. The SDR credit for
US$12 million equivalent was signed on January 22, 1979. The original closing
date for the credit was July 1, 1985. The Closing Date was extended three
times, to June 30, 1986, June 30, 1987, and finally to June 30, 1988. The last
disbursement was made on June 12, 1989.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division of the Southern Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts
I and III), and by the Borrower (Part II).
Parts I and III this PCR are based upon: the findings of an IDA
completion mission that visited Tanzania from September 7 to 19, 1989; visits
to the majority of institutions benefiting from the Credit; discussions held in
Tanzania with members of the Ministry of Education (MOE) involved in the
implementation of the Project; and a study of the relevant files at IDA in
Washington. Data for the preparation of the PCR were also obtained from IDA
archives, from the PPS in Tanzania, and from site inspections.

SIXTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 861-TA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The major objective of the project was to assist in the development of
critical middle level management and skills training for the modern sector. To
accomplish this, the oroject provided for the strengthening of vocational and
technical education, improved accountancy training, a program of management
training for education personnel, greater access of women to technical
education, improved monitoring and evaluation, and a study aimed at increasing
the effectiveness of the Institute of Education.
Implementation Experience
2.    The project was generally well managed. The technical staff of the
project unit was very dependent upon the support of the DANIDA specialists. The
procurement section was weak. Liaison was adequately maintained between the MOE
and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare regarding the implementation of
the vocational training program.
3.     Completion of physical facilities was significantly delayed by
prolonged shortages of material and financial resources, problems caused by
rapid inflation which made contractors unable or unwilling to fulfill
contractual obligations without substantial prices adjustments, poor
communications, and lack of fuel and transport services which resulted from
border conflicts with Uganda during that period.
Results
4.    Because of substantial delays caused by the war with Uganda and
deterioration of the Tanzanian economy the physical objectives were
significantly reduced. Within that reduced framework, the project achieved its
physical implementation objectives. Implementation of the vocational training
component has been successful in terms of the number of people trained. The
Instructor Training Center (ITC) has developed a vital role within the
vocational training system, meeting the demand for qualified staff for the
*        promotion and supervision of in-plant training. The accounting and management
training programs responded to the MOE's need for managerial improvement,
providing the additional training required to respond effectively to the rapid
expansion of the education system. To fully achieve these goals for education
management training in particular, it was necessary to shift the emphasis in
this component from civil works to additional staff development.



- iv -
5.. The Institute of Education study has influenced the shaping of the eighth
IDA assisted Education Project, which includes a component for strengthening
facilities, staff development, and additional resources for that Institute.
Sustainability
6.    The majority of staff at the School of Accountancy and many of the staff
at the Hanagement Training for Education Personnal (MWNTUP) trained by the
Project are still in place, suggesting a continued impact on the standards of
administrative personnel being trained. However, there are increasing concerns
about the ability of the institutions to maintain the facilities in the light
of financial constraints.
Findings and Lessori Learned
7.    The continuous program of IDA supervision in this project did much to
maintain the momentum of project implementation over an unusually long time
period of 10 years, despite the difficult circumstances brought about by
adverse macroeconomic conditions.
8.    Weaknesses, particularly in the areas of procurement, planning, and local
supervision of civil works and general maintenance have been identified, and
the need for modification of the underlying procedures noted for future
projects.

Sector Management
B.   Project Background
1.01.       Sector Development Objectives. In the Government's First Five Year
Development Plan (1964-69), the major portion of the education sector's
investment was directed at resolving the manpower shortage. It gave priority to
the goal of self-sufficiency in skilled manpower by 1980 by expanding education
at the secondary, higher, and adult education levels; it also resolved to
establish a comprehe:.ive education system for adults and children as soon as
financially possible.
1.02        Following the Arusha Declaration of 1967 the Government pursued a
socialist development strategy. Priorities were shifted in favor of basic
education for the entire population and the education curriculum was aimed at
greater relevancy to the rural environment. The Second Five Year Plan
(1969-74) established the goals of eliminating illiteracy by 1975, and
establishing Universal Primary Education (UPE) by 1989. The new Plan also
reiterated the goal set in 1967 of reaching self sufficiency in skilled
manpower by 1980. The Musoma Resolution of the Governing Party in 1974
accelerated the target of UPE to the end of 1977, while retaining an emphasis
in the curriculum on practical skills and self-reliance activities.
1.03        In the Third Five Year Plan (1976-80), the basic objectives
remained similar to those charted by the Education for Self-Reliance (Arusha)
declaration and the Musoma Resolution. with, however, slightly more emphasis
being placed on diversification into practical skills at secondary level, the
training of teachers, and the equality of opportunity for women in the system.
1.04        Policy Context.  At the time of this project's identification,
Tanzania was one of the twenty-five least developed countries in the world,
with a per capita income of US$200. The economy was heavily dependent on
agriculture with, at that time, 902 of the population engaged in agriculture



and approximately 402 of GDP and two-thirds of total exports derived from
agricultural proLiction.
1.05        The Government's socialist development strategy places strong
emphasis on rural development and social programs to benefit the poor. Since
1967, government has taken significant control of all economic activities, and
reserved some activities to the state cooperative sector.
1.06        Linkage Between ProJect, Sector and Macro Policy Objectives.  By
1978 some 902 of the total Standard I (Grade 1) population was enrolled in
primary schools, and the rate of effective literacy almost doubled in the
period 1967-75. However, the rapid expansion of the system resulted in the
emergence of several serious problem areas. Amongst these were: poor quality
and efficiency of the education system due to weak management; significant
deficits in critical technical skills areas; and low participation of women in
secondary and higher education. A number of the project components were
specifically designed to address these areas.
C. Project Obiectives and Description
1.07        Project Objectives. The major objective of the project was to
assist in the development of critical middle .anagement and skill training for
the modern sector. To accomplish this, the project provided for:
(a)   strengthening of vocational and technical education;
(b)   improved accountancy training;
(c)   a program of management training for educational personnel;
(d)   greater access of women to technical education;
(e)   a study aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the Institute
of Education; and
(f)   an improved monitoring and evaluation system.
1.08         Proiect Components.  Three general areas were supported:
(a)   Vocational and Technical Education: additional equipment, boarding
facilities and staff housing for two of the existing Vocational
Training Centers at Hwanza and Tanga; equipment, vehicles, boarding
facilities, and staff houses for a new Instructor Training Center at
Morogoro; 640 additional boarding places for female students at four
technical secondary schools.
(b)   Accountancy Training and Management: expansion of the Dar es Salaam
School of Accountancy by the provision of additional teaching,
boarding and administrative facilities, staff housing and equipment;
the development of a Management Training for Education Personnel
(MANTEP) facility at the College of National Education, Bagamoyo, by
the provision of finance for the renovation of buildings, equipment



and teaching materials, vehicles, training for ten permanent staff
members, and technical assistance.
(c)   Project related study: in addition to the above main areas, the
project financed a study of the role, staffing needs and physical
requirements of the Institute of Education.
D.   Proiect Desian and Organization
1.09       Proiect Design.  Preliminary discussions on possible IDA assistance
to the Third Five-Year Plan educatioi investment program were held in February
1977. This was followed by a IDA/Unesco project identification mission in July
1977. Further discussions were held with various government agencies in
November of the same year resulting in a set of suggested project components
vhich were presented to IDA in February 1978.
1.10       Project Organization. The MOE Project Planning Section (PPS), carried
out the administrative and professional services for the Project, as it had done
successfully for the Education III, IV and V Projects assisted by IDA.
1.11       To ensure adequate liaison between the Ministry of Education (MOE)
and the then Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) with respect to the
implementation of components (para 1.08) falling within MLSW's purview, the
Government undertook to establish appropriate mechanisms for task definition,
lines of reporting and responsibility, and procurement procedures. The close
coordination did not effectively materialize because of weak implementation
capacity in MLSW.
1.12       Appropriateness of Timing. The accelerated thrust towards Universal
Primary Education (UPE), taken with the increasing diversification of the
secondary schools, created a critical need for effective administrators in the
system and a source of skilled practical instructors and trainers. Accordingly,
this project, addressing these specific areas, was appropriately timed.
E.    Project Implementation
1.13       Critical variations in Proiect Implementat. n: Implementation of the
construction program was much slower than had been planaeJ, due essentially to
the following unforeseen factors:
(a) The Tanzanian economy was under severe stress during the period. Ln
attempting to ameliorate this stress, the government introduced
salary cuts of 1OZ for civil servants, and a withdrawal of leave
privileges, bringing about a deterioration in morale and
productivity.
(b)  A second unforeseen factor significantly affects. & the progress of
the project arose out of the war with Uganda during the early 80s.
This situation seriously affected implementation of the
infrastructure program. The Ministry of Defence commandeered much of
the available transport for military purposes, making the delivery
of building materials to the various sites extremely difficult and
uncertain. Security difficulties also precluded effective



supervision by the Project Implementation Section in a number of
districts.
(c)  By 1982 the rapid inflation rate had forced a scaling down of
construction targets, further exacerbated by shortages in the supply
of building materials. (Direct purchase procedures were recommended
as a result of the supervision visit in April, 1983.) As a result
of these factors, the project overran by 3 years.
1.14       Partly as a consequence of these factors, and partly because of a
shift i& the perceived priorities, the construction targets of the project were
not met in their entirety. In particular the projected renovations at MANTEP
were not undertaken since the funds targeted were deemed to be inadequate for
this purpose and were redirected to additional staff development training. The
funds released by these changes were utilised in the purchase of additional
books and science equipment for secondary schools.
1.15       The conclusions of an international review panel on reasons for high
failure rates in the School of Accountancy. which were presented to goverment
after Credit Effectiveness, resulted in a significant enhancement of the
priority for this component of the project and amendment of the Credit
Agreement.
1.16       Project Risks.  The major risks projected in the SAR were envisaged
as teing associated vith the project implementation processes (possibly because
of difficulties in the PPS) or with coordination between the three Ministries
involved.
1.17       The risk areas identified in the SAR proved to be correct, but
became critically important because of war and economic deterioration, i.e.
factors unconnected with the design of the project ox the particular
competencies of the PPS.
F. Maior Results of the Project
1.18       Within the extended time frame, the project'did eventually achieve
its major physical implementation objectives. The boarding facilities and
staff houses at the Vocational and Technical institutes were completed, but
those planned for the School of Accountancy were scaled down because of a late
start caused by problems with the contractor (see section K), and the
dramatically reduced purchasing power of the Tanzanian shilling. As already
stated (para 1.14), the renovations planned for HANTEP were not carried out at
all. By October 1985, the revised Project cost had risen to TShs 229.5 million
(SOX above appraisal). These upwardly spiralling local costs caused serious
delay because of the consultation procedures required to bring about shifts in
the disbursement patterns.
1.19       Manpower Training.  This objective was b hieved for the School of
Accountancy. Twenty six of the staff successfully completed one year courses
in accountancy and .teaching methodology, at various institutions in the U.K.,
while a further ten completed three month courses in training of trainers and
training management. Additionally, one member of staff received a Diploma on
Accountancy, and another a masters degree in Business Administration.   This



- 5 -
training programie reached approximately 80? of the staff in the School during
the period 1984/85, the majority of whom returned to their posts in the School
after completion.
1.20       In MANTEP the fetus of training was changed from a broad range of
experiences in several countries having institutions with goals similar to
those envisaged for MANTEP, as a basis for its shaping its courses and
development, to one in which the members of staff selected attended specific
overseas institutions mostly in U.K. for courses leading to higher degrees. In
this revised programs, 4 members of staff obtained masters degrees, one a
Ph.D, and 8 obtained diplomas in aspects of education management and training.
Only 6 members of staff undertook study tours, and these were confined to Kenya
and the U.K. Five of the staff who successfully completed higher degrees moved
on to other employment and were lost to the College. In terms of retaining
trained manpower for MANTEP therefore, the Project was less successful than it
was for the DSA.
1.21       Proiect Impact.  The Project initially improved the availability of
student boarding places at both vocational training centers (VTC), although the
facilities provided at the Tanga VTC under the project are already in a severe
state of degradation, so as to render them virtually unusable.  This appears to
have been due to very poor security and inadequate supervision by the staff of
the Center. By contrast, the facilities provided to the Technical High School
in Tanga are in an excellent state of repair and are obviously well maintained.
Improved boarding facilities at Tanga and other Technical Schools was planned
in particular to improve access to technical education for girls. It was
expected that the provision of some 640 boarding places for girls would expand
their enrAlment in vocational education to some 25Z of the total. In fact,
because of increased costs and some design changes in the plans, 504 places
were provided. This should have produced a significant impact on numbers of
girls, but the actual increase in numbers over the five years 1984 - 1989 was
only 90 girls, a percentage increase from 12.1Z to 14.6? of total, about half
the target prediction contained in the SAR. This disappointing impact suggests
that the real reasons for the non-participation of girls in tecnnical education
are not confined to those of accommodation. It further suggests that the
appraisal for this component of the Project was less than adequate.
1.22       Modifications to existing facilities at the School of Accountancy
have greatly improved the administrative facilities, but the staff housing
program, renovation of kitchen facilities and improvements to the School water
supply were not completed. The non-completion of an improved water supply is
particularly deleterious to the functioning of the School and significantly
reduces the impact of other items supplied to the School by the project.
1.23       Human resource development has been significant in terms of the
number of individuals who received further training.
G.   Project Sustainability
1.24       Construction Works.  In discussions with the Tanzanian
administrators at the various project sites visited, maintenance of the "new"
facilities emerged as a key concern. Provided this coincern can generate



adequate maintenance resources, these project components should have a
sustained impact over several decades.
1.25       However, in some cases, as has already been noted, a rapid
deterioration in buildings and equipment was observed, suggesting that
increased regular inspection by the MOE may be required if these benefits are
not to be lost.
1.26       Manpower Training.  The majority of staff trained for the School of
Accountancy are still in place (1989), suggesting that they should be having a
sustained impact on the standard of accountancy personnel being produced. As
already noted in para 1.20, there has ben some attrition of the staff trained
for MANTEP. However those still with MANTEP are bringing the benefits of that
training to their teaching.
H.   IDA Performance
1.27       Strengths and weaknesses.  The continuous program of IDA supervisory
visits did much to maintain the momentum of the Project under very difficult
circumstances, providing valuable assistance in making mid-course corrections
to the project as dictated by the changing economic circumstances. However,
the several changes in IDA supervisory staff presented some problems in
continuity. (The records indicate that 15 officers were involved in the
supervision of this project, with only two officers showing involvement over a
continuous period of two years or more.)
1.28       The slowness of comuunication and decision sharing between the MOE
and IDA contributed significantly to delays of certain aspects of the Project,
particularly where a change of direction was contemplated by government (e.g.,
changes in the manpower training program).
1.29       A total of 20 IDA supervision visits were made between the date of
Effectiveness and the Closing Date. These missions tended to focus on civil
works implementation and procurement issues, and it appears that insufficient
attention was given to assessing the achievement of educational targets and
institutional development objectives.
1.30       Lessons Learned.  The main difficulties encountered in this Project
were due to factors (rapid inflation and the war with Uganda) outside the
control of the project planners or implementors, and therefore major lessons of
general applicability are not easy to identify.
1.31       Several points have been noted:
(a) The failure to significantly improve the participation of girls in
technical education indicates that appraisal missions should be
cautious in accepting the obvious as the most important factor in a
given problem. In this instance more careful appraisal might have
uncovered the real reasons (perhaps traditional role perceptions),
and been able to incorporate a strategy to meet them.
(b) Where it can be anticipated that supervision visits will be
undertaken by different members of staff, the guidelines regarding



flagging of anticipated critical areas for close supervision are
particularly important and should be followed.
(c) The purchase of inappropriate or inferior plant such as the cooking
equipment purchased for the VTC in Tanga, and the design faults in
some aspects of the civil works such as the problem in the water
supply reaching the School of Accountancy, suggest that there was
poor assessment of local technical expertese or the technical
assistance provided under the Project was too little and not
directed to areas of need.
(d)  There was gross and rapid deterioration of some facilities provided
under this project. (e.g. boys hostel for the VTC Tanga). In the
planning and design of subsequent projects, attempts should be made
to build in provision for the maintenance and security of the
facilities constructed under the project.
I.    Borrower Performance
1.32       Bearing in mind the transport and security difficulties extant
during implementation of the Project, the Project Planning Section (PPS)
carried out its administrative and professional activities expeditiously.
1.33       As indicated in para 1.31(d), greater attention to specifying the
exact type and description of equipment required, particularly for the catering
facilities in the VTCs, would have avoided the purchase of inappropriate items
(e.g., gas instead of electrical cookers).
1.34       Consultation with local or foreign experts to assess the quality of
imported machinery for the vocational and technical education programmes when
compared with the specifications on which the contracts were agreed, could have
avoided the acceptance of below standard items whose working life was very
short.
1.35       The decision to allow direct import of building supplies, i.e. not
through a local supplier, first recommended by IDA in April 1983, was not
agreed by MOE until May 1984.
1.36       Indecision over the site for MANTEP delayed implementation of the
civil works for this component, until they were deleted in the reduction in
project scope caused by inflation and changing priorities.
1.37       It would appear that implementation planning for the MANTEP
component of the project was less than adequate in that no budgetary provision
was made in 1980/81, and the MOE was uncertain on how to incorporate MANTEP
within the overall Ministry structure. MANTEP development was further delayed
by the MOE's intention to change its location from Bagamoyo to some more
centrally located site. A decision to this effect was made and then reversed by
government.



J.     Project Relationships
1.38       IDA and the Government of Tanzania maintained a positive working
relationship throughout the project. However, greater continuity in IDA staff
would have further strengthened this relationship. As already noted in para
1.11, the planned close cooperation between the HOE and the MLSW was rendered
ineffective by weak implementation capacity in the MLSW. Future Projects
should incorporate explicit coordination arrangements to address this vital
issue.
K.    Contractor Services
1.39       Pior contractor performance in several aspects of the civil works
components suggests that closer and more frequent supervision by appropriately
qualified members of the Ministry's PIS would have improved quality of the work
done and assisted in maintaining a reasonable time scale. Again the project
design could and should incorporate such requirements.
1.40       Contractors should, as a prequalification for tender, be required to
provide proof of adequate financial resources to guarantee continuation of the
contractor work while waiting for periodic payments.
1.41       Thorough technical study of local conditions relevant to planned
civil works would avoid later problems and expensive modifications to design.
Cases in point are the water supply to the School of Accountancy (local mains
pressure inadequate) and the use of wood in the only external stairs to the
second story of the boarding facilities at the VTCs (poor durability in
tropical climate, and a fire hazard). This point further emphasises the MOE's
reduced capacity for technical design and management during the period of the
Project.
L.    Project Documentation and Data
1.42       The SAR and legal documents provided an adequate framework for IDA
and Borrower during implementation.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Project Objectives.
2.01        The Sixth IDA supported Education Project had the major
objective of assisting in the development of critical middle level
management and skill training for the modern sector. In order to
accomplish this objective, the following components were financed
through the credit:
(a)   Provision of student and staff accommodation at the Tanga
and Mwanza Vocational Training Centers;
(b)   Construction of a new Instructor Training Center at
Morogoro;
(C)   Construction of girls dormitories at four technical schools
(Tanga, Moshi, Ifunda, and Mtwara);
(d)   Improvement of facilities and expansion of the facilities at
the Dar es Salaam School of Accountancy;
(e)   Kanagement training for Educational personnel (MANTEP),
Bagamoyo.
B.    Froject Implementation
2.02        Vocational Training Centers at Tanga and Mwanza:
(a)   Specific objectives of this component were the quality
improvement of the Centers by provision of student and staff
accommodation. The emphasis was on the enhancement of
equity through the provision of accommodation for rural
students, enabling them to pursue technical education; and
increasing the retention of staff by providing suitable
accommocation.
(b)   civil works carried out at each center were: dining hall and
kitchen; 2 girls dormitory blocks; 3 boys dormitory blocks;
9 three bedroom houses; 7 two bedroom houses; 1 Principal's
house. Construction work has been completed, and the
facilities are in use. Construction was delayed due to
shortages of building materials during the Project life.
Direct importation required approval by Treasury, IDA, and
Flimu Tender Board - a protracted process, subscribing to
further delays. Delivery of materials also took a long
time.
(c)   Furniture.  All furniture has been delivered and installed.



- 10
(d)   Nquipyent.  Kitchen euipment and vehicles were delivered.
However, the kitchen equipment delivered was found to be
inadequate because of incorrect upecifications.
2.03        Ov-rall Assessment.  Despite the delay in construction work,
and the short-comings of the kitchen equipmnt, the project objective
has been achieved. Rural students are being accommeodated at the
colleges, and are pursuing vocational studies. Teachers are assured of
suitable accommodation, and the retention of staff has improved. It is
hoped that the quality of vocational training will be improved at the
centers.
2.04        Instructional Training Center, Noroooro.
(a)   Specific objectives of this component were manpower
devolopment and quality improvement in the training of
instructors (teachers) for the existing VTCs and for the new
Centers envisaged for the expansion throughout the country.
The component included the construction of facilities,
furniture, and equipment, and the provision of quality
improvement courses for teaching staff in the methodology of
teaching vocational and technical education.
(b)   Civil Works:  1 administration block; 2 student hostel
blocks; 5 staff houses; 1 Dining hall/kitchen; 1 library;
workshops for automobile, electrical and civil engineering
science laboratories.
Notes on the civil works
(i)   Construction was started later than scheduled because
of delays in the completion of designs and tender
documentation;
(ii)  The lowest tender received was for TShs 23.9 million,
while the budgeted amount was only TSh 16.9 million.
(iii) As a result of this shortfall in funds, the civil
works were reduced by omitting the following
facilities: general storage building; girls'
dormitory; matron's house; dispensary;
masonry/carpentry workshop reduced in size by three
bays.
(iv)  Negotiations with the contractor to accept the reduced
size of the contract and protracted correspondence
with IDA to get the necessary approval, further
contributed to delays in starting construction;
(v)   During construction, considerable delays were
experienced due to shortage of building materials,
petrol and allied products, and transportation
availability to the contractor.



- 11 -
(vi) Direct importation of building materials, plant and
vohicles was again a lengthy process necessitating
gaining approval from Treasury, IDA, and the Elimu
Tender Board.
(vii) The civil works have been completed, but short-comings
have been noted in the quality of work, unfinished
work such as pavements and street lighting, and
drainage problems in the toilet system.
(c)   Furniture order is complete, all furniture has been
delivered, installed and is being used.
(d)   Equipment.  Most of the instruction euipment has been
delivered. However, some of the equipment from the supplier
in India was found to be defective - either damaged in
transit or at the Port. The Centre also complained that
this euipment was sub-standard. Kitchen equipment was
again found to be inadequate due to incorrect
specifications.
(e)   Staff development.  The project funded 21 scholarships to
teachers at the College. Courses included training in
management; training of trainers; and a study tour.
2.05        Overall Assessment.  Despite the serious delays in
construction, changes of project requirements and costing, shortcomings
in the quality work, and outstanding items, the project objectives have
been achieved. The College is in operation and has since benefited from
additional support from SIDA.
6.          Provision of Girls, dormitories at four Technical Schools:
(Tanga, Moshi, Ifunda, and Mtwara)
(a)   Specific objective of this component was to improve access
of women to technical education by providing hostel
accommodation. The project aimed at the provision of 160
hostel places for women to each of the existing four
technical schools, resulting in an increased participation
by women in technical education of 3% by 1983.
(b)   Civil works.  At each school the following facilities have
been introduced: double story blocks of dormitories;
matron's house; and a sickbay.
Notes on civil works:
(i) The design for the Ifunda dormitories was changed to
four single storey units instead of two double story
blocks. This was done as a result of the difficulties
experienced at other institutions in supplying water
to the second storey.



- 12 -
(ii)  Construction work at all sites was delayed due to the
shortage of building materials and fuel for transport
experienced during project implementation. Direct
importation delays were again encountered in this
component.
2.06        Overall Assessment. Despite the delays in completion of
construction and the delivery of furniture and equipment, the project
objective has been achieved. The overall enrollment of girls in
technical education at the four technical schools has increased from
12.0% in 1984 to 14.6% in 1989. Overall participation of girls in
technical education at secondary school level is 12.2%. (1984 figures:
2220 boys, 306 girls; 1989 figures: 2313 boys, 396 girls).
2.07        Management Training for Education Personnel (MANTEP,
Bagamoyo).
(a)   Main objective was institution building, by improving the
competency of staff at the college through training and the
provision of teaching materials and equipment. This
increasing effectiveness would lead to improvements in the
training process for educational administrators and managers
at different levels in order to increase efficiency and
hence improve the quality of the education system in the
country. In order to maximize the improvements in training
processes, some renovation of facilities and the provision
of furniture were also included.
(b)   Allocation of Funds: (in Tz. shillings)

* No separate figure stated in Project costs table.
(c)    Civil works. Renovation and alteration of the old Fathers,
building into offices and seminar rooms.
Note on civil works. No civil works were undertaken, as the
funds allocated were deemed inadequate and re-allocated to staff
development.



- 13 -
(d)    Furniture.  Furniture was not purchased because the renovations
were not made.
(e)    Equipment.  Teaching equipment, books, and vehicles were
procured and delivered.
(f)    Technical assistance was not recruited.  It was felt that there
was a more pressing need to develop MANTEP staff, who would then
be able to identify the training needs.
(g)    Staff development:  10 members of staff attended a one month
specially tailored course in educational management at the East
and Southern African Management Institute (ESAMI) Arusha.
Longer overseas courses ranging from one to throe years were
made avdilable to staff leading to enhancement of their skills
in Education Management and Administration. All the staff have
resumed duties at the College with the exception of two who have
been transferred.
2.08      Overall Assessment. While the staff development objective has
been achieved, there has been no improvement in the facilities.  The
college still has problems of limited office and teaching accommodation.
Renovation of the existing facilities is now being undertaken through local
funding with technical assistance from Unesco and the Director of
Antiquities.
2.9       School of Accountancy DSM
(a)    Main objectives of the component were manpower development and
quality improvement in training of accountants, bookkeepers and
material management. The emphasis was on the quality
improvement of the training for both pre-service and in-service
students, and thus to improve the calibre of trained personnel
in parastatals and government lepartments. The project aimed at
increasing enrollment from 455 to 1015.
(b)    Civil works:  After careful assessment of the training needs
against the available funds, some aspects of the civil works
planned for this component of the project had to be scaled down,
and others added. The facilities omitted were: dispensary/
sickbay; new administration block; 1 new hostel block for girls;
24 staff houses; 2 model offices; renovation of hostels. The
facilities constructed were: 22 staff houses; 2 classroom
blocks; a water t6wer; dining hall and kitchen. Facilities
renovated or modified were: an administration block converted
into a printing unit; one classroom block into teaching staff
offices; and an existing kitchen and dining room renovated
(c)    Furniture, equipment and vehicles were procured and delivered.
(d)    Implementation of this component was considerably delayed and
not completed by the credit closure date. Construction work is
still in progress now (September 1989). An International



- 14 -
Accountancy review panel was formed early on in th- project to
roview the problems of high failure rates in Tanzanian
Accountancy *xaminations; th- review report was submitted by
July 1, 1979 for comment by IDA. An action plan to ensure
effective training of accountants in Tanzania was presented by
government to IDA on 28 November, 1980. The consequent changes
in priorities for this aspect of tho project necessitated
several revisions in design to include a training component and
recruitment of consultants; requiring the credit agreement to
be amended. This was done on March 9, 1982.
There were throe changes of architects dealing with the project
and design had to be restarted. The above factors contributed
to the delay in starting up this project component.
Construction work began in February, 1984, but could not proceed
smoothly due tot land dispute with neighbors; shortages of
building materials; contractor's lack of financial resources;
weaknesses in contractor's management.   The first contractor
was rejected by government, but insisted upon by IDA. The
contractor failed to begin construction and had to have his
contract terminated   A new contractor was recommended for
appointment by the Elimu Tender Board but rejected by IDA. This
contractor was eventually awarded the contract after protracted
negotiations and approval of the Accountant General, IDA, and
Elimu Tender Board. This contractor started construction on
January 1, 1985, and was scheduled to complete the civil works
by May, 1987. However, construction work was again delayed by
shortages of building materials in the country, necessitating
direct importation approval and inadequate budgetary allocation,
affecting the cash flow to the contractor. By the closing,
about 70% of the civil works had been completed. Outstanding
works are expected to be finalized by December, 1989.
(e)    Furniture.  All items of furniture have been delivered on site.
Placement in staff houses awaits completion of civil works on
houses.
(f)    Equipment, teaching materials, and books. All teaching
equipment, instructional materials and consumable have been
delivered. Vehicles have been purchased and are in use, or have
mechanical problems.
(g)    Kitchen equipment has been delivered.  However, the type of
equipment purchased was of the wrong specifications. Kitchen
equipment includes: electric boilers, 5 deep freezers, 10 water
fountains.
(h)    Staff development.  A total of 38 tutors received scholarships
for short (3 months), and long (one year) courses in the field
of accountancy training and associated cou:ses for an overall
total of 325 staff months.



- 1S -
(i)    Technical assistance.  A short term consultart was recruited to
assess the needs and prepare a plan of operation. A second
consultant, was appointed for one year to study the faculty
development needs for DSA. Five oxpatriate tutors were hired
from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for two year contracts.
2.10      Overall Assessment.  Conotruction work has been behind schedule
and the finalization of civil works very much delayed. The renovation and
construction work completed to date, is of good quality and groatly
appreciated by the staff. The provision of good standard equipment and
books and other materials has greatly improved the teaching. The training
of seven tutors has been very successful. Teachers are more competent and
dedicated to their work. The provision of staff houses at the Institute is
very much appreciated and will go a long way towards attracting and
retaining present staff. The problem with regard to the kitchen equipment
lies in incorrect specifications. The equipment purchased is for use in
the home and was not designed for large scale catering. Water supply
appears not to have been considered at appraisal, and continues to be a
major problem. The changes in the project design and the omission of
certain facilities may indicated inadequate appraisal. The project has
been implemented in patches. The dormitories which are in a very poor
state, require urgent renovation for the overall benefit of the project.
2.11      Project related studies.  Pre-investment study of the Institute
of Education ($75,000).
(a)    Objective of the study was to carry out a feasibility study of
the Institute with a view to defining its future role, assessing
its staffing needs, and planning for its physical expansion.
(b)    Implementation. The study was carried out and a report submitted
to IDA. The Institute has been established as a separate entity
in temporary (prefab) offices provided by the MOE. The
Institute faces continuing problems of accommodation, equipment
and other support. There has been little follow-up to the
recommendations contained in the report. However, under the
Eighth IDA financed Education Planning and Rehabilitation
Project, some support for the Institute is planned.
2.12      General Assessment.  Despite the delay in construction caused by
adverse economic conditions leading to shortages of essential building
materials, the Sixth IDA Education Project Credit 861-TA has been very
successful. The cooperation between IDA and the MOE has been very useful
in the project implementation.
2.13      During the implementation, the close supervision and easy
communication with the main office was very useful. IDA showed
understanding of the prevailing conditions and hence readily approved
direct importation of essential building materials. Towards the Closing
date of the credit, it was realized that some savings would be made on the
project. IDA understood the shortage of books and science equipment in our
secondary schools and readily agreed to the government request to produce



- 16 -
additional equipment and textbooks for the project schools as well as other
government schools in the country.
2.14      The Government of Tanzania is very approciative of the
cooperation and we look forward to sustaining this cooperation in future.

3.01    Comments on Project Timetables.  The adverse economic and social
conditions which existed in Tanzania during the period of the credit and a
reappraisal of the MANTEP and School of Accountancy components of the project
necessitated major changes in the implementation schedule (Part I, paras. 1.14,
1.15, and 1.16).

3.02    Comments on Project Financing.  The IDA Credit of US$12.0 million
equivalent represented 75? of the total project cost of US$16.0 million
including duties and taxes, or 83Z of the project cost net of taxes. The
IDA Credit financed the foreign exchange and 482 of the local currency
component.

3.03     Comments on Allocation of Credit.  Planned allocations for civil
works in the School of Accountancy were reduced by agreement in December
1982. Allocation was increased for vehicles and equipment. Due to lack of
budgetary commitment and inadequate planning, the civil works envisaged for
MANTEP were not implemented (para 15). During the course of the project
implementation, significant allocations were directed to training, both
overseas and local for the School of Accountancy and MANTEP (Table 8).

3.04                Comments on Direct Benefits of Proiect.  The total number of new
student places planned for in the SiR was 720 (SAR para 4.02). The goal of improving
access of women to technical education was approximately 80Z successful in terms of the
number of bording places created. However, the anticipated increase in participation was
not achieved - possible due to lack of interest of girls in technical careers.

the 8th Project includes a component to begin the construction of permanent
facilities for the Institute, to improve its resources, and offer
additional staff training.
