INTERU4ATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMEMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
US$ 6.1 million to the Republic of Kenya.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Development Credit No. 93 KE of August 19, 1966 provided $7.0
million for the expansion of primary teacher training and secondary technical
education in Kenya. The project, which is expected to be completed by the
end of 1970, introduced practical courses into what had been entirely
academic secondary school curricula. The project now proposed for financing
would not only put further emphasis on practical studies but would enable
Kenya to plan the future development of its education system in accordance
with economic needs.
3.        The present project has grown out of a continuing dialogue
between the Government and the Association since the first credit was
signed. The project was prepared with the help of Bank staff and an
agriculture education specialist from FAO who visited Kenya in September
and October 1968, and was appraised in the field in January and February
1969. Negotiations were held in Washington in February 1970. Kenya was
represented by P. J. Gachathi, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education;
Y. Komora, Deputy Chief Education Officer (Development), Ministry of
Education; R. D. W. Betts, Head of Training Division, Ministry of Agriculture;
A. Porter, Principal, University College, Nairobi; A. H. Bunting and
J. A. Fewster, Development Coordinator and Resident Coordinator, respec-
tively, for the Faculty of Agriculture, University College, Nairobi;
D. M. Mutiso, Chief Architect, Ministry of Works; and J. Gatuiria, Senior
Finance Officer, Mfinistry of Finance.
4.        The proposed credit would be the tenth credit to Kenya. Kenya
has also received four Bank loans, two of which were made before independ-
ence, and guaranteed by the United Kingdom. All credits and loans have
been made to the Government. The position as of March 31, 1970 was as
follows:

* Not yet effective
5.       Of the thirteen operations in Kenya, a high proportion has been
directly or indirectly in support of agriculture. That has rightly
reflected the economic priorities in Kenya; it has also required exten3iv3
supervision by the Bank and Association to resolve problems in execution.
6.       The Smallholder Agricultural Credit Project, Credit No. 105 KE,
has encountered problems in recruiting satisfactory management and staff.
The Agricultural Finance Corporation, which serves as the main channel
of funds for the project, was without a General Manager from July 1969
until late March 1970, and other senior posts are still vacant. The new
General Manager, appointed with the approval of the Association, appears
to have extablished satisfactory working relations and has taken the
initiative to bring in another specialist in agricultural credit to assistv
hLim. He is also searching actively for candidates to fill the vacant
positions. This project is being given particularly close attention by
the Association. Difficulties in recruitment have also arisen in the
case of Loan No. 641 KE for Forest Plantations and have delayed effective
ness of that loan. Cn the other hand, the slow start of the Livestock
Development Project (Credit No. 129 EE) and the consequential delay in
the start of disbursements, was due directly to the pioneering nature oQ
the project, for which there was little or no prior experience in Kerya,
but progress is now satisfactory.



7.       The picture as a whole is by no means disquieting.  The Small-
holder Tea Planting Program of the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA)
has gone particularly well. The first stage, financed under Credit No.
64 KE, was completed two years ahead of schedule, at a savings of about
$592,000. The Association agreed in March, 1970 to the Government's
request to apply the balance in the credit account to upgrading roads in
the tea-growing areas, thereby at the same time making it possible to
satisfy a provision briginally in the second credit to KTDA, Credit No. 119 KZ.
which required that Credit No. 64 KE be fully utilized before withdrawals
under Credit No. 119 KE could begin (see IDA/R 70-7). The Second Highway
Project (Credit No. 120 KE) is on schedule. In approving the Third
Highway Project on September 23, 1969, the Executive Directors also approved
an amendment to Development Credit Agreement No. 104 KE whereby a saving
of about $800,000 on the Agricultural Roads Project was made available for
an extension of the project.
8.       The next fiscal year is expected to see a continued high level
of lending to Kenya. A Bank loan of about $8 million for a water supply
project for the City of Nairobi is under active consideration. A power
project, including a hydroelectric plant at Kamburu, is being appraised
and might justify external financing of about $28 million; the possibility
of a joint operation is being discussed with Sweden. A road maintenance
project is also being appraised. The Government has requested Bank Group
assistance for development of industry and tourism, and we are considering
how we can best help in those two sectors.
9.       In addition to the lending set out in paragraph 4, the Bank has
made four loans for common services in East Africa, three of them for
railways and harbors and one for telecommunications. All of these loans
are guaranteed jointly and severally by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda; the
United Kingdom is also guarantor of the first loan for railways. Another
loan of $142.4 million for railways, to be guaranteed jointly and severally
by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, was approved by the Executive Directors on
March 24, 1970 and will be signed as soon as all necessary legal require-
ments have been met. A second loan for telecommunications in the amount
of $10.4 million, also to be guaranteed by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
jointly and severally, has been negotiated and will be presented for
consideration by the Executive Directors as soon as necessary Government
actions have been completed.   The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans for East African Community projects as of March 31, 1970:

10.       IFC has invested, under two Investment Agreements, about $3.1
million in loans and shares in Kenya Hotel Properties Ltd. for hotels and
game park lodges. A second investment, involving a total commitment of
$14.7 million in a pulp and paper mill at Broderick Falls, was approved
in December 1969.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
11.       BORROWER:                The Republic of Kenya
AMOUNT:                  US$ 6.1 million equivalent in various
currencies
PURPOSE:                 To assist in financing expansion and
improvement in (a) agricultural education,
(b) secondary technical education, and
(c) primary and secondary teachers'
colleges; and to provide technical
assistance for improvement of educationial
planning and curriculum reform.



AMORTIZATION:            In 50 years including a 10-year period
of grace, through semiannual install-
ments, of 1/2 of 1% from September 1,
1980 through March 1, 1990 and of
1-1/2% from September 1, 1990 through
March 1, 2020.
SERVICE CHARGE:          3/4 of 1% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
12.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education
Project in Kenya" (PE-lla) is attached. The project provides for expansion
and improvement in agricultural education, including the establishment of
a Faculty of Agriculture at University College in Nairobi; the expansion
of two institutes to train agricultural technicians; and the establishment
of a third institute and six training centers and three mobile training
units for farmers. The project also provides for extensions to 11 primary
teacher colleges and 8 technical secondary schools.
13.       A crucial component of the project is technical assistance to
Kenya in drawing up a long range development program for education, based
on studies to reduce unit costs, on a consideration of manpower require-
ments and on an examination of the changes in curricula required to
orient the education system more closely to Kenya's development needs.
14.       Pending the elaboration of a comprehensive development plan for
education, the project concentrates on two areas where the needs are
evident and pressing. Ninety percent of the population of Kenya live
in rural areas; for many years, the development ofagriculture will remain
of key importance in terms of employment, exports and self-sufficiency
in foodstuffs. Increasing incomes perhead in agriculture depends not only
on raising output, but also in improving quality. The proposed project
addresses itself to the latter through its emphasis on the education and
training of farmers. Implementation of the project would about double
the number of holders of certificates and university degrees in agricultural
subjects over the next ten years.
15.       The project would also help to relieve the shortage of technicallv
trained people in Kenya. At the present time secondary technical schools
cannot take in more than 30 percent of the applicants. The present project
would provide for an increase in enrollments from 2,200 in 1968 to 3,900
in 1974. This increase would still not provide places for all applicants
but is consistent with the expected growth of employment opportunities.



- 6 -
16.       The provision in the project for primary teacher training is
intended to meet as far as possible the planned increase in primary school
enrollment from 65% of the relevant age groups in 1968 to about 7500 in
1974. Largely as a result of the proposed project, the number of trained
primary school teachers would increase from 27,700 in 1968 to 45,700 in
1974. Despite some increase in pupil/teacher ratios over the same period,
there would still be a shortage of qualified primary teachers, but the
proposed rate of expansion is considered the most rapid that is feasible
at this time.
17.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $9.3 million
equivalent. The proposed credit would cover about two-thirds of the
total cost, including the foreign exchange component estimated at $4.4 million
equivalent, and $1.7 million (or 35%) of the local expenditure on the
project. As noted in paragraph 23, Kenya's 1970-74 Development Plan is
considered realistic, and the Government's financial and economic policies
are sound. However, the foreign exchange component of the public sector
projects included in the Plan which are likely to attract external financing
falls substantially short of the external assistance required for execution
of the Plan. In these exceptional circumstances, and taking into account
the key importance of the proposed project, I consider a moderate amount
of local expenditure of financing on this project reasonable and justifiable.
18.       Disbursement would be made against actual foreign exchange out-
lays in respect of equipment, including books, and technical assistance,
and to the extent of 59% of expenditures in all other categories.
19.       Procurement would follow the Associationts usual rules for
international competitive bidding, with up to 15% preference accorded to
local suppliers of furniture, equipment and books.
20.       Execution of the project would be the responsibility of a
Project Unit in the Ministry of Education. The Unit would be headed by
a Director and the staff would include an architect, an educator, an
equipment specialist and an accountant, all appointments to be subject
to approval by the Association.
PART IV - LEC-AL INSTRUMIENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Kenya and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d), of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Credit Agreement conforms generally to the pattern of existing
IDA agreements for education projects.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
22.       An Economic Report entitled "Economic Development Prospects
in Kenya" (Report No. AE-6a, in two parts, dated October 22, 1969)
was distributed to the Executive Directors October 31, 1969 (R69-209).
Since then,the Kenya Government has published its 1970-74 Development
Plan, which is essentially the same as the draft plan examined in the
economic report.
23.       The report found the Development Plan 1970-74 to be realistic,
and concluded that, on the basis of the past economic performance of
the country and the sound financial and economic policies of the Govern-
ment, Kenya would continue to warrant substantial external assistance.
Because of the probable increase in the inflow of private capital and
the end of post-independence grants, the average terms of the inflow
of capital into Kenya are likely to be harder than in the past. Within
moderate limits, the economy can sustain somewhat harder terms than in
the past but, with a sustained requirement for external assistance,
Kenya needs to secure as much aid as possible on concessionary terms.
24.       A basic data sheet is attached as an Annex.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
26.       I recommend that the Executive Directors of the Association
approve the proposed development credit.
