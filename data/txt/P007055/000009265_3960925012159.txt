PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 1429-EC)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Highway
Project in Ecuador for which Loan 1429-EC in the amount of US$17.5 million
was approved on May 19, 1977.   The  loan  was closed on June 30, 1985 four
years behind schedule. An amount of US$3,200,000 was cancelled on October
21, 1986. An additional amount of US$329,774.97 was cancelled on February
4, 1987, the same date the last disbursement was made.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operation
Division of-Country Department IV of the Caribbean Regional Office. in
accordance with the 'Guidelines for Preparing Project Completion Reports"
of June 1989. following the special instructSons for long overdue PCRs.
Given the time elapsea since closing of the loan (more than four years),
and the fact that MOP staff involved in project execution has disbanded,
Part II was not prepared.   However,  MOP  sent in October 1987 a draft PCR
according  to  the  old   instructions,   the  conclusions  of  which  were
essentially the same outlined in paragraphs 15 and 16 of Part I of this
report.
Preparation of this PCR was based on the Staff Appraisal Report,
the Loan Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 1429-EC)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.       The  Fifth  Highway  Project  shared  with  the  preceeding Fourth
Highway Project, Loan t231-EC, the same sector development objectives of
upgrading the transport system and correcting institutional deficiencies
within a broad plan of fostering economic growth and de7elopment of public
investment. (Para. 1 of the PCR)
Implementation Experience
2.       Implementation of the civil  work  component (98Z of the estimated
project cost) was marred by persistent difficulties: (1) conceptual
differences on the type of roads to be constructed; (ii) slow contracting;
(iii) defective engineering; (iv) poor performance of contractors; (v)
ineffective MOP management; (vi) labor conflicts affecting the main
contractor; and (vii) rain-induced extensive floods during two successive
years. The combination of all these difficulties delayed execution of the
project by four years, impeded implementation of the roads in the Puerto
Ila-Doblones area and prevented completion of the Duran-Boliche road within
the extended project period. (Para. 6 of the PCR). Implementation of the
Feeder Roads Program Study (2X of the estimated project cost) was carried
out satisfactorily by  well  selected  foreign  consultants.   (Para 10 and
Table 6C of the PCR).
Results
3.       The only  component  that  reached  fully  its  objectives was the
Feeder Roads Program Study which established criterias and standards for
selection and design of feeder roads, prepared manuals for the design,
economic studies and construction of feeder roads, prepared a regional
program  for  secondary  and   feeder   roads  (1500  Km)  and  recommended
organizational arrangements for the implementation of this and further
regional programs. (Para. 10 of the PCR).
4.       Construction of the  main  and  feeder  roads  in  the Puerto Ila-
Doblones area, totalling about 100 Kms, was suspended in 1984 because an
accumulation of errors, weaknesses and unforseen events impeded further
implementation (Paras. 7, 8 and 11 of the PCR). A similar combination of
negative factors delayed for several years construction of the Duran-
Boliche four-lane highway (25 Kms), which was completed by the Government
in December 1988, more than three years after Loan Closing date, at a total
cost 68X higher than evaluation estimates (Para. 12 of the PCR).



Sustainabilitv
5.       Sustainability of the wll prepared Rural Roads Study was impaired
by MOP's lack of capability, or willingness to implement the organizational
and desigr recommendations of  the  study  during the Implementation of the
succeeding Rural Roads Program  initiated  in  1982  (Para. 10 of the PCR).
The roads in the Puerto Ila-Doblones area were not completed and will most
probably never be built as designed (Para. 11 of the PCR). Feasibility of
*         the Duran-Boliche expressway  has  been  seriously  diminished  by the much
higher construction cost and lower rate of traffic increase, which have
reduced the internal rate of return  from 20? estimated at appraisal to 5?.
Moreover, design errors in both the urban and the rural sections of this
road have denied its sustsinability  as  an  expressway.   (Para. 12 of the
PCR).
FindinRs and Lessons Learned
S5.      During preparation of the  project,  the  Bank  should have made a
better  assessment   of   unfavorable   conditions   affecting  design  ane
implementation of both roads. as well as the shortness of the construction
period available each year. (Para. 13 of the PCR). During implementation
the Bank should have been willing to take strong corrective actions, such
as suspension of disbursements. (Para. 14 of tha PCR). In preparation of
possible future investment projects in Ecuadot. the Bank should ensure that
all potential unfavorable conditions have been taken into account properly,
and should design the project in tranches with precisely defined targets to
be achieved in given time-frames to facilitate timely application of
corrective measures. (Para. 17 of the PCR).
7.       MOP's weakness during project  preparation and implementation were
caused mainly by: (i) discontinuity of high and mid level assignment; (ii)
chronical shortage of qualified personnel; (iii) reluctance of mid level
staff to assume administrative and technical responsibilities; and (iv)
extreme  delays  in  the   processing   of   payments  to  contractors  and
consultants.  (Para. 15 of  the  PCR).   To attain greater effectiveness in
the preparation and implementation *of road projects, MOP would have to
correct the ingrained weaknesses described above by (i) ensuring greater
permanency of managerial and technical staff; (ii) upgrading the technical
capacity of its staff through increased salaries and better use of the
technical  assistance  in   highway   planning,  design,  .onstruction  and
maintenance received under Loan 1231-EC; (iii) fostering decision taking
capacity of mid level staff; (iv) streamlining administrative procedures;
and (v) making high level technical decisions more independent from
political interests.  (Para.  16  of  the  PCR).   To allow expeditious and
effective  processing  of  medium   and   large  investment  projects.  the
Government  would  have   to   streamline  its  administrative  procedures,
strengthen collaboration between public agencies, free technical decisions
from political interference, and ensure firm commitments to the project in
timely provision of counterpart funds (Para. 18 of the PCR).

Project Background Objectives and Description
1.       The Fifth Highway Project  emerged  from  components of the Fourth
Highway Project, Loan 1231-EC, which had been substantially delayed in
their preparation by the time of appraisal of that project (February 1975).
Therefore, both projects shared the same sector development objectives of
upgrading the transpoit system and correcting institutional deficiencies
within a broad plan of fostering economic growta and development of public
investment. These objectives were achieved only to a small degree, in the
Fifth Highway Project, because of defective design and poor execution of
the civil works components.
2.       The project included: (i) execution and supervision of civil works
for the construction of a four-lane paved highway (25 Km) between Duran and
Boliche, and a development road (29 Km) between Puerto Ila and Doblones,
including 75 Km of lateral feeder roads; and (ii) pre-investment and
organizational studies for the Dreparation of a secondary and feeder roads
program in the provinces of Guayas, Los Rios and El Oro.
Project Design and Organization
3.       The project  was  designed  as  an  infrastructure  project  to be
prepared and implemented by the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) with an
additional innovative component for the organizational study of feeder
roads, demanding close liaison with other Government and regional agencies
involved  in  agricultural  development   programs.    This  component  was
successfully carried out, whereas implementation of the civil works
components stumbled over conceptual discrepancies between MOP and the
Municipality of Guayaquil on the right of way acquisition for adequate
execution of the four-lane highway through the urban area of Duran, and
between MOP and the Ministry of Agriculture on the area of influence and
function of the Duran-Boliche road.



4.       Although an agreement  between  MOP  and  the Municipal Council of
Guayaquil on the required right-of-way acquisition for the urban section of
the Duran-Boliche road was signed as a condition for negotiations, the
Municipal Council, confronted by population and political pressures. later
backed off and MOP never had the power nor will to enforce compliance of
the agreement. These discrepancies caused serious delays in work execution
and, coupled with cost considerations, led finally, in September 1983. to
the deletion of the 1.8 Km urban section of the road from the project
scope.
5.       Preparation of the Puerto Ila-Doblones road and its lateral feeder
roads had been delayed by long discussions on the extent of the area to he
served (64,000 Km high yield hectares versus 200,000 partially low yield
hectares). length of the road (29 Km versus 86 1(), and type of road
(penetration road versus  secondary  road).    At  appraisal, agreement was
reached on the lower scope for the project, however, the type of road,
described  as  *development  road",  was   not  defined  precisely.    This
confusion, coupled with other factors discussed in paragraphs 7 and 8
below,  led  finally  to  the   suspension,  in  September  1983,  of  road
construction under the project in this area, except for the north-south La
Bramadora-La Palizada feeder road (15Kms), and to the transfer of loan
funds to the Duran-Boliche  road.    This  actdon  wa. also prompted by the
Government's decision to raise the level of the huge Daule-Peripa dam under
construction  (with  IDB  financing),   which  resulted  in  a  substantial
expansion of the flood area and, consequently, in a reduction of the area
to be served by the proposed road system.
Project Implementation
6.       Implementation  of   the   project   was   marred   by  persistent
difficulties, affecting particularly execution of the roads in the Puerto
Ila-Doblones area: (i) the above discussed conceptual differences; (ii)
slow contracting; (iii) defective engineering; (iv) poor performance of
contractors; (v) ineffectiv3 MOP management; (vi) labor conflicts affecting
the main contractor; and (v4i) rain-induced extensive floods during two
successive years.    The  combination  of  all  these  difficulties delayed
execution of the project by four years, impeded implementation of the roads
in the Puerto Ila-Doblones area and prevented completion of the Duran-
Boliche road within  the  extended  project  period.   Measures foreseen at
appraisal to prevent some of these difficulties were not effectively
implemented by MOP, several difficulties were unexpected.
7.       Although satisfactory contracting  procedures  had  been agreed at
negotiations, unexpected delays occurred because of undue interference of
the administrative and the legal state controlling agencies (Contraloria
and Procuraduria).   Design  modifications introduced during implementation
of the Duran-Boliche road, due to unfavorable soil conditions encountered
along a 2 Km stretch and to the addition of major culverts and cattle-
underpasses  initially  not  included   in   the  project  scope,  produced
substantial delays  and  cost  increases.    A  first  Bank  review, before
appraisal, of the Puerto Ila-Doblones road engineering showed that MOP had
chosen too high standards and that the consultant (local) had made a number
of serious errors. MOP agreed to contract a revision of the engineering,
which was not completed until after appraisal. The later execution of the



3
works revealed further critical deficiencies of the revised engineering:
(i) failure to detect unstablti soil conditions due to the existence of
thick layers of expansive clays a few meters under the surface; and tii)
inadequacy, and partially non-existence, of sources of materials foreseen.
imposing the use of sources outside the project area with much larger
hauling distances and thus increasing project cost by about 402.
8.       The contractors, the  consultants  and  MOP  revealed a continuous
lack of ability to deal adequately with these technical difficulties, which
were used by the contractors to try to obtain undue administrative
advantages. The weakness of MOP to deal with these problems was 'urther
exacerbated by: (i) constant policy shifts because cf frequent changes of
MOP Ministers and high and  medium  level staff: and (ii) persistent delays
of payments to the contractors and consultants because of cumoersome
bureaucratic procedures, lack of timely availability of counterpart funds,
and difficulties, extending over three years, in the application of the
price escalation formulas agreed at appraisal, and later of similar
formulas established by law.    These  compounded difficulties engendered a
labor strike that paralyzed for over a year construction activities by the
contractor of two of the three sections of the Duran-Boliche road and of
the Puerto Ila-Doblones  road.    In  addition,  the abnormal rains brought
about by the 'El Nino" current phenomenon from mid 1982 to mid 1984
decreased even more the short dry season during two successive years,
further delaying project implementation.
9.       Some risks and measures correctly identified at appraisal were not
satisfactorily taken into account or acted upon 'y MOP: arrangements needed
with other Government agencies; need for satisfactory engineering, adequate
contracting procedures and timely counterpart financing; and efficient use
of agreed price escalation formulas.    The  effect of the six month annual
rainy season preventing construction activities during that period was not
adequately considered in the planning of work execution, and was further
worsened by the unexpected abnormal rainfa:l during two successive years.
Another unforeseen factor was that MOP's administrative effectiveness,
which was at a fairly high level  at  the tine of appraisal, would start to
deteriorate progressively, resulting in failures to take timely corrective
action on the multiple technical and administrative difficulties discussed
above, despite constant recommendations for action submitted by successive
Bank missions and by constantly repeated Bank communications. The question
remains open if a timely suspension of disbursements by the Bank would have
prompted effective remedial action by MOP.
Project Results and Sustainability
10.      The only component that reached fully its objectives was the study
for the 'Preparation of a Regional Secondary and Feeder Road Program".
which was contracted, with some delay, with a joint venture of the Israeli
Institute for Transport Planning and Research and the local consultant firm
Protecvia and successfully carried out, within the foreseen time period,
with cost savings of about 10%. It established cr4:erias and standards for
selection and design of feeder roads, preparea manuals for the design.
economic studies and construction of feeder roads, prepared a regional



program for secondary and feeder roads construction and improvement (1.500
Km) and recomended organizational arrangements for the implementation of
this and further regional program.       Sustainability of this well prepared
Rural Roads Study was impaired by Hot. lack of capability, or willingness,
to implement the organizational and design recommendations of the study.
during the implementation of the succeeding Rural Roads Program initiated
in 1982. MOP's organization seems to be unfit to reasonably carry out
programs for engineering and construction of feeder roads and it appears
that implementation of such programs should be entrusted in the future to
more flexible agencies having a direct interest in them.
11.      Project objectives did  not  change during project implementation.
however, there was a substantial variance in the results of the civil works
components. The Puerto Ila-Doblones road and its lateral feeder roadc were
not completed and will most probably never be built as designed, affecting
seriously and even endangering implementation of the Puerto Ila-Chone Rural
Development Project (Loan 1991-EC) and delaying economic development of
that area for many years.
12.      The economic deterioration suffered  by Ecuador after the collapse
of the oil boom affected negatively the net benefits to be obtained from
the construction cf the Duran-Boliche road (70% of total project cost) by
reducing the average annual rate of increase of the compounded benefit
streams derived from predicted traffic flows over a 20-year period from
8.4Z forecasted at appraisal to a present estimate of only 5Z. This,
coupled with the fact that the road was not completed under the project.
but three years later with Government financing at a final economic cost in
1976 constant sucres 682 higher than the economic cost used for economic
evaluation at appraisal, resulted in a decrease of the economic rate of
return from 20? foreseen at appraisal to 5?. In addition, construction of
the road had a negative impact on agricultural exploitation of the area it
traverses, because it interrupted transversal flows needed to maintain and
increese agricultural production. The urban section (1.8 Kms) constructed
by MOP, independently of the project. was not provided with standards
adequate for a main urban artery affected by extensive side friction. This
section is already heavily congested and will deteriorate further in the
near future because of the rapid growth of the Duran urban area. In
addition, the remaining 23 Kms were not provided with lateral service
roads, therefore, this four-lane highway has lost from the beginning its
character as an  expressway.    Given  MOP's  ingrained weakness to enforce
necessary traffic regulations, this road will be progressively congested by
uncontrolled accesses and at random level crossings. Sustainability of the
original project concept is therefore seriously impaired.
Bank Performance
13.      Although the civil works  components  of this pro,ect emerged from
recommendations of the Highway Master Plan financed under Loan 379-EC, and
the preparation of their engineering took several years, in retrospect, it
must be recognized that during identification and preparation of the



S
project, the Bank should have made a better assessment of unfavorable
conditions affecting both roadli closeness to a parallel main road and need
for transversal crossings in the urban and rural sections of the Duran.
Boliche road, and conceptual and geotechnical problems in Puerto ila.
Doblones, as well as the shortness of the available construction period
each year  (betweer  rainy  seasons)  demanding  adequate  planning  of the
*             construction  sequence  and  of  the   total  period.    At  appraisal  and
negotiations many potential problems were correctly taken into account and
acted upon, however, the Bank failed to obtain a proper definition of the
t-pe of road  to  be  built  from  Puerto  Ila  to  Doblones and to enforce
preparation of satisfactory engineering of that road.
14.      Supervision of this  project  was  carried out simultaneously with
supervision of the Fourth and/or Sixth Highway Projects and was therefore
not  very  time-consuming.       However,   the  Bank  followed  closely  the
difficulties progressively arising in project implementation, and presented
timely and repeated recommendations to prevent deterioration and improve
project  implementation.    Eventual   stronger  measures  to  induce  more
expeditious project implementation, such as suspension of disbursements,
were not applied considering that each successive new MOP administration
promised to take adequate corrective action.   In retrospect, it would have
been helpful if the project would have been designed in tranches with clear
targets to have been achieved in a given timeframe.
Borrower's Performance
15.      MOP's execution and managerial weakness during project preparation
and implementation, already pointed out in paragraphs 4 through 8 above,
were caused mainly by       (i)  discontinuity  of  high  and mid level staff
assignment, newcoming unexperienced administrators and technicians slowed
down the process, took wrong decisions and often insisted in the same
errors that had been previously corrected; (ii} a chronic shortage of
qualified technical personnel, due to low government salaries, which
resulted in inadequate capacity to resolve technical problems in a timely
and effective manner; (iii) reluctance of mid level staff to assume
administrative and technical responsibilities leaving all decision-taking
to high level, mostly politically minded, administrators; and (iv) extreme
delays in the processing of payments to contractors and consultants,
resulting from the Borrower's overly complex proceduras and documentation,
particularly in the Ministry  of  Finance.   Compliance with Loan covenants
were mostly transferred to Loans 1882-EC and 1991-EC.
16.      To  attain   greater   effectiveness   in   the   preparation  and
implementation of road projects. MOP would have to correct the ingrained
weaknesses described above by (i) ensuring greater permanency of managerial
and technical staff: (ii) upgrading the technical capacity of its staff
through increased salaries and better use of the technical assistance in
highway planning, design, construction and maintenance received under Loan
1231-EC; (iii) fostering decision taking capacity of mid level staff; (iv)
streamlining administrative procedures; and (v) making high level technical
decisions more independent from political interests.



6
Project Relationship
17.      The Bank's  consistent  and  repeated  efforts  to improve project
preparation and implementation did not succeed, because of weak MOP
performance. On the other hand, the repeated assurances by incoming new
MOP authorities to take adequate corrective actions, induced the Bank not
to apply starner measures, such as suspension of disbursements. and even to
concur with four extensions of the loan Closing Date. In preparation of
future investment projects in Ecuador, the Bank should ensure that all
potential unfavorable conditions have been taken properly into account. and
should design the project in tranches with precisely defined targets to be
achieved in given timeframes to facilitate effective application of
corrective measures. The only other Government agency with which the Bank
related under this project was the Ministry of Finance. The Bank's efforts
to ensure more expeditious processing of payments to contractors and
consultants did not have positive results.
18.      The lack of a clear understanding  between MOP and the Ministry of
Agriculture on the scope of an agricultural project in the Puerto Ila-
Doblones area. had a detrimental effect on the implementation of this
project  component.    In  addition,  MOP  did  not  succeeds  in  ensuring
compliance by the Guayaquil Municipal Council and the Guayas Provincial
Council with their agreements on timely acquisition of right of way and on
the location of the bridge toll collection facilities, respectively.
Finally, the implementation of the project was seriously affected by
excessive interference from both the administrative and the legal state
control agencies (Contraloria and Procuraduria), and by the Ministry of
Finance complex procedures. To allow expeditious and effective processing
of medium and large investment projects, the Government would have to
streamline its administrative procedures, strengthen collaboration between
public agencies, free technical decisions from political interference, and
ensure firm commitments to the project in timely provision of cousnterpart
funds.
Consulting Services
19.      The joint  foreign-local  consultants  who  carried  out the rural
roads study played a key role in the successful completion of that study.
Whereas the local consultants deployed in the engineering and supervision
of civil works did not perform well and. lacking adequated MOP guidance,
were a main factor in the implementation failures of the project.
Project Documentation and Data
20.      As stated before,  the  legal  agreerents  for this project should
have defined more specifically the type of road to be built from Puerto Ila
to Doblones, and should have taken into consideration the climatic
constraints in project execution.   The  appraisal report's usefulness as a
tool for project implementation and supervision could have been enhanced if
its structure would have followed the new guidelines established shortly
after its preparation, and if it had addressed several problems that were
not detected at appraisal. Data relevant to the preparation of the PCR was
readily available. The Aide Memoires prepared after each Bank mission were
particularly helpful in the preparation of this report.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(Prepared by Borrower)
1.       Following the old guidelines for preparation of Project Completion
Reports (PCR), the Borrower prepared a draft PCR in January 1987 and
followed it up with detailed cost tables in October 1987. The conclusions

(NOT AVAILABLE)
NOTE:    As discussed in Part I of this PCR, implementation of the project
was marred by ingrained difficulties, affecting particularly execution of
the roads in the Puerto Ila-Doblones area: (i) concept al discrepancies on
the type of road; (ii) defective engineering; (iii) sl4w contracting; (iv)
poor performance of contractors; (v) ineffective HOP m magement exacerbated
by frequent changes of MOP Ministers and high and mid  evel MOP.staff; (v)
labor conflicts affecting the main contractor; and (vi rain-induced
extensive floods during two successive years. The combination of all these
adverse facts delayed execution of the pro.ject by four and a half years,
impeded implementation of the roads in the Puerto Ila-Doblones area and
prevented completion of the Duran-Boliche road within the extended project
period.

COMUENTS: The equivalence in US dollars expected at appraisal was based on 1 US dollor = 25 sucres. Actual costs in US dollars
derive from strem of disbursements over 1978/85 resulting from the following average annual exchange rates: 1978 through
1031: 26, 1982: 80.03, 1983: 44.12, 1984: 82.64; and 1986: 89.58. The increas of work quantities and unit costs of works
executed in the Duran-Boliche Road wore more than offset by the reduction of other works finaneed under the loan, resulting in a
24! de rease in tot l USS project cost.
1/ After Loan Closing Date (0/30/86) MOP lnitiated, under own financing, the construction of two major interchonges at Km. 1.8
and 4.7 and completed them late in 1988 at an additional cost, including supervision, of 179 million constant 1976 sucrea,
equivelent to US37.2 million. The total cost of the Duran-Boliche road US3711 million constant 1978 sucros is 681 above the base
cost used for economic evaluation (423 million) and 22X above appraisal estimate including physical and prlce contingencies (583
million).

COMMENTS:  Total expenditures under the project were reduced by about 202
because of the reduction of scope of the works financed under the project.
The percentage of foreign financing of civil works (47Z) and related
supervision services (532) remained fairly constant during project
implementation, because the reduction of the rates of disbursements to 20
and 25? respectively, agreed in May 1982 considering eventual cost
overruns, was cancelled in Septen,ber 1983, based on the reduction of the
project scope, and did not affect the total percentage of foreign financing
since no disbursements were done in that period using the reduced rate.
The percentage of foreign financing of the rural roads study increased from
65 to 82 percent because of higher participation of foreign consultants
than originally expected.

Comments: 1/
This abnormal drop in the ERR reflects the impact of the
economic deterioration suffered by Ecuador after the collapse of the oil
boom. Its direct causes are: (i) the 68Z increase of economic costs,
including supervision, in constant 1976 sucres between appraisal estimate
(SI 354 million) and actual final cost (SI 595 million); and (ii) much
lower rates of the annual increases of benefit streams derived from traffic
flows (a compounded average of 8.42 over 20 years estimated at appraisal
against a present estimate of only 5Z).
