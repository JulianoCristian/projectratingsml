namely due to the successful institutional\n            development objective of the investment component, and\n            sustainability is also highly likely. The high motivation,\n            and commitment of successive governments, and that of the\n            district heating enterprises (DHE), to improve energy\n            efficiency, provide competitive services, and protect the\n            environment, greatly contributed to this outcome. Among the\n            many lessons learned, it is suggested that: 1) to reduce the\n            overly bureaucratic, and time consuming procurement process,\n            standardized technical specifications required for DHEs\n            items be established; increase the international shopping\n            limit for these items; and, consider the use of local\n            language for procurement documents; 2) priority be given to\n            metering of total purchases, and sales of heat, early on\n            during implementation to prevent underestimating the level\n            of heat transmission losses, and DHEs variable operating\n            costs, and provide better cost savings opportunities; 3)\n            since depreciation is a major operating cost in the\n            capital-intensive district heating, and energy enterprises,\n            it may undermine the integrity of financial accounts when\n            inflation reaches high levels. Thus, the issue should be\n            addressed at the country level, not just in the context of a\n            single operation; and, 4) credit lines should be subject to\n            acceptable commercial practices, and, when in partnership\n            with other international financial institutions, a blending\n            of funds should be provided."}, "docdt": "2000-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
