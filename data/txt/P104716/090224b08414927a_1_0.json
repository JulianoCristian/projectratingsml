for Liberia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            government commitment for reforms secured early i.e. during\n            project conceptualization is critical to successful\n            implementation of institutional reforms. Free standing\n            grants to support projects should be planned with similar\n            objectives, project activities, and implementing\n            arrangements in order to provide flexibility and efficiency\n            in the use of funds. The failure to deliver the entire\n            planned water system provides a good example of the inherent\n            risk in having different funding sources delivering\n            different components. Splitting up interdependent systems\n            into separate packages to be financed by a single financing\n            source is therefore critical for a satisfactory outcome and\n            to avoid mismatched implementation schedules. A higher\n            standard of due diligence is required in the Procurement of\n            suppliers in weak operating environments to ensure selection\n            of qualified suppliers who are most likely to perform satisfactorily."}, "docdt": "2016-01-26T23:25:03Z"}
