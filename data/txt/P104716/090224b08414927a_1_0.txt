1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country Background.

1.      In June 2003, the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement brought 14 years of civil war
and unrest in Liberia to a close. The protracted period of conflict was devastating for Liberia’s
economy, government, and infrastructure. State institutions were severely eroded. Despite having
achieved rapid economic growth during the 1960s and ‘70s and reaching nearly middle-income
status, by 2003 Liberia was one of the world’s poorest countries with a per capita Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of approximately US$1511.

2.     Post-war challenges facing Liberia were numerous and covered every area of society: an
estimated 85 percent of the formal sector workforce was unemployed or underemployed; more
than half of children were not in school; less than ten percent of the population had access to
healthcare; the majority of rural houses, roads, and bridges were “in need of reconstruction”, etc.2
Migration resulting from insecurity in the countryside had doubled the urban population of
Monrovia and there was an urgent need to establish security in the countryside so that internally
displaced individuals could return and livelihoods, largely based in agriculture, could be rebuilt.

3.      Liberia entered new era of peace ill equipped to rebuild. Government institutions were
largely eroded by war and unprepared for the challenges of policy-making and reconstruction. The
National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) consisted of representatives of warring
parties, political parties, civil society, and the country’s fifteen counties.3

4.      In October 2005 Liberia was able to hold its first general elections since 1997. Despite a
successful political transition to an elected government, Liberia was still in a state of crisis.
Unemployment was estimated to be around 80 percent.4 Disarmament had only been completed
the prior year (late 2004) and high unemployment increased the chances of Liberia backsliding
into unrest and conflict. Key physical infrastructure required emergency repairs and rebuilding.

5.     The first post war government of Liberia made clear its focus on growth-oriented policy,
including land tenure reform to promote agricultural employment. While Liberia experienced an
immediate peace dividend in the form of accelerating growth under the elected government,
Liberia’s recovery and future stability were extremely fragile.

Sector Background.
6.      Up until June 2006, reconstruction efforts in Liberia were limited to small operations
consisting primarily of community-based rebuilding. These programs were led by non-
governmental organizations and by the United Nations Mission to Liberia (UNMIL), involved
relatively little technical capacity, and primarily consisted of basic rebuilding of housing, roads,

and bridges, including rebuilding trust in communities and producing employment. As such, many
critical infrastructure needs of the country were yet to be addressed and Liberia faced a
infrastructure deficit that would eventually serve as an obstacle to growth and recovery. By 2007
Liberia had established a Special Implementation Unit (SIU) within the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW) to undertake infrastructure works but had yet to undertake highly technical works on the
scale necessary to rebuild and lacked the institutional capacity to do so.
7.      Agriculture, the main source of livelihoods for approximately 80 percent of the population,
accounted for 50 percent of GDP5 and was rightly identified to be of critical importance to
Liberia’s short-term recovery and long-term stability. At the time of appraisal, Liberia faced
immediate crises of food insecurity and unemployment, a global food crisis was emerging, and
world food prices were increasing dramatically. The impacts of these increases were already
evident in the domestic economy since food is such a large share of household expenditure and,
even in 2007, 70 percent of Liberia’s food needs were met with imports. Investments in physical
infrastructure, policy reform, and capacity were needed to improve farmer productivity. The
consumer price index (CPI - in which food carries a weight of 45 percent) increased to 14 percent
in March 2008, about 25 percent more than in January 2007. At appraisal, 48 percent of the
population was unable to meet their basic food needs. Poverty was endemic, with an estimated
national poverty rate of 64 percent, and the impact of food price increases on Liberia’s poor was
severe. Rice is a staple food for Liberians, accounting for 37 percent of value of food consumption
and 50 percent of daily calorific intake for the average household, but prices are relatively high
and local production is relatively low. Increasing agricultural production was vital to reducing
poverty and food insecurity and to increasing employment. 6
8.      In an effort to advance agriculture development, the Government of Liberia (GOL) and
development partners prepared a Comprehensive Assessment of the Agriculture Sector (CAAS-
Lib) in 2007. The agriculture sector of Liberia consisted of large plantation producers focusing on
export crops and a relatively small number of medium-size operations, and small household farms.
Small household farms made up the majority of all farming and typically used traditional
production techniques. CAAS-Lib recognized that the potential for agriculture to contribute
maximally to poverty reduction and economic growth would hinge upon transformation of the
sector from dominance by large cash-crop plantations and low productivity small holders into a
system where higher productivity of small holders enables an increase in their participation in the
cash economy. The key institutional challenges in the sector were: (a) the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) was in need of top to bottom modernization; (b) MOA lacked basic capacity to collect and
analyze data and formulate policy; and, (c) redevelopment of extension services. The sector
suffered from lack of trucks and a weak market for trucking services, and from roads and bridges
that were generally in very poor condition.

Rationale for Bank Assistance
9.      To maintain peace and stability in the postwar transition, Liberia would need to resolve the
acute economic, food insecurity, and employment crises. The agriculture sector had the greatest
potential to create employment opportunities and address food insecurity, and was a natural focal
point for development efforts. The Bank was already positioned as the donor of choice by the

GOL to lead donor efforts in infrastructure development, particularly given its extensive global
experience in reinstating large-scale transport infrastructure, particularly in post conflict situations.
The Bank had also already been playing a key role in natural resource development and in
revitalizing the forestry and the agricultural sectors. The rationale for AIDP was therefore to
rebuild the agriculture sector and key infrastructure assets in order to address an already poor
situation made worse by the global food crisis. A program for infrastructure development, which
was originally conceived as a separate operation from agricultural activities, was combined with
the agricultural investments in order to take advantage of synergies between the sectors.
10.     The rationale for the infrastructure component of AIDP was relatively simple. A range of
infrastructure investments across several sectors was needed to restore basic services and set the
foundation for future growth and stability. These ranged from urban and rural roads and bridges,
the municipal water supply and distribution system, the oil jetty and other basic facilities. AIDP
also supported rebuilding the country’s capacity to manage infrastructure projects in order to
establish a pathway to sustained reconstruction and growth.
11.     The rationale for the agricultural component and aspects of the infrastructure component
followed along the lines of the conclusions of the CAAS-Lib study. CAAS-Lib identified the
overarching challenge to achieving poverty reduction in the sector as transforming the role of
small-holder farmers from small-scale subsistence farmers to operations with greater participation
in the cash economy.

Contribution to Higher Level Objectives
12.     The project was consistent with the government’s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
(IPRS) for the period 2006-08 as well as the Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN) of 2007-2008.
Specifically, the project supported pillars II and IV of the IPRS, which was built on four pillars:
(a) enhancing national security; (b) revitalizing the economy; (c) strengthening governance and
the rule of law; and (d) rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic services. The World
Bank’s ISN laid out a comprehensive 18-month strategy closely aligned to priorities expressed in
the IPRS. This provided for a scaled-up International Development Association (IDA) pre-arrears
program in infrastructure, economic governance reform, and delivery of basic services
(community-driven development, health, and education).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

13.     The development objective of the project was to support the Recipient’s efforts to: (a)
rehabilitate its basic infrastructure; and (b) revive its agriculture activities.7

14.    The key performance indicators agreed between the government and the World Bank at
appraisal were:
           (i)        Increased access to water for residents of Monrovia;
           (ii)       Port productivity increased;
           (iii)      Increased access to an all season road for targeted rural population;
           (iv)       Increased number of markets where seed rice is available; and

the Data Sheet). The difference in wording is minor and does not impact the meaning of the PDO.

      (v)   Percentage increase in metric tons of cocoa.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

15.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) was not revised.

16.     Restructuring of the project during implementation in October 2013 led to a revision of the
project indicators as presented in the data sheet. The changes were mainly driven by the need to
better reflect the interventions on the ground and eliminate complexity in project results
monitoring.
17.    The revised key indicators for the project at the time of closure, including key indicators
that were achieved and dropped from monitoring, were as follows:
      (a)   Total rice production in Bong and Lofa counties;
      (b)   Port productivity increased (moves per hour/crane);
      (c)   Increased Access to an all-season road for targeted rural population;
      (d)   Rice yield on beneficiary farms; and
      (e)   Daily production of treated water.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

18.    The main beneficiaries of the project were the people of Liberia at large who would benefit
from the increased port productivity and increased food production and the population of urban
and rural areas in Monrovia and along the Monrovia-Cotton Tree-Buchanan and Gate 15-Ganta
corridors benefitting from road and bridge improvements. These include the population living
within Monrovia city; rural community groups involved in rice, vegetable, and cassava farming
on a household basis, and suppliers and service providers; community based organizations who
ensured that the project activities were realized; and people employed in rural roads construction
and along the Monrovia-Buchanan road corridor.

19.     The specific institutions that participated in the project include the Ministry of Public
Works, Ministry of Agriculture, Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC), and National Port
Authority (NPA). These institutions were direct beneficiaries of the funding that contributed to
capacity building, policy reforms, and the improvements in infrastructure in the transport, water,
port, and agriculture sectors.

20.     The secondary target beneficiaries were: (a) the out growers of lowland rice; (b) the
Ministry of Agriculture, county extension staff, and local groups who managed and sustained
progress under the project toward sustainable increases in the incomes of rural dwellers affected
by the project; and (c) residents of the urban area of Monrovia who benefitted from the increased
volume of the urban water supply.
1.5 Original Components

21.   The Agriculture and Infrastructure Development Project (AIDP) comprised of three
components:



                                             4 
Component A: Policy Reform and Institutional Support (Original Funding US$5.7 million
excluding contingencies, no additional financing)
22.     This component was designed to support the development of key strategic policies of the
Government and strengthen relevant government entities. This includes a management contract
for operation of the Port of Monrovia and complementary advisory services in undertaking
comprehensive reform of the port sector, as well as funding of technical assistance to various
entities of the Government responsible for transport and infrastructure. This component also was
to provide: (a) targeted assistance for policy reforms and institutional strengthening of LWSC,
improving the legal and regulatory framework, and capacity building in the water sector; and (b)
technical assistance to the MOA to strengthen its capacity in policy formulation and planning, as
well as monitoring, evaluation and statistical reporting.
Component B: Agriculture and Infrastructure Investment (Original Funding US$27.3 million,
additional financing US$19 million, excluding contingencies)
23.     This component was to finance the design, rehabilitation, and supervision activities of
infrastructure assets. Included in these activities were rehabilitation and/or construction of: (a) the
existing oil jetty in Freetown port; (b) major bridges on principal road corridors; (c) bridges on a
number of smaller river crossings nationwide; (d) secondary and tertiary feeder roads; and (e) a
feasibility, environmental and design study for a new landfill near Monrovia. Funds were also to
be made available for developing a sustainable local roads maintenance capacity. The water
treatment plant for Monrovia was targeted for rehabilitation to at least 50 percent of design
capacity with the aim of improving provision of safe drinking water in selected secondary cities.
In addition, this component covered the rehabilitation of Monrovia’s water distribution network
(secondary and tertiary pipelines to connect to water posts and selected institutions/users).
24.      The planned agriculture sector investments were: (a) to establish basic seed multiplication
facilities to ensure seed availability for future planting; and (b) support existing Farmer Based
Organizations (FBOs) to effectively manage the facility, including producing and marketing
quality seed for local markets. This component was also to rebuild agriculture value and marketing
chains such as marketplaces and post-harvest handling facilities concentrating on cocoa, coffee,
food crops, and vegetable production, including support to FBOs to enhance production and on-
farm community processing. Marketing infrastructure, including marketplaces, post-handling
infrastructure, local distribution hubs, storage places, and local markets were also to be established.
Component C: Project Management and Capacity Building (Original Funding US$0.9 million
excluding contingencies, no additional financing)
25.   Under this component, incremental support was to be given to the existing project
management and implementation entities, namely the SIU and Public Financial Management Unit
(PFMU) of the MPW.
1.6 Revised Components

26.    The project components were revised on several instances: in the first Additional
Financing, in 2008; in the second Additional Financing, in 2009; and in the Restructuring in 2013.
The project PDO was not revised but the Results Framework was revised twice, in 2008 and in
2013.



                                              5 
27.     Changes in 2008 consisted of scaling up the agriculture component through an Additional
Financing grant of US$3.0 million from the Food Crisis Response Trust Fund (Grant H327-LR).
The Grant supported expansion of the tree crop value chain enhancement activities being delivered
by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) to include rice and cassava. This
opportunistic restructuring was undertaken in response to the worsening global food price crisis
and supported the existing PDO. Implementation arrangements continued to be through the SIU
and PFMU. SIU recruited an agriculture specialist around the time of appraisal in order to
strengthen implementation of the agriculture activities of the project. The existing Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) arrangements were applied to the additional activities.
28.     In 2009 an Additional Financing in the amount of US$16.0 million was approved to be
applied to: (a) cost over-runs for two project activities, (i) pre-contracting design of road corridors,
and (ii) higher than expected costs for reconstruction of the collapsed Vai Town Bridge; and (b)
for scaling-up of the Monrovia-Cotton Tree Road Works by the addition of 83 km of road length
originally planned to be deferred to a subsequent project. Several activities were also dropped
from AIDP to be implemented under the Urban and Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project
(URIRP, Grants H4780 and TF094353). These include: rehabilitation of the oil jetty, maintenance
of rehabilitated roads, and rehabilitation/reconstruction of five of the six bridges along the
Monrovia-Ganta and Monrovia-Buchanan roads. The sixth bridge in the corridor required only
minor repairs, which were to be funded by the government. This Additional Financing also
retained the project’s existing implementation arrangements, via SIU and PFMU. The Project
Paper noted the planned transition of the SIU into the Infrastructure Implementation Unit (IIU).
29.     The Project underwent a third restructuring in 2013 to refine the results framework and,
particularly, increase focus on staple food production. Cassava production was removed from the
results framework, as rice had become the major focus of the expanded staple crop activities.
Increased production of cocoa was also dropped as a PDO indicator, as tree crop activities would
be delivered under a newly launched tree crops project, the Smallholder Tree Crop Revitalization
Project (IDA Credit 5101). The number of markets where seed rice is available was also dropped.
Although the project activities remained focused on increasing availability of seed rice, marketing
of seed rice was found to be overly complex for the project’s focus (see Data Sheet).

1.7 Other significant changes

30.    The Government of Liberia requested extension of the project closing date at no additional
cost on three occasions. Additionally, in 2011, the legal agreement for Grant TF096385 was
revised to allow retroactive financing of some water sector activities covered by the original Grant
Agreement that were not originally anticipated to be financed retroactively. Table 1 provides an
overview of project changes, including changes to components and results.

    impacted by Ebola.

31.      The first extension, of 22 months, was approved on June 24, 2011, from December 31,
2011 to October 31, 2013. The second extension, of 11 months, was approved on October 24,
2013, from October 31, 2013 to September 30, 2014. Both of these extensions were requested to
allow additional time for project activities to be completed. The last project extension, approved
by the Bank on October 1, 2014, was occasioned by the occurrence of the Ebola Virus Disease
(EVD) outbreak in Liberia. The outbreak brought several project activities in the agriculture sector
to a standstill. An additional 10 months extension was approved on October 1, 2014, bringing the
total time extension for the project to 43 months.

32.     The project was prepared with co-financing of a €10 million Grant (US$12.5 million
equivalent) from the European Commission (EC). The emergency project paper approved by the
Board on July 31, 2007 indicated that an EC Grant was expected in September 2007. In spite of
these good intentions several delays were experienced in getting the funds on stream. The trust
fund (TF) Administration Agreement for the EC grant was signed on February 23, 2009. The TF
was activated on August 4, 2009 and the Grant Agreement was signed on July 20, 2010, almost a
year later. The delay in signing of the Grant Agreement left only 11 months for procurement and
implementation of the targeted activities. The closing date for the grant was therefore extended
from June 30, 2011 to July 31, 2012. The Grant Agreement was also amended to include


                                             7 
retroactive financing to the tune of US$1,519,309.94 equivalent for eligible expenditures incurred
on or after February 15, 2010.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

33.     The AIDP was the first major IDA-funded project after the Emergency Infrastructure
Project (EIP, IDA Grants H2360, H2560, and H5050) was approved in June 2006 and the second
major IDA-funded reconstruction operation in Liberia following the end of the war period. AIDP
was prepared as an emergency operation under the Bank’s OP 8.00 for Rapid Response to Crises
and Emergencies. The situation in Liberia justified this approach as the OP 8.00 objectives
include: (a) rebuilding and restoring physical assets; and (b) restoring the means of production and
economic activities. In the determination of the project scope and activities to be prepared, the
project built on the work carried out under the Technical Assistance (TA) project financed by Trust
Fund for Liberia (TFLIB), which carried out a comprehensive infrastructure needs assessment
identifying critical emergency works. Of these urgent needs, the Bank agreed with the GOL to
focus on a short-term program of road rehabilitation, restoration of potable water supply, labor-
intensive public works, and critical repairs of port and airport infrastructure. On the agricultural
aspects, project preparation benefited from the integrated approach to agricultural development,
which was a central component of the Liberia Agricultural Initiative (LAI), to which other
development partners were providing parallel financing. The proposed activities related to
revitalizing agriculture focused on the priorities identified by CAAS-Lib (a joint analytical work
carried out in 2006-2007 by the MOA, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Bank,
and International Fund for Agricultural Development) and contributed to the overall Program for
Food Security developed by the MOA. The project was therefore well founded in the initial
analytical work of the post-conflict era in Liberia.
34.    Although lessons learnt and reflected in the project design are not explicitly stated in the
Project Paper, (PP) the write up is nuanced with references to experiences elsewhere that were
incorporated in the project design. The following key lessons are derived from the project paper:
       Participatory approach to the selection of feeder roads in areas selected to benefit from
        agriculture productivity interventions, which potentially eliminates the risk of adverse
        selection of roads;
       The use of farmers and farmer based groups to effectively organize and coordinate
        production and marketing activities based on a similar approach on the Sierra Leone Rural
        and Private Sector Development Project;
       Maximization of synergies between agriculture productivity interventions and other
        infrastructure investments to achieve maximum impact of financing; and
       Intense hands-on technical support to the borrower is required in fragile environments.
35.     Quality at entry was not formally assessed by the Bank. However, the roll out of
implementation suggests that the quality of entry was high. The project became effective in a
relatively short period (within 6 weeks of Bank Board approval), emphasizing the readiness to kick
start implementation rapidly under the emergency conditions. The resources expended by the
Bank on key technical expertise to design the project, which covered technical and policy issues
in-depth in infrastructure and agriculture, was also appreciable.


                                             8 
36.      Assessment of the project design. The PDO was relevant and responsive to the needs of
Liberia in the early post-conflict era. It was defined to be broad and allowed a certain degree of
flexibility to accommodate emergent needs of the emergency operation. The components were
simple and well aligned with the development objective. The sectoral interventions identified were
in critical need of restoration or reform. As noted in Paragraph 33, the initial postwar studies
prioritized the needs and provided the guidance for selection of project activities.
37.      The scope was highly ambitious when compared to the modest financial resources
available for the project. From the point of view of implementation, the project was complex due
to its multi-sectoral nature involving agriculture, roads, water, sanitation and ports, and the
challenge of effective coordination of the project across these sectors. The capacity of the
implementing agencies was assessed to be weak, and the project design made provision for
capacity building in the SIU and the use of specialized agencies such as IITA and FAO for
implementing significant agriculture sub-components to reduce the burden of implementation on
the Ministry of Agriculture. Furthermore, the use of the FBOs was incorporated in the design to
ensure structured transfer of farming knowledge to beneficiaries. Therefore, the proposed
implementation arrangements were adequate and had taken into consideration the need to take
mitigation action to augment project implementation. The design did acknowledge the limitations
of a weak institutional environment in decision-making, and made provision for the development
of critical policies and strategies to shape the future direction of Government, which is critical for
sustainability of interventions. The project monitoring indicators were relatively simple and linked
directly from the interventions proposed. Nevertheless, one indicator for rural accessibility (rural
population within 2 km of an all season road), which is a core transport sector indicator, was
included despite the lack of baseline data. This indicator proved difficult to monitor because of
capacity constraints and the unit of measure was subsequently revised.
38.    The project preparation envisaged co-financing by one partner, the EC. Preparation of the
EC component, which focused on water and roads, was still in progress at the time of appraisal
and was expected to be completed by September 2007. This added to the complexity of the design
because activities could not be considered as one package, and had an impact on implementation
focus.
39.     Government commitment was satisfactory. Broadly, the government agreed with the need
to establish key policies for the management of the sectors and facilitated discussions on the key
policies to be addressed under the project. At the level of the presidency, there was a strong focus
on the need to transform the port sector as a whole and particularly at the port of Monrovia, as
efficiency had been hampered by noticeable mismanagement and misguided policies. A
Presidential Delivery Unit (PDU) was also created to monitor and track development projects in
Liberia, particularly in the infrastructure sector. The relatively short duration of project
preparation under emergency conditions and the cooperation received from the multi-sector
stakeholder groups is credited to government commitment.
40.     With a high degree of relevance, good donor coordination, high government commitment
and a simple but ambitious design, adequate implementation arrangements and minor drawbacks
in the results framework, the overall project design is considered reasonably sound.

41.     Assessment of risks. Project risks taken into account during preparation were: (i) risk of
political unrest and social upheaval; (ii) inadequacy of internal controls in Government systems,


                                              9 
(iii) risk of failure to achieve the project development objectives; and (iv) political resistance to
institutional reforms and policy implementation.

42.     The first risk is of a global nature to the project, and could not be addressed within the
project scope. Strengthening the existing SIU with experienced procurement and contract
management specialists mitigated the second risk. The third risk was deemed moderate on account
of the number of activities being adequately spread across sectors to elicit a more than average
level of performance. The proposed mitigation of the fourth risk included phasing of the reform
process, if needed, and strong government commitment.
43.     Overall, the task team did not assess project risks adequately; for instance, the Task Team
failed to identify the critical risk that poor coordination with the co-financier could impact delivery
despite the fact that the co-financed component was still under preparation at the time of Board
approval of AIDP. The proposed mitigation measures for the identified risks were appropriate
even though, in the post-conflict environment, difficulties were bound to be experienced in their
implementation, as was also seen from the difficulties experienced in strengthening the technical
capacity of SIU over the project period.

2.2 Implementation

44.     The project was appraised in June 2007 and approved by the board on July 31, 2007. It was
declared effective on September 11, 2007, after complying with all requirements needed to declare
the effectiveness of the Financing Agreement. The following were the main factors that affected
implementation.

45.     Mid-Term Review: The mid-term review (MTR) was held from September to October
2008, just one year after project effectiveness, as part of the MTR for the entire transport portfolio,
which was being managed in a programmatic manner. At this time, the Emergency Infrastructure
Project (EIP) and the EIP Supplemental Component were also under implementation and the
URIRP was under preparation. All these projects were under the management of the SIU.
Therefore its limited capacity was stretched thin. Furthermore, the planned capacity building of
the SIU has not materialized due to poor responses to requests for consultancy services for both
firms and individuals to provide technical assistance for project management. The Bank, as
anticipated at appraisal, had to engage in intense hands-on implementation support to help build
the capacity of the SIU, including the provision of technical specialists in the field to augment the
intense and frequent implementation support missions.

46.     The MTR recommended the restructuring of implementation arrangements to replace the
SIU with an autonomous IIU with international management. This was critical to achieve the
needed skills mix required for managing the rapidly evolving program of donor projects being
implemented by the MPW. The main incentive was international-level salaries for prospective
project staff with suitable qualifications. The Government showed strong commitment to ensure
a successful transition to the new arrangements, however, as noted above, and notwithstanding the
change in approach, the capacity build-up was slow due to difficulties attracting the right caliber
of professionals to Liberia to occupy the positions fielded.

47.     Weak Project Management Capacity. Project Management was initially under the remit
of the SIU. A year into the project, there was a restructuring of the unit to transform it into an IIU,


                                              10  
responsible for managing all donor-funded projects as a program. Anticipated capacity
strengthening did not unfold as expected. Though a program manager was successfully hired, a
host of other positions went through a long speculative period of procurement before they could
be filled. Coordination of all project activities was also problematic. MPW, in charge of the EC
roads component, made slow progress and the agriculture component, with only one staff seconded
from MOA to IIU, was also experiencing significant delays. While IDA continued to assist with
intense hands on support to the IIU, a decision was made by MPW to bring on board the
International Labor Organization (ILO) to handle the roads sub-component financed by the EC.
Following a joint assessment of project implementation, IIU transferred responsibility of the
agriculture sector activities to the Project Management Unit (PMU) that had been set up at the
MOA with a separate designated account for the AIDP agriculture activities. This would ensure
close follow up on the implementation of the agriculture productivity interventions.
48.     Delays in procurement: Particular reference is made to the agricultural component, rural
road rehabilitation (co-financed by EC), and the port activities. Start-up of agriculture activities
under the project was delayed significantly. This was due to failure of the identified agriculture
implementing agency, IITA, which had been sole-sourced, to come up with a good proposal for
the execution of the proposed agriculture sector activities; on the rural roads, the MPW, which
retained responsibility for implementation, lacked the capacity to move the project activities
forward. When the project was restructured, provision was made to bring on board two additional
implementing partners in the agriculture sector, the World Food Program (WFP) and AFRICARE,
to minimize the risk of failure of the procurement process and utilize project funds in a more
targeted way. The implementation of the port infrastructure, i.e. the rehabilitation of the oil jetty,
was also delayed due to the inability to attract qualified international consultants to complete the
feasibility studies in the first instance. Even when it was completed, the procurement of a
contractor also failed; by this time it was apparent that the activity could not be funded under the
project due to lack of funds arising from cost overruns on other sub-components, and the activity
was consequently dropped from the project.

49.     Delay in EC co-financing. The emergency project paper approved by the Board on July
31, 2007 indicated that an EC Grant to co-finance the project was under preparation and was
expected in September 2007. While the IDA funds became effective on September 11, 2007, the
trust fund Administration Agreement for the EC grant was signed on February 23, 2009. The trust
fund was activated on August 4, 2009 but Grant Agreement TF96385, to the Government of
Liberia, was signed on July 20, 2010, almost a year later. The delay in signing of the Grant
Agreement left only 11 months for procurement and implementation of the targeted activities. The
closing date for the grant was therefore extended from June 30, 2011 to July 31, 2012. The Grant
agreement was also amended to include retroactive financing to the tune of US$1,519,309.94
equivalent for eligible expenditures incurred on or after February 15, 2010.

50.     Due to implementation delays, the Government of Liberia, in April 2013, requested
extension of the Closing Date of Grant TF96385 by another year to enable the planned activities
in the water and road sectors to be completed; however, the request was turned down by the EC
due to the limitation on availability of the EC grant as a result of closure of the European
Development Fund (EDF) by December 31, 2012. In order to allow the Client to utilize as much
of the balance funds as possible, IDA proposed to EC to repost the expenditure of US$1.5 million,
which had been spent on rehabilitation of rural roads in the Bong, Nimba and Lofa counties under


                                             11  
the IDA funded URIRP during the grant period, to Grant TF96385. The EC considered the
proposal and indicated that eligibility requirements were satisfied, and therefore agreed to the
reposting. Under the circumstances, it was not possible to fully utilize the EC grant on project
activities. A refund was triggered in November 2011 on account of wrongly booked expenses. An
uncommitted balance of US$3.8 million was also cancelled from the EC co-financing, and some
incomplete activities had to be shifted to IDA for completion.

51.     Food for work and cash for work incentives. The first additional financing of US$3.0
million was part of an overall emergency food crisis response program that provided additional
grant to a community empowerment project (US$3.0 million) as well as a grant for food support
for vulnerable women and children (US$4.0 million). The design incorporated food for work and
cash for work incentives as a means of getting the populace to return to agriculture and mitigating
hunger. This incentive was a new approach to the agricultural productivity interventions that
worked positively and was well embraced within the communities where they were implemented.
The significant achievement of increased land cultivation is partly attributable to this strategic
change.

52.     Outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease. The outbreak of EVD from August 2014 till its
subsidence in April 2015 impacted implementation of the remaining project activities at the time
to a large degree, including the testing of high lift pumps installed at the White Plains treatment
plant, food value chain development activities, as well as a community grain storage facility.

53.     At the time of the outbreak the agriculture activities had picked up and were on course for
completion. The outbreak resulted in decimation of the workforce and abandonment of farms for
fear of the disease. Thus, though the total land available to be cultivated could not be fully
rehabilitated and utilized due to EVD, the expected yield was met (98% achievement).
Achievement of the targeted yield despite the impact of EVD can be attributed to higher than
expected yields per hectare as a result of project interventions (improved rice varieties and
adoption of lowland cultivation practices). Though the farm rehabilitation target was far less than
expected, achievement of the targeted yield is a remarkable success of the agriculture intervention.

54.      The outbreak of EVD also impacted the supply, installation testing, and commissioning of
high lift pumps for the White Plains treatment plant, as well as pumps and generators for the
Newport and Caldwell booster stations. With all elements in place, testing of the provided
facilities was delayed till January 2015 on account of the reluctance of the supplier to mobilize
staff under the conditions of EVD in Liberia.

2.2 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

55.      Design. The original design had five PDO-level indicators and 11 intermediate results
indicators. The project indicators selected were simple, focused, and relevant, with the indicators
directly derived from achievement of project activities. The core indicator for rural accessibility,
i.e. “increased access to an all season road for targeted rural population”, was relevant but difficult
to measure. The government lacked a baseline measurement of this indicator at the time of
appraisal. The PDO indicator for “increased number of markets where rice seed is available” was
rather ambiguous. Also, the water investments indicator “Increased access to water for residents
of Monrovia” was wrongly described even though the correct unit of measurement (millions of


                                              12  
gallons/day) for measuring the intended project achievement (daily production of water) was used.
Combining “production of rice and cassava” in a single indicator was also problematic and
undesirable in terms of measurement. The PDO target levels were generally realistic, while the
intermediate outcome indicators were mostly of a qualitative nature, which could easily be
monitored. The indicators, while clearly linked to the PDO, had some shortcomings in regards to
measurement and attribution of achievements.

56.    While the design of the results framework suffered from some shortcomings, the PDO on
the other hand was well aligned to the country’s post-conflict needs. The flexibility of the PDO
allowed subsequent project restructuring to modify the results framework and fine tune the
descriptions of the intended outcomes as needed to reflect the changing realities.

57.     Implementation. The selected transport indicators were collected on a regular basis by
staff of the SIU/IIU as the implementation of the project activities progressed, and were
disseminated in quarterly progress reports. On the agriculture component, the implementing
partners who came in after the additional financing effectively organized the data collection on an
annual basis. Each implementing partner in the agriculture sector monitored progress by preparing
monthly reports with inputs from community based organizations in a fairly robust set up with
technical audits of the results. Thus though there were delays in implementation, the data collected
was relevant.

58.     Additional financing and restructuring of the project necessitated some changes to the
results framework. Three of the original outcome indicators to measure agriculture productivity
were dropped to remove the ambiguous indicator described above and to reflect a shift in focus
from cassava and cocoa to rice. The changes in scope and focus on rice meant that new indicators
had to be added to the outcome indicators to focus on rice production and yield, while the
intermediate outcomes needed to include new indicators to reflect the outputs of the rice
productivity interventions (community grain storage constructed or rehabilitated, foundation seed
produced and distributed, and rice land cultivated in project areas, and small scale irrigation
schemes rehabilitated in project areas). The remaining indicators were either continued with
revisions to make them more targeted or dropped because they had been achieved. It is noteworthy
that a substantial amount of project funding was targeted at the Monrovia-Buchanan corridor at
the time of restructuring, and the project would have benefited from monitoring of an outcome
such as reduced travel time along the corridor.

59.      Utilization. The infrastructure components were relatively simple as they are linked to
distinct outputs and did not require anything more than a rudimentary monitoring mechanism. The
major impact is the establishment of a streamlined mechanism for monitoring of such data within
IIU as projects are formulated. However, as noted earlier, the monitoring of the core indicator was
an issue because of lack of capacity within the sector and was subsequently dropped. On hindsight,
it is noted that an attempt at establishing a framework for its monitoring would have served for the
longer-term needs for determination of the accessibility of road infrastructure. For the port sector
in particular, the number of moves per crane continues to be monitored by the NPA, as it is linked
to how investments are made by the concessionaire to improve efficiency. Also the indicator for
production of water is easily measured at the White Plains Treatment Plant, where the newly
installed high-lift pumps are fitted with instruments for measuring the potable water, which is
pumped after production.


                                            13  
60.     As part of project funding, a sector-wide monitoring and evaluation mechanism was put in
place within the PMU for monitoring outcomes in the agriculture sector. This system continues to
work for other projects under implementation. Continuous monitoring of the project outcomes
beyond the completion of project activities is therefore in place and is serving as good information
for policy-making in the agriculture sector. The Monrovia port also routinely monitors the
efficiency of container movement at the port.

2.3 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

61.     Safeguards. AIDP was classified as a Category B project for environmental purposes and
triggered OP/BP/GP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment). At the time of appraisal the environmental
and social impacts of most AIDP activities had already been assessed and disclosed under the EIP
and LIRP projects. The exceptions were the Vai Town Bridge and the agriculture investments.
Per the provisions of OP 10.00, assessment of the environmental and social impacts of these
activities could be deferred to the implementation phase. OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement
was anticipated for the Vai Town Bridge pending confirmation of the bridge designs. The
following instruments were disclosed in-country and at the Info Shop: Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) for water sector projects (prepared under an African Development
Bank (AfDB) project); Environmental Mitigation Plan associated with Implementation of
Emergency works for the Monrovia-Buchanan Corridor and Gate 15 to Guinea Border Road;
Environmental Management Plan for Repair of Rural and Urban Roads in General; Environmental
Management Plan & Resettlement Management Plan for the construction of a bridge replacing the
collapsed/failed old bridge at Vai Town, Monrovia. Overall, the project complied with the
requirements of all safeguards policies and is therefore rated satisfactory.

62.     Financial Management. Financial management arrangements were adequate. The PFMU
was adequately staffed with qualified and experienced financial management specialists
throughout implementation. Project cost updates were maintained in a robust manner. The
project’s audited accounts were submitted in a timely manner and the audit reports were of
acceptable quality. Accounting was generally satisfactory for implementing partners who were
using UN rules of engagement. The exception is ILO, which was contracted under EC co-financing
for the implementation of rural roads. The closure of the EC co-financing was delayed on account
of difficulties reconciling the expenditures of ILO on the project. At the time of closure of the EC
grant, on July 31, 2012, the IIU failed to indicate to ILO to stop project activities. ILO therefore
claimed expenses incurred beyond the closing date of the grant till the time of notification by IIU,
i.e. September 27, 2012. The outstanding amount of US$115,574.34 was recorded by the EC as
an ineligible expenditure and has since been refunded by the GOL (as communicated via letter
dated November 9, 2015). While the project financial management processes and systems were
well in place and maintained during implementation, the issues relating to the closure of the EC
co-financing and the delays thereof on account of reconciliation of ILO’s expenditures justify a
financial management rating of moderately satisfactory. 

63.    Procurement. The procurement activities of the AIDP project were carried out as planned.
Performance was moderately satisfactory with several quality reviews necessitated prior to
clearance of procurement documents. A review of post procurement activities was conducted
during review meetings, which generally showed that procurement processes were carried out in
accordance with the Legal Agreement/PAD, the World Bank procurement and consultant’s


                                            14  
guidelines and the procurement plan. Steady progress was made during the project on record
keeping, post procurement review (PPR) findings, and compliance with procurement procedures
guidelines.  

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

64.    A number of interventions are already in place to support or scale up completed activities
and extend their impact beyond the life of the project. Some project activities that could not be
implemented have been better defined and taken up for financing by donors, including IDA.

65.    Ports. The construction of a new oil jetty is now financed by the Bank-funded Urban and
Rural Infrastructure Development Project (URIRP, Credit 5351; Grants IDA-H4780, H6040, and
Trust Fund Grants TF94353, TF98040, and TF16065).

66.     Water. Other donors are currently making interventions to continue with the activities in
the water sector that could not be funded by IDA. Full rehabilitation of the White Plains Water
Treatment Plant and a 36 inch, 21 km transmission pipeline from the Plant to Paynesville Red
Light in Monrovia is currently financed under an AfDB grant for an Urban Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (UWSSP).

67.    Roads. Experiences derived from this project have already been incorporated in the current
transport sector project, i.e. URIRP, and Liberia Road Asset Management Project (LIBRAMP,
IDA Credits 4950 and 5167 and Trust Fund Grant TF99588).

68.     Agriculture. Investment in revival of cocoa cultivation, which was dropped from the
agriculture interventions, is now being financed by IDA under the Smallholder Tree Crop
Revitalization Project (IDA Credit 5101) mentioned earlier. The cassava and rice production is
also continued under the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Project (WAAPP).
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

69.      The relevance of objectives is rated high. The project’s overall objective of supporting the
Government of Liberia to re-establish basic infrastructure and revive agricultural activities is as
relevant now as it was at appraisal. The project objective is fully consistent with the key
development priorities that remain for Liberia today. The government’s Agenda for
Transformation (AfT) is organized around five pillars: (i) Peace, Justice, Security and Rule of
Law; (ii) Economic Transformation; (iii) Human Development; (iv) Governance and Public
Institutions; and (v) Cross Cutting Issues. The World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (FY13-
FY17) (CPS) is aligned with the Pillar II, III and IV of the AfT. AIDP focused on addressing three
focal areas consistent with these strategies (i): Economic Transformation to reduce constraints to
rapid, broad-based and sustained economic growth to create employment; (ii) Human
Development to increase access and quality of basic social services and reducing vulnerability;
and (iii) Governance and Public Sector Institutions to improve public sector and natural resources
governance. The project objective therefore contributes to all three pillars of both the AfT and the



                                             15  
CPS. Both transport and agriculture subsectors continue to be of high relevance in the strategy
documents.

70.      The relevance of design is also high. The project components and implementation
arrangements were consistent with the project’s stated objectives. The design also responded well
to the strategic objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Furthermore, the components
were well aligned with the relevant sector institutions and delivery responsibility was delegated to
those agencies with the appropriate motivation to ensure implementation of the proposed activities.
The nature of the design allowed for scaling-up of interventions such as was seen in the agriculture
sector when the food crisis situation was deteriorating in Liberia. The results framework was
designed to capture all the sectoral interventions to a large extent, although results were not defined
for monitoring the outcomes of policy reform and capacity building activities. While the number
of institutions and implementing partners (including the co-financier) involved made
implementation challenging from a coordination point of view, this does diminish the high degree
of relevance of the project’s design.

71.     Relevance of implementation is also high. The Bank’s implementation assistance was
responsive to changing needs on the ground. For example, the Task team prepared US$3.0 million
additional financing grant for scaling up the agricultural interventions under the project on account
of a food crisis emergency response to Liberia. This was done ten months after board approval of
the original project.  

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial

72.     The AIDP largely achieved its development objective of supporting the Government's
efforts in re-establishing basic infrastructure and in reviving the agriculture activities. Key
infrastructure has been established and made a substantial contribution to the improvement of life
in Liberia in general and Monrovia city in particular. An increase in the amount of potable water
produced and available to Liberians has been achieved, from two million gallons per day (MG/D)
at project inception to six MG/D. The project constructed a new Vai Town Bridge, a key piece of
infrastructure in the city of Monrovia that ensures continued access to the city (the bridge collapsed
during the construction period). A major highway between Monrovia and Roberts International
Airport (Monrovia–Cotton tree corridor) including selected links in Monrovia (totaling 83km) has
been successfully rehabilitated. The project has also made substantial contributions to the
wellbeing of the beneficiaries and local economy, particularly in the ports and agriculture sectors.
Improved port efficiency has resulted in increased willingness to do business (import and export)
to and from Liberia, with concomitant effects on the national economy. Expansion in rural
incomes and provision of skills for strengthening agriculture value chains through support for
FBOs in both production and marketing was also significant outcome. There were significant
increases in yields from the lowlands, reduced hunger from increased production and Food for
Work incentives.

73.    The achievement of the PDO is examined in the light of agreed outcome indicators as
below. It must be noted that two indicators at the PDO level for increased port productivity and
increased access to an all season road were achieved earlier on in the project implementation and



                                              16  
subsequently dropped from monitoring of the results in accordance with established practice to
cease monitoring completed indicators.

(a)     Port productivity increased. The outcome of the port component was to achieve
increased port productivity. With the successful concessioning of the port to a landlord model, a
private operator is now investing and improving the port operations and the result is seen in the
increased number of moves per hour at the port, from 3 moves/crane at project inception to the
current 17 moves per crane, reducing queuing and improving port efficiency.

(b)    Increased access to an all season road. The project contributed to the construction of the
83km Monrovia-Cotton Tree corridor to asphaltic concrete finish. This has opened up the corridor
by way of the availability of increased access to an all season road which impacts on the economic
development along the corridor.

(c)     Daily production of treated water in Monrovia (MG/D). The project targeted a
production of 8 million gallons per day (MG/D) of water at the White Plains Treatment plant; 6
MG/D was achieved, i.e. 75 percent achievement. The supply and installation of two high lift
pumps and generators at White Plains and two pumps and generators to the Newport and Caldwell
booster stations was successfully completed, as was the rehabilitation of the Newport, Caldwell,
and Ducor reservoirs, contributing to the increase in capacity to supply water. The impact is
limited, though, because of weaknesses in the water distribution network that prevent water from
getting into the reservoirs for supply (by gravity) to Monrovia. Effectively, the water gets only to
Paynesville from the water treatment plant (WTP), and though the pumps are capable of delivering
water under pressure at high speed, the poor condition of the distribution network does not allow
the water to get to the reservoirs at Newport and Caldwell for onward distribution to Monrovia.
That notwithstanding, the production capacity is available and water regularly finds its way into
Monrovia and its environs via small-scale water supply operators.

(b)     Total rice production in Bong and Lofa counties increased. This performance indicator
measured the impact of the agricultural productivity interventions by measuring increased
production of the main staple food in Liberia, which is rice. There was no baseline at the beginning
of the project, but it can be inferred from the post conflict situation at appraisal that production
was at best on subsistence level. The project achievement of 132,408 was slightly less than the

                                                            
8 The indicator was reported as the increase in the number of kilometers of all season road available to the target population. The
rehabilitation of the Monrovia-Buchanan corridor (83 km) is therefore reported here.


                                                               17  
target of 134,808 metric tons (MT) by 2,400 MT. This is regarded as a substantial achievement,
which helped to improve food security in Liberia.
(b)     Rice yield on beneficiary farms. Achievement of this performance indicator is about 69
percent more than the targeted yield on the average. Seed multiplication was carried out by
AFRICARE/Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI) to provide about 20 MT of foundation
seed to farmers who had been organized into FBOs in Bong, Lofa, Gbarpolu and Bomi counties.
The production of seed was supplemented by training of farmers in various techniques for
increasing productivity on farms, as well as the construction of irrigation schemes in the lowland
farming areas. The reported yield was from lowland farms in the where NERICA L19, NERICA
14, SUAKOKO 8 and AROMATIC rice varieties were provided to farmers. Before the project
interventions, yield was averaging less than one (1.2) MT/hectare (ha) for lowland rice. Average
rice yield per hectare achieved under the project was 2.5 MT/ha in Lofa County and 3 MT/ha in
Bong County while 2.43 and 2.33 MT/ha was achieved in Gbarbolu and Bomi Counties,
respectively.
74.    The achievement of the intermediate outcome indicators which contributed overall to the
achievement of the agreed outcome indicators, including those that were achieved and dropped
from monitoring, is also discussed below:

75.     The revised intermediate outcomes were focused on the infrastructure, i.e. roads/bridges
and water, as well as the agriculture interventions. Overall the intermediate outcome indicators
for the roads and water infrastructure were fully achieved. Refurbishment of the water treatment
plant at White Plains to a level of 50 percent contributed significantly to the 6.0 MG/D daily


                                                     18  
production of treated water at the treatment plant. The New Vai Town bridge was also successfully
built and officially commissioned on December 30, 2011; 25 out of 30 targeted minor river
crossings were also improved by installation of bailey bridges

76.     The intermediate outcome indicators for the agriculture sector were also substantially
achieved. With the exception of the small-scale irrigation schemes and the area of land for rice
rehabilitation, which fell short of the expected target by a fairly significant margin, all other
indicators (for grain storage and production of foundation seeds) were fully achieved. These also
contributed to the overall rice production in Bong and Lofa counties as well as the improved yield
of rice per acre on the beneficiary farms.

77.    Although the focus of AIDP shifted towards rice, the initial efforts of AIDP at developing
new cassava varieties were continued under the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program
APL (WAAPP-1C, IDA Credit 4883) which has resulted in eight new cassava varieties currently
being cultivated by outgrowers.

78.     On the policy and management side, the Draft National Transport Policy and Strategy
paper was formulated ahead of the scheduled completion date of December 2009 and, following
this, a National Transport plan was adopted in 2012. The establishment of an external port
management team was also achieved by February 2011 after a delay of about a year, nevertheless
a significant achievement in the annals of the NPA.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

79.     In line with the Bank’s operational policy for emergency operations, OP 8.00, a
conventional economic and financial analysis was not undertaken at appraisal because the
conditions in Liberia at the time of appraisal and the emergency nature of the project simply did
not lend themselves to rigorous financial and economic analysis. Under the circumstances,
efficiency is judged on the manner in which implementation was carried out, and cost comparison
of identifiable infrastructure. (See Annex 3.) In light of the several delays in implementation
observed, specifically delays related to the procurement process and the processing of the EC grant
for co-financing of the project, efficiency is rated modest.
80.     Operational and administrative efficiency. Looking at efficiency from an operational
and administrative perspective, it is clear that further factors need to be taken into account. The
project was originally scheduled to close on December 31, 2011, i.e. four years and five months
after Board approval. The project eventually closed eight years after Board approval. This was
largely due to major delays initiating some components.
81.      The agriculture component was delayed for three years because IITA, which was sole-
sourced for implementation of the tree crops value chain activities, lacked the capacity and
capability to fulfill the overall coordinating and management role even though it is a recognized
institution in conducting successful programs in value chain development. Eventually this
component was dropped and WFP and AfricaRice had to be recruited to focus on the food crops.

82.    The Grant Agreement for the EC grant was signed on July 20, 2010, three years after Board
approval of the project. The delay in signing of the Grant Agreement left only 11 months for


                                            19  
procurement and implementation of the targeted activities. The closing date for the grant was
therefore extended from June 30, 2011 to July 31, 2012. In the meantime, IDA funding had taken
up some of the EC grant responsibilities in the water sector, pending effectiveness of the grant,
and provision had to be made for retroactive financing of those activities under the Grant
Agreement. The EC Grant Agreement was amended to allow retroactive financing and
US$1,519,309.94 equivalent was reposted to the EC grant for eligible expenditures incurred on or
after February 15, 2010. Furthermore, the EC activities could not be implemented beyond July
31, 2012 due to a decision of the EC to not extend the Trust Fund from which the grant funds
came. Therefore, delayed EC-funded activities in the roads sector could not be implemented. With
EC approval, some IDA-funded expenses for primary laterite roads in Bong and Lofa counties
(which were consistent with the PDO of AIDP) were reposted to the EC grant in order to make
maximum use of the grant funds. Such posting, reposting, and adjustment of expenditures
contributed overall to operational efficiency but reflected administrative inefficiency arising from
the delays in signing the grant agreement.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.     This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) for this operation does not use
a disbursement-weighted rating for the PDO. This decision is based primarily on the fact that the
PDO remained the same throughout the project. In addition, revisions of the indicators were done
to provide clarity and targets were revised upward to reflect the scaling-up of activities. Taking
into consideration the high relevance of the PDO, the project design and implementation, as well
as the achievement of the project objectives and modest efficiency, the overall project outcome is
rated moderately satisfactory. Three out of the five key indicators selected in the lifetime of the
project fully achieved their targets (i.e. port productivity, rice production and rice yield). The
target for water production was 75 percent achieved while the target for increased access to an all
season road is considered reasonable and substantial (83km of Monrovia-Cotton tree corridor
rehabilitated) though no target was set during appraisal.. These achievements were within
reasonable budget and modest efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

   (i) Poverty impact and gender. Poverty and food insecurity are high across the country and
       particularly acute in Liberia’s rural areas. The government-led 2012 Comprehensive Food
       Security and Nutrition Survey (CFSNS) found that every fifth household in Liberia is food
       insecure, with the highest rates found in Bomi (55 percent), Grand Kru (46 percent), and
       River Cess (45 percent) counties. Food insecurity and poverty are strongly correlated, as
       poor rural households with informal livelihoods tend to be the most food insecure. The
       project greatly contributed to reducing food insecurity in Liberia as it helped to increase
       agricultural productivity, which simultaneously improved the livelihoods of vulnerable
       youth and women by providing their basic social needs. As it aimed at promoting the
       production of quality and sufficient planting materials for the Liberian farming population,
       the project helped provide essential inputs - including knowledge - to scale-up production
       and rebuild physical marketing infrastructure such as market places and post-harvest
       handling facilities (concentrating on cocoa, coffee, food crops and vegetable production).


                                              20  
       The project had substantially positive impacts on women, particularly in the agriculture
       activities. Women constitute a dominant force in the rural communities. 80 FBO’s, with a
       combined membership of 2,000, were engaged in the project in Bong and Lofa Counties
       and 60 percent of these participating FBOs’ members were women. The project trained
       community and beneficiary female group members in rice post-harvest handling and
       processing using training methodology and modules that were adapted to the context of the
       target participants. Through its strong capacity building focus, the project left behind
       communities with tremendous knowledge and learning to undertake similar initiatives on
       their own.

   (ii) Impact on incomes of farmer based organizations. The improved business climate for
       farmers enabled the establishment of Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLAs) under
       the management of three executives. In Bomi County, for example, the VSLA of the FBO
       sold surplus of the rice produced in 2013 and opened a bank account with the proceeds
       worth about US$800 (LR$75,000). These proceeds are used to purchase farm implements
       for group farming, or are given out as loans to members, payable by harvest from the
       member’s farming plots in the next season.

   (iii) Collaboration between MOA and local farmers. As part of agricultural productivity
       interventions, collaboration between MOA and local farmers was reorganized through the
       FBOs. This strategy was adopted in order to increase the production and sales of quality
       rice seed and strengthen market oriented FBOs.

   (iv) Improved Citizen-Government relations. The project, with its broad coverage of activities
       across several sectors, may be said to have improved the relations between citizens and
       government. The provision of jobs, access to social amenities, training in agriculture as a
       livelihood and other impacts, such as reconstruction of Agricultural Extensions, have all
       contributed to better relations between the citizenry and government. In light of the decline
       in the government’s legitimacy during the war period, the government’s ability to
       effectively deliver agricultural programs in rural areas is a significant accomplishment in
       Liberia’s post-conflict development.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

84.     Ports. The successful concessioning of the ports to a private sector operator represents a
landmark achievement for the Freeport of Monrovia and Liberia at large. The improvements in
port productivity are already evident. Additional investments will be made by the concessionaire
to continue with port improvement and efficiency at determined benchmarks over the 25-year
period.

85.    MPW and local contractors - Under the rural road investments funded by the EC co-
financing grant, three (3) engineers of the MPW were trained as trainers in labor-based road
building technology. Twenty-four MPW staff completed training under ILO in feeder roads and
drainage design, while three representatives each from twenty local contractors were trained in
labor based methods in Road Rehabilitation based on a 1.9 km pilot section from Bensonville to
Low Cost village. Training of community based groups for maintenance of roads could not be
accomplished due to closure of EC funds.


                                            21  
86.    LWSC – following the supply of Transformer at White Plains Treatment Plant for High
Lift Pumps, 20 technicians were trained in the operations and maintenance of the pumps.

87.     IIU and PFMU – The project continued to provide incremental support to these units,
including recruitment of key and support staff in procurement and financial management. Despite
all challenges, IIU and PFMU have built capacity over time, handled their work-load well, and are
counted amongst the better performing entities in the government.

88.     Ministry of Agriculture - The implementation coordination capacity of the supervising
Ministry of Agriculture and its agencies was strengthened by the project as evidenced by the
project support to the Ministry’s PMU and the Central Agricultural Research Institute. The project
provided support for the staffing of the PMU including Project Director, Financial Manager, and
Procurement Specialist. A web based M&E system was also developed and has evolved into a
single framework for monitoring of all projects. About 20 professionals have been trained in
various aspects of seed multiplication technology and seed genetics at CARI. The intervention
provided the national staff of MOA and CARI, as well as local government, the opportunity to
improve the living standard of the vulnerable communities. This exercise led to improved
production, ability to market assets, and increased income.

89.     Farmer Based Organizations - Building the capacity of farmers’ organizations was very
important aspect of the project. Farmer field schools were conducted under the project to teach
and demonstrate improved farming techniques, utilization of the improved low cost technology
(rice planter, row weeder, threshers, etc.) for rice production, as well as post-harvest technology
for preservation of food. Business and marketing skills were also disseminated at such workshops.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

90.     Establishment of Community Grain Reserves (CGRs) built by the project played a vital
role in providing first response to the hunger crisis precipitated by the Ebola Crisis in Liberia.
Many people who had migrated from the areas that were hard hit by the virus turned to the
areas/counties where CGRs were in place to seek food and shelter. This played a major role in
stemming potential nutrition related deaths during the Ebola crisis.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

91.     A beneficiary survey was conducted during the ICR mission to interact with the
beneficiaries and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the agriculture productivity
interventions with the view to understand how they had been impacted by the project. The
beneficiaries were very satisfied with the support they had received from the project. Significant
positive impacts were reported on livelihoods and household incomes, crop cultivation habits, food
self-sufficiency and capacity building aspects of the project intervention. Interviews were also
held with the other key stakeholders, i.e. MOA, WFP, AFRICARE, FAO, and the local NGOs who
were involved in sensitization and training of FBOs. All the stakeholders expressed the need for
the government of Liberia to assume ownership of the project after the closing date for it to be
sustainable.

92.    Change in community crop cultivation habits. Traditionally, farming in Liberia has been
principally on higher ground. The valleys, though well watered all year round, are seen as difficult

                                            22  
to cultivate, culturally. Through intensive sensitization campaigns carried out in beneficiary
communities by NGOs rice cultivation was adopted in the low lands. This enabled at last two
harvests per year and increased the benefits and profits. The use of FBOs brought about some
cohesion in the communities, with benefits of increased productivity accruing to the groups.

93.     Improved livelihoods and household incomes. There was a dramatic increase in the
livelihoods of beneficiaries participating in the project, mainly due to the cash and food for work
programs at the initial stages of the project, in which individuals were paid to help prepare farms
for planting. Through the supply of seed varieties to farmers a majority of households were able
to plant, harvest, and keep seeds for the next season, and sell the surplus. This culminated in
increased incomes for the beneficiary households. With an increase in income levels, some of the
households have embarked on facelift programs and acquisition of personal farming assets such
as pumps for irrigation of farms, farm implements, etc.

94.      Improved food self-sufficiency. The project helped beneficiaries accumulate enough
foodstuffs from the 2013 and 2014 season and, as a result, most beneficiaries were able to save
money that would have been used to purchase food for use for other purposes, such as expenditure
on their children’s education and health care for members of their households. Incidentally, the
outbreak of EVD brought about heavy reliance on the food reserves in the community grain storage
facilities, as many people from affected areas started to migrate in search of food and safety from
the disease. To a large extent, this food self-sufficiency helped to stem the tide of nutrition related
deaths during the EVD outbreak.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

95.     The risk to development outcomes and sustainability of project benefits is rated significant,
given the number of issues that are likely to impact the development outcomes in each sub-sector.

96.     Roads. The initially targeted roads for the EC component were not fully completed. Only
drainage works were carried out and re-gravelling contracts could not be signed before the grant
closing date. There have been no further interventions along these roads, and the competing
demands for budgetary allocations suggest that these roads are unlikely to be rehabilitated in the
short-to medium-term. Therefore the risk is rated significant.

97.     Water. The water sector is also faced with significant operational inefficiencies in spite of
achieving a potable water production of 50 percent of the capacity of the WTP. The outcomes in
the water sector are contingent upon further adequate investments in improving overall operational
efficiency - in particular ensuring the integrity of the distribution network and reducing revenue
loss by strengthening cost recovery mechanisms. The current lack of institutional capacity to
address the management and operational issues poses a significant risk to development outcome.

98.    Ports. The successful concessioning of the port for 25 years and the improved productivity
of the concessionaire, APM Terminals, would render the risk to development outcome low.
Furthermore, government ownership is high and the government continues to maintain a keen
focus on developments at the port.



                                              23  
99.     Agriculture. The increased levels of rice production are readily absorbed, currently, by the
WFP for the national school-feeding program. The evidence is that the purchase price of locally
produced rice is about 45 percent higher than what is openly available on the market. This could
be evidence of lopsided government policies and merits further investigation as to the underlying
causes. This is a significant risk to development outcome because unless locally produced rice is
sold at a price lower than what is imported, the economic benefits to farmers will be eroded, and
will serve as a disincentive to farmers when the policy of buying school food from local markets
is ended.

100. Risk of Ebola virus outbreak is rated moderate. The outbreak of Ebola, which impacted
the project toward the end, has been successfully contained in Liberia. Given the devastating
nature of the virus, mutation and flare ups could occur, however the level of vigilance seen in
Liberia, which has continued to maintain the structures and systems established for containment
of the disease, would render the risk moderate.

101. Institutional risk to development outcome is rated high. In the MOA for example, systems
for monitoring, evaluation, and strengthening of project and financial management functions have
been established. Government commitment is also seen in the port reforms and in the
establishment of policies and strategies in the transport and agriculture sectors for future guidance.
However, the slow buildup of capacity across the institutions renders this risk high because of the
challenges in maintaining an institutional focus for implementation of these strategies, policies,
and measures.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
102.    Bank performance during project entry was satisfactory. The project was well conceived
and responded to the pertinent issues in the immediate post-conflict era of Liberia. The relevant
OP/BP8.0 was employed for processing the operation and it ensured a rapid response to alleviate
the situation in Liberia. The design combined critical institutional reforms in the port sector,
capacity building of the weakened institutions and other forms of institutional support. Although
the design covered five subsectors of the economy, the selection of the interventions was well
targeted. The Bank was able to mobilize a highly competent cross-sectoral team at short notice
with a range of skills to cover the project’s institutional and technical requirements. The speed of
processing the operation was commendable and in the true spirit of emergency projects. Appraisal
was completed on May 12, 2007; the Board approved on July 31, 2007; and effectiveness was
declared on September 11, 2007. The Bank team also leveraged effective donor coordination to
bring on board sizeable EC co-financing for road and water infrastructure.
103.   The results framework though simple and straightforward had some shortcomings in terms
of focus and measurement of results. It is considered that, though some shortcomings were
observed in the M&E framework, the overall picture of Bank performance remains satisfactory.




                                             24  
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

104. The Bank's performance during implementation of the project was satisfactory. The Bank
team paid great attention to the quality of supervision. The team organized no fewer than 14
implementation support missions consisting of up to four missions in some years. In addition,
specialists on the team supported supervision through intensive sector-focused missions, such as
for ports and agriculture sectors. Though the Task Team Leader was changed three times during
the project, adequate focus on project objectives was maintained at all times. Implementation
progress was adequately reported, and implementation problems were identified early and
addressed proactively. Performance ratings given in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs)
were realistic, and sufficient attention was paid to the project’s likely development impact.
Supervision reports were sufficiently detailed and well written, and highlighted key issues, with
action plans for next steps. Working relationships with the donors, whose presence increased over
time, were effective.
105. Early in project implementation, a general MTR for all transport projects was held. This
enabled strategic decisions regarding implementation, particularly regarding the transformation of
SIU to IIU with greater autonomy. The team also took action to scale up interventions, such as for
the food crisis response window grant, and restructured the project as needed based on emerging
realities on the ground. The latest cause for restructuring was the incidence of EVD, which led to
a further extension of the project by 10 months to allow agriculture interventions to generate
another cycle of rice production.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
106.     The overall performance is rated satisfactory. The project preparation was efficient,
objective was sound, and highly relevant to the context, and the project supported clearly focused
activities aligned with the government’s i-PRSP. Bank supervision was also intense and proactive
in recommending changes as and when needed. Restructuring was also effectively used to
streamline the project activities and clarify outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
107. Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the high degree of
commitment shown to the project and clear sense of project ownership throughout the project life,
with some drawbacks in the areas of agriculture, water and rural roads. The government ensured
that all effectiveness conditions were met quickly. During implementation, the government
showed interest in the progress of project activities, particularly the reforms. Port reform, for
example, was under the purview of the Project Development Unit, which was sitting right in
President’s office. Several changes were made to the port to bring on board the right management
to lead the port reforms. In the case of the squatters to be resettled from Vai Town bridge
construction, the government expeditiously implemented the safeguards policy and funds for
compensation were released in a timely manner. However, in the case of the reforms in the


                                           25  
agriculture and water sectors, as well as the implementation of the rural roads financed by the EC,
government drive was not very evident.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

108. The implementing agency’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The SIU was
highly committed to achieving the Project Development Objectives and had sufficient resources
to perform well. However there were challenges in achieving the required staffing levels at the
SIU due to difficulties attracting the right quality of professionals. Even when the SIU was
transformed into the IIU, and was granted greater autonomy, the same situation prevailed and the
professionals on board were stretched. This led to some lapses in project administration and in the
agriculture component, which was proceeding slowly at the beginning.

109. In spite of these challenges, the IIU and PFMU ensured compliance with Bank safeguards
and fiduciary policies. Adequate financial management systems were established and maintained;
the procurement recordkeeping and reporting improved through the project life. After the
responsibility for the agriculture activities was transferred to the PMU of the MOA, the IIU
maintained effective coordination of agriculture and infrastructure investments. However,
management of the ILO-implemented EC grant was problematic and symptomatic of the inability
to manage the increasing transport portfolio with the available staffing. As a consequence, funds
were cancelled from the EC grant.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
110. The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory. The borrower
demonstrated a high level of commitment to the project objectives and ensured that the project
stayed on course to achieve the intended development outcomes. In spite of capacity challenges,
the IIU/PFMU did well to ensure compliance with all legal covenants satisfactorily. However, the
challenges with the ILO implementation of the infrastructure components under the EC grant,
leading to cancellation of funds, which could have been used effectively, would appear as a major
setback in performance under the circumstances.
6. Lessons Learned

111.   The following lessons are drawn from the implementation of project activities:

   (a) Government       commitment for reforms secured early i.e. during project
   conceptualization is critical to successful implementation of institutional reforms. This is
   seen in the reforms carried out in the port sector successfully transforming the Port of Monrovia
   to a landlord port model. Even though the consultancy contract was terminated, the
   government remained resolute and made the necessary management changes in NPA to ensure
   that the reforms were properly understood and carried through.

   (b) The conditions for Grant and Administration agreement for other partners (the EC
   in this case) should be well aligned with the Bank Financing agreement with the borrower


                                            26  
   to avoid the misinterpretation of the Grant Agreement by the borrower. This is a
   reflection of the inability of the EC grant to be extended beyond July 2012 due to an
   overarching decision by the EC to end the funding cycle in 2012.

   (c) Free standing grants to support projects should be planned with similar objectives,
   project activities, and implementing arrangements in order to provide flexibility and
   efficiency in the use of funds. The EC co-financing provided a good example of such
   flexibility, and in the unforeseen event of the three-year delay in making the grant effective,
   allowed for IDA-executed eligible activities to be funded by the EC seamlessly.

   (d) Projects designed to provide systems should be prepared from the viewpoint that the
   entire system needs to be delivered satisfactorily for it to perform as a whole. The failure
   to deliver the entire planned water system provides a good example of the inherent risk in
   having different funding sources delivering different components. Splitting up interdependent
   systems into separate packages to be financed by a single financing source is therefore critical
   for a satisfactory outcome and to avoid mismatched implementation schedules.

   (e) A higher standard of due diligence is required in the Procurement of suppliers in
   weak operating environments to ensure selection of qualified suppliers who are most
   likely to perform satisfactorily. For example it was assumed that the IITA, being present on
   the ground, could easily be sole sourced for the implementation of the agriculture component
   for Tree Crops; however this could not materialize and had to be abandoned and replaced by
   contracts with WFP and AFRICARE.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
112. Comments made by the borrower are found in Annex 6A of the ICR and notes the need to
synchronize the Administration agreements between the World Bank and co-financiers, (the EC
in this case). This has also been noted by the ICR and reflected in the section on lessons learnt.

(b) Co-financiers
113. Comments made by EC are captured in Annex 7 of the ICR and relate mainly to the
components funded by the EC for which project performance was considered unsatisfactory with
only 62 percent of Grant funds spent and the remainder reimbursed.

114. On the comment of the PDO indicators that were dropped, it is accepted practice to drop
indicators that have been achieved from monitoring during restructuring. However, the dropped
indicators are still evaluated as part of the assessment of the PDO.

115. The satisfactory rating of the Achievement of the PDO is largely a reflection of the project
activities achieved over the course of implementation. It is noted that even though the EC could
not finance some of the activities to completion, these were taken over by IDA funding and
completed. Therefore, the closure of EC funding was alleviated by the flexibility of the available
IDA funds to cover the same activities. Admittedly, greater utilization of available funds would
have further enhanced the project’s achievements.



                                            27  
116. The satisfactory rating of Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is also viewed by
the EC as unrealistic. The assessment is based on a number of factors that went into preparation
as outlined in Paragraphs 33-35. The rating was selected to reflect the circumstances of a post
conflict environment and the need to respond in a timely and flexible manner, and the concrete
actions taken by the Bank to ensure quality. A satisfactory rating would indicate that there were
shortcomings in the process but not so critical as to derail the objective of the project.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
117.   No other stakeholders or partners provided feedback on this ICR.

1.       The project was prepared as an emergency project under OP8.0, and as such did not lend itself to a
rigorous financial and economic analysis. In this regard, the cost per unit of major works items are
compared with similar works in the sub-region at Implementation Completion and Results Report stage
(ICR) as a measure of cost-effectiveness. Planned costs and the implementation time of various activities
are also assessed against the actual execution outcomes as a measure of efficiency.
2.     Cost-effectiveness considerations. The costs associated with the completed works appear
reasonable compared to similar works completed in the subregion..

3.      Implementation timing. Project implementation was delayed as several issues needed to
be resolved before implementation could proceed. Major delays were experienced in the
implementation of EC-financed component as well as the agriculture components. These are
further elucidated as follows: 

      The IDA Financing Agreement became effective on September 11, 2007 while the EC
       Grant became effective on July 2010, about three years later. Thus there was a relatively
       short time of 11 months to implement the activities funded by the EC Grant.
      The water sector activities were contingent on completion of the African Development
       Bank (AfDB)-funded technical studies, which were delayed considerably. Subsequently,
       implementation of the key activities in water components suffered from poor supplier
       performance with extensions of time, variation orders, and in the case of the supply of high
       lift pumps termination of the contract and procuring of another supplier under IDA funding
       in light of the EC grant closing date.
      In spite of the project starting under IDA funding, initial start-up of the feeder roads
       component faced significant delays emanating primarily from a scarcity of motivated and
       skilled human resources at the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). This culminated in
       contracting the International Labor Organization (ILO) on a sole source basis to act as an
       Implementation Agent on behalf of the MPW.
      The ILO strategy was to engage and train local contractors in labor-based methodology for
       implementation of the works. In light of difficulties experienced by MPW in procuring
       equipment to assist the local contractors, the works were split into two phases, drainage
       and road works, to allow for equipping of the contractors before the works were contracted
       out.
      The ILO implemented labor-based public works also had several irregularities in the
       manner in which the contracts were procured and managed. Bank procurement procedures
       were not followed in the procurement of contractors, and advance payment and
       performance guarantees were not obtained in the approved formats. This resulted in
       significant delays in retrofitting contracts, as well as in payment of contractors.
      The sole-sourcing of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) for the Tree
       Crops Value Chain activity originally planned was unsuccessful and had to be abandoned
       after two years. The World Food Program (WFP) and AFRICARE were brought in as
       implementing partners to kick-start the activities under the agriculture component.
      Delay in the rehabilitation of the oil jetty was due to delays in the procurement of the
       feasibility and pre-design consultancy for a year. This component was eventually dropped
       on account of insufficient funding.
4.      Considering the balance between lower costs, the delays in implementation, and the
mitigating circumstances of working in a post conflict, fragile environment overall, the efficiency
is rated as modest.

                           ANNEX 5. BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS

1.      A beneficiary survey was conducted during the ICR mission to interact with the
beneficiaries and NGO’s involved in the agriculture productivity interventions and better
understand project impacts. Interviews were also held with the other key stakeholders, i.e. MOA,
WFP, AFRICARE, FAO, and the local NGOs who were involved in sensitization and training of
FBOs. Overall, the project succeeded in organizing 2,046 beneficiary farmers and value chain
actors (1,020 in Bong County and 1,026 in Lofa) into Farmer Based Organizations (FBOs), and
provided various trainer of trainer workshops and community-level training to build the capacity
of 1,884 farmers (1,128 from Bong County and 756 from Lofa County).

2.     The mission visited project sites for the agriculture component in Bomi and Bong counties
where the interventions were in rice and cassava production, respectively, to interact with project
beneficiaries and inspect progress of farming activities. Site conditions during the rainfall did not
permit easy access to Lofa, Gbarpolu, and some parts of Bomi counties. In Bomi County, two
farming communities at Zelekai and Dulime were visited and in Bong County, two farmer based
organizations at Youth Mission and Worla were also visited.

3.      The beneficiaries were very satisfied with the support they had received from the project.
Significant positive impacts were reported on livelihoods and household incomes, crop cultivation
habits, food self-sufficiency and capacity building aspects of the project intervention. All the
stakeholders expressed the need for the government of Liberia to assume ownership of the project
after the closing date for it to be sustainable.

4.      Summary of interactions with primary project beneficiaries:
      Project approach and mobilization methodologies applied. Beneficiaries expressed
       satisfaction and great interest in the project. The revival of Farmer Based Organizations
       previously known in Liberia with food for work and Cash for Work incentives were
       appropriate. The FBOs brought about cohesion in the communities, with benefits of
       increased productivity accruing to the groups.
      Capacity building aspects. Beneficiaries attested to success of the farmer field schools
       (48 farmer field schools were established) which were organized by FAO to provide the
       FBOs with training on improved farming methods, best farming practices including
       practical demonstrations at demonstration sites, introduction of new seed varieties,
       marketing strategies and mini kits that included seed rice, assorted vegetable seeds, cassava
       cuttings, cutlass, axes, wheel barrow, diggers, measuring tape. On the downstream end,
       training was also provided in agricultural processing, marketing, quality standards and
       market prices, and innovation in value addition to crop products including product
       handling, preservation, processing, and packaging. Beneficiaries claim that valuable
       information was received that has transformed their perspective of farming.
      Change in community crop cultivation habits. Traditionally, farming in Liberia has been
       principally on higher ground. The valleys, though well-watered all year round, are seen as
       difficult to cultivate. Intensive sensitization campaigns carried out by NGOs in the
       beneficiary communities led to rice cultivation in lowlands. This enabled at last two
       harvests per year, which also increased the benefits and profits.


                                             40  
    Role of local NGOs. The use of knowledgeable local NGOs as Implementing Partners on
     the ground was a plus. The collaboration between District Agricultural Officers, the
     Implementing Partners, and local NGOs with agricultural extension officers was excellent
     and a high level of interest has been established in sustaining the project outcomes. Some
     of the beneficiaries in Bong County recommended that projects should not be left under
     the management of local NGOs but there should be an agricultural focal person from the
     World Bank besides the project coordinator, to work with any World Bank project in order
     to assure regular field visitation and accurate monitoring.
    Marketing aspects. Finding ready markets for produce before harvest led to sales success.
     Farmers also expressed that planting on time and cultivating the appropriate surface areas
     according to the available workforce or labor helped them succeed.
    Improved livelihoods and household incomes. There was a dramatic increase in the
     livelihood of the beneficiaries resulting from participation in the project, mainly due to the
     cash and food for work that the project provided them at the initial stages of preparation of
     the farms for planting. Through the supply of seed varieties to farmers, a majority of
     households were able to plant, harvest, and keep seeds for the next season, and sold surplus.
     This culminated in the increased incomes for the beneficiary households. With an increase
     in income levels, some of the households have embarked on facelift programs and
     acquisition of personal farming assets such as pumps for irrigation of farms, farm
     implements, etc.
    Improved food self-sufficiency: the project helped beneficiaries accumulate enough
     foodstuffs from the 2013 and 2014 seasons and, as a result, most beneficiaries were able to
     save money that would have been used to purchase food and put those financial resources
     to use for other purposes, such as their children’s education or health care for members of
     their households. Community grain reserves (eight were established under the project)
     were crucial for food preservation and management during the dry season. Incidentally,
     the outbreak of EVD brought about heavy reliance on the food reserves in the community
     grain storage facilities as many people from affected areas started to migrate in search of
     food and safety from the disease. To a large extent, this food self-sufficiency helped to
     stem the tide of nutrition-related deaths during the EVD outbreak.
    Impact of Ebola virus Disease. The benefit of the FBO methodology was undermined by
     the occurrence of EVD, which had a devastating effect on the project. Farmers no longer
     wanted to work in groups on account of the disease transmission mechanisms and many
     farms were therefore abandoned, leading to decreased productivity in the 2014 season.
     However, the benefits of the FBOs are evident from the 2013 farming season and the FBOs
     have been reorganized with the subsidence of the disease.
5.      Desirable follow-up activities. Based on the interactions with the primary project
beneficiaries encountered, the following are seen as desirable to ensure sustainability of the
project:
    Government ownership. Government/MOA should assume the ownership of the project
     and complete the activities that remain outstanding on account of EVD. The evidence is




                                           41  
  that there is greater interest from communities to develop their farms profitably and it is
  imperative that the momentum is sustained.
 Increased efficiency in farming. There is a need to move to mechanized forms of
  farming, e.g. the use of power tillers and irrigation pumps in the lowlands for rice
  production.
 Post-harvest management. Post-harvest management of agricultural produce is a
  challenge. Beneficiaries lack requisite processing and value addition equipment and
  infrastructure. The Government should consider providing direct support in the provision
  of equipment or create conditions that would encourage private investors establish farming
  equipment rental services at affordable rates for active farmers. Community grain storages
  established in eight locations were critical to the success of the rice productivity
  interventions. Consideration should also be given to provision of storage facilities to reduce
  spoilage of farmers’ produce.

      ANNEX 6: SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR
(A.) Summary of Borrower’s ICR
The main elements of the Borrower’s ICR are summarized below.
1.0 Project Development Objective

1.      The project Development Objective (PDO) was to support Government’s efforts to: a)
rehabilitate its basic infrastructure; and b) revive its agriculture activities.

2.0 Original and Revised Project Activities and Components
2.1 Original Components

2.     The Project was in the amount of US$49.5 million (IDA US$37.0 million and EC US$12.5
million equivalent) and consisted of three components.
A. Policy Reform and Institutional Support IDA US$5.7 million:

3.      This component supported Government with the preparation of a management contract for
operation of the Port of Monrovia and complementary advisory services in undertaking
comprehensive reform of the port sector, as well as fund Technical Assistance to various entities
of the Government responsible for transport and infrastructure. It provided targeted assistance for
policy reforms, legal and regulatory framework and capacity building in the water sector in
particular the institutional strengthening of Liberia Water & Sewer Corporation (LWSC). It also
provided Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in strengthening their
capacity in policy formulation and planning, as well as monitoring, evaluation and statistical
reporting.
B. Agriculture and Infrastructure Investments: EC US$12.5 million; IDA US$30.4
   million

4.       This component funded the design, rehabilitation and supervision activities of
infrastructure assets including the rehabilitation and construction of several major bridges on
principal road corridors and on a number of smaller river crossings nationwide, as well as
secondary and tertiary feeder roads. Funds were also made available for developing sustainable
local roads maintenance capacity. The water treatment plant for Monrovia was rehabilitated to at
least 50 percent of design capacity and provision of safe drinking water in selected secondary
cities. In addition, this component covered the rehabilitation of Monrovia’s water distribution
network (secondary and tertiary pipelines to connect to water posts and selected institutions/users).

5.     The agriculture interventions were based on an understanding of the value chain. This
component provided essential inputs- including knowledge - to spur production and rebuild
physical marketing infrastructure such as market places and post-harvest handling facilities
concentrating on cocoa, coffee, food crops, and vegetable production. Building the capacity of
farmers’ organizations was an important aspect of this component.




                                             43  
C.     Project Management and Capacity Building: Bank US$0.9 million:

6.    Under this component, incremental support was given to the existing management and
implementation entities, namely the SIU/IIU and PFMU.
2.2 Revised Components

7.      Although the project was restructured with many changes, the overall development
objectives in general remained the same. Additional financing were required to cover cost
increases in the projects, scaling up of activities and added activities within the scope of the
development objectives. The restructurings resulted in cancelling some activities and significantly
amending the scope of others. The major changes sought were: (i) to cover cost over-runs for a
major consultancy assignment and for the construction of a critical bridge in Monrovia; (ii) for
scaling up road works on 83 km corridors from Freeport of Monrovia to Cotton Tree; and (iii) for
dropping three activities from the project.

8.         The three components of the project were subsequently revised as follows:

9.     Component A for policy reform and institutional support, including financing for
comprehensive reform of the port sector, Technical Assistance to various entities of the
government responsible for transport and infrastructure as well as for policy reforms, legal and
regulatory framework and capacity building.

10.     Component B funded design, rehabilitation and supervision activities of infrastructure
assets, bridges on principal road corridors and on smaller river crossings nationwide, as well as
secondary and tertiary feeder roads; contribution to the rehabilitation of the water treatment plant
for Monrovia, as well as activities in agriculture.

11.        Component C funded project management and capacity building.

4.0 Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
4.1 Project Preparation and Design

15.     The Special Implementation Unit (SIU) was transformed into the Infrastructure
Implementation Unit (IIU) in October 2009 to pave the way for the expansion of the infrastructure
portfolio.

16.    The IIU with the assistance of the Ministry of Public Works and the World Bank Transport
Task Team continued with the implementation of key civil works contracts with focus on contracts
which were being unsatisfactorily executed leading to considerable delays in completion.

17.     In parallel, the IIU had to proceed with recruitment of staff, the procurement processes for
Goods, Services and Works, the recruitment of supervising/monitoring Consultants and Civil
Works Contractors on other major Infrastructure Projects. The transition from SIU to IIU, by itself
was a great challenge and a daunting task. Project preparation and design would have inevitably
been affected negatively. However, the IIU with the assistance of MPW, former SIU staff and
hired technical assistance under the project, were able to deliver these projects within reasonable
timeframe.
4.2 Implementation
4.2.1 Ports

18.    A management contract for the operation of the port of Monrovia and the Port Management
and Sector Advisory Reform Services for the National Port Authority was signed with a Consultant
in January 2009.

19.    Paving Container Yard (21,600sq.m) along with four (4) internal access routes at the
Freeport-National Port Authority (NPA) was completed August 2010. Originally, a Contract to
provide Consultancy Services for the Supervision of the Oil Jetty Refurbishment and Provision of
Fire Fighting Facilities at the Port of Monrovia was signed. The services were modified to a
Conceptual Design and preparation of bidding documents for Design and Build for the Fuel



                                             45  
Unloading Facility in the Freeport of Monrovia. The Bids for design and construction were opened
on May 1, 2012, Bids were evaluated, and Contract awarded.
4.2.2 Agriculture Sector

20.    The Infrastructure Implementation Unit (IIU) of the Ministry of Public Works over the
period from September 2009 to August 2012 has implemented the following components of the
Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project (AIDP) on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture;

21.     Rehabilitation of Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Bong Regional Offices, Central
Agriculture Research Institute (CARI) Bong County including Fabrication and Installation of
security / burglar bars for windows and metal steel doors.
      Purchase of two generators for MOA Bong Regional Office, furniture for the Regional
       Offices and Landscaping of MOA Regional Office Compound;
      Consultancy; Recruitment of three (3) advisors for the Program Management Unit
       (MOA) Program Coordination Advisor/Financial Management Advisor/Procurement

       (Maryland, Bong, Montserrado & Margibi Counties); and
       Consultancy; Social Impact Assessment (SIA) & Environmental and Social Management
       Framework (ESMF).

22.    The implementation of the Consultancy Services has been delayed mainly due to poor
preparation and response from some of the Consultants.
4.2.3 Water Sector

23.    The Infrastructure Implementation Unit (IIU) of the Ministry of Public Works over the
period from September 2009 to 2015 has implemented the following components of the
Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project (AIDP) on behalf of the LWSC:
      Monrovia Water Distribution Network (Lot 1B);
      Rehabilitation of Bushrod Island Booster Station, Newport Booster Station and also
       Ducor & Mamba Point Reservoirs;
      Supply, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of High Lift Pumps & Generators;
      Supervision of Works for Rehabilitation of Bushrod Island Booster Station, Newport
       Booster Stations, and also Ducor & Mamba Point Reservoirs;

      Supply of Spare Parts for the Newly Installed High Lift Pumps of the Water Treatment
       Plant in White Plains, & Training of Technicians in the Operations & Maintenance of the
       Pumps.
4.2.4 Roads Sector
a.       Demolition of collapsed Vai Town Bridge and its replacement with a New Bridge

24.    The Contract was for the demolition of the existing collapsed Vai Town Bridge and its
replacement with a New Bridge 240m long, cast in place balanced cantilever box girder with three
spans of 70+100+70m respectively.

25.     The contract was signed in September 2008, however the initial progress was
unsatisfactory and had already been delayed for one year by the time of the new implementing
unit; Infrastructure Implementation Unit took over. Poor management and inadequate planning by
the Contractor were part of the obstacles to the progress on this project. Some of the issues which
took time to be resolved were:
b. Staffing, Geotechnical Investigation and Foundation Design, Shop Drawings,
inadequate equipment and a comprehensive Work Program.

26.    The contractor was very slow in mobilizing and suffered from poor management, lack of
planning, and hardly any competent technical staff. The situation was so serious that a meeting
was called in January 2010 to improve the situation. Since that meeting the situation improved
with the first pile done (Cast) on 26th June 2010.

27.     The Supervision Consultancy had not been satisfactory either, with the change of five
Project managers and non – compliance to their contract.

28.    Extra effort had to be made from including High Level Meetings (MPW, IIU, Consultant
and Contractor), regular site visits, and meetings before there was positive transformation in
physical progress.
c.       Small Bridges (Installation of Bailey Bridges)

29.      Installation of 27 Bailey singular Bailey bridge components, which had been purchased
under a previous program was targeted, and was installed at 25 bridge locations due to the width
of the river crossings prioritized to install these bridges at various locations throughout the country.
The twenty-seven bridges have been launched and completed 100 percent. The Bridges have
helped alleviate the chronic problems caused by failed and damaged bridges in most of Liberia's
road network.
d.       Feeder Roads

30.     The ILO contract to implement Feeder Roads Project on behalf of the Ministry of Public
Works in three Counties was partially completed at the end of August 2012. The agreement for
this assignment was signed on 13th July 2010. The component covered 200km of feeder roads in
Lofa, Nimba and Bong Counties. The assignment also covered the training of local contractors
and MPW staff in the management of feeder roads.



                                              47  
31.     The goal and purpose of the project was defined as: (a) Improvement of productive
livelihood and service delivery; and (b) to (i) Build the capacity of MPW staff to manage feeder
roads network and develop the capacity of local contractors to rehabilitate feeder roads using
labour based methods; and (ii) Carry out engineering studies of feeder roads in Lofa, Nimba and
Bong Counties, package roads into sizeable contracts for award and to supervise the rehabilitation
works, respectively.

4.3 Details of the Components
A Capacity Development

32.    The following Capacity Development activities were undertaken under the project:
   1. Capacity Development for MPW staff & local contractors in feeder road rehabilitation:
         i. Train 2 MPW Engineers
        ii. Train 20 MPW Engineers/Technicians + 3 representatives from each of 20 local
            contracting firms
   2. Capacity Development for MPW staff & local contractors – Pilot Surfacing of Rural &
       Secondary Roads using labor-based methods.
         i. Train 6 representatives of local contractors & MPW Engineers for bitumen surfacing
            of roads – 3km road section
   3. Community Based Maintenance Groups for Routine Maintenance
         i. Train community based groups through combination of “trainers’ & direct
            contracting
B Engineering Study of Roads & Preparation of contract packages 200 km of Roads for
    rehabilitation

33.   The performance of ILO was not satisfactory and queries were raised by the Task Team;
IIU presented an assessment based on MPW/ILO’s interpretation of the Agreement,
implementation strategy and actual performance.

34.    On the contrary, MPW later provided a justification for the continuation of the ILO services
based on its unique experience on Labor Based Methodology and ILO’s performance on the
ongoing African Development Bank funded Feeder Roads Program.
C National Transport Policy and Strategy Paper

35.   The National Transport Policy & Strategy (NTPS) was published by the Government in
2009.

5.0     Lessons Learnt
5.1     Equipment

36.    The unavailability of road construction equipment affected the delivery of road works in
Liberia. In the case of AIDP, the project was designed with the assumption that the local
contractors already had the requisite equipment for the works. It was in view of this fact that it
was agreed to implement the project in two (2) phases with the hope that the equipment being



                                            48  
procured by MPW under the LBPWP would be available for the works. The low equipment
capacity resulted in serious time overruns on a number of projects in Liberia.

37.    Efforts should be made by the MPW to assist local contractors to obtain pieces of the
required equipment for the works. Different methods have been used in a number of countries and
the MPW availing itself to some of these approaches would go a long way in helping to build the
capacity of the local construction industry for the future maintenance of roads in Liberia.
5.2 Contract Securities

38.     The local contractors faced difficulties in obtaining the necessary securities from the local
banks to support their tender/contract. Most of the contractors cannot provide the collateral
(usually landed properties) required by banks. The banks usually, in the absence of the landed
properties, requires the applicant to deposit with them an amount equivalent to the value of the
security required, a situation that cripples the contractors financially.
5.3 Staffing

39.     SIU and later IIU were understaffed to handle the implementation of all the components,
which included non-roads component. As other projects were launched the burden on the skeleton
staff increased as there were no corresponding increase in staff strength. A technical support team
of young national engineers should have been incorporated so as to gain training and experience
from the Non-nationals, international staff and consultants.
5.4 Financial Management (FM)

40.    It was self-evident that FM considerations were over taken by project implementation
matters, thus FM flags were unfortunately not part of the control process because for the period
2008 – 2010, there was no in-house capacity to review and advise on FM issues. Subsequently in
2011 – 2012, some semblance of FM control came into existence but with difficulties.

41.     There was a clear sign that no Quality Assurance (QA) process was in place to review the
financial accuracy of the documents as no capacity existed. Even when capacity became abundant,
it was very difficult to integrate Financial QA into the review of approval of draft documents and
reports as the culture had been to ignore or exclude FM issues. The role of FM was perceived as
simply to process payments and to explain the status of any contractor or consultant payment.
5.5 Project Management

42.    Progress on site is enhanced by the availability of information required by the contractor,
which may include queries as to how certain provisions of the contract should be interpreted or
how problems encountered on site should be dealt with promptly and properly. The Supervision
Consultant appointed was expected to be familiar with details of the project to deal with them
promptly. However, some of those were referred to the Employer, IIU for approvals or concurrence
even when the contract was clear as to the cause of action.

5.1 Comments on Draft ICR

43.     The Infrastructure Implementation Unit (IIU), which managed this project, is of the view
that the most important lesson learnt is the impact on implementation schedule due to the timing
of Administration Agreements between the partners. It is therefore proposed that Administration
Agreements for future projects of this nature are efficiently aligned in a manner that would allow
the successful attainment of all objectives of the project.

      ANNEX 7. COMMENTS OF COFINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS

1.       We understand that the report relates to the totality of the WB-administered project of USD
52 million. I note that the ratings are given as mostly satisfactory. For the activities funded under
EU grant contribution of EUR 10 million, which at the time amounted to some USD 13 million
our assessment is there are areas/objectives were the project performance is unsatisfactory. There
is an independent Evaluation report of this contract funded by the EUD, posted under our website
(http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/liberia/projects/evaluation/index_ en.htm) which highlights the
main problems the project has faced for what concerns the activities financed by us.

2.      Only 62 percent of our grant funds were spent and the rest has been reimbursed. More
specifically, mentioning just a few points:

     (i) PDO indicators: it is surprising how many were dropped. The original indicator 1 was
        actually revised because no substantial results could achieved.

     (ii) Para. 67: Achievement of Project Development Objectives: in EU's view a rating:
        Satisfactory is unrealistic. For the parts funded by the EU it was unsatisfactory, maybe in
        total a bit better.

     (iii) Para. 97: Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry: in EU's view a rating: Satisfactory
        is unrealistic. For the parts funded by the EU it was partly unsatisfactory (poor design of
        the water component, which did not achieve significant results notwithstanding the amounts
        spent and the hardware installed; poor selection of the rural roads sections), maybe in total
        a bit better.

3.       We would find it appropriate that these comments are somehow included in the report.
