                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.       The Government of Liberia requested for 8 months extension for completing works related to Agricultural component. Further, there are about US$7m uncommitted/project
                         savings. A formal Government proposal to reallocate these project savings to URIRP is awaited. The project shall be restructured shortly.
                         2.       To partially utilize the balance funding under EU grant which closed on July 31, 2012, the Bank in consultation with European Union reposted similar eligible expenditures
                         under IDA projects (URIRP) to the EC co-financed component.
                         3. The contract for balance works of high lift pumps and generator, critical infrastructure for Monrovia water supply, which was signed on July 31, 2012, needs to be closely monitored
                         by the Government for successful and timely delivery.
