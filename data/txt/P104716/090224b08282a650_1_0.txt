                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. There have been substantial delays in the implementation of agricultural component activities undertaken by
                         WFP and its partners. The Ebola outbreak has adversely impacted the progress of associated field activities in the affected counties. Pending testing of water pumps is also delayed
                         on account of the Ebola crisis.
