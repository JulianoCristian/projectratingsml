 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project closing date is currently July 31, 2015 and no extension of the project is planned. Overall implementation performance is rated Moderately
 Satisfactory. The Ebola epidemic had impacted the ability of implementing units in Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Agriculture to undertake
 project completion activities in a timely and orderly manner and the project was extended by ten months to provide additional time to complete
 pending project activities. All transport and water activities are complete with the exception of the installation of Baily Bridges at three river crossings.
 (The project has already installed Bailey Bridges at 22 river crossings.) Installation and testing of water pumps and an electrical transformer delayed
 by the Ebola outbreak have proceeded successfully and equipment is functioning. Agricultural component project activities were further delayed by the
 EVD crisis and field activities were impacted or stopped in the affected counties. Despite progress of the agriculture component prior to the outbreak,
 the objective of improving food production was directly impacted by the disease due to abandoning of farming plots. While Community Grain Reserves
 created under the project provided rice on loan to many farmers in need during the crisis, not all farmers have been able to fully repay loans on
 account of transport issues and low yields. Following subsidence of the outbreak, agriculture activities resumed strategically with Food for Asset and
 Cash for Work schemes Overall, rice productivity has increased on account of the provision of improved seed. Efforts are being made to link the AIDP
 project to the WAAPP project of MoA so that there could be synergy and the latter can take over the activities of AIDP at closure.
 The issue of US$115,574.34 refund under the ILO-supervised labor-based public works contract is outstanding for almost two years. Relying on the
 interim financial statement of the ILO and a consultant's report, the donor, the EU, has raised questions whether the full balance of unused funds was
 reimbursed by the ILO. The GoL agreed to pursue the matter with ILO and either demonstrate by June 30, 2015 that no refund is due or refund the
 balance amount in a time-bound manner.
