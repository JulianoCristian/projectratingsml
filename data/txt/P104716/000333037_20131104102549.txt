    AGRICULTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper seeks your approval for: (i) changes to the results
framework; and (ii) a closing date extension (Restructuring Level II, with approval
authority delegated to the RVP) for the agriculture component of the original financing
and additional financing (Grant Numbers IDA-H327, IDA-H504, respectively “Original
Financing” and “Additional Financing”), and the additional resources funded by the Food
Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (Grant Number TF092332, the “FPCRTF”) for the
Liberia Agriculture and Infrastructure Development Project (P104716, “AIDP” or
“Project”), by 11 months, from October 31, 2013, to September 30, 2014. This will be the
second extension for the Original Financing, Additional Financing and the FPCRTF. The
proposed restructuring is based on Government’s request dated May 30, 2013.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The Original Financing was approved by the Executive Directors on July 31,
2007. The overall original allocation in 2007 was for US$37 million under an IDA pre-
arrears grant, and included a co-financing under an Administration Agreement (AA)
between the Bank and the European Community (“EC”) (TF070904). The Additional
Financing was processed in November 2009 in an amount of US$16 million.
Subsequently, the Closing Date of the Original Financing, the Additional Financing and
the FPCRTF were extended once by 22 months, from December 31, 2011, to October 31,
2013. The AA governing EC co-financing (TF070904) was amended in April 2011
extending the AA closing date from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012. The EC Trust
Fund is not being extended in this restructuring.

AIDP Agriculture Sector Component (US$5.0 million), and Food Price Crisis
Response Trust Fund (TF092332) (US$3.0 million)
3.     Agriculture related activities of US$5.0 million of the Project, with US$3.0
million of the additional resources from the FPCRTF, were allocated for agriculture
development activities as follows:
       (a) Policy Reform and Capacity Building: (i) to strengthen the Policy, Planning
           and Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA); (ii) to support
           the monitoring, evaluation and statistical capacity of the MoA; and (iii) to
           develop priority agriculture sector policies.
          Activities progress: to date approximately 99 percent of the US$1.1 million
          budget has been disbursed or committed on goods and services related to
          Policy Reform and Capacity Building, and 54 percent of the US$2.6 million
          allocated for the MoA Program Management Unit (PMU) strengthening have
          been disbursed or committed.
                                           1
       (b) Value Chain Development: to provide technical assistance to farmer based
           organizations to support agricultural production of tree crops and food crops
           along value and marketing chains.
           Activities progress: the implementation of Value Chain Development
           activities is proceeding under two contracts: (i) Strengthening Food Crop
           Value Chains in Lofa and Bong Counties, for an amount of US$1.0 million
           with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); and (ii) Rice Food
           emergency Support in Lofa and Bong Counties for an amount of US$0.8
           million with the Africa Rice Center. Due to delay in the procurement process,
           implementation started late, and only about 30 percent (US$298,000) and 36
           percent (US$307,000) of the FAO and Africa Rice contracts amounts
           respectively have been disbursed to date. Due to the late start, the
           implementation of both contracts will not be completed by the current closing
           date of October 31, 2013, and will require a second dry season in 2014 for the
           contracts to achieve their intended objectives.
       (c) Productive Infrastructure and Seed Multiplication: the aims of these two sub-
           components are to support productive and marketing infrastructure including
           market places; (ii) local agriculture distribution hubs, storage facilities and
           post-harvest handling facilities; and (iii) rehabilitation and maintenance of
           seed multiplication facilities to supply quality seeds to farmers.
           Activities progress: activities under these two sub-components have been
           regrouped under one contract with the World Food Program (WFP) for an
           amount of US$2.5 million. Although implementation also started late, due to
           delays in the procurement process, it is proceeding well with about 60 percent
           (US$1.5 million) disbursed to date. However, similar to the Value Chain
           Development sub-component, implementation of activities under the WFP
           contract cannot be completed by the current closing date of October 31, 2013,
           and will require a second dry season in 2014 to achieve the contract intended
           objectives.

4.     The Progress toward achievement of the PDO and the Overall Implementation
Progress (IP) were both rated as Moderately Satisfactory (MS) in the last ISR #11 dated
October 11, 2013.

5.     There are inconsistencies in the financing plan and disbursement data reflected in
the SAP system and the iLAP. These inconsistencies are being examined in detail with
the support of OPCS and the Controller's CTRLD, Loan Department, to check if any
systemic issues exist. In this document, the reflected data is consistent with the iLAP
system.

6.      The conditions for extension of Closing Dates under Paragraph 42 of BP 10.00
were fully met, namely that: (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the
performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; (c)
the Recipient has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the
project. There are also no outstanding audits.

                                            2
7. There is an open INT investigation which is in the early stages for this project. The
   team has confirmed that no procurement is planned or underway that uses debarred
   firms.

8.      Overall to date, implementation of social and environmental safeguards has been
satisfactory1.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

9.      The proposed extension of Closing Date under the agriculture component of the
project is necessary to allow sufficient time for the completion of all Project goals,
without any change to the overall scope of the Project. The extension will allow sufficient
time for the completion of the two Value Chain development contracts and the contract
for the Productive Infrastructure and the Seed Multiplication activities, as well as for the
provision of further support to the strengthening of the MoA’s PMU. Outcome indicators
have been revised to better reflect interventions under the Project for the remainder of the
implementation period (see attached revised Results Framework).

  During the May 2013 in-country review of the agriculture component, a Bank mission raised concerns about the
potential environmental implications of the development by the World Food Program (WFP) of 240 ha of new
lowlands into small-scale irrigation schemes. After investigating this matter with the WFP and visiting all concerned
sites, the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed to the Bank on August 2, 2013, that there are no environmental issues
associated with the development of the small-scale irrigation schemes by the WFP.
