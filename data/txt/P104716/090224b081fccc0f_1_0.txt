                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. On May 30, 2013, the Government of Liberia requested for 11 months extension (until September 31, 2014). This request is under processing.
                         2. The recruitment of additional project staff (5) in the Program Management Unit in the Ministry of Agriculture needs to be fast tracked to enhance the Client’s capacity for project
                         delivery.
                         3. The Government of Liberia should follow up and secure the refund from ILO of US$$207, 592.04 to the project under the closed EC co-financing.
