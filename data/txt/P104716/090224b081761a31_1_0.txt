                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.       The Government of Liberia shall be taking immediate steps to allocate the uncommitted funds of approximately US$8 million to plan and execute the activities before project
                         closure next year. A formal request shall be submitted to World Bank by September 28, 2012.
                         2.       The Bank and European Union are actively considering all options to use balance funds available under EU Grant. The Grant Agreement for these funds has come to an
                         end on July 31, 2012.
                         3. The contract for balance works of high lift pumps and generator, critical infrastructure for Monrovia water supply, which was signed on July 31, 2012, needs to be monitored by
                         Government closely for successful delivery.
