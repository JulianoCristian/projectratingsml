education in science and\n            mathematics through strengthening teacher education in these\n            subjects. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) raise the\n            qualifications of teaching staff in selected Rajabhat\n            Institutes (RIs) (teacher colleges) and enhance their\n            understanding of modern teacher education techniques; 2)\n            reinforce quality improvement in the RIs through modernizing\n            science laboratories and workshops with up-to-date\n            equipment, expanding laboratory space and refurbishing\n            workshops; 3) expand the capacity of the RIs to carry out\n            in-service training of secondary teachers; and 4) enhance\n            the RIs capacity to undertake research and provide technical\n            services to the community. The project will comprise the\n            following components: 1) civil works to construct new\n            science laboratories and to refurbish workshops; 2)\n            equipment to modernize laboratories and workshops; 3)\n            equipment-related operations and maintenance expenditures;\n            4) an institutional development program consisting of\n            fellowships and practical training for teaching staff, and\n            in-service training for secondary teachers; 5) a research\n            and technical services program which will include research\n            grants and consultants to assist in the design of research\n            projects and for new course development; and 6) assistance\n            for project management and for the establishment of a\n            monitoring and evaluation system."}, "docdt": "1996-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
