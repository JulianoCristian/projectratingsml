               Urban Local Govt Development Project (P101474)



 The ULGDP closed on schedule on December 31, 2015. The project has largely achieved its objectives. An estimated 2.85 million urban residents (50 percent
 female), are benefiting from improved roads and drainage, new bridges, street lights, solid waste services, markets, and other urban infrastructure services. Some 1.5
 million people are benefiting from improvements in roads alone. Another 35,600 residents are benefiting from improved community water points and from expansion
 of the water network to new neighborhoods. People are also benefiting from more responsive, transparent, accountable, and effective urban administrations. Some 19
 cities have cleared their audit backlogs. This is a major achievement, as at the start of the program, all cities had audit backlogs of 5–7 years. All 19 cities in fiscal
 2013 received audit reports that were qualified with minor comments. This contrasts with the situation in previous years, when a number of cities received adverse or
 disclaimer audit reports. Mekelle, Adama, Bahir-dar have received a clean audit report for fiscal 2014, the first cities to have done so since the program started. In
 addition, over 300,000 permanent and temporary jobs have been created in micro and small enterprises, about one-third of which have been taken by women. All data
 will be verified during the preparation of the Implementation Completion and Results Report.

 Overall Comments
 The June 30, 2014 data is used as the actual, since we do not have the full data yet. The ICR will reflect the most up-to-date data depending on
 what we receive from cities. The number of improved community water points has been corrected to 131 as per the annual rport of the client for
 the period ended June 30, 2014.
