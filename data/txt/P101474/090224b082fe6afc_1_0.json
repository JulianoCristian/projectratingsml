follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: support for large primate cities should\n            come through a dedicated project, rather than through a\n            project including multiple secondary cities. The ULGDP did\n            not provide funds or incentives to regional entities. As a\n            result, the regional government did not support cities as\n            expected. Without additional funds, the regional entities\n            simply did not have the capacity to audit cities financial\n            reports on time or to support cities efforts to increase\n            municipal revenues. Learning from experience, the Second\n            ULGDP provides performance grants to key regional entities\n            to encourage them to take active part in the capacity\n            building support, facilitation of cities\u2019 own-source\n            revenue, social and environmental safeguards, audits, and\n            backstopping support as well as mentoring and monitoring.\n            Municipal own-source revenue generation requires focused\n            attention to ensure that cities can continue to invest in\n            and maintain infrastructure and services. Although all\n            cities prepared revenue enhancement plans, most did not do\n            so based on a thorough analysis of the potential of various\n            revenue sources, and instead simply projected the revenue\n            based on the figures achieved in the previous year.\n            Moreover, regional administrations often provided cities\n            with targets for revenues based on unrealistic assumptions\n            of how quickly cities could generate revenues. Recognizing\n            that cities need focused assistance to develop and implement\n            revenue enhancement plans, the Second ULGDP includes a\n            minimum condition and a performance measure in the APA\n            linked to municipal revenue generation. It is expected that\n            many cities will seek assistance from the advice of\n            consultants in how to prepare revenue enhancement plans\n            based on revenue potential and the assistance of the\n            regional revenue authorities on issues of revenue collection\n            and administration."}, "docdt": "2015-06-08T13:26:00Z"}
