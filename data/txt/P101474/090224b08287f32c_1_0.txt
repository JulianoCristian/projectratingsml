                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the project became effective in November 2008, the total Credit amount has increased from US$150 million to US$ 300 million as of July, 2011 due to additional financing in
                         the amount of US $150 million equivalent. The government contribution (regions and cities) increased from US$ 58 million to US$116 million. This brings the total project cost to US$
                         416 million. Funds to Component 1 (Performance Grant) constitute about 96% and Component 2 (implementation support) about 4%. Most of the activities under Component 1 of the
                         project have been completed, there are only eight civil work contracts (worth US$ 23 million), which are on- going. Under Component 2, there are only nine contracts (worth US$
                         5.7million) which are on- going. These ongoing contracts are all expected to be completed before the project closing period, December 31, 2014.

                         The project is on track to achieve its development objective. By June 2014, the project had been operational for about six years, with four rounds of performance grants provided.
                         Performance of cities has measurably improved and disbursements have been higher than expected. The project has performed well, and funds have been disbursed faster than
                         anticipated. The original credit and the additional financing have been almost fully disbursed. The Performance of the participating cities, as verified by the independent assessments,
                         has improved meeting or exceeding most targets set for this time of the project.
