Ethiopia. The project\n            objectives of this Resettlement Policy Framework are to: (i)\n            as far as possible ensure that involuntary resettlement and\n            land acquisition is avoided or where it is necessary, is\n            minimized, by exploring all viable alternatives; (ii) where\n            involuntary resettlement and land acquisition is\n            unavoidable, resettlement and compensation activities are\n            prepared and implemented by providing sufficient investment\n            resources according to GOE Proclamation and Regulations; and\n            (iii) persons displaced by the ULGDP will be meaningfully\n            consulted. The project standard of living adversely\n            affected, whether or not the project affected persons (PAPs)\n            must move to another location; Resettlement Action Plan\n            (RAP) is a resettlement instrument (document) to be prepared\n            when ULGDP investment project locations are identified. In\n            such cases, land acquisition leads to physical displacement\n            of persons, and/or loss of shelter, and /or loss of\n            livelihoods and/or loss, denial or restriction of access to\n            economic resources. RAPs are prepared by the party impacting\n            on the people and their livelihoods. RAPs contain specific\n            and legally binding requirements to resettle and/or to\n            compensate the affected party before implementation of the\n            project activities causing adverse impacts. The project\n            measures to mitigate the impact of resettlement on any host\n            communities, including: (a) consultations with host\n            communities and local governments; (b) arrangements for\n            prompt tendering of any payment due the hosts for land or\n            other assets provided to resettlers; (c) arrangements for\n            addressing any conflict that may arise between resettlers\n            and host communities; and (d) any measures necessary to\n            augment services (e.g., education, water, health, and\n            production services) in host communities to make them at\n            least comparable to services available to resettlers."}, "docdt": "2013-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
